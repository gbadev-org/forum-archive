    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I am an Ecube user, I been more and less happy with it, but the software has always been very crappy, and some games does not work.
<br/>
The problem is that the coder of the soft has dissappeared, we haven't had any news from him in a long time.
<br/>
I am asking for help to hack the cart and create some kind of unofficial client, currently, I am trying to run the project from <a href="http://www.unofficialecube.tk," target="_blank">www.unofficialecube.tk,</a> but we don't really know how to start, or what to do.
<br/>
Any help is really appreciated, thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
