I think I'm starting to deside which I want.
<br/>
<br/>
The EZ didn't have built in support for SMS GBC and so on?
<br/>
What can I do to fix that? is it good emulation?
<br/>
<br/>
What's up with pogoshell? What can I do with it? 
<br/>
Every where I look it says "no pogoshell support" 
<br/>
But then again every where I look I see people saying they are using 
<br/>
pogoshell.. hmm strange.. Now how does this work???</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Feel free to send him one so PogoShell can be completely compatible with the EZFA.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is possible. It just depends. The reason why it isn't fully supported now is because the developer, Borden, "prefers" not to release specifications on his carts, namely how to bankswitch on the cart and the RTC/saving routines.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
There are a few types of Flash Advance cards, like Flash II and such.  Which way do I go with that?  Did EZFlash ever finally support PogoShell?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I find that transparent EZFA red cart really sexy. it was the first to support RTC games, but it's not hardware support, it patches the games to use its protocol. which kinda sucks cause I want to access RTC, but it'd be different from other cards. Now I believe XROM and ultra flash advance has RTC hardware, so it's more standard, like your demo would work fine on those carts but not the EZFA red one.
<br/>
<br/>
I think my next flash card purchase will be that purple one that has a usb chip on cart. It supports RTC, and seems pretty cool. There's a cart that has a removable battery, but I think it's a gimmick, I'm turned away by it. if I could pick any cart to buy again, it'd be the flash advance extreme 256, but it has no RTC, and is hard to come by.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
