    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay I got the F2a ultra 256m cart. I got the USB Linker cable also from F2A.
<br/>
I plugged the cable to GBA.
<br/>
I plugged cable to Ibook Laptop.
<br/>
I opened Terminal and dropped the  F2A thingy on it.
<br/>
I then dropped the gba file onto the Terminal.
<br/>
I then recieved the following message.
<br/>

<br/>
You should be using if2a at this point anyway. They are still developing it, and I haven't updated the OS X port of f2a in quite a long time and it is buggy. I haven't tested it with the ultra cart, so I'm not sure it even works, but it sounds like you're missing the firmware file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
You were told many times in the other thread to use if2a instead as f2a is very old now. If you want to continue using it, you are on your own.
<br/>
<br/>
Now the good news is that if2a is now correctly working on MacOSX so you should have no problems with it. Or course, you are welcome to report problems you encounter.

<br/>
<br/>
When you download if2a, it's in source code form. You have to build it. You need a compiler and associated tools of course. You may also need to read the documentation to have hints on what if2a is, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Tell me whether you have problems with building stuff et al. I can ask one of our testers to build a binary for you if that is needed.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Build??? Not quite sure what you mean. Compiler? Associated tools? These all seem to be the realm of PC items.
<br/>
By binary do you mean short line of code to get things moving? That's what the F2a download had. It had a short line to get things talkin between the Terminal and the equipment.
<br/>
<br/>
The primary use of Macs is design. Frankly the folks that use Macs very infrequently are code writing types.
<br/>
It seems I bought this GBA gear prematurely. I thought that since the iF2a site said it had something for OSX that it had something. OSX is unix based. Creating code that will work on an apple is no longer the bugger that it used to be. 
<br/>
I alas, am a designer...not a code writer.
<br/>
My only recourse now is to look into getting Virtual PC software to utilize the application created for the PC.

<br/>
There's a precompiled binary on the if2a site <a class="postlink" href="http://if2a.free.fr/downloads/if2a/if2a-0.94.2-MacOSX-darwin-nearlystatic.gz" target="_blank">here</a>. Extract that using stuffit and then drag the file that was extracted into a terminal session, type -W in the terminal window, then drag your (non-commercial, public domain) ROM files into the terminal window.
<br/>
<br/>
That should give you a terminal command that looks like:
<br/>
iBook-G4:~ ibook$ /Users/ibook/Desktop/if2a-0.94.2-MacOSX-darwin-nearlystatic -W /Users/ibook/Desktop/homebrew.gba 
<br/>
<br/>
Hit return and with a bit of luck it will write the ROM and loader to your cartridge.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow.  Are users of OS X really that incapable of using a command line app?  I surely hope that this guy is not what makes up the mac community of which I have become a member of.
<br/>
<br/>
Telling people that you can't conceive the thought of using a terminal window leads me to believe you havent been around computers for that long.  Ever saw the MS-DOS prompt on Windows? How about just plain old MS-DOS? Anything?
<br/>
<br/>
The sugar coated state of computing these days is not how it has always been, hell 10 years ago we first tasted Windows 95, which tried all it could to rid us of DOS yet still couldn't do it.  
<br/>
<br/>
Whatever it is you do on Macs, you must not be into computing all that much to not even know what compiling a application is or what "source code" is.  If it's really all that hard to understand, I really don't think you should even be trying to use a gba flash card, instead try "Computers for Dummies".
<br/>
<br/>
I don't code, I'm not a programmer, but I fully understand what it is they do and how to use what they do to my advantage.  if2a is a very easy command line application to use, very easy to compile, and VERY easy to get working on OS X.  First, I suggest you learn a little about computers and then try to use if2a.
<br/>
<br/>
Ahhh... sorry bout the rant, Mr. BrettOG if you really can't figure it out, send me a PM and I will try my best to help you out, I'll write you a book if it's really that hard to do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Many users of Mac OS X have never become adept at using MS-DOS command.com, Windows NT cmd.exe, or a Bourne shell. Many have used Macintosh computers all their lives, and Mac OS 1 through 9 did not have a command prompt to speak of at all (AppleScript doesn't count, and neither does MPW).

<br/>
You'd be surprised at how many AIM members I have to walk through using the command prompt. Their entire experience is GUI based. In fact, a lot of users learn at work or at school or at a library, where Command Prompt and Run... are removed from the Start menu "for security reasons".

Many would argue that unless a GBA flash card is usable by the "Windows XP for Dummies" crowd, then it is missing a crucial feature.

Do you mean "learn a little about computers" in general, or do you mean "learn a little about the traditional user interface to computers that run a UNIX? brand operating environment"?

<br/>
A small Swing app that acts as a frontend to if2a might help work around this general lack of knowledge of command-based interaction with a computer. Anyone want to put up a bounty for this through Fundable.org or something?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

it seems like you got that part right, but it looks like you don't have the correct permissions for the .gba file, to fix that you might need a little more unix terminal knowledge.  basically, you want to change to the directory the file is in with the terminal and type "chown yourosxloginname:yourosxloginname your_game.gba"  if you can't run that command then you might want to try re-unzipping the file or with using the "sudo" command followed by the chown one.

if2a is command-line for the moment. If you cannot stand using a terminal, stay away from it until a graphical interface exists. It is planned, I will write it, it will come, I only don't know when.
<br/>

As the docs says, you have to be root or use the program sudo to use it.

When you make your command line, make it look like this: (without quotes)

"sudo ./path/to/if2a -W /path/to/your_game.gba"

it will then ask you to type your OS X password in (use the one that lets you install OS X apps) and then if2a should work for you then.  If it still don't work, I don't know what to tell you.

I don't know whether VirtualPC will work or not, I have never used it and don't know about it's USB support, or any of it's intricate file details when used on a OS X machine.

I grabbed the whole age and saved it as a Microsoft word document. Even threw your pics in.
<br/>
Do I need to delete a game on the cart before importing a new game....or does the line of code that brings the game in overwrite the old game?
<br/>
Just curious. My son is too busy playing with the new game on the cart for me to experiment. hahahah.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To flash more then one game on the card, you have to put a "loader" on the card.  Basically, there is a bunch of them included in the binware/ directory in the file you downloaded of if2a.  There is different files for the different types of f2a carts, I'm not sure if it's really part of the documentation which works on which carts but it *SHOULD* be self-explanatory.  I plan on adding that info to my document, after I saw your question the other day, I just haven't gotten around to it.  First you must use the "-L" option, and specify the file you want to use. If you have a f2a pro card use one of the <span style="font-style: italic">loader-pro-GBA_Loader3*.gba</span> files, or if your using a ultra card, use one of the <span style="font-style: italic">loader-ultra-*****.gba</span> files. Basically, your command would look something like this:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">./if2a -L binware/loader-pro-GBA_Loader32.gba -W game1.gba game2.gba game3.gba</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Of course use the loader you need, if you don't specify a loader, if2a will insert pogoshell as the loader, which may or may not work for you.  Maybe I'll add this info to my document for ya soon ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
Autodetection will indeed install Pogoshell (for non-Ultra carts). Otherwise, use the -L list option to list available loaders instead of having to keep one on your disk.
<br/>
<br/>
Concerning ROM add/delete, once you burnt your cart once with if2a, you can use the -X/-A options to dynamically add/remove ROMs without rewriting the whole cart each time.
<br/>
<br/>
r0ni : if you write a help ducument, why not submitting it? It could then be integrated into the official help and would benefit more users.

I went to add a game to the f2a ultra 256m flash card that I have a game on. I got the following..

I don't care if the game on it gets overwritten, though adding without subtracting would be cool. I am sure that is impossible since I never loaded a loader. I stuck with the OSX "how to."

Now I wouldn't mind getting slick and add two games.
