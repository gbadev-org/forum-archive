the EFA II Linker is actually composed of a 256Mbits NOR Flash memory and a 1Gbit NAND Flash Memory, i only wanted to know if it's possible to access data stored on the NAND Flash from my ROM at runtime (The Efa Loader on the Cart can, so i think that there's a way to do it from my applications)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not at this time.

Is technical information available for developers to create their own EFA drivers or client?
