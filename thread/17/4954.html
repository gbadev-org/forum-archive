    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heya.  I'm new to the world of GBA programming, and plan on purchasing a Flash kit in the near future.  For me to get the most out of my kit, what should I buy?  I don't really care too much about cost, and I'd like high quality hardware.  For example, I'd like the blank cartridges to be capable of battery backup.  My problem is that I see four or five different products on the market, and can't tell the differences between them.  Thanks in advance!  (If my question is answered elsewhere, I apologize; I've done some searching around the website, but not extensively.)<br/>_________________<br/>Brian Chambers
