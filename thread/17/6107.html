<br/>
<br/>
I know this is quite unusual, but I'm looking for a parallel linker for f2a carts :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Please PM me if you have one to sell. If you have a flashcart that you don't need anymore without it I'll consider buying it as well (well, only a small one, I don't have that much money for this linker ;-).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have a parallel linker for f2a carts but I use it though wine sometimes since if2a isn't always so easy to use, yet lately wine don't seem to be doing anything right so it's becoming useless, and if2a is becoming better in the usb area.  If you want it, just let me know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
