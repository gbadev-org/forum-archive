<br/>
I recently bought a m3 lite with micro sd card. I wanted it to run the scummvm games. I have followed instruction from the drunken coders site and I still cant get it to run. Has anyone got or know of a link to a tutorial that has step by step guide to running the scummvm games on the ds using the m3 and sd card. Please help!!
<br/>
Your help will be most appreciated. Thanks in advance. PB</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
