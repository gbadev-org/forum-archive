    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was just wondering if any people here could shed light on how to get some cards to 'autoboot' an NDS file.  I'd like to have a card that automagically boots DSLinux when it's turned on.  The cards I can use are:
<br/>
<br/>
Acekard RPG
<br/>
Acekard 2
<br/>
iTouch DS
<br/>
Supercard SD Slot-2
<br/>
<br/>
Any idea what I have to name the file for the cards to autoboot it?  Apologies for non-googling but I hoped someone might know off the top of their heads and at least this way the information is in one place from now on.  (in fact, when I get round to it I'll plop something on the DSLinux wiki)
<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, I've got Flashme v7 installed and wanted to remove the "boot to slot-2 first" feature permanently, how would I go about this?  Reflash it with another firmware?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is a build of FlashMe v8 that doesn't search for the "PASS" code to boot SLOT-2 in DS mode; instead, you have to hold A+B+X+Y to force it when you need it. Or even on the version you have, you can hold Select while turning on the DS to skip the search for "PASS".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Chishm and Grizzly_adams hacked the Supercard CF/SD 1.7 firmware to auto-boot a file named a certain name when the R or L button is held, but I don't know how well DSLinux works with this.  
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about the other devices you have, sorry.  You could try "default.nds" which I know the R4 uses.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
