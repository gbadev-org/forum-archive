    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You probably need an older version of the XG drivers to make LW work; it doesn't seem to find the linker with newer versions. I don't know where you might find one, though. The port setting is irrelevant; it will look for the XG first whatever port you have configured.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
