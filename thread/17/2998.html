    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It works good actually, but i only can connect it to my USB root port (that is at the back of my PC) but i want to connect it on my keyboard (it is a logitech usb keyboard with 2 extra usb slots).
<br/>
<br/>
When booting up i always got to plug out the cable while the PC is booting and only can plug it in again after it has boot up, otherwise i will get a blue screen for like 1/4 second and it will reboot :(
<br/>
It also crashs in windows when it is connected to a sub-usb-port and i want to install the driver (it carshes after i confirmed the driver certificate box).
<br/>
And everytime i want to use the F2A cable i have to a) start my F2APowerWriter software, then the device name will change from "EZ-USB for Flash2Advance" to "Flash2Advance U-Linker V1.0" and it shows an warning that it has 2 drivers loaded! b) Deactivate the device and activate it again, the warning will disappear and it will work...
<br/>
<br/>
It's all a bit strange to me, i tried to totally uncomment the EZ-USB entries in the inf file, but it didn't help... i will keep on getting rid of the EZ-USB stuff first!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Currently, SMA4 is the most popular game to use a 128 Kbyte flash save. (Other games may use a 64 KB flash save.) Perhaps F2AU's handling of 128 Kbyte saves is still buggy.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hm, i don't even know how much SRAM my cart has... somewhere i read it's 2 mbit or mbyte and somwhere else i read it is only 128kbit/kbyte... i am confused by bits and bytes :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most games with save that don't use an EEPROM patch use 32 to 64 Kbytes (256 to 512 Kbits), but SMA4 uses 128 KBytes (1 Mbit).
<br/>
<br/>
Popular flash cart models have 256 KBytes (2 Mbits) of SRAM. Carts with an instant save-state function may have more.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
