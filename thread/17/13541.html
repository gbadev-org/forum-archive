<br/>
<br/>
I searched on this forum and didn't find any topic regarding any Flash 2 Advance Ultra 2G...
<br/>
<br/>
So my question is, I bought a F2AU 2G a few months ago, ans it's working just fine, the only problem is that, because it has 2x 1G chip, everytime I add a game and it's allocated to the second 1G chip, it usually doesn't load, or some of the games in the first chip won't load anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this happening to anyone else ? Is this normal ?
<br/>
<br/>
cheers!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
