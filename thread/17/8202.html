It claims to have a RTC in it as well as 100% support for all GBA games. They claim no more freeze ups or incompatability when running it off a CF or SD card.
<br/>
<br/>
I figured the day would come when they would make it work right. I have been looking at one of these for a few weeks. I just got a GBM a couple weeks ago and ended up buying a EZF card. But being the noob that I was I didnt read into it farther to notice it was only rating them in MegaBITS instead of Bytes. Here I was epxecting a card that I could load 20+ GBA games on as well as my nes emu. Boy was I surprized when it told me I was out of memory after only 3 games where on it!!!
<br/>
<br/>
SO I started looking at the SUPERCARDS. I have a bunch of 128mb and 256 mb SD cards lying around. So I figured it would be perfect. But then I was reading about the incomatibility problems. I figured I would get a card and just wait for firmware updates that fixed the problems. then I found the card above!
<br/>
<br/>
So from what I would guess. This card will have a 128 mbit flash rom on it. It would then just use the SD or CF card as a storage location. When you go to run the game it would unpack it to the temp rom location to run it. So the system should think its running a genuine game and not even care about the 256 mb card I have in it.
<br/>
<br/>
This is what I believe the older card did in the first place that had all the problems. 
<br/>
<br/>
ANyway Has anybody tried one of these yet? Or are they looking at getting one? I was thinking of getting one anyway. But would like to hear if anyone else knows about them any more??

oh, And I am new to this forum.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What you've found on ebay is not a Supercard.  It is an M3 Perfect, which is the Supercard's main comepetitor.  Yes it is better, with fewer slow downs and such, but it is also twice the price.  Both will work fine with DS games (and a pass card) but the Supercard will cause slowdowns in several GBA games.  I've decided to get the cheaper one because after looking at a couple of compatibility lists I found that the games I actually want to play all work fine on the Supercard.  Here are some links that will help you compare:
