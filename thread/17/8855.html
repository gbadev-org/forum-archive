<br/>
<br/>
Just a quickie,
<br/>
<br/>
I currently use a EZFA flash cart, like this one: <span style="font-weight: bold">warez URL removed by MOD</span>, it uses a white USB-&gt;GBA cable and comes with its own client 'burning' software.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm planning to buy some small 64Mb carts called 'EZ-Flash Line' (or Super FC?) the cable that seems to go with this is a parallel-&gt;GBA and it comes with its own client software.
<br/>
<br/>
I could get these a lot cheaper without the cables.  So now I am thinking maybe my current USB-&gt;GBA cable would work but I dont think that the software would? either that or the cable is specific design for the EZFA cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts or experience?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much.
<br/>
<br/>
Chris.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
