    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone happen to have a link to a site that has mirrored the latest EZFA 1.04b drivers? The gba-toys.com site seems to be down. I just received my flash cart today and would love to start using it ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Any assistance would be much appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Its still possible to download the drivers from the site, through another one.
<br/>
<br/>
Go to <a href="http://www.mwelectronics.com" target="_blank">www.mwelectronics.com</a> and click on the EZF-Advance link.
<br/>
<br/>
Then on the right hand side there should be a link to the drivers from the gba-toys server.
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your new EZF. I know I am!<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recommend downloading the most up-to-date drivers from the official site at <a href="http://www.ezf-advance.com/download.htm." target="_blank">http://www.ezf-advance.com/download.htm.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't recommend downloading drivers from a retailer like the above poster mentioned.. that's 3rd party stuff and they won't update as fast as the official site, of course.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
