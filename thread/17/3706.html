    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have two more questions; is there a certain way you have to start you gba after opening the EZFA client? When you start your gba is it suposed to play the 'GAMEBOY' animation without the 'NINTENDO' and have the screen freeze when the 'GAMEBOY' letters turn blue (at the end of animation)?
<br/>
I only ask this because when I start EZFA client and turn my gba on EZFA client doesn't work.
<br/>

<br/>
Thank you in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by tris on Tue Jul 13, 2004 5:50 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

If you can, take a look at the device manager and see what the EZFA is listed as now. It might be a High Speed USB device (or something like that), uninstall that and try again. Or you can manually install it by right clicking ezfa.inf and install should be on the pop-up menu.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
