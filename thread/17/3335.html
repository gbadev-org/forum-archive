    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to get a new flash writer with cart(s) and was wondering which one i should get. I have a budget of around ?80-?90. I will use it for putting my games (in C) on to the GBA. I have heard some good things about the following: Ez-F advance, F2A Ultra and the XG flash 2 turbo. Please tell me which i should get, and also say other ones if you think i should get different ones. If you do say different ones, could you please tell me where i can purchase them? Also, one other question, I know that you can make GBA games in C (i have made some but only played on emulator) but can you use C++ as well? Oh, and one more! When you program the controls, what do you call the controls? up, down, left, right, a, b, l, r, start, select... Or do they have different names? I would really appreciate some feedback. Thanks alot!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Fatnickc on Wed Jun 02, 2004 10:47 am; edited 4 times in total</span></div>

Any of those should be fine, but I have been problems with the F2A drivers recently, I believe they are not meant for windows XP. These all have varying cost, you should search to see what fits your needs.

I'd be surprised if you could find a writable cart/linker in a local store (unless you live in Hong Kong), meaning the best way to get one is order over the internet, just check around to make sure that a company is fairly well known so you don't get your money stolen.

These questions are better for the GBA programming forum, but there are ham names for the keys (I believe they are in mygba.h) which are something like F_CTRLINPUT_UP_PRESSED, F_CTRLINPUT_START_PRESSED , and so on. (http://www.aaronrogers.com/ham/index.php for a tutorial on programming for the GBA in C/C++)
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, you can use both C and C++ (or a combination of both) using ham / vham (available for free download at ngine.de)
