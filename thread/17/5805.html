    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm intending to purchase a Gameboy Micro when it's released (or soon afterwards). During the Nintendo Press Conference at E3, it was mentioned the GBM was not "new technology". This raises a question with me: Do any of you think that the GBM will be compatible with current flash carts? One reason I was thinking of getting a GBM (note I do not have a flash cart at the moment) was being able to use a Flash Cart with it, store several games on it and thus minimize the amount of stuff i have to carry around. 
<br/>
<br/>
Since it isn't "new technology", doesn't that mean the flash carts should, in theory, work on the GBM?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it's compatible with all gba games, which in theory should make it compatible with all gba flashcarts. in practice, it may be different. a few flash carts may not be compatible due to their low quality design or something</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The resolution is the same (same # of pixels), but the physical dimensions are smaller. the GBM's screen is about 2/3's the width of a gba cart, whereas a SP screen is slightly wider than a gba cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm at work so this is just coming off of the top of my head. Correct me if I'm wrong.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I currently own a F2A card and usb flasher and I'm looking at purchasing a GBA Micro (Ain't it cute)
<br/>
<br/>
and I'm pretty certain the flashcards will work, but what I am curious about, is whether I'll be able to connect the GB Micro to my flasher?
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas.. I googled a bit yesterday and couldn't really find any information</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
