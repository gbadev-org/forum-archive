    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have recently found a free Go game ROM for my GBA and I would like to play it.  I have done some research here and elsewhere on the web regarding flash writers, etc.  Can some Mac savvy folks here suggest the best combination of software and hardware for playing freeware games and for backing up my purchased games?  Is the best way to go through VPC?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using a Flash2Advance cartridge with a command-line tool made by some Eli dude. It works ok. The program will crash if you try to transfer to large ROM files. Don't know where on the web you can find his program but I can stuffit and send it to you.

Then there's this fellow called Mr. Spiv who've made a flash util for Visoly Flash Advance Xtreme Linker. Check out his website at <a href="http://www.deadcoderssociety.tk/" target="_blank">http://www.deadcoderssociety.tk/</a><br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have taken a brief look at Mr. Spiv's site for his GBA linker software.  Is this one better than the other software I have found for the Flash2Advance?  In the opinions of posters here, what hardware and software should I go for (support for most types of flash cartridges and most types of games)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You shouldn't be using the f2a port any more. All carts it supported are also supported by the newer if2a software available from <a href="http://if2a.free.fr/" target="_blank">http://if2a.free.fr/</a> . I've only left the source up for people who are interested in the usb code to look at.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about the newer carts, so I'm afraid I can't help with that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I use the standalone cart programmer that uses a smart media card. Can't remember what it's called, but it connects to the link port of the gba to write the cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
