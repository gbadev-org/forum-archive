    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got a original flash advance pro 256M (with those printer port adapter) i read from some one said it can use with a F2A usb linker? But i wend to one store and they said my model is too old and it probably will not work? He said those cart have bio? and probably it is early version bio so it will not work. Is the shop pulling my leg. Do those cart have bio version? i see no one mention in those forum.
<br/>
<br/>
Also what is the average price for those usb linker. And does my original Flash Advance pro only work with the F2A usb linker? or other other brand linker are the same thing?
