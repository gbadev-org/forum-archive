    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I scanned through the recent posts and havent found info on this topic, so i apologise if this has been covered.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm in the process of buying a M3 lite + passcard, and have yet decided on whihc microSD to buy.
<br/>
<br/>
1.What is the difference between 'Transflash' and regular MicroSD cards?
<br/>
2. Kingston or Sandisk or Toshiba?
<br/>
3. Will 'Sandisk/Kingston 1g Micro SD Transflash Cards' be fast enough to run NDS/GBA backups without slowdown?
<br/>
4.And finally i have searched for the speed of 'Sandisk/Kingston 1g Micro SD Transflash Cards' and it doesnt have a speed listed, does anyone know the speed?
<br/>
<br/>
Thx in advance.
<br/>
Regards,

Some people will tell you to go with SanDisk or you'll have to ScanDisk. I'll just state that SanDisk invented TransFlash and that SanDisk is headquartered in the United States.

Backups of what?
<br/>
<br/>
Any card that supports GBA mode can load backups of your music CDs into GSM Player, and any card that supports the REIN FAT library (an extension of Chishm's gba_nds_fat with additional drivers for various SD adapters) can load backups of your music CDs into MoonShell. There probably won't be much of a problem with loading backups of your DVDs (SmartRipper FTW) into MoonShell if you encode them properly.
<br/>
<br/>
Backups of commercial GBA and Nintendo DS games? Golf Tango Foxtrot Oscar.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
