    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if it says so in the instructions, and the software even comes up with it, then I would only guess... hmm... YEAH! it's always good to fully charge a rechargable battery before the first use. it's also good to allow it to fully discharge before recharging, but that pry isn't possible with the card because it'll recharge whenever it has the ability.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
