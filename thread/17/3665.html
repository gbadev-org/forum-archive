    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello! I've got a 256mb Flash2advance cart that won't save any games. It's my understanding that the sram or something is the bit of memory for saving in. Is that right? Do flash2advance cartridges not have any sram?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You're cart should have SRAM are you saving to it properly? What happens when it is trying to save? There is a really simple document located on gbadev.org which is under documents-&gt;saving titled "How to save data on a gba cartdrige." I believe there are also some posts which talk about using the SRAM feature, just use search to find them.
<br/>
<br/>
If that doesn't work I'd suggest you post your source code or what game you are trying to put on your cart that has the save feature. If it is a commercial game, look elsewhere for help.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
