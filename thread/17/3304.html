    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey im thinking about picking up a flasher, im not going to ask i can get my own, but do you guys know of any emulators written to run on a gba? specifically for a 16-bit sega system... i was pondering the idea while at work, most gba games are boring but if i could emulate some games like warsong that would make work fun....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For emulators designed to run on the GBA, see <a class="postlink" href="http://www.zophar.net/consoles/gameboy.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Given the existence of SNES Advance, it appears that Sega Genesis emulation may be distantly possible, but don't count on it in the near future unless you yourself plan to put some work toward it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
