    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, PogoShell does work, to a point. Some things are not fixed, others don't work at all. Often I have to reset my GBA because things don't work.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't use PogoShell much as it isn't so useful now. The screen DOES look pretty though, 'til the GBA locks up.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
