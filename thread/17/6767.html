    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've recently lost an usb to gba cable for my EZF Advance 256M cart and after searching for days consider, it gone for good. I looked up the EZF-A site and it appears to be down, so I plan on cutting up some spare usb/link cables and making my own. I was wondering if any one knew or could be bothered, to find out which pin on the usb end connects to which end on the gba side with their existing cable. This would save alot of work for me when I make a replacement cable.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks alot, K.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After over ~12 days of searching and 5 min after my post, my cable appeared out of no where. I guess it was just waiting for me to post this ;P. I will, however, post the diagram on my web page in case some one else suffers the same fate.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks anyways, K.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I am also interested in that diagram. Could you notify us when you have done it?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks

Unfortunately, the normal EZFA cable is loaded with a couple of IC's down the GBA end... I wouldn't know the first thing about duplicating the functionality. :(<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum.

Im really sorry im too late, cause if i posted this earlier you would'nt have smashed your cable open. But since you've already done that, why dont you tell some of the people here the IC's serial number.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I couldn't tell you about the cable's specs... it broke months ago, I kinda threw it away. :(<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For the moment I am starting to play with the D2XX provided by the FTDI website and compare the output with the captured output of the EZFA client 1.03. But it could help (not sure) if the hardware after the USB chip is known.

You're thinking of EFA, right?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
There's gotta be at least one cart somewhere that uses a standard USB A - A or A - B connector. (Or, god forbid, one of those crazy digital camera ones which I always get mixed up between) Surely... you could just put the magic support circuitry gadget that, say, resides in the thick end of the cable (like ezfa) onto the cart itself, if there were space. And then you could just use a USB extension lead into the flash cart.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum.

That's EFA. <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.pocketheaven.com/Extreme_Flash_Advance" target="_blank">PHWiki has more info</a>. But then because the cart connects directly to the PC, you can't use the linker to make a fair-use dump of an authentic Game Pak.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
