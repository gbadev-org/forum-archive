<br/>
<br/>
I have the movieplayer V2 and I want to get the above homebrew games working. They need to be multiboot but they are not.
<br/>
<br/>
Any idea what I need to do to get them working??

I have read that you can play DS games(when is a DS with a passme :) from the mediaplayer.
<br/>
This sounds very strange to me or is this also running multiboot games?

A homebrew .nds program is like a GBA multiboot program, except because the Nintendo DS has sixteen times the EWRAM capacity, it can be up to 4 MB in size. In addition, many .nds programs are designed to read additional assets from the CF card in the GBAMP. Most GBA programs would take a lot of reworking to get CF assets to work.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

1) The DS has 16x the amount of memory of the GBA (as Tepples mentioned);

Hmm, interesting, that helps a lot. 
<br/>
Shame about the above games thou, I was really hoping to get some of the homebrew stuff up and running ELITE would have just taken my life away like it did when it first came out :).
<br/>
<br/>
But this does give me another question :)
<br/>
If I buy a DS, this has 16x more memory than a GBA most GBA homebrew doesn't need so much, would I be able to get these games working then :) 
<br/>
I have been thinking of a DS for a while, if I could run any homebrew stuff from the GBAMP that would just be so cool :)
