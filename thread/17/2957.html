    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey,
<br/>
<br/>
        My brother just got a Flash2Advance Card Writer and a 128MBit Cart. I was just wondering, would I be able to flash stuff to a commercial Cart and erase what was already on there? (ex: flash something over an official Advance Wars Cart) Is this possible? would I need some sort of patch? Or would I have to bu another card online to make it work?
<br/>
<br/>
        Thanx in Advance...
<br/>
help me with this please!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
