    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am newbie to GBA development so some perhaps dumb questions.
<br/>
I just got a china/taiwan made (much cheaper) linker, loaded
<br/>
my .gba file (compiled with devboyadv/gcc from sourceforge) which
<br/>
works fine on emulator (visualboy advance) but when I plug
<br/>
the cartridge in the GBA and turn it on, I just got the "game boy"
<br/>
logo (and some garbage underneath)... so my questions are
<br/>
<br/>
1. it doesn't recognize the title ... is there some standard title header
<br/>
global variable I should have in my .c or .h file?
<br/>
2. is loading a single .gba file good enough? or do I need to load
<br/>
other stuff in the cartridge as well?
<br/>
3. or does this sound more like a low battery (the loaded file persists
<br/>
even after i unplugged it from the linker though) or a cartridge contact
<br/>
with the GBA problem?
<br/>
<br/>
The linker I got is like the (second item) one shown here

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"Garbage underneath" may mean you need to use one of the header fix tools on your ROM. GBA programs are supposed to carry a 156-byte "magic cookie" that represents a compressed Nintendo logo bitmap. Emulators usually ignore the header, but the GBA hardware doesn't. If you put multiple ROMs in one cart, the menu software prepended to the ROMs will usually carry a proper header, but a single-ROM cart needs its own header. Try DarkFader's GBA Rom Fixer, available from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbadev.org/tools.php?section=header" target="_blank">gbadev.org's header tools section</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
Thanks alot! That's exactly what the problem was. I used deixu's
<br/>
GBA-header tool to edit the header and it works! (Thanks
<br/>
deixu for the tool if you are reading... :)
<br/>
<br/>
I have not read anywhere that I have to modify the header
<br/>
myself... I supposed other linker software does that automatically?
<br/>
Anyway, I am happy, thanks again very much.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
