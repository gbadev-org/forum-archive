    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody!
<br/>
I've got a big problem with my flash advance linker (connected to printer port) and a 256mb flashcard.
<br/>
In fact, when i try to flash any rom on it, it says for each program I use :
<br/>
<br/>
with each version of littlewriter : 
<br/>
2 s
<br/>
Error during the process of the command: flashrom 
<br/>
Error : Timeout on block 0x00000000.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
with Flash Advance Writer : 
<br/>
Write Flash Error!!!(31)
<br/>
Time = 11 Sec
<br/>
<br/>
with Flinker :
<br/>
Erasing Visoly turbo flash cart...
<br/>
Flash cart erase failed
<br/>
<br/>
What can i do to remedy to this big problem.
<br/>
When i'm using an older version of littlewriter (1.0.2.2) with Adv test Card, it seems that a program is blocked on it almost after the format:
<br/>
"Game: EMPTY : 0x00017813 bits found"
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using XP Sp2 and i had no problem before.
<br/>
Maybe it's because i've not used it for a long time?
<br/>
Many many thanks for all your help!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
