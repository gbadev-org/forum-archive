    <h4>#12220 - thrift - Tue Nov 04, 2003 8:24 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm new to the GBA programming scene and have recently acquired a "Flash Advance Pro Linker" and a "Flash Advance Pro 256M" cart.  I also have a mbv2 cable, a gameboy advance, and a ROM that plays fine on the GBA.  
<br/>
<br/>
When I first recieved the Flash Advance cart yesterday, when I put it in my gameboy and turned it on I would get a screen that I am pretty sure said gbapack 2.0.  Since then I hooked up my Flash Advance linker to my parallel port and downloaded the source for the fl program for Linux, which is the operating system I am using.  My parrallel port is at 0x7800(I have an abit AT7 Max2 with no parallel port and a dual parallel port expansion card), and because of this I had to modify fl.c and replace all occurances of 0x378(I'm pretty sure that is what it was) with 0x7800.  I then wanted to make sure everything was working fine and used fl from the command line to backup my working ROM(dave mirra2 freestyle BMX). 
<br/>
<br/>
here is the command I used and the output that i recieved:
<br/>
<br/>
falcor thrift # fl -s test.bak -w 125
<br/>
Linker found. EPP not Found - SPP used.
<br/>
Device ID = 0x2e : Standard ROM
<br/>
Backing up 32 mbits of ROM to file 'test.bak'. Please wait...
<br/>
falcor thrift # 
<br/>
<br/>
an ls -l of this file shows it to be 4194304 bytes:
<br/>
<br/>
falcor thrift # ls -l test.bak 
<br/>
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root      4194304 Nov  4 03:16 test.bak
<br/>
falcor thrift # 
<br/>
<br/>
If i then put my 256Mb flash cart in my flash advance linker, and try to program it with fl, I get an error that worrys me greatly:
<br/>
<br/>
falcor thrift # fl -p test.bak -w 125 -c 256 
<br/>
Linker found. EPP not Found - SPP used.
<br/>
Device ID = 0x98 : Turbo FA 256M (2 x i28F128J3A

Erasing Visoly turbo flash cart...
<br/>
Flash cart erase failed!
<br/>

<br/>
On some lower -w settings I recieve other Device ID's, and I have also tried with higher -w settings to the same effect.
<br/>
<br/>
Now when I insert my flash advance rom into my GBA and turn it on I only see the GameBoy Logo, but no gbapack 2.0, also if i try to hit start and select to get the funny sound and put it into the mode needed for mbv2 cable it does not work with the flash advance ROM, although it works fine with the dave mirra ROM.
<br/>
<br/>
I have also tried to use the mbv2 cable to program the cart, by booting from the dave mirra rom, hitting start and select to hear the sound, the hot swapping dave mirra with the flash advance cart.  Using the mbv2 cable it takes forever to do this and I am left with errors sometimes, while other times it works(during this the gba screen turn to a black screen with the text "GBA R/W"):
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
falcor thrift # mb  -p test.bak -w 125 -l 0x7800
<br/>
port# = 0x7800, Parallel MBV2 cable found: hardware=v2.0, firmware=v4
<br/>
No EPP support found; low speed transfer set.

When I recieved errors there were CRC errors between the *'s this last time I just programmed it it left the GBA saying "GBA R/W" and when I rebooted with the cart, start select worked, but the game did not run, and the nintendo logo was corrupted.  When I got the CRC errors I could not start select and hear the sound.
<br/>
<br/>
does anyone know what the problem is, are my options wrong, is the editing of the fl source causing problems, is my fa rom or flash advance linker experiencing problems, is there a problem i am missing, is there anyway I can find out?  Someone please help me with this, my girlfriend ordered this for our anniversary from ebay, and i'm not sure if any of the parts are not functioning properly or if what I am doing is wrong.  I'll be eternally gratefull if anyone can offer the slightest advice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
