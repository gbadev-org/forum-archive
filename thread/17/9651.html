    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just installed the newest version of the M3 firmware, and now GBA roms I've made no longer run. At least one demo from gbadev (MGS2:S) launches fine, but with two of my roms, one crashes immediately, and the other won't even make it past the M3's "loading" screen. They run fine in emulators and they USED to run fine on my M3, too. This happens whether I copy it on myself or with the M3 loader.

<span style="font-weight: bold">edit:</span> Well, this sucks. I just installed the oldest firmware on dualscene.net (2.7, which I think is mine) and the same thing STILL happens. It's the same ROM from before I flashed it... I even reformatted my CF and copied on a freshly-compiled ROM just incase either the rom or the filesystem got corrupted. Exact same problem :/ Any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have been able to get it running again by reverting to e13...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
