    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all, I'm looking for reliable places to buy Flash 2 Advance carts. I'm trying Linker4u but I'm having problems with the order because my shipping address is not the same as the billing address (they want a scan of my driver's license, credit card and bank statement. Hello identity theft). I need a dealer that's simple and reliable. I will be requiring my students to purchase carts, and they will likely be using their parents' credit cards which seems even more likely to confuse the fine folks at Linker4U. Any alternatives?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah okay. My mistake. Reading through the posts one retailer at a time and mentally summing up all the good and bad experiences is somewhat perpendicular to answering the question "who's good." Perhaps there should be a sticky forum in Flash Equipment with peoples' positive experiences. A quick way for newcomers to see what retailers are currently in the good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Careful comparing retailers just by shipping times tho. Shipping from the orient can get dicey. I have had merchandise get lost in customs and show up months later. Not really the fault of the mailer....but that is no solace when you have spent money and think you got robbed. hahahah</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
