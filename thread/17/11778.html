    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi.
<br/>
<br/>
Im new user to thease flash card, and do not know how they works.
<br/>
<br/>
Im using EZ Client 3.25, and I can se my original cards. I can make a backup of them (ie. Harry Potter), and I can store it on my flash card.
<br/>
<br/>
When I put it ind my GB Advanced SP (Nintendo), there is only a black screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Do I have to do something to make this work? Or do I doing somethink wrong when I burn my flash card.
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone help me, or do someone have a manual about what to do.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks
<br/>
Benny, DK</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, you are doing something very wrong. To see why, watch <a class="postlink" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-420663394921441084" target="_blank">this video</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Interestingly enough, just yesterday I was viewing this extensively as well as a couple of variants of it.  <a class="postlink" href="http://gprime.net/flash.php/youareapirate" target="_blank">Here's another one</a> that plays upon the "sea pirate / software pirate" thing, while <a class="postlink" href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v41/danthemanms/Pirate_full.swf" target="_blank">this one</a> is a bit more perverted (still PG-13 though).  The second one is uploaded to Photobucket since the site I found it on is most definitely <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> PG-13.
<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, this probably isn't the place to ask about things like that.  See if there's a support forum for your specific flash cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Didn't know that you all where so angry about taking backup of thinks I pay for. I have some kids that sometimes break thinks, and when one game cost 100$, it is too expensive. If I had the oppotunity to get a new game if the one I payed for was broken, it was ok. I see it as a license, like Windows, I can always get a new windows-cd, and still got my license.
<br/>
<br/>
OK, Have to go on, so now I will ask the same question about your games and demos on this site <a href="http://www.gbadev.org" target="_blank">www.gbadev.org</a>
<br/>
Thease I still can't get to work with this card. I see a lot of freeware or shereware games that I would like to try, but it doesn't work - like I describe. I get a black screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I say sorry about the thing I wrote in the first note - hope you except it, I do not copy things!!
