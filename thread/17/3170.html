    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi all,
<br/>
i have the F2A 64m cart with the paralel link. well, everything was working really good since today. I had the software to load GBA roms into the cart the (f2aw30) working. But, somehow, it stopped working (accusing that it could not open the DRIVERlinx driver). I tried to dl a new version of f2aw(31) in f2a wabsite, same problem. I even tried to unistall the printer and the printer softwares, same problem... Finnaly a installed the F2ApowerWriter, very same thing. It seems that the software can not connect with the port since i turn my gba on (with the start+select thing) and when a click on the write button (or everyother one) it freezes and acuses "find_port() error"....
<br/>
Is there any software that inteferes with the paralel port?
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone knows how to solve this?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch
<br/>

Although my computer gets past that it now does:
<br/>
Checking ULA...
<br/>
Waiting renumerating...
<br/>
Launch BIOS... (popup that says Turn on GBA and press START + SELECT with a count down)
<br/>
as soon as I turn the gba on and press start + select the countdown stops but PowerWriter merely freezes and does nothing...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
