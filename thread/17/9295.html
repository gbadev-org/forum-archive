<br/>
<br/>
I intend to buy a gba micro and a flash cart, preferably an M3 or a supercard, or even a play-yan.
<br/>
<br/>
what do you advise me to buy? considering i may use it as a cart for homebrew, but this will be basically for mp3.
<br/>
<br/>
I also heard the play-yan has an additional chip to improve the sound. Is that true? Is the quality really worse if using m3 or supercard?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Play-Yan has an onboard MP3 audio and MPEG-4 video decoder. However, it can't be used for homebrew. If you don't want to buy both a Play-Yan and something else, you'll probably want a SuperCard CF so that you can run <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/gsm/" target="_blank">GSM Player</a>, which has acceptable quality over, say, street noise.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">oh.
<br/>
<br/>
and what about moonshell? I'm somewhat confused*, does it work for gba? apart from GSM player, there is no other mp3 decoder for gba?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*causes are, everyone is talking about using gba media player with it, wich name itself is confusing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have Supercard SD and use it for playing audio - but am using the Movie Player software - so you need to convert MP3's to its format.
<br/>
<br/>
(You can download the software and try it out if you like from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.supercard.cn" target="_blank">http://www.supercard.cn</a>)
<br/>
<br/>
With a play-yan adapter, it comes with its own audio out - so you get 16 bit sound which is better quality than using the jack on the micro - which is 8 bit out.  
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, the audio quality of supercard/movie player is fine for me...on the bus, train etc....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GBA Movie Player was intended to play movies on a GBA using a software decoder. Chishm and friends have hacked it to do more.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
