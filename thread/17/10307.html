I've got an M3-CF coming to me in a day or two and I've been trying to sort out how to get the thing to work as well as I can ahead of time.  I've read lots of guides and stickies but I'm still having a hard time figuring out the extensions: which ones I'll use on M3-CF, how to convert between extensions, and also why all this messing around is necessary anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
I've read this <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10125" target="_blank">guide for getting the Supercard to work</a>, which seems nice and thorough...do the instructions also apply to the M3?  Because if so, I might be taken care of.  The only thing I wonder about is the bit about a *.sav file.
<br/>
<br/>
Plain .gba files meant for the GBA should be fine, correct?  Just write them and it runs just as it would in an emulator, for example?
<br/>
<br/>
What confuses me is all the goings-on with .ds.gba, .nds.gba, .ds and .nds.  Apparently I need to convert between them and/or rename them to .gba?  Is .ds an outdated extension compared to .nds?  Do the multiple extensions really matter, or are they actually just .gba files?
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone could offer me any help with this I'd be grateful.  I'd be fine with just knowing the basics ("make everything .nds and you're fine") or a more detailed explanation of why the various formats are used would also be nice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
