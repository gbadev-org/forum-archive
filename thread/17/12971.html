    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone, I'm Bill. I'm new to these forums, but no n00b when it comes to technical electronics. 
<br/>
<br/>
I recently acquired an EZ-Flash Advance Realtime cartridge (256m), however the seller had lost the USB cable for it. Does anyone know of a programmer that is compatible with this cartridge, or does anyone know of a suitable USB to GBA cable replacement? I'm having a hell of a time tracking down the original USB cable.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have a Flash to Advance programmer and an EZ2 USB Linker coming in the mail shortly... will either of these work with my EZ-Flash RTC?
<br/>
<br/>
Someone please point me in the right direction. This super nice EZ-Flash cartridge that I have is currently useless :(
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if you have a E2F cartridge both is possible. you can buy a USB cable or make it yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
you can buy it at <span style="font-weight: bold">[URL Removed by MOD]</span>

<br/>
<br/>
for making yourself look <a class="postlink" href="http://www.teamknox.com/xla/xla.html" target="_blank">here</a> (xLA project/ULA) or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ziegler.desaign.de/GBA/gba.htm#USB%20programmer" target="_blank">here</a> (Ziegler/Devasys
<br/>
<br/>
you only need a special USB chip (EZ-USB) wich is a 8051 based USB device.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Since I'm a do-it-yourself-er (especially when it comes to arcade hardware and video game mods), I'll probably build the cable myself. THank you so much for the info, you're a savior. Goggle couldn't find ANYTHING relevent to these cartridges.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One more quick question... are you sure that the F2A USB cable is compatible with the EZF Realtime? I'm assuming if they are its because they share the same USB controller chip. After looking at both options, its more cost effective to just buy the USB cable rather than make one. I'd just hate to blow $20 on something thats not going to work for me.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you are right. I believe EZF card cannot be written by E2F cable, cause it seems EZF has a special USB programmer for it. you can see this on the EZF homepage ...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">no, - there are two product lines at ezf. one with a USB programmer and one with a USB cable connected to the GBA like E2F has.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A friend of mine is going to let me borrow his XG Flash usb cable. It connects to the GBA the exact same way the EZF Realtime does. I guess if that works, there's a good chance the F2A works with it as well.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you buy a commercial linker like the F2A linker and the official software won't work with it, you can try FlashManager instead.  It works with many different types of linkers and cards.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, good idea with this flashmanager. it works fine with my F2A USB cable and my F2A 256MB cartridge. 
<br/>
<br/>
you can get latest software here: <a class="postlink" href="http://mootan.hg.to/fmgba/" target="_blank">click</a>
<br/>
<br/>
on this page you can read it should work with nearly all F2A and EZF cartridges. have fun ...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Mr. Benda from flashlinker shop has tried the combination of EZF 256K + E2F linker + flashmanager with partial success. flashmanager recognize the flashcard and read is possible but no write to flash. <span style="font-weight: bold">[URL removed by MOD]</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Benda also asks the producer company for USB cable or USB programmer but they has none.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
