    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a flash2advance ultra 256M flash card. In it's specs it says that it has an SRAM size of 8M. Can any homebrew slot 1, nopass solution be used with this slot 2 card? I've read on some forums that sometimes a firmware update is required to do so but nothing has been said about using this particular brand.
<br/>
<br/>
I am looking to purchase a slot one homebrew solution like M3 real or the R4 (those two just because those are the ones it seems most people use and are kind of midrange in price). I'm looking to get homebrew apps running at a good speed on my Nintendo DS and I was wondering if I could use my Flash2advance ultras 256M to do so and which slot one card would work best in combination.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any possible suggestions, or information.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SRAM size is indeed 256 KB.  If you need source code to bankswitch the SRAM, look for it in pogoshell's source code, in libfc_visoly_xg1.  May need to change the addresses used to make sure they point to the cartridge bus on an NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
I've also used code to write directly to the 32MB of flash rom on this card, it must be done in 256KB chunks.
<br/>
<br/>
Any "passme" compatible with your DS will let you jump to the cartridge, and let you install flashme if your DS needs it.
<br/>
<br/>
In the end, it's not really necessary to combine a Slot 1 device with a flash cartridge, unless you need features that only a flash cartridge can provide, such as directly executable cartridge memory, and instantly writable SRAM.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Dwedit, do you have any suggestions as to what slot 2 solution to purchase? I'm looking to run the following homebrew applications:
<br/>
<br/>
DS Organize
<br/>
Moonshell
<br/>
Animatee
<br/>
Flickbook
<br/>
DScratch
<br/>
<br/>
What kind of a setup do you use to for developing? and how much did it cost you to get together? Anyone who wants to tell me what they use please do because going through all thes products is giving me a headache!
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Dwedit for such a speedy reply.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
