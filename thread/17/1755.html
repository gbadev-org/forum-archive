No.  The original cartridges are not rewrite-able.

Unless you can get the vulnerable game to copy your code from savegame memory to IWRAM or EWRAM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Yeah, and then you'd have to make the game execute the code from IWRAM/EWRAM.. Not very easy..
<br/>
Still, you can't fit much of a game into the SRAM or flash of a cart...

No!

The only cart's you can write to are the flashcarts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I suppose someone could try to execute code in SRAM and see what happens...
