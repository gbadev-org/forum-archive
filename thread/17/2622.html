    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was thinking of buying this Flash Advance Linker but I wanted to know what it's like. I mean, on the site I found it they say it loads fast, does it really? And isn't there a limitation in the size of the rom you can load?
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Serian,
<br/>
<br/>
Are you talking about the Flash2Advance? Almost every flash card can load GBA ROMs very quickly for immediate play on the GBA. If you're talking about <span style="font-weight: bold">uploading</span> ROMs to the card from the computer, the EZF-Advance is one of the faster cards out there.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, flash cards have size limitations. The most common ones are 128Mb and 256Mb. There are a few GBA games that are 128Mb in size, which will fill up a 128Mbit card right away (just one game). 256Mbit is recommended in most cases.
<br/>
<br/>
On average, a 128Mbit cart can hold up to 2 games. A 256Mbit cart can hold up to 4 games. 
<br/>
<br/>
I suggest reading the flash card reviews in detail on this site (gbadev.org) and at <a href="http://www.gameboy-advance.net." target="_blank">www.gameboy-advance.net.</a> More than a few people already posted questions nearly identical to yours here, so try using the search feature.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But actualy I wasn't talking about the cards. I was talking about some cable that you plug in a USB port and that directly connects to the gba letting you play you're demos on the gba without using a card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It's reasonably fast, but you can only play specially compiled games on it, limited to a size of 256 Kbyte.

A nearly free alternative is the <a class="postlink" href="http://graga.tri-bit.biz/xboo.html" target="_blank">xboo cable</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
