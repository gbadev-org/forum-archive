    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone know if any of the existing flash cart solutions is incompatible with the Micro. In the info for every flash cart and linker that is sold now it says that they support GBA/GBA SP, but the Micro isn't even mentioned.
<br/>
I realize that all linkers that use the link port would require an adapter, but other than that I just can't see why they wouldn't be compatible, and therefore why the Micro wouldn't be mentioned anywhere.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yes, that can happen if the Game Boy gives less power for the CART than GBA (if backup CART needs more power than original GBA CART).
<br/>
<br/>
I remember that some CARTs has some saving problems also with GBA SP (those worked fine with GBA).
<br/>
<br/>
GBA uses 2 AA batteries (1.5V x 2 = 3V). *also 2 x 1.2V AA rechargeable batteries works*
<br/>
GBA SP has rechargeable battery (3.6V).
<br/>
GBM has rechargeable battery (3.6V).
