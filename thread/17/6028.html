Which leaves open a dumb question - why wouldn't the program author do this automatically?

Enjoying the flash card &amp; all the home-made files you guys are sharing for the flashcard. My imagination is too slow to write a game, but I'm sure glad there's folks like you out there. To me the commercial games are a bore.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

the author of wonkie didn't do it himself for one of several reasons:
<br/>
1. he doesn't need to for his flash cart (some dont require it)
<br/>
2. he's worried about the legal implications of distributing copyrighted nintendo material (even if it's only a handful of bytes and its required for the rom to boot)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
