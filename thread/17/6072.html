    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can't help you with PAL nor HAM, but EFA-Linker 256 + NTSC GameCube + NTSC Game Boy Player works perfectly with both homebrew and commercial ROMs. Buy it, and if you have problems, try switching the Game Boy Player to 60 Hz mode.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">that's what i'm afraid of :
<br/>
This combo may only works with NTSC systems.
<br/>
a PAL TV is 50hz, a NTSC TV is 60hz
<br/>
<br/>
I hope my homebrews will works on 50 hz</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA always runs at 59.73 Hz; the Game Boy Player either adds frames (NTSC, to 59.97 Hz) or drops frames (PAL, to 50.00 Hz) to make up the difference.
<br/>
<br/>
But can't the Game Boy Player on a PAL GameCube be set to output 60 Hz 525 line PAL like they use in Brazil? The <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pocketnes.org/howto.html#gamecube" target="_blank">pocketnes.org Howto</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.n-cubed.com/reviews/gbp.php" target="_blank">this review</a> seem to imply so. I know that <a class="postlink" href="http://ms.nintendo-europe.com/consumerinformation/enGB/" target="_blank">Metroid Prime 2 runs in 60 Hz PAL</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most fairly modern (Not 10 years old) PAL TVs should happily run 60Hz mode. Many games - like Mario Kart : Double Dash and Donkey Konga - Have the option to switch, and it will work if you do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
