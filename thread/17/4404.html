    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Found answers to some of my questions by searching but have still come up with little on how to name your rom files when putting them onto a flash cart. If I hadn't already known someone that had used a flash cart I probably would have thought that something wasn't working when no file names appear when you turn it on as he first did, but I can't remember the solution to this problem if he even found one. I'm assuming it's something you can put in your code somewhere, I'm just working with C no ASM yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, is it ever possible to re-order what is on the cart as you always have to delete the last thing on it. I'm assuming that there probably isn't though, due to the limited space and it being better if it doesn't get fragmented. Guess you just have to put anything you're likely to keep for a while on first and then your quick test programs that you're gonna upload fairly frequently.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using EZFA Client v1.03 by the way, though I doubt that makes much difference on the ROM naming front, I assume it's something standard for any flash cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can't re-order ROMs on an EZFA. You can manually name your cart image every time by double clicking on the ROM (it won't have a title) and typing in a new name, but you will have to do this every time. However, there are plenty of commandline header tools that can automatically change the internal name of the ROM if you want. 
<br/>
<br/>
By far the easiest way to have a title for your ROM is if you are using the VisualHAM IDE (you can use just the IDE and toolchain and not use HAM if you want...). By simply clicking on "Build + Run VBA", VisualHAM with automatically patch the ROM to the name of your current build ("*.gba" with whatever you called your project to replace the *).

I'll be happy to answer more questions if you have them.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it true that you can only erase the last game on EZ carts?? That's some anoying limitation.
<br/>
At least on the XROM you are free to erase any games on the cart and replace with new games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for that, took me a second to realise that you can only double click to change the name before you write it, obvious really. Do most writer programs work like that? There was a similar question on another forum I looked at where someone was using EFA Client 2.1 but they hadn't had an answer.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just using dev kit advance to compile my stuff and MS Visual studio for my editing, is there anything simple you can do in code that will work with DKA? Also there's quite a few header tools listed on the main gbadev page, any recommendations on these? Not all of them have much information when you click on the name and most look like they do a lot more than just change the ROM name.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
