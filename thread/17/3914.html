    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm looking for a setup that'll allow me to do the following: Upload games to a flashcart, download games I own to my computer, and run an emulator to play my favorite classics.
<br/>
<br/>
The first is easy, but there's a shortage of product comparisons out there that give a good side-by-side view of what you can do with one setup as opposed to the other.  I also noticed that only two (so far) kits I've seen listed specifically state that you can download your current games to a PC, the EZFA2 and the F2A.  What about the others?  As far as price and size go, the Ecube looks like a good deal, but I want to make sure I get the right piece of hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I use the EZFA, and it let me backup my games to my PC, which can then be played in the VBA. The PDF shows step by step how it is done. I found it very easy.
<br/>
<br/>
I have also used the EZFA to run my own code that I found in tutorials on this site. The best feature in my opinion is that I have not taken the EZFA cartridge out of my gameboy in probably 3 months, as everything it does is through the link port at the back of the gameboy.
<br/>
<br/>
The software could be more user friendly in my opinion, but otherwise I am very satisfied with this product.
