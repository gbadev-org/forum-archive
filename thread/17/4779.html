    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Indeed. 
<br/>
<br/>
I myself am getting one to see whether we could disassemble the firmware to run our code/support the product ourselves.
<br/>
<br/>
Compatibility is not high because they do not target HW compatibility, as real flashcarts do. They make heavy use of ROM patching to make them work on their system.
<br/>
<br/>
The extra capacity is nevertheless nice to be able to play movies/emulate CDROM-based media such as the PcEngine.

<br/>
I just ordered one from hopebuy.com

I'm hearing a lot of pretty good stuff about it and considering the price of the media for it I couldn't say no....

<br/>
Tons of information about the card here:

I'll post a retailer feedback in the appropriate section as soon as i get the card...can't wait to play all those freeware games people have created from <a href="http://www.pdroms.de/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.pdroms.de/index.php</a>  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Probably not, and here's my reasoning: Does the SC user have to "load" a game into RAM every time e powers up the GBA? If so, then loading games into RAM is probably done with GBA code, and when the DS powers up in DS mode and passes control to the passthrough, the only code there is the SC firmware.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
Microdrives are CF type II. The Supercard only works with CF type I. This is only a question of physical dimensions that make the CF type I differ from CF type II.
