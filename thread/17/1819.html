    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just got a 256M EZF Advance cart, and I must say, it's pretty sweet to see my code run on real hardware. The only real problem I have, is I can't figure out how to run a rom directly through the cable without flashing the cart. (supposedly this is supposed to work for rom images &lt; 2Mb). I downloaded the latest drivers and client app (0.96 beta I believe).
<br/>
<br/>
Here's what I've been doing:
<br/>
1. Start EZF Advance Client, which says (waiting for GBA connection...)
<br/>
2. Plug in the cable to my GBA, and USB port
<br/>
3. Start the GBA (tried with &amp; without the flash cart, holding start + select)
<br/>
4. The client says "No Cartridge detected"
<br/>
5. Press the "No Cart" button, and load my rom image (less than 2Mb)
<br/>
6. My GBA resets for some reason, but just resets to a blank screen, where it hangs forever. If I turn it off, and back on, it still doesn't reset right. I have to unplug the cable and reset for it to show the Nintendo logo again. If I do this, the client goes back to step 4.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone had any luck with this? I've tried this on both a GBA and a GBA SP with no luck.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, another question: Does anyone know if the USB cable charges the GBA SP battery when you turn it off? The charge light seems to glow dimly if I keep the cable plugged in after turning the SP off...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Your rom must be compiled as multiboot.
<br/>
<br/>
And by 2mb it's megabits, thus 256k in bytes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If not, youll get loads of help from a quick search in the forum.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
