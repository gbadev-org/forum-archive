    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I am using a MBV3 (Intelligent Multiboot Cable) with the MBLOAD.exe utility under Windows 98.
<br/>
The hardware works fine. I have tested it thuroughly.
<br/>
<br/>
I can upload games, but only if I use the Pocket NES utility to convert a .NES rom into a ".gba" file and rename it to ".mb".
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the issue: If I download a ".gba" file from the demos section and rename it to a ".mb" file it will fail to work. It uploads fine, but always produces a blank screen when finished.
<br/>
<br/>
This MBLOAD utility (see <a href="http://ajo.thinknerd.com/gba/software.html" target="_blank">http://ajo.thinknerd.com/gba/software.html</a> ) cannot see a file without renaming it to ".mb".
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a functional difference between a .gba and a .mb file?
<br/>
I also cannot load the renamed file using VisualBoyAdvance Emulator unless I change the name back to a .gba file.
<br/>
<br/>
I have checked that the .gba files do work in the emulator, but will not run after being renamed and uploaded to the real GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
All help appreciated.
<br/>
:-)
<br/>
<br/>
I figure I might actually be the first to get this #!@$!$ MBV3 cable to work, but maybe someone here knows what is going on.
<br/>
<br/>
Strange that the .gba file generated by PocketNES can be renamed and still upload and run correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The rundown:
<br/>
a) .gba files created by PocketNES can be renamed to .mb files and will upload and work.
<br/>
b) .gba files downloaded from the demo section that are renamed to .mb files will not work though they will upload.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A .mb program is compiled to run at a base of 0x02000000 (EWRAM) instead of 0x08000000 (ROM). You can't just take a .gba program and rename it to .mb; you have to pare its assets down and recompile it. (You usually can't do that to a proprietary program.) Some .mb programs, especially homebrew ones, will detect whether they're loaded from ROM or from EWRAM and will copy themselves to EWRAM if necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're using a recent DevKit Advance, you can place the following line of code in one of your source files to trigger compiling for .mb:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">int __gba_multiboot;</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Some GameCube games send a .mb program to the GBA; experts may try intercepting those, or some pirate sites may carry those.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I found a post near the bottom that dealt with this issue right after I wrote the article.
<br/>
<br/>
I have just gotten the MBV3 cable to also work with the Game Boy Advance Base Station for the GameCube. Thus, I can now edit my games on the BIG screen.
<br/>
:-)
<br/>
<br/>
Very happy indeed.
<br/>
<br/>
I think my next question belongs in the programming area.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried lots of combinations to get my MBV3 cable to work;
<br/>
<br/>
Pentium 3 Win2000
<br/>
Pentium 4 Win2000
<br/>
Pentium 1 Win95
<br/>
Pentium 2 Win98
<br/>
<br/>
None of these worked.
<br/>
<br/>
Any hints on how you got yours to work?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
