<br/>
<br/>
I bought today a F2A 512MB USB Ultra set to my sons GBA SP, and after installing everything and trying to use the powerwriter 2.40, i am getting this:
<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to use F2A PowerWriter
<br/>
Checking ULA....
<br/>
Launch BIOS...
<br/>
USB.Linker Found
<br/>
Flash not found!!!
<br/>
<br/>
I read through a lot of FAQs and i have installed updated drivers, etc. but i still get this error. On the SP screen, it says: USB LINKER: data to PC UNKNOWN CART!
<br/>
<br/>
I also have to ask, since its USB,  is there supposed to be a icon popping up when connecting the GBA? Like it does when connecting a digital camera, external hard drive, scanner/printer, etc.?
<br/>
<br/>
Because i get a message that the new USB device is ready and working after installing the drivers, etc. but there is no icon showing that its connected, but the message in the powerwriter say that it finds the USB linker.
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
