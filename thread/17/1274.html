    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. I am looking for a flash cart kit to buy. I already have one that I bought from lik-sang back when there were selling them but need a couple more. So, lik-sang is no longer stocking them, GameGizmo is out of business and easybuy2000 won't let me buy from them unless I send a photocopy of my ID and a photocopy of the front and back of my credit card (kind of shady, huh?) which i'm definately NOT going to do. Anyone know of somewhere else I can pick one up? Thanks.<br/>_________________<br/>- RegularKid</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
