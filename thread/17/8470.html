    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought this 128 mbit flash card off of ebay called newwise. the guy didn't even send me the drivers so I had to find them myself and I got it working. Here's a picture of the card: <a class="postlink" href="http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&amp;friendID=15585645&amp;imageID=486176721&amp;Mytoken=CD7991ED-155D-63F3-5E09129A246C555410377620." target="_blank">viewmorepics</a>

Has anybody else heard of it, and its compatibility with the DS?
<br/>
I have a red DS and want to run homebrew stuff on it. 
<br/>
<br/>
I also bought a passme2 modified for SM64 and can't figure it out. I'm trying to get ScummVM for the ds to run.  <a href="http://scummvm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://scummvm.drunkencoders.com</a>
<br/>
But I don't know if it supports the strange flash card that I have. Help would be appreciated, thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If a GBA NOR flash card works in the DS in GBA mode, and it's possible to write a ROM without "correcting" the header, then DS homebrew should work on it. But the "128M" will limit which ScummVM games can run.
