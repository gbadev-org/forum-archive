Totakeke:Is the software app f2a a Darwin based tool? I have stayed away from fiddling with that app for fear of destroying my OS. Or is their some app I am missing in the f2a download. I have been unable to find a drag and drop based application to facilitate moving games  anywhere.

I'm one of the authors of if2a and did the F2A Ultra part. f2a is compatible with Ultra carts as well as very few has changed in cart registers between non-Ultra and Ultra carts. 
<br/>
<br/>
Using f2a, you'll miss several features though (such as dynamic ROM adding ability, new in if2a 0.93) + f2a is not supported anymore.

I just want to make sure that the program and accessories will work on my Mac. I also need to make sure that my meager PC abilities will be able to utilize the equipment once I recieve them. It seems like the application is not drag and drop. A man needs to know his limitations.. I do not want to get involved with writing code. I also worry about spending $130 to get stuff that I will not be able to use. These are all real worries.
<br/>
Vince howza about making this lil program of yours more simple. If an app can compress video and write DVD's....I am sure that the ability to place simple games onto carts in the same manner is not in the realm of impossibility. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

BrettOG: hahaha! I understand your concerns. The program is command-line only at the moment. No drag and drop or UI of any kind. I am planning to write a graphical interface using PyGTK so it is in the realm of possibilities. The real question is when, of course ...

PC emulator? I would rather dress in drag and try to pick up sailors. hahahahah, It's not me. Don't even wanna go there.

Thx for the linkaroo to the Q&amp;A.

So I would put the ultra cart into the GBA. Then plug the linker cable into the cart. Then plug cable into Mac.  Start up Terminal and ..type the command that will put the games into the cart such as
<br/>
if2a -d -W 1999-StarWars3RevengeSITH.gba Klonoa-EmpireofDreams.gba Pitfall-Mayan Adventure.gba

Thx for the linkaroo to the Q&amp;A.
<br/>
So I would put the ultra cart into the GBA. Then plug the linker cable into the cart. Then plug cable into Mac.  Start up Terminal and ..type the command that will put the games into the cart such as
<br/>
if2a -d -W 1999-StarWars3RevengeSITH.gba Klonoa-EmpireofDreams.gba Pitfall-Mayan Adventure.gba
<br/>
and.......boom those three games would be written to the cartridge?????</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">Yes, this is how it works. But if you have an Ultra cart, not all the specific ultra informations will be updated onto the cart and you may have problems with saves. You could also try and use pogoshell if your cart is 256Mbits at max.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So I don't wanna buy ultra carts. 
<br/>
For Mac what Carts do I want?? 
<br/>
I have found that ebay deletes any flash carts that are placed there.
<br/>

And one day maybe if2a users will be able to use the ultra carts at their full power. Only time is needed for that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Whatever the case I ordered a linker and a 256 cartridge. If that works I will oder more carts and some larger ones. Wanted to keep my initial cost down before I get too involved.
<br/>
Expect mass postings from me when I recieve the merchandise. hahahah
<br/>
I am sure I will have some questions. I am already concerned that my OSX will start up iPhoto when the caet is plugged in. I would imagine that a flash device being plugged in would start that software up automatically.
<br/>
No worries now. I don't have the cable or device yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't stray from your Mac screen in the coming weeks. hahah. I haven't recieved the cxable or cart yet, but when I do..... :)
<br/>
Nah..I'll just use the info you provided..plus the stuff from the web site of the app.
<br/>
Seems easy enuff.
<br/>
As near as I can tell.
<br/>
#1 Place cart in Gameboy advance.
<br/>
#2 Attach linker cable.
<br/>
#3 Attach cable to Mac
<br/>
#4 Start Gameboy Advance unit.
<br/>
#5 Launch Terminal? Or wut?
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I am sytill confused about the components I downloaded from the  f2a site. Where should those items reside? When I double click any of the files in the "build" folder it launches my Visual Gameboy software. hahahah
<br/>
If terminal (part of the Mac OS Utilities) does the haevy work by using command lines to load the games..what does the f2a files do? My guess is they facilliatate the encoding of the game file. If that's the case where should I put those files on my hard drive to make the process work? I have the folder still on my desktop where I downloaded it from the web site.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">as of now I can get this 
<br/>
<a href="http://if2a.free.fr/downloads/OSX/f2a_source.zip" target="_blank">http://if2a.free.fr/downloads/OSX/f2a_source.zip</a>
<br/>
to work put that wherever is easiest
<br/>
dont turn on your gba until after you do all this
<br/>
After all those steps you said, launch terminal and open up the folder where f2a is and drag in the unix executable  (Looks like a little black window with stuff on it)  to the terminal window.  Then drag in the .gba file you want (or .ds.gba)  and hit return.  If it works it will say New device added Please restart gba in multiboot mode. 
<br/>
Then turn on your gba with select and start held down.
<br/>
It willl start the burn and you're done<br/>_________________<br/>-=Jstart=-</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
