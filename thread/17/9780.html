    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey,
<br/>
<br/>
sorry for the question that has probably been answered many times before.
<br/>
I am trying to find out whether the f2a usb cable (i.e. at <span style="font-weight: bold">URL removed by MOD</span>) enables me to download multiboot roms onto the gba and run them, under windows and linux, without any other hardware (besides the gba).
<br/>
<br/>
I have found only software that loads images into flashcards...
<br/>
<br/>
I wanna buy a bunch of them and really make sure i get the right stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
thank you
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, i dont understand why that url was removed, anyhoo.
<br/>
<br/>
lets try to rephrase
<br/>
Does anybody know about any usb cable that i can plug into the gba, with which i can run multiboot images on the gba from pc, possibly using windows or linux?
<br/>
<br/>
thx

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The F2A software (f2aw31.exe) and USB cable will allow you to send multiboot images, but it doesn't properly start them in supervisor mode.  I suggest you get a GBA Movie Player or MBV2 cable if you want to run multiboot roms.  The MBV2 cable lets you write programs that communite with the PC from the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh wait, this post was for windows only...  I guess you're best off with the GBA Movie Player, since compactflash readers are linux compatible with no problems.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so basicly the only option would be one of those xboo cables.
<br/>
<br/>
what do you mean by F2A doesnt start images properly?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">He means the F2A boot code which loads the rom image is broken for the reason he stated. In simple terms it doesn't work and it's pointless trying.
<br/>
<br/>
MBV2 and Xboo Communicator both work correctly on linux &amp; windows.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually several of the usb cables which claim to allow multibooting suffer exactly the same problem as the f2a - I've tested XG2Turbo, f2a and ezfa.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
