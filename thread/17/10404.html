    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The file has to be both 1. under 256 KB and 2. linked in multiboot mode (-specs=gba_mb.specs).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most of the homebrews on the TOD page are also multiboot. Look for anything with a file name suffix ".mb" or ".mb.gba". (However, ".mb" files will need to be renamed to ".mb.gba" or ".gba" for the GBAMP firmware to recognize them.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
