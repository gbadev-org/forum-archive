    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wanted the software for EZ-Flash II PowerStar. If anyone has the lastest version and drivers, I would be greatly appreciated if they can give me a copy. (Btw, when I bought the Flash Cart and Loader, it did not come with the CD)
<br/>
<br/>
edit: I know gbadev.org serves the 1.02 version; I have seen the 1.04 software and drivers. Also, I did download the 1.02 version and somehow it doesn't work on my computer. Keeps shutting down for no apparent reason, right after I execute the program.

EDIT #2: so anybody know? i didn't want to make another post.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
