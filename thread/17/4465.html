<br/>
<br/>
I've been trying to find a flash linker that has support for Linux, and has found the drivers f2a and if2a. Unfortunately I haven't found any dealer that can sell me a Flash2Advance device since they seem to (apparently?) be outdated.
<br/>
<br/>
But one dealer I mailed to offered the following list of flash linkers. Unfortunately he didn't know if they had any support under Linux, which is why I'm posting to this forum. Does anyone know if any of the linkers below have support under Linux? If so please redirect me to the driver page! :-)
<br/>
Or if you know of any other linker that has Linux-support that I should check out, please tell me! 
<br/>
<br/>
Extreme Flash Advance (EFA Linker), 256M, USB, RTC
<br/>
Extreme Flash Advance (EFA Linker), 512M, USB, RTC
<br/>
EZ Flash II Power Star 1Gbit - backup flash kit, USB, RTC (GBA/SP)
<br/>
EZ Flash II Power Star 512M - backup flash kit, USB, RTC (GBA/SP)
<br/>
ECube 1G - backup flash kit (linker), SMS, USB, RTC, 1M save, U-Disk (GBA/SP)
<br/>
EZF Advance 256M USB - backup flash kit w/RTC (GBA/SP)
<br/>
ProCard 128M flash kit, USB, RTC (GBA/SP)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!

<br/>
<br/>
None of these have a driver under Linux. Your best bet would be to buy a F2A Ultra since it is closely compatible with the F2A.
<br/>
I own a Ultra too and I am working on the Ultra support for the Linux software, if2a. Almost everything is done now. Should be in during December, say.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,

After reading through the specification for it, I'll have to agree that it seems rather tempting.
<br/>
<br/>
Would you mind telling me at what online store you bought your F2AU? I'm a bit concerned about potentially dishonest internet companies, especially since a flash linker apparently costs quite a bit of money. But the distributor where you got your linker from at least has a good track record. ;-)

Sweet! Does this mean that all the fancy features mentioned at flash2advanceultra.com will work or just a subset?
<br/>
<br/>
Please forgive me if I'm asking you any questions that have obvious answers to most people at gbadev.org. I'm still somewhat of a newbie when it comes to gba hw (as opposed to programming for the emus).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I bought mine from a french site but you can find linkers on <a href="http://www.linker4u.com/" target="_blank">http://www.linker4u.com/</a> , many users seem to have a positive feedback on this store. Also do not forget to consult reviews of stores on forums such as gbatemp or emuboards.

I will. As I'm looking forward to buying a F2AU I'm certainly interested in you F2AU Linux driver, so how's the status on that? Do you aim for a release soon? Can I assist in any way even though I haven't got the device yet?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
Concerning the Ultra support on Linux, here is the current status :
<br/>
+ SVD R/W is done. SVD disassembler is in the works (I have a Java implementation thanks to Zhevon, still need to port it to C)
<br/>
+ Die Hard R/W is easy to do but it seems that some processing is done internally by powerwriter so it's not complete now
<br/>
+ SRAM R/W is ok
<br/>
+ ROM flashing is OK except that apart for the Content Descriptor area. More info here : <a class="postlink" href="http://www.emuboards.com/invision/index.php?showtopic=18122" target="_blank">http://www.emuboards.com/invision/index.php?showtopic=18122</a>

Note to moderators : last time I linked to Emuboards, my link was removed with a note like "Do not link to that lame site". I'd prefer not see that happen here since the link is on a purely development-oriented post.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I searched the forum and even checked all the posts you have made but could not find that quote anywhere. I did however find that an URL had been removed from one of your posts but it said "<span style="font-weight: bold">URL deleted by MOD</span>" which to me has quite a different tone to it. Did I do a poor search job or is that a fake quote?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello Simon,
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I was referring to that post. It indeed seems that my understanding of the comment beside it was wrong and I stand corrected. My bad.
<br/>
<br/>
However, it was unclear to me at that time why the URL was removed. I had it put there because I think it is important to refer your sources. 
<br/>
While I could agree that the link was not development-related (hence off-topic), there was no observation beside the mod comment as to why the URL was removed. This could have helped me not to do the same error again (and not have put the comment in this present post)
<br/>
<br/>
At that time, I assumed the link was removed since the linked forum has a somewhat fuzzy reputation, esp. concerning ROM distribution.
<br/>
<br/>
Could you clear the situation up a bit? 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your concern,
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I want to buy a F2A Ultra card for development, I realize the linux drivers aren't finished yet, but I have a windows machine I can use in the meantime.
<br/>
<br/>
However, none of the retailers I looked at carried the F2A Ultra! Does anyone know a good place to order one? I live in California, USA, so a retailer in North America would be preferred. I'm leaning towards a 256Mbit size, should be more than enough for anything I want to do.
<br/>
<br/>
