    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Aight i got the cart right?  and well its a 1 gig cart.  When i try to download about 512 mbits of data it says that the cart is full.  Also it says that the cart is only a 256.  I was wondering where i can get better information on how to use this thing, and also what the two buttons do?  The readme doc that came with the kit is old and it mostly talks about older versions, so it doesnt say what the buttons do.  It would be great to figure out the full potential of this cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
