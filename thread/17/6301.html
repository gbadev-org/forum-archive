<br/>
However, a couple of the advantages of the other linkers that connect straight to the GBA is that 1) I can copy my games and saves to the linker, and 2) I can squirt my own code direct to the GBA without flashing a cart.
<br/>
<br/>
What I want to know is whether it's possible to buy just the cable, and with that, can I copy my saves from my cartridges and write them to the EFA?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

nope, you cannot backup your games with an EFA.

What I'm asking is whether it's still possible to buy just the USB cable for something like a EZ-F?  I remember gbax.com selling them a while ago.  If I have just this cable, can I take my saves from my existing carts and use them with the EFA?
<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of the EFA because it's both cheap and quick, however it'd still be nice to test code using multiboot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
