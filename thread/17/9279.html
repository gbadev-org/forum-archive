<br/>
<br/>
So I want to get going programming the GBA with HAM.  I now want to try out my creation on a flashcard, but which one?.  I had a look and there is long list available.  Can someone give me some advice on which would be best to use as a development platform?
<br/>
<br/>
thx.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well.......I love my EFA linker.............. A flash card isn't the best thing for everyone though, some people prefere using a multibook cable......... Just depends on what your doing really. Tepples told me to get a GBA movie player, but I didn't and don't regret it. the only thing is that a movie player can alos be used for DS deving but for GBA deving my EFA works fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
