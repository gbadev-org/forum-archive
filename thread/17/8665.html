<br/>
I was wondering if anyone knows where you can find blank one time use carts (like Simon was using to burn peoples games), or who gbadev used to produce its carts.

<br/>

You are allowed to tell people about other sites here, but not those with links to warez (in this case, DS games). It also seems fishy that they are selling homebrew games...hopefully all the original developers have given them the permission to do that.

If they were below $15 us, and I made a bulk order, who would be interested in purchasing some, and how many, approximately, would you want to purchase?

They'd still be rewritable, like any other flash cart, but cheap enough that it would be realistic to use them to distribute your games.

Just so you know, DS games have a some kind of code that's specific to each game and that is very hard to crack, (at least that's what I've heard) It won't be for a long time, or never that someone can make a DS flash cart. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I would also be interested in a about 10 small one time right carts that I could give to my friends.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#80066 - Lynx - Tue Apr 18, 2006 2:56 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Uhh...  the code has already been cracked.. and you wouldn't need to crack it for each game if it was specific anyway, as you would just tell all your homebrew devices to use the code of one specific game.  The "lack of interest" in an NDS flash cart (In my opionion) is because of two major issues.  1) it most likely won't be nice and neat, and fit into the DS slot without sticking out.  2) all major hardware providers already have GBA Flashcarts and have done the major work of developing them.  So, why take on the expense to develope something that isn't really needed?  Which would you buy:
<br/>
<br/>
1) NoPass + GBA Flash Cart (Both that fit perfect into their slots) = $80
<br/>
2) NDS Flash Cart (that sticks out) = $300
<br/>
<br/>
As, most of us already have GBA Flash Carts, the real $ = $20 for the NoPass and we use the hardware we already spent a lot of money on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

None.. If I'm defining "us".. then "us" = people with flash carts.  :)  Otherwise, people interested in devoping and playing homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
But, on a serious note..  Answer this question honestly, from your personal opinion.
<br/>
<br/>
Which would you buy?
<br/>
1) NoPass ($20) + GBA MP ($20) + 256MB CF/SD ($20) = $60
<br/>
2) NoPass ($20) + GBA Flash Cart 256Mb ($60) = $80
<br/>
3) NoPass ($20) + SC ($40) + 256MB CF/SD ($20) = $80
<br/>
or
<br/>
and of course, I have to make up the price, as it isn't available
<br/>
4) NDS Flash Cart = $300
<br/>
<br/>
And, do you think guessing at $300 is an extreme over price?  Seeing what some companies charged for option 2 with a PassMe instead of a NoPass.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It would be a bit expensive for each company to be doing it in-house considering some are as low as $20US now.

<br/>
Getting hold of these carts, along with the actual NoPass software would be perfect - It'd be a self-contained cartridge that will run in an un-modded DS without the need for any extra Pass devices.

Any ideas?
