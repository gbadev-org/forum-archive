    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I just bought an EZ Flash III cart from jandaman and downloaded the 2.08 software for it.
<br/>
<br/>
However, no matter what I do I can't seem to get the cart to work properly.  If I attempt to upgrade the "OS" on the cartridge, it starts to transfer but then the red LED comes on solid and nothing happens from that point on.
<br/>
<br/>
If I try to backup a game ROM, the same thing happens.
<br/>
<br/>
I can burn a demoscene ROM to the cartridge, but then I just get the white screen from the GBA after booting.
<br/>
<br/>
So either this cartridge has a hardware failure, or I'm doing something wrong.  Any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone point me to detailed English language instructions for the EZ Flash software, then?
<br/>
<br/>
I can't tell if I'm doing something wrong because the docs are poor, or because this cartridge has a hardware fault.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
