<br/>
<br/>
I've had a GB E-Merger for a few years now, was great up until the point that some idiot inserted a power supply with an output higher than the requirement, and switched it on; hasn't worked since then - it'll function but no matter what the windows software will not detect the unit and gives an EPP port error. Today I tried setting up Windows 98 on an older machine, knowing it'd once functioned on that and maybe my problem was Windows XP based, got exactly the same error. So I figured I'd attempt to wipe a flash card manually using the E-Merger's standalone functions... on trying to wipe the card I was greeted with an error message informing me of a BIOS ID error; so it seems I've finally found what the power surge caused, a BIOS corruption.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing that in order for it to have done that the BIOS would have to had been flashable, so I'm hoping that *maybe* someone can provide me with a tool and BIOS file that would allow me to re-flash it or flash it with a new BIOS and fix the unit, anyone capable or doing so or pointing me in the right direction? It seems Netmars have disappeared off the face of the earth, and an earlier search I did for the newer E-Merger software turned up a load of broken download links so no luck there... I'd really appreciate it if someone could help me with this, and it seems a development community are the best bet I have right now. Cheers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
