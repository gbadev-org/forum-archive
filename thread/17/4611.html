Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
you have to, because without a f2a(ultra) card the game wallet will not work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok thanks
<br/>
So to transfer the savs i just transfer it like i'm putting a game onto my F2A?
<br/>
I just flash it like i'd flash a game. right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
The reason why it is called the 'Game wallet' is because it serves as 'mass' storage for ROMS. You'll definitely need a flashcart with it. When you want to use a ROM on the GW, you'll have to flash it to your cart.
<br/>
<br/>
From the saves point of view, I don't have much idea about it. I suppose it works the same as for ROMS. I'll be glad to have some more info.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm interested in knowing how it goes generally with the GameWallet. I'd also like to know whether it's possible to use it with a GBA SP (not sure for the package) and wether it's confirmed it works with F2A Ultras.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the review.

Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
it?s nearly the same way using the "supercard" (if you know this product).
<br/>
<br/>
You format your CF/SMC card on your pc in FAT mode (not FAT32 !) and then you can copy your files on the card.
<br/>
<br/>
After this you plug in your gamewallet into the gba/sp and plug in your f2a/pro/ultra card into the gba/sp.
<br/>
<br/>
Then you start with select+start (if i remember right) and you will reach a little menue. You select the file(s) you want and the file(s) will be copied to the f2a card and now you can play them....etc. etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info. Yes, I know the Supercard but the GW seems much better mainly because it's not a battery hog + as it uses a standard flashcart, it achieves full HW compatibility (the Supercard has to heavily rely on patches for the Roms to run).
<br/>
<br/>
I think I may get one ;) Plus I know someone has already disassembled the GW firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
Gret, great, great !

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another quick question,
<br/>
   Is there any way to put .sav files from the SMC to my flashcart's SRAM?
<br/>
I've tried just flashing it to the cart itself, but it just acts like it's a game and puts it in the menu. Any help would be great. thx</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
