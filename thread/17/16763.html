    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm looking for a flashcard for my DS Lite. I need it to be able to support homebrew and use Aim for the Ds and some kind of web browser so I can go on myspace and other sites. Can you help me pick a good quality flash card that will do what I need. I also need a microsd and it would be nice if you can refer me to a place to buy all of it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
