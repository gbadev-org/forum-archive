<br/>
<br/>
I got an EZFlash Advance to play homebrew roms and read ebooks, and I was wondering if it could be used to emulate one of those mini-USB flash drives... you know what I mean.
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be possible for someone to make software to do this? I have no programming ability or I'd try myself. 
<br/>
<br/>
Later!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ermm.. You already have it, really. If you don't want to see what files you happen to have on screen, you could just stick the files you want on to the cartridge, move to a new place, plug in your linker and take them off. This is do-able as this is how you get rom-dumps, really. If the cart won't accept .xls files or whatever, just rename them, as it won't change the actual file, really. Mind, I might be wrong...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
However, the cart might attempt to header-fix your .xls files, thereby corrupting them. A better choice is to stick them in a .gbfs file and then append them to some random small GBA ROM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
