    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Open System-&gt;Hardware-&gt;That Manager and view your USB drivers - your driver might have morphed to EZ-forFlash2Advance (my pc does this all the time :/) instead of Flash2Advance U-Linker 1.0. If that's the case run The software it'll say driver not found. In you'll get a (!) in the hardware window select update driver update it and restart if youre asked to. That solves the problem for me.
<br/>
<br/>
However it's turning back to the other driver once in a while if anybody has any advice how to fix that HELP it's really annoying to reinstall the driver about once in a week</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
