    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You are not going to find any flash carts in a store (unless you live in Hong-Kong) so ordering off of the Internet is the only way to get one. There are some reliable retailers in the "Retailer Feedback" section of this site, so take a look at them and read the reviews. If you have a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.paypal.com" target="_blank">PayPal</a> account, life is much easier when ordering as most site accept it as a method of payment. A word to the wise: It is always better to order in your native country as shipping won't be as expensive.

Good luck in finding a online store.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
