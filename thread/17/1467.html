    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just a quick query; are there any USB linkers which have Mac OS X compatible software? If so, which? Does anybody have any recommendations? Also, does anybody know of any reliable dealers of such USB linkers in the UK?

Jouni Korhonen (a.k.a. Mr. Spiv) has released a program for the Flash Advance Xtreme (available <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jikorhon/condev/gba/" target="_blank">here</a>). Right now it is very picky about the cart, but new versions should be coming soon.</span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by crossraleigh on Sat Aug 30, 2003 5:56 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is an alpha version of the f2a OS X software I'm writing available at <a class="postlink" href="ftp://ftp.nuprometheus.com/pub/f2a.zip" target="_blank">ftp://ftp.nuprometheus.com/pub/f2a.zip</a> if anybody wants to try it out. Or you could just wait for me to find some more time and get a real beta up.
