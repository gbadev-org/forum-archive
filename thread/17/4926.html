    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's what it says on the box. Bought it to replace my old Flash2Advance for various reasons, including but not limited to USB cable and RTC.
<br/>
<br/>
Strange things are:
<br/>
<br/>
1) The cart doesn't quite fit. It goes in the GBA's cart slot fine but is too stuck to get out. It seems to be just a leeeettle too wide...
<br/>
<br/>
2) When I load up the link software and start GBA operations, I get the MagicFlash splash screen on the GBA, immediatly followed by a message box on Windoze stating that it can't find a cart. Funny, because it hasn't left the slot at all.
<br/>
<br/>
3) It's chinese. Thank your local deity it defaults to Engrish.

Did I just waste a hundred bucks or am I simply missing something?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Usually to make the software talk to your cartridge, you have to press select + strat at the boot of your GBA. Did you try that ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes I did. I even do that when there's no card inserted at all. But there is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got this card too... it isn't the best. If it helps, I've found that there are a couple of different versions of the send software floating about the web. They seem to be different, e.g. one version works with my flash card, and the other doesn't. They appear exactly the same, use help-&gt;about to see the version number...
