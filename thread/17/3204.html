    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering about the quality of the gold connectors that is inside xrom, i am pretty worried about them because i constantly change my xrom in and out (well at the start anyway) and noticed they were wearing down fast, or at least, that's what it looked like.
<br/>
So i just left the xrom in since i now have two gba's, but i still need to change it. Does anyone know if they can completley ware down? I want to take it out but i'm too afraid.
<br/>
<br/>
This is unlike the official carts, they never seem to ware down fast, maybe xrom is made with low quality connectors? (Which wouldn't surprise me)
<br/>
<br/>
So can anyone shed any light on wether or not the connectors are of good or bad quality, and if how long they could last constant swapping?<br/>_________________<br/>\(^_^)/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe it just looks like they are ware down because the gold got scratched off and you may now see plain metal instead of gold (I think so because i believe that most likely the connectors are not fully made out of gold)??<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"plain metal" Well, the metal under the gold is copper, so you would not really see it that clearly because it has a similar color.
<br/>
All PCB edge connectors are made of copper with a few mikrometer of gold plating on top.
<br/>
No edge connector will last forever, but there should not be much difference in lifelength between different brands. It should last for many years.
<br/>
What you are seeing is probably small scratches, dirt, and metal oxide.
<br/>
If you want, you can clean the contacts using a gum eraser.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm...
<br/>

<br/>
I mean, i have swapped my Pkmn Ruby cart a million times, and still the Xrom cart is worse...
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I mean its worse by it loosing its goldness.
<br/>
I know that eventually all things with gold connectors will loose it but this lost it ultra fast, i mean i noticed it was quite bad after around a week. I've had ruby was longer.<br/>_________________<br/>\(^_^)/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hmmm. that sounds like a quality issue but at the same time ive seen contacts lose their luster all the time it shouldnt be an issue, also try contacting the manufacturer and ask them if you cant contact them, try contacting the company that you purchased it from maybe they can help you out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
