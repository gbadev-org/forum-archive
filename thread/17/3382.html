    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, this is here to document my problems I've had along the way. 
<br/>
<br/>
So far, I've written maybe 16 games to the card (filled it up) and tried to remove those games. Using the 'Delete' button just hides the game from showing up on the menu and changes it's status to 'Hidden - In Cart' It's not possible to delete it in this fashion. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, if you fill up the card, games off the end (bottom) of the list will begain to be marked as 'To Be Erased - In Cart' instead of the previous message. 
<br/>
<br/>
This seems to work really well. Now, the problem that I am having at this point, is that after messing with it for a few hours, and doing multiple writes, the original 16 or so roms I put on were marked as 'Hidden - In Cart' when they were written over. I don't seem to have a way which I can remove them at all. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to fill up the cart with other roms, so it will begin to 'delete' these hidden ones. Since the size of the hidden roms is showing up as 0 bytes for each of them however, they never get erased from the card. 
<br/>
<br/>
Here is my problem. I now have 16 entries in the menu, which contain 0 bytes, and won't (of course) play. What to do?

<br/>
<br/>
It appears that opening and closing the program several times seems to do the trick.  Delete all the roms on the cart (of course you can't the ones that are 'stuck' on there).  Then I went and added one right after I opened the application up.  Seemed to work for me.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this 'just jiggling the cable' or 'hitting the tv' sorta thing to fix it?  I assume this is due to some bugs in the software.
