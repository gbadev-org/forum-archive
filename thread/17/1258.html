    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
   I have one of the earlier GBA flash carts that showed up at LikSang. It's a 64mb cart, with a serial port linker (the basic flash advance kit). Now I'd like to buy a bigger cart, 256mb or so, but I don't know which one to buy. Are these Flash2Advance and other USB carts compatible with the old linker? I'd really like to keep the serial port linker and buy just a compatible cart, which one should I go for?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
<br/>
Cesar.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Um, parallel port linker surely?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I recently got a F2A 256mbit USB kit, but the cart can be programmed ok with my old visoly linker (but slower than USB).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, parallel, not serial. I was thinking "the *not USB* one", and just typed along.
<br/>
<br/>
The visoly linker is the same as that flash advance linker?

<br/>

Thanks,

I have the linker at the top of that page...

<br/>
<br/>
...and that cart. It came in the same style metal case my old 128mbit cart came in (also pictured on the first page), so I guess they came from the same place.
<br/>
<br/>
nb Success comes highly recommended if you're looking for somewhere to order one from, and the 64 and 128mbit F2A carts aren't compatable with the old linker.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the info. The one I got is precisely the one you reviewed, only with a smaller cart (same stickers, box and all).
<br/>
<br/>
Which cart is compatible with that linker? I'm about to order one of these:
<br/>
- Flash Advance Card Xtreme 512M (GBA-0080)
<br/>
- Flash2Advance 256M Ram Cart (GBA-0032)
<br/>
<br/>
If you guys have any clue, please let me know.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure if you need the xtreme linker for the 512mbit cart. Plus they are too big to fit into a GBASP should you get one in the future (or if you have one now).
<br/>
<br/>
The 256 cart however works fine with the linker and is the same size as a commercial cart, and fits into an SP fine :)
<br/>
<br/>
So I'd recommend the 256mbit cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
