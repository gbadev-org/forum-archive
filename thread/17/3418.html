    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Please help! I bought the 64m cart and the printerport linker from a guy used and it didnt have the disc that was suppose to come with it. I went to the flash2advance web site and downloaded every version of the program that they had on the site and everyone of them I get a port_error message.
<br/>
I saw a post on here from someone with the same error message and someone responded by saying to disable the cable in the hardware profile and then cut it back on....well my computer doesnt recognize the linker in the first place. So I was wondering if there is some kind of driver that was on the disc that I am missing and if so where I could get it from, because I have looked all over the flash2advance website and everywhere else I can think of. 
<br/>
Thanks in advance</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it the flash2advance ultra? I think you might have a search for LittleWriter since it supports some of the older linkers.
<br/>
<br/>
I own the f2au usb version so i can't really help you with this, but it's always a bad thing if windows doesnt even detect the hardware that you connected. Can't you ask the guy who sold you the linker? I think you will find something like "LPT port" or "Printer port" in your hardware settings, try to replace the driver of it with the f2a driver.
<br/>
<br/>
If nothing works i would try to get the usb linker cable, i think it is not very expensive and it works good for me (should work for old flash carts as well, not sure).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you for your reply Lupin.
<br/>
As for the version of the cart I have It just says flash2advance 64 m....I think its one of the very 1st ones they made but Im not sure.
<br/>
I really think I need some type of driver because no matter what I do, windows can't find the hardware. It sees the ECP port but nothing attached to it. I have Windows XP Home if that matters any. Anybody else got any ideas? Or know where I could find a driver. The only ones I can find are the USB drivers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
