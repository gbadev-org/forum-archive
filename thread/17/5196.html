<br/>
<br/>
I just recieved 2 of your EZF Advanced III readers.  After installing the drivers that worked fine and the software the computer notices them just fine.  But the software does not. 
<br/>
There is nothing wrong with the docker the computer says its running fine. Also can I get the Read MEs in English
<br/>
<br/>
Where might I find the correct drivers?????  The ones on the website do not work.  Is there a correct way to install it?
<br/>
<br/>
Please Help
<br/>
