    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all! I'm new of this forum but I hope someone will reply to me!
<br/>
I'm writing here because I'm in despair : I'm not able to write my 128 Mb flash card with the parallel flash linker! It usually worked but now I can't understand what happened! I use win XP and the latest version of the Flash linker (3.1), but when I start it I see a dialog window that say there's not a file, or dll I cannot understand; and the program show this: 
<br/>
Initial ULA ...
<br/>
Use DLPortIO
<br/>
Could not find xLA system !!
<br/>
i-Linker Found
<br/>
Flash not found!!!
<br/>
<br/>
What's that damn xLA system?!?! I've never saw this before!!!!
<br/>
I tried to search in the forum but I can't find anything about using a parallel cable!
<br/>
<br/>
Please can anyone help me?!?
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: I think this means nothing because on my friend's pc it works fine, but I use a Game Boy SP
<br/>
<br/>
Bye Bye

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Step 1: turn off the light.
<br/>
<br/>
Step 2: Some cheaper parallel ports don't put out just the right amount of juice to run a flash linker.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
