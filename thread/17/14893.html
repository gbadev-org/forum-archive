    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, 
<br/>
<br/>
I have a Nintendo DS and a R4 with a micros SD. I have also run FlashMe. Now I want more experience with Slot-2. For instance extra RAM and the possibility to run gba programs. It seems possible to run .nds from slot-2 as well when I get the "Error: can't fin NDS or GBA card in S2. Do you want to boot to NDS mode?" 
<br/>
<br/>
Can I have it both ways? A Slot-2 GBA cartridge with both extra ram and support for a microSD card with .GBA programs? 
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone recommend a particular GBA cartrdige for this purpose? 
<br/>
<br/>
best regards</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
