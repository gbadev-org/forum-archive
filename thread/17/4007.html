<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone tried to work out the SRAM compressed data format used by the new flash2advance loaders (the latest loader seems to be winf2a220.gba) ?
<br/>
<br/>
The goal would be to be able to extract and insert saves separately with tools like if2a or so...
<br/>
<br/>
Another good thing would be to have the sources of the sram-it! windows utility that patches the rom to enable sram saves for f2a carts.
<br/>
<br/>
No time no good...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
There is a program that can extract individual saves from a historical one (see PIRACY-DOT-COM boards IIRC, down ATM) but, as the algorithm is unknown, it is only able to separate the historical file into separate compressed ones that cannot be flashed to the cart...
<br/>
<br/>
Concerning SRAM-it, it was written by darkbishop (PIRACY-DOT-COM and PIRACY-DOT-NET boards) and is only a frontend for 2 tools that handle patching the ROMS. IMHO, the source for these is much more important than the source for the frontend (which I think bishop would gladly provide you btw).
<br/>
<br/>
The latest loader is indeed v 2.20. Did you get an ultra model btw? I thought you only had a regular F2A (well in fact 2)...
<br/>
<br/>
HTH,
