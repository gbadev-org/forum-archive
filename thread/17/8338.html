<br/>
I've successfully created a .GBA file, that runs fine on a emulator (Visualboy Advance). It also works when I test on a snsystems hardware debugger.
<br/>
<br/>
However, when I test it on hardware with my 'E2F Advance Realtime 128M all copyleft(?) reserved' flash cart thingy ... the game has developed a bug that didn't occur in emulator OR snsys debugger (the main character doesn't jump, he flies).
<br/>
<br/>
When I grab the .GBA rom image back from the cart, and test it again on Visualboy Advance, my game still has the same problem (flying character).
<br/>
<br/>
I can only assume that the problem lies with faulty flash equiptment?
<br/>
<br/>
The .GBA file has also grown by 2664 bytes, somewhere during the process of downloading from PC to flash cart, then uploading back to PC.
<br/>
<br/>
I would have thought it should be an identical image (in size and content), any ideas why this is not the case?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have simular probs with flash equiptment, and any recommendations for reliable kit?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>_________________<br/>Qwak - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk</a> | Forum - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk/forum/" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk/forum/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
