    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBAMP SD firmware isn't even dumped yet. We need somebody with a GBA (classic or SP, not a Micro or DS), a GBAMP SD, and a GBA serial cable (MBV2 or Xboo), but nobody in the gbadev.org crowd or the PIRACY-DOT-COM crowd seems to have all three parts.
<br/>
<br/>
The plan: <ol type="1"><li>Dump the GBAMP SD firmware. </li><li>Run the firmware in a modified GBA emulator that logs all Game Pak I/O. </li><li>Find where in the firmware the sector driver lives and disassemble it. </li><li>Figure out the algorithm that the GBAMP SD uses to read or write a sector. </li><li>Figure out the firmware unlock sequence. </li><li>Reimplement this algorithm into Chishm's FAT driver. </li><li>Recompile NDSMP against the new FAT driver. </li></ol>

<br/>
Moved to the GBA Flash Equipment forum because we need to reach out to people with GBA hardware.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
I could help with the 1st part - Dumping the firmware using an xboo cable.
<br/>
<br/>
But i dont have a GBAMP SD.
<br/>
<br/>
I wrote a routine for rom image dumping for my xboo xp software, but didnt release it cause kiddies would do illegal things with it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I tested the GBAMPSD with a normal Kingston 1 GB card, and it worked without problems.
<br/>
I already heard that the Kingston 1 Gb Elite Pro have compatibility issues
<br/>
with some hardware (some cardreaders do not work, some digital cameras),
<br/>
So you should give another card a try.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I already dumped the GBAMPSD-Firmware und currently looking for
<br/>
the SDCard access code, but I am not far yet. See this <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9568" target="_blank">thread</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
