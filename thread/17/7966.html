I mean, let's assume I've got another storage media, like a Supercard.  Could I still buy the EZ Flash II USB-GBA cable (it's sold standalone at Jandaman.com) and use it purely for the ability to multiboot code directly to GBA?

<br/>
So I'd have a cheap storage solution via the Supercard's CF media, but I could still upload small things real quick-like.  And the standalone cable is _so_ cheap, too :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
