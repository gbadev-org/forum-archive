    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't had any problem with any game on my old Visoly cart. Everything saves just fine. But recently I wanted to read out the savegame of NFS Underground to take some screens of my cars in VBA. It didn't work, there was some old Pogoshell rubbish in the .sav file. I bought the original game when it came out in Germany and tried to read out the savegame an there was only a lot of rubbish, too.
<br/>
Anyone got any Idea how I get my Visoly reader to read out EEPRom 124 or whatever it's called?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
