<br/>
<br/>
I have bought a ez-flash2 powerstar 512Mb at e2city 2 weeks ago, i received it, i tried it an it worked perfectly. But yesterday i tried to connect my card to the computer and it didn't work. I think that it is the transfert case which doesn't work. Indeed, the little light  doesn't work (the light which is red when it doesn't work and red when it works). I think that the transfer case is not powered. I tried it with an other usb cable (which work), with an other computer, with all usb ports of both computers, and it still doesn't works. I really don't understand, because i didn't use it, and i used the pc really few times...
<br/>
Does someone has the same problem, or even has a solution?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had the same problem with the same model/size (different store). I think it started when I unplugged the unit in the middle of writing because the link software had locked up.
<br/>
<br/>
As best as I can tell it went away once I left unit unplugged on the counter for a while. My guess as to the problem was the USB code in the adaptor isn't the best quality and it needed to sit a while for the until to dissipate any leftover charge and fully reset. If it wasn't that then it was from the gentle tapping on the table in frustration before giving up for a while.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
 What do you call 'for a while' (few hours, few months...). Indeed i will wait a little then try it, and if it still doesn't work i will try the gentle tape :).
<br/>
thx again
