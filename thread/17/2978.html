    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Rather then use the stupid WinF2A10.gba as a virtual drive, i would rather just keep save games in their natural format so that I can email them to people or just use them with an emulator.  But whenever I try to rip the save game using the software I get no luck.  And when I download a save game to the cart along with the game, the game does not reconize it.  Im pretty new to the scene, is there anything I need to do so that the save games can be ripped and reconized by the flash carts save memory?  Does anybody know more detailed information?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
