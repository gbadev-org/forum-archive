    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys,
<br/>
<br/>
We are very glad with spooo, original if2a author to announce the release of if2a-0.90 alpha, the F2A/F2A Ultra managing software.
<br/>
<br/>
As you may have noticed, version has bumped from 0.3 to 0.9 since there are many improvements:
<br/>
+ rewritten structure
<br/>
+ full 2.4 and 2.6 kernel (spooo)
<br/>
+ F2A Ultra support, reverse-engineered from PowerWriter software (me)
<br/>
<br/>
We will reach 1.0 when Ultra write support is complete.
<br/>
<br/>
You will find the release on spooo's site (if2a site in the works) :
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://if2a.free.fr/if2a-0.90a.tar.bz2" target="_blank">http://if2a.free.fr/if2a-0.90a.tar.bz2</a>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://if2a.free.fr/if2a-static.bz2" target="_blank">http://if2a.free.fr/if2a-static.bz2</a>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://if2a.free.fr/Sniffs_Dumps.tbz2" target="_blank">http://if2a.free.fr/Sniffs_Dumps.tbz2</a>
<br/>
<br/>
First is the release (with source).
<br/>
Second is the static binary (compiled on a 2.4.21 kernel, libusb v0.1.6). Is completely standalone unless you run a kernel version below 2.4.18, in which case you'll need the ezusb2131 kernel module.
<br/>
Last is a package containing zipped usbsnoop sniffs from PowerWriter operations as well as various dumps made with if2a Ultra functions (esp. content descriptor which is the 64K block that is used by CIZ to know what is on the cart).
<br/>
The Sniffs-HOWTO file details use of the supplied scripts to know how to produce pretty-printed output from these logs.
<br/>
<br/>
Please test and report bugs : F2A Pro/Turbo read/write support is fully functional, Ultra content descriptor is not fully reversed-engineered meaning you can fully write to the cart but CIZ won't see anything. If you use another loader or Pogoshell, this is gonna work nevertheless. SVD R/W is in on the other hand but needs testing.
<br/>
<br/>
We have also included several bootloaders and multiboot images so that you can have the configuration you need (see if2a options to give your own binary/use supplied ones).
<br/>
<br/>
You'll also notice that it is possible to supply another background image for the multiboot image. It would be _very_ nice if someone could do a Linux-somewhat background for use in if2a or figure out in what mode it is (I suppose image is mode3, 4 or something like this, maybe tiled?)
<br/>
<br/>
We are making this release to get feedback from the community, betatesters and help finish the Ultra support.
<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to post on that topic for any issue, bug, patches (most welcome!), etc.
<br/>
<br/>
As a glance on the future, here is what will be in future releases (see also TODOs file):
<br/>
+ SVD disassembler
<br/>
+ Zipped ROM support
<br/>
+ Win32 port using libusb Win32 port
<br/>
+ GTK frontend
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you'll enjoy if2a as much as we did developing it,
<br/>
<br/>

Great news, Vince! Kudos goes to you and spooo.

<br/>
This means that I'll get myself a F2AU for my GBA SP really soon now. :-)

And update is available (0.91) on the usual site : <a class="postlink" href="http://if2a.free.fr" target="_blank">http://if2a.free.fr</a>. It corrects problems with USB timeouts that were set too short hence causing write failures on FLASH.

Some work still has to be done for ultra support. I can't help much since I've only PRO carts.
<br/>
Anyway, as Vince said somewhere, there's a libusb port for win32. We'll try to compile if2a one of these days and check if the port would be easy.
<br/>
Feel free to try (using cygwin or mingw).
<br/>
It's been reported that if2a could compile and run nicely under freebsd and libusb (using a ezusb2131/fxload equivalent  that we must get for win32 too).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<div class="post">
    <h4>#32532 - Vince - Thu Dec 23, 2004 5:17 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys,
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there definetely gonna be a Win32 port of if2a. As you correctly stated, PW is really limited in its features and can lead to unrecoverable carts. This is one of the best examples of where free software can shine. This would also dramatically increase our audience as lots of people use Win32 for their GBA work.
<br/>
<br/>
As spooo correctly mentioned, there is a win32 port of libusb that we plan to use with Cygwin to produce a full win32 app without any source change (hopefully). Of course, we won't be able to use the ez2131 module as it operates under kernel mode but this should be fine with fxload as it operates purely with libusb (note that I may be wrong as it's spooo who did all the USB 2.6 work of if2a. The basics were laid down in f2a by Uli Recht.)
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, do not hesitate to try and compile if2a against the cygwin lib with the win32 port of libusb. This would really speed up the whole porting process.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
<br/>

However [I know this is not the place to discuss about this :-] I already tried using mingw and I have basic problems with read() not returning the good value (the number of bytes read). Using cygwin with -mno-cygwin gives the same weirdness. I'll try to play with #includes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Version 0.94 (and 0.94.1 bugfix) have been released. Find it on <a href="http://if2a.free.fr." target="_blank">http://if2a.free.fr.</a>
<br/>
They add dynamic ROM insertion :  just tell if2a the ROMS you want to add and it will manage to find holes in the cart for you. This can be used to not rewrite the full cart in case you simply want to change a few ROMS.
<br/>
<br/>
Pogoshell is also packaged as the default loader for Pro carts.
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy (and report bugs, thank you).
