    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I plan to buy a Game Boy Micro 20th Anniversary Edition and buy either the EZ-Flash III 2Gb or the G6 Flash 3rd Generation 2Gb. Which should I buy? I don't need any DS functionality. 
<br/>
<br/>
      My main problem with the g6 is its ugly loader and my main problem with the EZ3 is the annoyance of flashing from nand to nor (or the other way, I don't remember). If I get an EZ3, will I have to transfer the game manually, then open it, causing me to deal with a couple annoying extra screens, or will i be able to just click on one of the roms in the big section and it will move it and open it for me?
<br/>
<br/>
      What should I do? I sort of want to buy very soon. Thanks a lot!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Say I have a bunch of 8MB roms in my 1 Gb section. What are the precise movements for playing them (at realtime speed)? Do I just click and automatically it copies them to the faster 256Mb section, then opens them? or do I have to copy it myself, then navigate through various folders in order to play? The latter process sounds very annoying and less preferable to the general ugliness of the GUI of the G6.

So what's the word, bros? If you know anything, feel like IMing me at dblot (aol style)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
