    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
Just a quick question, does Pogoshell (2 beta) work well, if so, better than Power Writer?
<br/>
<br/>
I've not used Pogoshell before, just read about it and seems to be very good.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good question, and I'd like to know the answer too. I'm planning on buying a Flash2Advance Ultra 256M with the GB-Bridge. I know Flash2Advance works better with PogoShell and GB/GBC ROMs (with the GB-Bridge) than the EZ-Flash Advance, but the EZ-Flash Advance has the real-time clock in it. I also know that the Flash2Advance Ultra now has a real-time clock built into it. What I would like to know is if the Flash2Advance Ultra also works with PogoShell and the GB-Bridge to play GB/GBC ROMs (and which GB-Bridge works with it). If it does, it looks like it would be the best all-around card for me. And I hope it does, because I am sick of finding cards that do one thing but not the other.<br/>_________________<br/>"Amp up and amplify! Defy!
