    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hopefully I've put this in the right area.  I have the standard 256mb Flash2Advance cart (and the USB Linker) and I've noticed in some games (such as Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga,  The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap, and also with the Phantasy Star Collection... there are probably more games) that you can't save your games, no matter what.  You'll get a Write error or something similar.  I've even tried flashing the cart with ONLY one game.  I was wondering if anybody knew of a way around this, and why it's happening.  I'm thinking that it may have to do with the size of the savegame, that the games have a funky place to store the savegames, but I don't know much when it comes to ROMS and the like.
