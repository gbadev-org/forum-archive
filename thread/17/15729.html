    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I just got a new DSTT to replace my broken EZ-Flash V, and it's working excellently so far, but there's one thing that's been nagging at me. When you turn on the DS with the DSTT inserted, it jumps right into running the DSTT menu, bypassing the built-in DS firmware menu entirely, regardless of what your autostart settings are or whether you're holding START or what have you. I've got FlashMe, but I'm told this happens on the stock firmware as well. There is, apparently, no way to turn this off, nor is there any way to launch the DSTT if you somehow do find your way into the firmware menu.

Now, I sort of like this behavior, but my only question is how did they do this? I didn't think this was possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you find your way into the system menu, that means the DS couldn't read the card. Most often, this happens due to a dirty card edge connector. Unfortunately, DS cards have plastic teeth separating the contacts, so <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/nes/clean/" target="_blank">the normal cleaning method</a> won't work.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Actually, I was referring to a special .nds that you can get that'll dump you back into the firmware menu (on Yasu's site, I think?), but you can't go back to the DSTT from there (even though you were there before). Yeah, it must be a weird header or something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
