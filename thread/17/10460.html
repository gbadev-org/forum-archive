    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there. Brand new here, firt post :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I want to get my mits on homebrew. Just bought a SuperCard mini-SD/SuperKey package for my DS along with 512 Mb Mini-SD. Works fine.
<br/>
<br/>
If I download a homebrew file like racing23.gba from this site, I have to patch it thru a small utility provided with my Supercard device to make it runable on my Superkey'ed DS. But well, the utility says that this rom cannot be patched. Testing on emulator is fine, testing with the real hardware is far much better :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Anybody could help me with this issue ?
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think Game Boy Advance homebrew needs to be patched unless it needs to save. And with GBA homebrew you don't use the SuperKey; that's just for homebrew that runs in Nintendo DS mode (both screens, touch screen, possibly the 3D chip).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

If I put the .gba on the mini-SD, the homebrew .gba does not run either. I just get the Gameboy Advance trailer, then nothing happens.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If the GBA homebrew boots in an emulator, but doesn't work on hardware, check to see if the Nintendo banner is displayed on the 'GAME BOY' "whoosh" screen. If it isn't displayed, the Nintendo header may be missing from the .gba file.
<br/>
<br/>
You say nothing happens when you don't have the Superkey inserted... that's strange. 'Nothing' happening is very strange behavior for a DS with no alterations done to it. :) All the Superkey would do is allow you to use the Supercard in NDS mode. If you use the DS menu, and select 'Play GBA Game', you can use the Supercard in GBA mode. You can launch GBA games from the Supercard in <span style="font-style: italic">either</span> mode.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum.

I discovered this afternoon that I was able to path the headers from the gba files. Some are now working, some don't however.
<br/>
<br/>
I am able to run my own homebrewed files on the DS, I'm happy with it :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, when I say 'nothing', I tell that DS is booting but then since there is nothing in the DS port and the only thing inserted in GBA port is a supercard with the mini-SD in it, the game won't boot.
<br/>
<br/>
Hummm, there are several games on the mini-SD already. Will test it with only one burned on it. Might work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If the superkey is not inserted, I got DS boot then no menu. DS does not see Supercard with its mini-SD.
<br/>
<br/>
Since I have Superkey inserted, I don't have the standard DS menu anymore .
<br/>
<br/>
I get Superkey boot then games list menu displayed, showing roms burned into the mini-SD.
<br/>
<br/>
Some GBA games run (like Arkanoid conversion), some don't (like racer23 found here). When I select this rom for example, I get the GB trailer, then black or white screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Very strange behavior. Do you have your DS on automatic boot or manual boot? What does it say at the bottom when you boot with the Supercard without the Superkey, while holding the Start button? "There is no Game Pak inserted"?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
