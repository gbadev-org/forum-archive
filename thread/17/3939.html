    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm having a problem with an xg flash writer.  I cannot write anything.  The cart is hardly ever detected, and if it is, it is detected only momentarily.  Does anyone know how to fix this?  Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had a similar problem with my EZF Advance, it worked fine in my cobalt SP but when I traded it in to get the Classic NES style it no longer worked. (I actually returned it as defective and got another one which also didn't work). I found out that the EZFA has an issue where sometimes the pins don't make enough contact in some GBA's, I remedied my problem by taking a small piece of paper, folding it in half and slipping between the back of the cart and the board and now it connects every time. Not sure this is the same issue but may be worth a try.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
