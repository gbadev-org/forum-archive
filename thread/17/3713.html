    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As a gameboy developer, and as a musician, I am very interested in what the gameboy hardware is capable of musically. I'd like to see what I can do with the thing, but the GBA (especially SP) has terrible speakers. It seems that the best speakers are on the original brick sized gameboys, but I can't find flash carts for them anywhere. Does anyone know where I can still get them?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Visit the link found on the main page of this site, the advertisement on the left for XROM, then scroll down the page.  At the time I checked, it was the last item, a 64M flash cart with the gameboy emerger for $109.

The GB E-Merger is a tool to backup and program GameBoy games. Multiple games can be stored into one single 64M Card, and it works with GB, GB Pocket &amp; GB Color! </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I imagine you can also homebrew your own apps/games and load them on, but I could be wrong 'cause I've never used this system.  Does that help? ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I saw that JUST after I posted this question, so I kind of feel like a dumbass. Does anyone know of any other availiable linkers? I found a bunch of stuff by this Bung company, but it doesn't look like their stuff is made anymore. Is there anywhere where you can still find their product or another company's product?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try this: <ul><li>Get a stereo or a pair of amplified speakers. </li><li>Get adapters from your GBA, SP, or GameCube to your stereo's in ports. </li><li>Get <a class="postlink" href="http://synk.at/krawall/" target="_blank">Krawall</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.apex-designs.net/tools_aas.html" target="_blank">AAS</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pidelipom.com/boyscout/" target="_blank">Boyscout</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/gsm/" target="_blank">GSM Player</a>, or some other GBA music player. </li><li>Get a flash cart. </li><li>Compose music for the format that your music player demands. </li><li>Build a ROM and put it on your flash cart. </li><li>Put the cart in your system and listen. </li></ul> I personally use GSM Player with my GBA and a pair of clip-on-ear headphones from Walgreens ($8).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
