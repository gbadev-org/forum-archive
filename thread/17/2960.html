    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am thinking of buying a Flash2Advance ULTRA 256MB version. However, before making the purchase, I would like some feedback from actual owners of this unit.
<br/>
<br/>
If you own one of these, could you please post your experience with this. 
<br/>
<br/>
-- Do all games (that you have tried) work with this ?
<br/>
-- Does this cart work with the GC GameBoy player (I know it *should* but I want to know if anyone actually have tried it) ?
<br/>
-- Does PogoShell work with this ?
<br/>
-- Finally, does the two "save anytime" buttons on the cart work as promised ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much in advance for ANY feedback !!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i bought it at lan-kwei.com, it is already arrived, but still at the customs authority, i will get it tomorrow (at least i hope so). I already tried today, i took the train to the next city, then i walked through half the city searching for their building and then i was told it's somewhere outside the city area... well, i am kinda annoyed now by german authorities... but i think the shop itself is good, though they didn't tell me that i need to pay value added tax (though this is obvious if you import, but in germany we have 16% tax!!! That's an extra 30?)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>

I am writing pogoshell to the rom right now (20mb rom, so it takes some seconds :)), already writing 22 seconds (like 10% now :/)... well, i will eat something while it's writing :)
<br/>
<br/>
I like the splash screen that shows up on the GBA when you write a rom, really stylish!! Though i am still wondering about the info that's shown there (there should be percentage information on the screen...).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, after rebooting my PC i found out that i can't start as long as the f2a is connected to my usb port, i got to connect it after i boot up and then install it again to make it work... maybe that's just an odd driver problem and only specific to my PC, but it ticks me off :)
<br/>
<br/>
I think i email them today...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
You just have to select the pogoshell rom (the 64kb one) as gba bootfile (config menu)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>
