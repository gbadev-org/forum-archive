    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have an ez-flash2 powerstar.  Why can't I put a .gba, or .gbc game on it and have it work?  I really don't understand this because if i put a real gbc cartridge in the gba it will work.  I wasn't sure about that when i wrote it but I just tested it with ZeldaDX and it does work and is in color.  What is the difference between loading the info off the ZeldaDX cart and loading the same info off a ZeldaDX rom on the ezflash?  I have read alot of posts about emulation but really is this an emulation issue?  I mean if something needs emulated it must be something about the cart itself right the gba has plenty of processor power to run GBC games.

thanks

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GBC and GBA carts use different voltages and different wire protocols on the Game Pak connector. Interlocks in the CPU prevent running GBA programs with GBC wire protocol or vice versa. If you want to run GBC programs on your GBA, then get a GBC flash cart and a GBC flash linker, and everything will Just Work(tm).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok so this would have to be a change made at a hardware level but i can't believe the guys who make the flash carts don't put a switch on the cart that can flip it to gbc mode and if they could make a hardware switch they could probably make a software one where you like reboot the gba from a menu inside in gbc mode....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, you do have the [url=http://www.success-hk.com/pp/item_detail.asp?itemID={DE5F7A24-1EFD-494B-932E-3A37430BDDBD}#]GB Bridge[/url]...
<br/>
I dont think a software switch would work as the GBA 'knows' if the cart in the unit is an AGB or CGB/DMG cartridge. If I remember correctly the CGB/DMG carts push a switch when they are inserted making the GBA go into CGB/DMG mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is a physical switch in the cart slot which is pressed by GB/GBC games and not by GBA games; this is why GBA games have small cutouts in two corners. You would have to have some way of pressing or not pressing the switch, or else modify your GBA to have a seperate manual switch; you would need a second switch on the flashcart to turn on and off the bridge circuitry as well.
<br/>
<br/>
In general it's not worth it; get an old GBC flashcart if you can, or get one of the carts that works with the GB Bridge, or just use one of the mono GB emulators (they're apparently quite fast now) and don't play GBC games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
