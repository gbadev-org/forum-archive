Yes. It means you can start homebrew with one piece of hardware, even if you don't gain resistance to (rare) brickers.

Yes; otherwise, you won't be able to run GBA homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You don't -need- a slot-2 device, no, but like Tepples said, that's the only way to gain GBA compatibility.  A popular option is to get a slot-1 device like the R4 combined with the slot-2 EZ-V 3in1 expansion pack, which gives you GBA functionality for about $20 extra.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
