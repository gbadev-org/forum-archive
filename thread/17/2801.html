    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi All, 
<br/>
<br/>
I?m completely new to using the Flash2Advance card. I bought me a 256M FlashCard and even managed to install the F2A Power Writer; now I wrote some .gba files on the FlashCard, all fine up to now.
<br/>
<br/>
If I want to "format" the FlashCard or "delete" all/certain files on it, I don?t find any clue how to do exactly that. Is there a "hidden feature" to solve my problem? Do I have to press certain buttons to get in some kind of "debug mode" or sth.? Do I need a certain program to reach my goal?
<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if someone could help me out of my misery...
<br/>
<br/>
thx a lot :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You shouldn't take my word for it 'cause I'm just as new to this as you are and I'm gonna order my first flash card (F2A) this week. Do you have the new F2A Ultra? 'Cause if you do, I heard that there is no current way to erase/format the card, only to write over the existing files. If you have the regular F2A, it shouldn't be a problem though, with older versions of the software anyway (or so I've read). Hopefully someone will help us out here.<br/>_________________<br/>"Amp up and amplify! Defy! I'm a brother with a furious mind!"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can always "format" a GBA flash cart by overwriting it with a blank ROM. Find a relatively small homebrew ROM, use a pad program to extend it to 32 MBytes with 0xFF bytes, and then write a few copies of it to the flash cart. Find all the tools you need to do this in the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#tod" target="_blank">TOD distribution</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
