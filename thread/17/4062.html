    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">this is like the only program to use for flashing gbaroms to my xrom. i have to use this version cause its the only one w/ full support...
<br/>
<br/>
I had this program running fine, but i come back a few days later (i dont think ive installed anything new on the computer) and whenever i open littlewriter it creates the multiboot, makes that server thingy, lists my games, and then it gets to backing up sram and an error box pops up... 
<br/>
<br/>
i uploaded the pic of the error to my webspace at tripod... go here
