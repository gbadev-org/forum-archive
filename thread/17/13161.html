    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I'd like to start saying I'm very, very new to DS modding (As in just found out it was possible via these forums a few days ago) and by apologizing for asking such a question, but I've searched the forums over and over and I haven't yet found a post that answers it.
<br/>
<br/>
What I'm wondering is why the R4DS card (or something similar) is necessary to have homebrew UI's or games playable on the DS... I don't understand why just simply putting a card in slot 1 and selecting it from the DS menu won't launch it into the UI. If anyone could clear this up for me, I'd appreciate it :)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: And is the R4DS some kind of card expansion that fits into slot 1, and then the microSD card fits into the R4 card? That's how I understand it...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yup
<br/>
<br/>
you use the R4 to hold the Micro SD card
<br/>
<br/>
the R4 OS then supercedes the DS's OS and allows you to run homebrew and [yarr]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow.. I think that is the simplest way I have ever seen it said.  If you are happy with that answer, then it is correct.  But there is a little more technical detail behind it.  The reason you can't just plug any card into the DS it just work is becuase of the handshaking done between the card and the DS to make sure it is a liscensed Nintendo game.  The Slot-1 devices these days have that handshake built in.
<br/>
<br/>
So, as long as the device in Slot-1 is able to pretend to be a liscensed DS game card, you can run code from it.  It doesn't have to be a media adapter like the R4DS, M3 Simply, SuperCard One, etc.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
