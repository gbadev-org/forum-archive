    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just installed the software for the linker by following the few steps that were part of the instructions. I then opened the software wanting to add a rom. First I think I must tell you that I have a green light on the cart. Once I open the software I hit the search button. It finds the cart and tells me. 256M EFA:.ROM left:0.00MBits.RAM left:2048KBits. So when trying to add a rom it tells me that there isn't enough space. Take note that this is the first time that I have hooked it up. So I see a button called Format Card. Well when I hit that button the software crashes. I don't know if maybe my driver is messed up or if the cart is bad. I also tried this setup on another machine as well and have the same issue. Has anyone else had this problem? If so what did you do?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i bought the same card a few days ago, worked fine right away. tho i did click format card before i did anything (this is a good idea to do with any storage medium that you can do it to, before  first use).
