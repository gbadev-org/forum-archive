    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, so I'm in need for a fatlib-compliant storage device for the GBA. I need support for writing, and SD/CF sounds like the most feasible solution to me.
<br/>
<br/>
Price is not a big issue, I'm looking for something with a long-ish life span.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo DS support isn't a must-have (I already have a DSX), but I would like to be able to use it as a RAM-expansion for the DS when/if some homebrew use it. I guess compatibility is my biggest issue ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions? :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You'll need a slot-2 device with RAM then.  The main three products in this field, in order of lowest to highest price, are the Supercard, M3, and G6.  
<br/>
The Supercard and M3 come in various sizes.  From largest to smallest, they are CF, SD, miniSD, and microSD (which only fits in a DS Lite, though the M3 Lite comes with an adapter to fit into the Phat).
<br/>
<br/>
With one of these, you will need a passthrough device as well.  A NoPass type device is recommended, like the Max Media Launcher, Superkey, or Passcard 3.  You can also use the Action Replay DS as a NoPass if you don't wish to order one online.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What's the practical difference between these? Slim-fit with the DS Lite is a plus as long as it still works with a GBA. What about fatlib support? What devices are proven stable and what has had the most reports of issues?

Don't think so. As stated, I already have a ds-x for NDS-stuff. I suspect that I can use RAM expansion together with the ds-x...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The drivers for compact-flash based cards are generally more stable than the SD based ones, although the gap has narrowed significantly. Anything designed for the DS Lite Slot-2 won't fit in a normal GBA without modifying the case.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
