    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can somebody please tell me where could I find information on how to backup/load a 128Mbit file in a F2AUltra 128Mbit card?
<br/>
<br/>
I am using F2APower Writer 2.20 and everytime I try to back up a 128Mbit file I get the falowing error: The file you're trying to backup exceed the maximun size of the card, so it can't be back up(in my own words). If anybody know the way around this or know where can I get the answer please let me know.
<br/>
<br/>
...so far I think I gone be force to buy a 256Mb card....

<br/>
Thanks in advance to the savvy one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
the loader menu is probably 32KB, which will put you over the limit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1) El Problema.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The first diagnose (16,777,216) that you indentified is the problem because for some reason f2apw2.30 doesn't acept a 128Mbit file if your card size is 128Mbits and you have chosen to let the program know that the size of the card is 128Mbit (in the Preset Capacity Option that range from 64M-1G). Also for some odd reasons the developres of PW2.20 have decided to make the fallowing Options in the [Config] menu Uncheckable: [Fix Data] and [Cut 32K](I guess this options are a must in this version/PW2.20). I used no Multyloader like you recommended.
<br/>
<br/>
2) La Solution.
<br/>
<br/>
This is what I did in order to find the solution to this problem.
<br/>
After trying most of the F2APW programs and failing to write the  
<br/>
16,777,216 bytes file. I had no option but to try a much older version of the witer tool design for the F2A -none- Ultra called Flash2Advance Writer 3.1 Win9x/Me/NT/2000/XP (28-07-2003) after trying some of the diffrent tips that I got from you guys I was able to write the file in the (...it  didn't have any problem recognizing my card automatically and allowing me to place the 128Mbit file in the menu so I could flash it) f2aUltr_128Mbit_Card by check marking the fallowing 
<br/>
[Options] : [Fix Data] and [Cut 32K].
<br/>
<br/>
I guess that all PW version for the F2AUltr are pure bugs and the only thing nice about it, is the photoshoped Interface. The rest is a nightmare in which you are the hunted.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you guys once again and of course to the Gbadev Team/Community for making this possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
