<br/>
<br/>
If you didn't know or haven't done already, contact the seller and ask him for the software. If that doesn't work, mention to him that he has posted on his auction that he has said the unit will come with software, since it hasn't, that's misadvertisement(false advertising) and you can report it to eBay about that. I have done it before and they take such matters seriously.
<br/>
<br/>
I have looked at the picture and that looks like the EZ-Flash set. I was going to purchase one like that.
<br/>
<br/>
For comparison, go to;
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.linker4u.com/pp/item_detail.asp?itemID=" target="_blank">http://www.linker4u.com/pp/item_detail.asp?itemID=</a>{F7732E8A-DE5F-401F-81DF-29793809ED30}
<br/>
<br/>
I'd say that's it.
<br/>
<br/>
On that page there is also software, drivers and an operation guide for that set. The official site is <a href="http://www.ezfadvance.com." target="_blank">www.ezfadvance.com.</a> You're most likely to get all you need for your set there.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
