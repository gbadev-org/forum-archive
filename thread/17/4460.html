    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought this quite a while ago, and it worked great in windows ME.  Then I upgraded to XP, and it hasn't worked since.  I currently have XP with SP2.  Windows notices that I plugged it in, and then asks for the drivers.  I am using the latest drivers I could find ([<span style="font-weight: bold">URL deleted by MOD - warez links</span>] 1.08) and windows says that there are no driver files for my device in the path specified.  I did unzip them and even tried manually instalilng them (moved them where they should be, then right-click install on the inf file) and that didn't work either.  Tried manually editing the inf file (thought I saw typos in it, but now think that I was wrong).  I can't figure it out.
<br/>
Also, I tried using it in parallel mode and couldn't get it to work either (windows didn't recognize it, so I didn't install drivers or anything... couldn't figure that one out...).  After trying it in parallel mode, when I plug it in through usb, it gets no power :(.  I have to use the ac adapter, but that I can fix (you can only have 2 devices powered by usb at a time, and I think I have 2 like that already, if not it might be requesting too much power, so I'll just plug all the junk into the wall that I can instead of running off of USB power or unplug shtuff that I am not using at the time).
<br/>
if anybody has any pointers on how to get this to work, I'd really appreciate it.  Tonight I am going to try loading the drivers off of the cd, but I kinda doubt that that will work...
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">in parallel mode, you shouldn't need any drivers for the device. Just plug it in, and try using the link software in parallel mode. I am not sure how the software operates, but it should have some setting somewhere, where you can change it to parallel mode. 
<br/>
<br/>
You may need to change the type of your parallel port in your BIOS settings, not sure exactly which is the best (there are different settings like EPP ECP or something, try each one if you can't get it to work at first).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok...  Will try that.  I was using littlewriter for writing in parallel mode.  Is this not a good idea?  From what I can tell the software that comes with it doesn't support parallel mode (visoly Xtremelink).  I have ver 1.20 installed and it doesn't support it anyways...  But I will try the EPP, ECP, etc settings in the bios and see if that makes a diff...
<br/>
thanks for the info :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
