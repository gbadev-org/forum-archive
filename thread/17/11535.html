    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was doing some searches last night and came across something called the "DMC Card" that supposedly has the same functionality as a Supercard.  Anybody heard of it or own one? I'm probobly going to buy one unless its like another GBAMP. :p It does have flash memory so it can't be all that bad right? Check it out its only 35$ shipped

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have tried these flash cartridges (not the DMC card), and they worked well for me.  All the programs I've written work with them, and all the others I've tested except  Luminesweeper and 2004 Mbit worked too.  Anyone have an idea why those two would not work?
<br/>
<br/>
I was actually considering seeing if people wanted to place a group order for these 128 megabit cartridges.  They seem perfect for sharing demos with friends, giving as gifts, etc.  If there are enough interested people, I will coordinate an order - the cost would be less than $10 each.
<br/>
<br/>
The cartridges have 512 kilobytes of SRAM, and you load games onto the cartridge with PC software through the GBA link port.  The software includes a multi-game menu so you can put more than one game on a cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone interested in ordering?  If so, we should place an order within the next few weeks so it arrives in time for the holidays.  If you want to check to see if your game works with these cartridges, you can email it to me and I'll test it.  Just PM me with your email address or a link to your game.  Note: I will not test commercial roms for you - only homebrew.

<br/>
I did use Xboo Communicator and SendSave to backup the SRAM of these cartridges with the included parallel linker, so that makes me think that maybe an xboo cable would work for flashing these cartridges.  I'll take a closer look at the cable and compare to the xboo schematic.
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't have a GBA, you can pick one up at your local game shop for about $25, and you can probably find one even cheaper on ebay.
<br/>

If someone wants to mail me some alternative flashing hardware, I'd be willing to test it out to see if it works with these cartridges.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I figured out why Luminesweeper and 2004Mbit didn't work - there was a problem with the header on both of them that I fixed by running gbafix.exe on them, and now they both work fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Some people have asked me how programs are written to these cartridges - here's how it is done:
<br/>
<br/>
First you must put your PC's parallel port into EPP (Extended Parallel Port) mode - this is done through the BIOS settings.  The software does not work in any other mode.
<br/>
Plug one end of the supplied cable into the parallel port and plug the other end into a GBA or GBA SP.
<br/>
Insert the flash cartridge into the GBA or GBA SP, hold start + select, and turn the GBA or GBA SP on.
<br/>
Use the software to transfer your program or programs to the cartridge - I'll submit the software to be placed in the tools/transfer section of gbadev.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Does the software work under Windows 2000 and Windows XP? Does it need a special parallel port driver? I seem to remember parallel flashing software that was designed only for MS-DOS or only for Windows 98.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I understand these are 16 MB flash cards, and you can load programs using parallel port.

is loading through usb possible?

are these better than supercard (which seems to be not accurate all the time)?

But are these carts blessed? The first time I sat down with the game on one of these carts for longer than 15 seconds, I beat Luminesweeper game left (defined as score &gt;= 999999).

<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://gggddfdgju.googlepages.com/" target="_blank">http://gggddfdgju.googlepages.com/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Multiboot is possible using the included cable and <a class="postlink" href="http://devkitpro.org/downloads.shtml" target="_blank">xboo communicator</a>
<br/>
<br/>
If you only burn one game to the cartridge, the multi-game menu is not loaded.  This means that they can be used for the DS, as long as you have a GBA to do the burning.  The burning software loads the multi-game menu automatically when you burn more than one game.  All the homebrew I have tried works fine on these cartridges, as long as the header is valid.
<br/>
<br/>
I have about 10 of these cartridges left, and a few linker cables - send me a PM if you want to buy them from me.
<br/>
<br/>
They were purchased from a Hong Kong distributor who only does wholesale.

<br/>
If you would like me to order some more, send me a PM with the quantity that you want.  When the quantity gets large enough (over 100) I will order them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unfortunately, the supplier does not have 256 megabit cartridges, only 128 and 512.  The 512Mb cartridges require a USB linker, which costs a little bit more.  Here are the prices:

USB linker for 512Mb cartridge - $10 each

<br/>
1) Get a copy of the menu with bankswitching code.
<br/>
2) Run in an emulator, record invalid writes to GBA cart addresses. Also record reads if necessary.
<br/>
3) Look for pattern in reads/writes.
<br/>
This may not work if the code expects a reply from the hardware, so:
<br/>
4) Record address of code that does read/write to GBA cart
<br/>
5) Disassemble any code near that point, and possibly any called / calling functions.
<br/>
6) This part is hard to explain. It usually involves reading through the code and tracing it while writing down "best guess" labels for functions / data.
<br/>
7) Convert results to C code.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

Is it your own application? If so, someone with first-hand experience and knowledge about the actual cart might have more info on this than me. I feel pretty confident that it should work, the question is how much effort has to be spent to make it work. A lot of carts have known bank-switching sequences, so if you're lucky these ones does as well. Best thing though, is to keep the application under 32MB, but that might now be an option.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I haven't actually tested it, but I see no reason why it shouldn't work. it can change rom banks and sram banks, but apparently the loader doesn't think my little demos use sram, so I think it left it at the default sram bank. my cart is the 128mbit one with the splink software.

<br/>
rom bank = 0x03FF = last bank on 128mbit cart
<br/>
0xFE0000 - 0xFFFFFF on flash chip
<br/>
<br/>
the ram banks are split into 32KB chunks. bit12 must be set (0x1000) I don't know why. bit7 specifies a 32KB bank (0x80) I assume it mirrors any higher address reads.
<br/>
ram bank = 0x1000 = first 64KB bank
<br/>
ram bank = 0x1002 = second 64KB bank
<br/>
ram bank = 0x1004 = third 64KB bank
<br/>
<br/>
ram bank = 0x1080 = first 32KB bank
<br/>
ram bank = 0x1081 = second 32KB bank
<br/>
ram bank = 0x1082 = third 32KB bank
<br/>
<br/>
they overlap so if you do for some reason want 32/64 to fit on the same sram, you just mix and match, taking into account a 64KB bank takes up 2 banks, do this:
<br/>
ram bank = 0x1080 = 32KB
<br/>
ram bank = 0x1001 = 64KB
<br/>
ram bank = 0x1003 = 64KB
<br/>
ram bank = 0x1085 = 32KB
<br/>
<br/>
ram bank = 0x107D = last 64KB
<br/>
ram bank = 0x10FE = last 32KB
<br/>
<br/>
it looks like there's 4MB (megabytes) of sram!
<br/>
<br/>
both series have the same unlock sequence (4 writes to 2 addresses.) the rom bank and ram bank address are back to back. the smallest rom bank the writer would make was 0x20000 bytes (128KB) but looking at the values maybe it can go smaller (visolys would do 32KB banks.) I would guess the 0xF0F0 write locks in your rom/ram bank settings, and the final write is very curious. 0x00FF to the first byte on the cart is usually a setting for flash chips to set them to read only mode. so if this unlock sequence really unlocks the cart, you could just use jeff frohwein's flinker (it's got source code) to write the chip from the gba. and the dead loop at the end I assume is just for a delay to allow the cart to do its thing. it is probably neccessary, don't let your compiler optimize it out.

so a 'bank' is like a window into some location of ram/rom on the flashcard, and your sequence changes where that window 'points' to in physical ram; whereas the window is always at the same address, right?
<br/>
So couldnt programs that use external ram not simply check whether the right bank is chosen, and if not simply switch it. Like that they could emulate access to the whole 128mbit, no?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
most of the following was pieced together from different code from different sites covering amd, atmel, spansion (?) and other crap. most chips have the same basis for flashing, but this one took a little trial and error to get working right. the closest thing I found would be <a class="postlink" href="http://www.honestar.com/Data_fuji/FLASH/MB29LV800BE-70/MBM29LV800BE-70.pdf" target="_blank">MBM29LV800</a> data sheet. it appears to be an identical command set (listed as byte, still uses 16bit reads/writes) HOWEVER when writing to the address 0xAAA you get nothing, you must write to 0xAAAA and you'll be good. I believe this card is sold as "AnyU", "AnyC", and/or "Super FC."

anyone got a 512 cart they could run some code on? I can email you a binary that spits out relevant info on the card (4 bytes) or just fire off the ReadID routine on your cart. the tmp variable is needed for the loops, when writing the cart it just keeps reading until it reads the value it put there. a timeout could be added to these routines otherwise they'll freeze if the cart is removed or some other error happens.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not in this case, it's actually another boot menu.. there's 3 bootloaders for the ANYC/U 32Mbit-&gt;256Mbit.. the modified RBasic, the "Jukebox", and the "Yarrrrr.. cart" menu.

No, I played a little around with phoneymikes code, and bankswitching
<br/>
seems to work, cartridge info only on non programmed 128 MB cartridges,
<br/>
but erasing is not working, I didn't try programming yet.
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose there is some 'unlock' code needed yet to set the cartridges
<br/>
into programmable mode (as e.g. SetVisolyFlashRWMode() in Jeff Frohweins FLinker).
<br/>
I also tried cartlib from Jeff Frohwein <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devrs.com/gba/files/flgba.zip" target="_blank">GBA FLinker v1.72</a>,
<br/>
and had no luck either.

<br/>
<br/>
Was wondering the Manuf/Device returned on these cards when using cartlib.c?  I got 1C:B9 for mine.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't own a GBA, nor a parallel port, but it came with the same parallel port linker.  I've not programmed in awhile (and never for nds/gba), but I am hoping that tftpds can be modified to work with the card I have so I can program it (via wifi at that!).  Before I found this thread I did some tests last night.  The NonTurboFAEraseBlocks worked without error - the preflashed FIREEMBLEM8.GBA is gone, but I got write errors of course using NonTurboFAWrite's.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to try the posted code tonight.  I've heard my card works with SPLINK, so I'd imagine it's the same routines even if the hardware looks different from the picture.  PCB reads 'SZcard ver.1' on lower-right corner.

Thought it'd be a good deal and great way to share homebrew...  Hopefully it is once I get a way to flash it.

Happen to know which flash rom is on it?  Mine is SZcard ver. 1 and it has M6MGD137 W66CKT.  Can't find data sheet.  I think the normal intel erase routines worked, so I was trying these other write routines but I'm uncertain if they've been working since it'd end up stopping somewheres...

hah. thanks, but i think i finally got it!  i never found anything about that silly flash chip! i found this post and decided to try to write a program to flash it myself using the NDS.  i think i finally figured it out!  i never tried started without phonymike's post.  thanks!
<br/>
<br/>
does that code that phonymike posted work on the M6MGD137 devices though?  is it tested with SZcard ver.3?  it didn't work for me, but like i said, it got me started.
<br/>
<br/>
here's my findings:
<br/>
after hours of google i found something that may be similar to the M6MGD137 -- <a href="http://pdfdata.datasheetsite.com/web/54538/MX28F640C3T.pdf" target="_blank">http://pdfdata.datasheetsite.com/web/54538/MX28F640C3T.pdf</a>
<br/>
<br/>
after messing with that for awhile and seeing that the pre-flashed GBA game is gone, i got excited but things still weren't working out.
<br/>
<br/>
using the routines in this data sheet -- locked sectors can be written to, and there is no need to erase a block.
<br/>
<br/>
so the only thing ya need is a write routine, which does work from this data sheet.  the manuf code returns 0x90 (uh, that's the code i wrote to 0x8000000 to try to read the manuf code though, so i wouldn't trust it)
<br/>

I do have a test rom, it's dated about three months ago (look at the rom with a hex editor ;) and you can get it <a class="postlink" href="http://files-upload.com/files/550254/Flash%20Test.zip" target="_blank">here</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?2bxmycicwdl" target="_blank">here</a>. when flashed to all of my carts, it displays "7E1200 08". once you see the number on screen, you can remove the cart and insert another. all my visoly cards reboot the gba but these anyu or whatever carts don't for me, I can hot swap them all day and the number will update, you only need to flash one cart. now if the cart ID read routine doesn't work on your cart, I guess you'll see "00A3BE AE" or any sort of other numbers that are more than just 1 or 2 off from the 4 I posted. the 7E1200 is device id 0, 1, and 2. the 08 is id 3, it apparently doesn't mean anything, but I display it just because it shows up. the manuf id is 04 for Fujitsu so I didn't bother showing it.
<br/>
<br/>
now here's the killer. when I made the C code from the assembly, I broke down the commands to only what it takes to run on my cart. please don't be mad, I thought the chinese hackers or whoever were up to their old tricks. with other various datasheets on similar chips, I created this code that runs great for me. so if you look at all the addresses and values written, they're mostly 0xAAAA, 0x5555, 0x800AAAA, 0x8015554. also 0x555, 0xAAA. so these values work for me, however isn't exactly what's in the original code. like the ADDR_PROGRAM define might actually be 0xAAAA instead of 0xAAA, so I figured the pirates were trying to hide their code. some addresses were 0x8015544 but work fine for me as 0x8015554 and they all match and are all pretty and shit. I'll go through it again and make a direct port, I also think timing may be an issue, again they had little loops after certain commands to waste time, the use of volatile would be very helpful for this as ps2aich pointed out to me *smacks forehead* you guys want the raw asm code?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try using GBA_BUS instead of (u16 *)0x8000000. eg:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">GBA_BUS[0] = 0x40;

<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
GBA_BUS is defined as volatile, perhaps without it, the CPU is caching the data you are reading from the status register, and thus it stays in the 'not ready' mode for much longer than it should. Plus as a bonus you get rid of a few evil magic numbers :)
<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe instead of checking for the ready bit, you could try reading the data back, and make sure it matches? I dunno how these things work.
<br/>

I'll time SPLINK tonight, it's not all that fast, but it definately finishes in less than 15 hours...I think it takes a couple minutes for a 2MB file, if I remember correctly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

just back from weekend out-of-state. i finally got a rom to load. gbaldr's bootGBA isn't working for me, but restart my NDS and it boots normal from there... it uses the last page of SRAM to hold loader data.  my chip is 2Mbit, or 256K. and I have no info on any bank switching, ...

<br/>
first!! make sure to change the blocksize used in flash.c, search for Block_Erase.  the important part is the blocks are 0x10000 in length, not 0x40000. (why didn't they use the LEN define, der?)

262 Kbps (32 KiB/s) is pretty much the fastest stable speed for GBA serial port communicating over a cable in "normal" (GBC) mode, so 31 KiB/s is about right. (The GBA serial port can go faster than that for directly attached devices.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

thanks. i checked it out, used the same routines as posted by mike, but the banks were all jacked up and didn't work for me.  using phonymike's #s worked for me though.  did my gbaldr bin work on your card?  Mine is SZcard ver.1, is yours a different version?

i wrote 16M exact in 270sec = 60KB/sec, but just before was ~15M at 283sec = 55KB/sec.  so the in-system programming is useful for a nearly double speed gain :D
<br/>
<br/>
tftpds, my original intended program to modify, comes with a small gbamenu.  i edited it, and then padded it to 64kB.  then i just did a copy /b gbamenu.rom+rom1.gba+rom2.gba+rom3.gba multiboot.gba.  the result is a working menu, but it scans memory for ROMs, so they show up 2-4 times a piece due to size, and mirroring.  this is great tho. i did not touch SRAM stuff yet, but i'm certain it'll do well.
<br/>
<br/>
so now the question is, how to put multi-rom burning into a small screen interface? no way i'm doing windows style drag &amp; drop! heh. i don't think gbaldr's UI will do well.  i'm thinking something like <a class="postlink" href="http://i23.tinypic.com/29zqu79.png" target="_blank">this image</a> that i hacked up really quick in mspaint. layout-wise i think it's rather functional. of course i may require assistance at making it visually ... tolerable... ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Then have it where you can press L to change selection from files on slot1, to roms on slot2, allowing you to see their info, adding an "SRAM slot/size" to the info box, and the buttons available to the right would be: (A)Launch, (B)Erase..., (X)Write SRAM to file, (Y)Write file to SRAM.
<br/>
<br/>
Buttons would be just 4 hard-coded areas so touchscreen would be feasible for even myself! :P
<br/>
<br/>
That all ought to keep me busy learning graphics stuff for awhile... :)
<br/>
<br/>
Think it's a bit overkill?  I'm just doing it for the learning experience... I've a good bit of free time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But for some reason with my 128mbit test file, it wont do anything...i press A to select then A to write, and it instantly says "Done writing". Perhaps some bug, when the gba file is exactly equal to the cart size?

Also, if i look up the gba slot connector, I see "SZcard. ver. 3" printed on the lower right of the PCB.

EDIT: Actually...after writing two files, it no longer works. Now it always hangs at 'Writing SRAM 0%'...which is odd, since I don't even want to write SRAM, I want to write the NOR

Are they still $9 a piece? Let me know how I should send you payment. You can email me directly, PM me, or whatever.

If you're gonna buy so many, might be better to get them direct, save a couple $ per cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So KeithE is making a couple dollars profit per cart? Very nice margins. I don't know how we'd be able to get them direct. KeithE probably doesn't want to let you know of his supplier if he's making so much profit on this product. KeithE might give you a volume discount, though.

I'm not planning to place any more orders for GBA cartridges any time in the near future. The supplier that I was using has not been responding to my emails, and I'm not planning to search for a new supplier. It was fun while it lasted...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Right now, the cheapest thing I can find on most shops seems to be this:
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Retailer link removed...rules etc - MOD</span> -- which claims that it works as a standalone gba flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anybody used that thing to know if it works nicely as a basic gba flash cart, even though it has all that fancy DS functionality in it as well?
<br/>
<br/>
Or has anybody found a cheaper source for gba flash carts?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">&lt;rant&gt;Well mods, thanks for changing my message in a way where it's suddenly a pointless message, but there's no indicator that anybody had posted after me, so I was waiting for a response without realizing that it had been changed.     
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, are these rules actually posted anywhere other than the DS forums?  I don't do DS development, so I don't read those forums.  If these rules are going to be enforced across the whole board, they should probably be posted somewhere that obviously applies to the whole thing.
<br/>
<br/>
About retailer links: the rules in the DS forum just as clearly state that mods should replace links to retailers with links to the retailer feedback section, but that didn't happen...&lt;/rant&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
That being said, in answer to my own question, there is a store that sells gba flash carts for cheap:
