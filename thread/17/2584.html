Well, the gba just shut down :P. Just kidding.
<br/>
I'm using the EZF Advance but I think the behavior will be pretty similiar because the architecture seems to be very close (despite the 1.8v memory chip and other things... I'm almost jealous :P). You don't have to worry about your saves: they are stored in the hardware (the cart), no matter if the gba runs out of battery.

Good question... uhm, you know I'm talking about my experience with a flash cart that it's not the same as yours, anyway, the most common thing is that the flash cart it's recharging while it's plug in the writer and this to the computer. 
<br/>
<br/>
Draining power of the gba? Sure, but I don't think it's used to recharging, just needed to run normaly.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think you have to worry so much about the flash cart's battery, because it  is well design to have a long an productive life.
<br/>
<br/>
You can also ask to the company who sold you the cart. They will know much more things than me.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for my English and have a happy new year.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All carts I know of charge the lithium battery from both the GBA power and the cart writer. The battery is charged whenever the cart is powered up.
<br/>
I must however say that EZ carts in general have a bit of a flaw regarding the battery. The battery only lasts for months between charges, while a regular non-rechargeable battery lasts for many years.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
