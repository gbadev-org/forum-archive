    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd say get the F2A 256 Mbit cart.  It has the greatest compatibility with hardware (the USB linker is supposed to work fine with the GBA SP, and the cart works even with the older Visoly linkers) and software (PogoShell works best with carts that implement the Visoly hardware interface, such as the F2A 256 Mbit).
<br/>
<br/>
As for music files, the 8ad player should work with any flash cart.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
