    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I had bought an EZ Flash kart from Binarygame.com over a month ago.  I had not recieved anything and now I can no longer log onto their site.  They never answer my emails.  I have lost $200. 
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else have any experience with Binarygame.com?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
