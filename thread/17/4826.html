    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This event just recently occured with my F2A USB Liker
<br/>
<br/>
- Every time I plug the linker in any USB slot its recognized as "USB DEVICE " only
<br/>
<br/>
- F2A drivers ( official &amp; Hacked ) will not recognize the hardware
<br/>
<br/>
- When checked under properties in the System Console i see that the pid of the device is recognized but it still does not pick up the drivers
<br/>
<br/>
- I am running Win XP SP2. I have tested the drivers on both the on-board usb 1.1 ports and  PCI USB 2.0 card ports ( same results )
<br/>
<br/>
All 3 computers I tested the linker on show the same prob, 1 of the computers had never had the device connected to it until I plugged it in today...same problem
<br/>
<br/>
Someone had mentioned that I may need to "reflash" the F2A USB dongle...anyone had any success?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
your cable is broken. Try to replace it.
<br/>
<br/>
After the cable was found from you system, you have to install a driver. If the windows-installer will not start itself, you have a problem with the cable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">*Update*
<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to flash the firmware on the f2a usb linker, its a matter of trickery though...
<br/>
<br/>
i downloaded a "bix" file and ran a program through linux to flash the "cypress" chip.
<br/>
<br/>
Apparently in some fasion the f2a linker always flashes the chip before forwarding information to the GBA flashcard...
<br/>
<br/>
Ill be posting a tutotial soon
<br/>
<br/>
for more info check out <a href="http://www.keil.com," target="_blank">www.keil.com,</a> they refer to the ez-usb linker as an experimental usb board....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
The whole purpose of the F2A USB linker chips is to be hot-reconfigurable. This means the chip enumerates as AN2131 from Cypress (name of the chip) with endpoint 0 available. Firmware is then downloaded to the chip with a special command (0xa IIRC), which then resets and renumerates as the new device. Perfect for development and firmware upgrades. The chip is based on an 80C51 core. Coresponding free software compiler is SDCC.
<br/>
<br/>
The firmware is downloaded in the chip's RAM by Linux utilities such as fxload (kernel versions &gt;2.4.19) and/or ez2131 kernel module (&lt;2.4.19).
<br/>
<br/>
Spooo and I wrote if2a the f2a/f2a ultra free software linker. Take a look at the site at <a href="http://if2a.free.fr." target="_blank">http://if2a.free.fr.</a> The 'real' new site is under XHTML/CSS2 validation atm and should be up and running this week.
<br/>
The sources are available under the GNU GPL. They explain everything:) See also the PROTOCOL file describing the entire f2a/f2a Ultra protocol. Please help development if you can (at least by testing and reporting bugs). Thanks.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got basically exactly the same problem as NOX_Kerbanker does in his first post, and I'm using exactly the set up.
<br/>
<br/>
My scenario goes pretty much the same apart from after I've tried to install drivers (I've used the ones which came with the CD, plus the new updated drivers) the windows installer, 'Found New Hardware Wizard', does start automatically when I plug in the USB. And it's recognized as 'USB Device' and also 'Flash2Advance Power Writer'. So I don't know what's happening there.
<br/>
<br/>
Power Writer gives the same old USB error message aswell. I had the USB connected when I installed the drivers, both with and without the GBA attached.
<br/>
<br/>
I've only got one other USB driver installed I think, which is my ADSL modem. I'm new to all this so I have no idea what Vince just said, although I gather that if I'm running windows XP, if2a ultra won't work, and it won't fix my driver problems.
<br/>
<br/>
I spent around 10 hours trying to get this to work yesterday when I got it. I'd really, really, appreciate the help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
The problem may come from your USB ADSL modem. Try uninstalling it and see whether the situation improves.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I certainly would try what you suggested, but this isn't technically my computer so uninstalling the modem could cause problems. I could re-install it afterwards but the CD that it came on was an installation-for-idiots package which installs everything needed for broadband on the computer in one go without letting you pick and choose what it actually installs. Plus I can't find any sort of .exe setup file on the CD under drivers which would suggest that I could just install the driver again.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have another machine which I could try to install the driver on either, so I'm kind of up shit creek without a paddle. 
<br/>
<br/>
But thanks for your help anyway. It's appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
