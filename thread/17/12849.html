    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you use this f2a usb cable? this is based on this ULA driver (on PC side).
<br/>
<br/>
ULA uploads firmware for this 8051 based USB chip. maybe here is a problem windows side (registry or such shit). delete this USB driver and reinstall it. normally ULA should work after this.
<br/>
<br/>
does it go wrong since beginning or does it work fine formerly? did you install ULA properly?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
you need local admin rights on your PC and you have to press Sel+Start while turning on GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A flash cart (at least a F2A one) is not like a USB thumb drive, so you can't simply delete files on the cart.  You can hide them from the menu using the delete option, but if you want to actually free up the space you'll need to reflash the whole cart.  This is a trade-off of NOR-based media, but I found it relatively easy to work around, though I bought a 1 Gbit card, so it was easier to deal with since I usually had a good amount of extra space at the end for additions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">okay done that now im going to be real dumb again, i added a couple of new roms on to the cart they copied on just fine, an it goes as far as the gameboy start screen then freezes im guesing i also deleted the game select screen or what ever it may be called, so do i need to add a file to stop it from freezing at the first screen?thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A lot of GBA homebrew games/demos (especially those from a few years back) require that you add a proper header to the rom for them to start. If you run them from the flash cart menu though, and depending on how they are run from the menu, this might not be needed however.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Your lack of punctuation makes the meaning of your post unclear. Do they freeze <span style="font-style: italic">at</span> the "GAME BOY" screen with a corrupted Nintendo logo at the bottom (in which case SimonB's explanation is correct), or do they freeze at a white screen <span style="font-style: italic">just after</span> the "GAME BOY" screen disappears?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sorry its hard to explain as i dont know the correct terms, when i got the cart it had a couple of games/roms on it virua tennis and something else and a load of old nes games. When i switched the game boy on after the game boy screen a select menu came up with the games listed and you just picked the game of your choice.
<br/>
<br/>
I then delected everthing on the cart and added a couple of my roms i had saved these were not homebrew games or demos but games that can be brought they worked fine before i completly deleted everthing now they dont.
<br/>
<br/>
When i power up the GB console the gameboy logo appears after the little sound it makes the logo then freezes with the logo still on the screen and this is as far as anything goes?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Please don't discuss commercial piracy on GbAdev.  In any case, does the same thing happen when flashing only one file to the cart?  You might need to manually flash the multi booter program to the card in order to have more than one file on the cart at a time.  I believe for regular F2A carts you can use loader3.3, available in the downloads section of <a href="http://flash2advanceultra.tk" target="_blank">http://flash2advanceultra.tk</a>
<br/>
<br/>
You could also consider using Pogoshell if you want to flash only 1 file at a time to the cart, as it packages many different files into a single GBA binary.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
