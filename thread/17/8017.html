    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was thinking that it would be handy to have a battery backup on the SRAM in my supercard, because then I wouldn't have to continually write the SRAM file whenever I wanted to do homebrew on my DS (yes, I could flash my DS, I know).  Has anyone had a go at this?
