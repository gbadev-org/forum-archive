    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It seems like the new version of the soft doesn't support ripping ROMs yet.
<br/>
Get the old F2A linker soft from <a href="http://www.flash2advance.com" target="_blank">www.flash2advance.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
