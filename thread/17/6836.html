    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had it working. it worked fine. then after I got e19 my pocket nes ang goomba don't load the roms right. when i select a rom it dousn't go to the menu it just plays a glitchy version of the rom. and when i select pocket nes or goomba themselves it goes to a glitched screen and does nothing. when i use the menu creator programs and select those roms it goes to a white screen. music,vids,e-books,and pictures work fine. can anybody help me?
