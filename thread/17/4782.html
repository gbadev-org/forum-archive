    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently got 2 flash carts and I've been trying to make backups of some of the games I've bought simply because it would be much easier to lug around 2 carts than 10. I also seem to do more playing at work than at home which is part of the reason.
<br/>
<br/>
I bought the EZF Advance 256 and the EZF II Powerstar 1 Gig. I find that when I use the EZFA to backup my comm carts, it shows the correct ROM size for the cart, but for the memory is always shows it as 0k. Theres also the fact that it wont let me pick between EEPROM, SRAM, or Flash. When I use the EZII PS it backs up all games as 128Mbit ROMS and the save games as 64k SRAM.
<br/>
<br/>
I can find plenty of info online on using flash carts, but nothing when you're actually trying to make a backup of games you already own! Any help and info you can provide me with as far as making backups will be greatly appreciated. Also with making backups of the saves.
<br/>
Thanks in advance...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
