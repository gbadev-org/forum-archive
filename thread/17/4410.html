    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. I recently got robbed. One of the items was my GBA SP... and my flash card was in it at the time... I've been trying to find another one with no luck. It seems as though the Flash2Advance 256M has been discontinued. Does anyone know where I could find one (F2A 256)? Thanks.<br/>_________________<br/>"Amp up and amplify! Defy! I'm a brother with a furious mind!"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
