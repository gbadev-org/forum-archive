    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would like to eventually buy a cable AND a rewritable rom cartridge, but I cannot afford the cart at the moment.  Is there a cable I could buy now that would let me back up carts now and work with a flash cart later when I can get one?  
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

Check out the nocash xboo cable, it is very cheap.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
and use it to write to f2a (etc..?) carts. Price 29.00$. Or just get the [url=http://www.success-hk.com/pp/item_detail.asp?itemID={05B30AD5-A5C4-4265-A25E-BD3C120B549E}]f2a with a 64mbit cart[/url] for 60$...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The F2A USB cable I have can dump a rom, but 99% of the time it's bad - plus it takes longer to read back than to flash which is a bit whacky.
<br/>
<br/>
Infact I remember dumping Mario Kart several times, on two different SP's and one regular GBA, and tried reseating the cart and cleaning the contacts, and it came out right once.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
