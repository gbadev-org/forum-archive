EZF- Advance 128M Flash Card Set or Flash2Advance 128M Ram Set
<br/>

My brother asked me to get him either one of those for christmas and I seriously have no idea what's the difference and which one is better. Actually I have no idea what they do, but my brother wants it, so what can I do :)
<br/>
<br/>
I've scimmed through the forum and it seems like both have TON of troubles! So in your honest opinion, wich one would you choose?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I chose the EZF-Advance because it is a supposedly simple product and it has RTC (RealTime Clock) built-in, which will support games that require it.
<br/>
<br/>
... however, a new flash card just appeared and your brother may not have heard about it yet:

This is where the name Power Star comes from. The new meory chip saves about 60% energy so giving you more time to play on the same battery charge! Becouse the battery consumption of the card is redced by more than  half you can play ~5 hours longer than you would using other cards!</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
