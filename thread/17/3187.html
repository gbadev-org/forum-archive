<br/>
<br/>
I have sum (sum????? understatement!!!) probs with my new card and its writer software. Been waiting for the 2.0 writer to come out and fix me problems but it doesnt....
<br/>
When i start the writer software it DOES NOT list the roms that are on the card and therefore i can not add one rom or remove just one or two, i have to re-write the whole card again.
<br/>
Also when i add roms to the list in the writer software it doesnt show the right name of the rom on the right side of the writer-software screen.
<br/>
AND i can not import-export lists in this new version of the writer software.
<br/>
Are there any people here that have the same card and if so, are you having probs too ???
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it's just because you wrote your topic in upper case...
<br/>
<br/>
You don't have to rewrite the whole card again (it won't overwrite the other roms if you only upload a small one).
<br/>
<br/>
The software and the drivers are a little bit buggy, but that's how it is, there is no better software around and for me the bugs really don't count. I am able to flash my roms to the cart and run them, what more do we need?
<br/>
<br/>
The export/import list function doesn't work in the new release, i wonder why...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">erhm,sorry bout the uppercase all!!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx for the confirmation Lupin.
<br/>
Im with you on that one, the card does work indeed. 
<br/>
Now since im kinda new to gba and flashing i assumed it was me doing something wrong.... not this time,pfffffffff, thats a first ;-)
<br/>
Is it just a matter of waiting for better drivers and software to 'pop up' when there are more people using these ULTRA cards?? 
<br/>
Tx again for both the uppercase tip and gba info!!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yap, i think we have to wait for new drivers (I hope they will ever finish a stable version :)).
<br/>
<br/>
Well, when i put the flash linker into my keyboards usb port (i can use the keyboard as some kind of USB hub) my PC will just crash, therefor i think that the hardware itself is not that stable (it's build whacky, it's japanese (or chinese or taiwanese or whatever) quality work :P).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok.  So I have trasfered .sav data to the sram, and it all seemed to work.  Pogoshell indeed... is the shit.  Now I want to add some stuff but first I must transfer the .sav files of the gba to my HD.  Using F2A_3.1 is crashing whenever I try to write the save.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a tutorial or anything for this process.  Perhaps someone has the time to write down a step for step?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi
<br/>
Im as noob as it gets to the whole rom cart scene but do have an F2A Ultra with the USB flasher.
<br/>
I`ve got the same prob as Kastef (and everyone else at the moment) in that I can`t use saves.
<br/>
I`ve read around the forums a bit and dowloaded pogoshell but 
<br/>
<br/>
a. don`t know what to do with it and 
<br/>
<br/>
b. am shit scared incase I f&amp;$k things up.
<br/>
<br/>
Kastef's request for a tut on pogoshell is something I whole heartily agree with.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
