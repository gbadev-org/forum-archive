    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone tried these two different devices, and compared them? I know the F2A can use the Smart Wallet for a lot more storage, but the EZ-F unit has a Real-Time Clock and calendar features, and can boast up to 512Mb storage, and supposably is much easier to download. I'm mainly asking about any pros and cons people have had with these two devices. I'm leaning into getting the EZ-F kit because of it's extra features, but there isn't Smart Wallet support.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

PogoShell's support for Visoly-type flash carts such as the F2A is much more mature than its support for EZFlash-type carts.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
