    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just bought a  EFA Linker 256 from kicktrading, to use with my Nintendo DS, for gba development (and ds development as soon as I can get a pass thru). It installed fine, and the linker program on my PC recognizes it, and allows me to load GBA demos &amp; homebrew games onto it, but when I put it into my DS, the DS always comes up as if there were no cart inserted, saying "There is no Game Pak inserted". If I connect the cart back to my PC, it shows the games are still on there and everything is fine. I followed all the directions, including 'charging' it overnight connected to my turned-on PC, before I used it.
<br/>
<br/>
I will have a chance tomorrow to try it on my little brother's GBA, so I can see if it works at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any ideas on things I can try? I tried inserting it into the DS many many different ways (inserted only 99%, only 95%, only 90%, etc, the right side slightly more in the the left, and vice versa)
<br/>
<br/>
thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think you should format the card frist if it still doesn't work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I tested my efa in a gba sp and it doesn't work. my friend's efa256 does work in my ds, so after exhausting all options, it seems to be defective. kicktrading.ca has been very helpful, and offered to replace it, so I will be sending it to them for replacement.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
