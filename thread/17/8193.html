    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright I'm really new to this flash cart thing so I got a two questions since I plan to buy one for my NDS. To be more precise, I only want to buy the GBA flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
1. I have the red DS with MKDS bundle so I know I have the new firmware so Passkey1 or Passme1 whatever it is doesn't work. I want to play only play .gba games from the GBA flash cart. Will I need the that Passkey/Passme to play them?
<br/>
<br/>
2. There's a snesDS program available that converts SNES roms to .gba or if you use the .bat file that comes with it, it converts it to .nds. I plan on only using the .gba filetype. Will the button mapping and everything else be the same as if it were a .nds file?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To run GBA homebrew, you will only need a GBA flash cart and a flash cart writer. (Some GBA flash carts use a GBA, GBA SP, or Game Boy Player as a writer; if all you have is a DS, avoid those.)

You will need a Nintendo DS with PassMe2 to run this, but the button mapping should be the same as it is on the Super NES. There was an effort to emulate the Super NES on the GBA, but it was halted when the limitations of the GBA hardware got in the way.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
