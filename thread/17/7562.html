    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I need a cheap GBA flash cart, (talking sub-$100 here) that I can write to without the GBA serial port. 
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is, I have a DS, and I sold my GBA SP, but I still want to program for the GBA, so, I need a reliable, solid, cart, that's cheap and works with my DS. <span style="font-weight: bold">I DO NOT WANT TO RUN DS SOFTWARE</span>, I just want my GBA flash cart to work like it should.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance, you guys rock.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Your existing GBA flash cart should work in the Nintendo DS, provided that it fits. Which make and model is it? And have you cleaned its metal contacts with rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
