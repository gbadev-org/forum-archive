    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
today my shiny F2A 128M USB cart arrived. *Of course* I now have the first problem. I'm using the cart under Linux and tried writing with f2a and if2a from <a href="http://deyv.free.fr/gba/f2a/" target="_blank">http://deyv.free.fr/gba/f2a/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Writing itself works like a charm. The GBA SP shows the progress and then it says it is "Ready". Now I disconnect the USB linker and try to run a ROM. The GBA loader 3.2 screen comes up and lets me select any of the games or demos I wrote. I press "A" and that's it. The GBA seems to just hang there in a freeze. 
<br/>
<br/>
I tried several gba files, mostly some demos and games, for example the Compo stuff, but nevertheless nothing would boot. I cannot test writing with a Windows machine for the next 2 days, but I fear that the card just might be defect?
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have an idea what might be wrong here? 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot for any help.
<br/>
<br/>
ciao,
<br/>

It also happens with the supplied F2A Writer under Windows 98. So it's not Linux-specific at all. If I only burn one Rom without the GBA Loader, the GBA hangs at the Gamboy logo. 
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.
