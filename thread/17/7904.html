<br/>
<br/>
First of all, a Merry Xmas and happy newyear for all!!
<br/>
<br/>
A few months ago I bought myself an EZF advance USB linker with flash card. After a few troubles I got it working on XP, but since I am quite a Linux freak, I want to start using it on linux.
<br/>
<br/>
I sniffed the output of the USB bus on $indows with a shareware usbmonitor. I must say, it's not quite according the multiboot specs what I find.
<br/>
On the EZFA website I found a small picture with the FTDI FT232BM device on it (I think), but are there other ICs used? If not, this cable is a dumb serial terminal and it should be quite easy to write a multiboot implementation for it. However, when I see the monitor output, I fear for the worst...
<br/>
<br/>
--&gt; so, has anyone before opened up his EZF Advance cable? (before I smash mine in bits 'n pieces ;-) ) If you did, would you like to share the information?
<br/>
<br/>
On the EZFA website there are some application notes mentioning a few other modes than serial for the FT232BM (parallel bitbang or JTAG). If we know which other IC's are used (if any?), we could try to reverse engineer it
<br/>
(yeah, real hardcore bit-fucking :-D )
<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,
<br/>
