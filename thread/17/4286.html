    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello to you all,
<br/>
<br/>
I almost finished adding the F2AUltra support on if2a (Linux software). All is working fine except that CIZ, the bootloader of Ultra carts, relies on a 64KB internal block (I called it the "content descriptor") to display cart contents. This means that, even of the ROMS are correctly written to the cart (an they are :), CIZ cannot see nor boot them. Usually, the content descriptor is updated whenever an operation is performed on the cart.
<br/>
<br/>
I studied hexdumps of this block and already found all related fields that have to be filled/written for the content descriptor to be on par with the cart contents. These fields include release list index, saver type, ROM size, active/hidden state, etc. However, sth is still missing : Game IDs.
<br/>
<br/>
Game ID is displayed by CIZ when you press B after having selected a ROM (first line). This ID is used to :
<br/>
1. uniquely identify the game
<br/>
2. locate the game to boot (with other parameters)
<br/>
3. match a compressed save with the corresponding game (CIZ says "Loading:_XXXXXXX", where XXXXX is the game ID when you start a ROM)
<br/>
<br/>
Could sb give me hints on how the flashing software could generate these IDs? I've already tried CRC'ing the ROM and looking in the ROM header, no luck.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help,
<br/>
<br/>

From the tests I did, it seems CRC are involved : to generate GameID, Powerwriter may do a CRC on the ROM header. So my question is : what kind of CRC are used to check ROMs (CRC16, CRC32, etc).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help, the searches I did with keyword crc did not answer this question
