    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I use the EZFlash for my dev stuff and it's served me well, but lately it's begun acting odd sometimes.
<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, once in a while I'll transfer my game to it, and then when I go to boot the cartridge up in the GBA I'll get the "GAMEBOY" animated startup screen, but without the "Nintendo" logo at the bottom. It then locks up.
<br/>
<br/>
If I format the cart and try again, it usually works the second time. This never happened before, though, and it's happening more frequently as of late.
<br/>
<br/>
I've verified the cart's ROM, and it checks out okay.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know what could be causing this?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sometimes I get the same thing with official Game Paks and have been getting it since the days of the 8-bit Nintendo Game Brick in the early 1990s.

<br/>
Problem: GBA isn't reading header from Game Pak
<br/>
Symptom: No "Nintendo" logo or scrambled "Nintendo" logo
<br/>
Cause: Bad connection between GBA and Game Pak
<br/>
Solution 1: Reseat Game Pak in GBA by removing and reinserting it
<br/>
Solution 2: Clean GBA and Game Pak edge connectors with Nintendo's Game Boy Cleaning Kit<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
