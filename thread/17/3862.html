<br/>
<br/>
Ok. One of my first games for gba was legacy of goku and when i saw the opening movie my brain just clicked "they can put movies on this thing!" i told my friends that it would be cool if they started putting movies on the carts. one friend said that i was on crack the other said it was stupid. but now i see that they have been putting shows like spongebob and rugrats on carts and i just wanted to know if we could put our own movies on the flash carts. i sat the gba movie player but it looks too tacky I just wanted to know if you could get a movie on just the car titself like the ones in the stores</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But for the price of two flash cards, you could pick up a portable DVD player at Wal-Mart.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Just keep in mind that GBA carts are usually measured in megaBITS rather than megabytes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
