Personally, I would recommend the following:
<br/>
<br/>
* EZ-Flash II PowerStar (this is new, I don't know if this cart has any issues)
<br/>
* EZFlash Advance (also known as "EZFA" around here. A very simple and solid product)
<br/>
<br/>
From what I've read around here, Flash2Advance seems ok.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The EZFlash Advance seems a very good election. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Berto (Roberto Bouza)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Anyone who is going to buy/has recently (1-2 months) a EZF-Flash Advance cart, please tell what you think of it. Sure anybody can write a review but i want FIRST-hand newbie experience from someone who hasn't dealt with this kind of stuff. 
<br/>
<br/>
I plan on buying one but want to save myself the trouble of begging if it isn't "better" than the Flash2Advance cart.

Thanks a bunch.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
