    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I stumbled on this deal this morning for $15 for the same MSI card that I used to original crack my DS with WIFIME.  Just wanted to pass it on and hopefully help someone out.

I know I've seen some people concerned that they have notebooks with a built-in ethernet that is not compatible so they think that their notebooks are simply not compatible.  This is not true, you can simply pop this card in the side of your notebook and load the special wifime driver and use it for your DS simultaneously while your notebook's internal wifi is available continue to surf the net, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If this card really works, then you have really helped me out geordy!  Especially now that I found a site that has those in stock :P
<br/>
<br/>
That said, I have no idea if this card will fit into my laptop expansion slot. Signs seem to indicate that I have one Type III expansion slot (as there is only one pip to eject a card instead of two for the "two Type II expansion slots").  Would you or anyone happen to know if the linked MSI card is for Type III or II slots?  If not, are there any adapters between the slots?

Please let me know!  Overall I have an IBM Thinkpad R30.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You'll be just fine with an R30.  The pc card slots are stacked together.  When you use a type 3 card, it fills both slots.  When you use a type 2 card, you can use two of them at once.   Order away and you'll be fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
