        <h2>Flash Equipment > card for SP?</h2>
<div id="posts">
<div class="post">
    <h4>#166959 - miamicanes - Tue Feb 24, 2009 10:16 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there any flash card that:
<br/>
<br/>
* is compatible with the SP 
<br/>
<br/>
* directly exposes the 4 GPIO pins to the outside world 
<br/>
<br/>
* Is available for ordering, today, with more or less immediate shipment, from a company that still exists?
<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, are any cartridges likely to be available for $5 or less from Gamestop that will let me easily solder my own wires somewhere to get at those four pins? I can live with XBOO for now... I bought my SP to use as a cheap ARM7 embedded development toy. The only reason I'm looking for flash + i/o at this point is because if I have to order and wait for something, I at least want it to be able to do both. For the sake of instant gratification with something I can buy locally and be playing with tonight, I can live with i/o access alone...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
