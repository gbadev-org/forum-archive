    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ive seen a lot of troubles with the new usb linker for the f2a, well here is something that Im experiencing that I have not seen posted or resolved.  I am using a FlashAdvanceLinker Xtreme, and I am using the USB functionality.  I am using XtremeLink 1.25 with the Visoly USB drivers, and an F2A 256.  I have used this set up with no issues for 4 months.  Recently, and unrelentingly, while attempting to write anything at all to the cart I get to XX% (different each time) when my entire system abrubtly reboots itself.  No error beebs, messages, logs, just straight down and back up again.  I have tried reinstalling drivers, I have gone back down to Xtremelink 1.20 beta, I have taken the linker out of my external hub and put it directly into the motherboard usb hub, all of which show no other signs than totaly abrubt reboot.  Perhaps bart has written a driver for this situation as well?  Or maybe someone has had similar issues that have been resolved?  Please, someone help me here, I cant send anything to my cart!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
