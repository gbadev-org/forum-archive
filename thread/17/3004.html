    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm considering getting the EZF-Advance--or some kind of flash cart--I'm not sure--but I would like to be able to play GB and GBC games. I understand that in order to do that I need either some kind of emulator, like PocketGB, or a F2A cart with a GB Bridge.  My question is: Is an emulator any good? Does it do a descent job? Is it slow? Is it buggy? Would I be better off getting the F2A or F2A Ultra with GB Bridge, or is the software based GB emulator perfectly adequate?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Emulators that run on the GBA don't do GBC mode yet, and their GB mono compatibility is nowhere near perfect.

<br/>
If you want the absolute best performance on GBC games, go get a GBC flash cart. The GB Bridge to F2A carts is reported to work, but I'm not sure that it works on the new F2A Ultra carts.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's good to know... I asked Success-HK and they said the GB-Bridge was compatible with the new F2AU... Oh well, I don't care. I'm getting a regular F2A with the GB-Bridge. The F2AU is too buggy right now.<br/>_________________<br/>"Amp up and amplify! Defy!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It'll probably be impossible to find these days, unless you get it used from some place like eBay or something, but I don't think anyone's selling them. Your best bet is to go with the Flash2Advance 256 USB kit and get the Flash Advance Bridge to go with it. That way, you get the best of both worlds (GB/GBC and GBA).<br/>_________________<br/>"Amp up and amplify! Defy! I'm a brother with a furious mind!"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the info.  It never really occurred to me to just go out and get a GBC flashcart for playing GBC and GB games. It's sort of like "well duh." But, as some of the other posters have pointed out, it's probably a little hard to find something like that these days, and I probably will have to get the F2A with GB Bridge.
<br/>
One other thing, and this would probably be best posted elsewhere but I'll ask it anyway, and post it somewhere else later if I recieve severe lashings and reprimands: What has people's experience been with NES emulators for the GBA?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Recent PocketNES runs just about everything I've thrown at it, including homebrew NES ROMs. It may not work with (J) games that use some obscure mapper or with some games that bankswitch VRAM/VROM mid-scanline (such as Pirates).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
