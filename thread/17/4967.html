    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
Im wondering if there is any way to minimize/shrink a rom file before sending it to a flash card.  As I only have a Flash 2 Advance 128, I can at most fit one large commercial game on it at a time. And as I am new to developing my games, i fear that my first creations will not be efficiently made -- and I will need all the space i can make.  So i have the following questions:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Is there any way to compress the game? 
<br/>
<br/>
I have played a bit with gbadat, and it has a function called "trim".  How does this work?  
<br/>
<br/>
What does it remove?  
<br/>
<br/>
When developing games yourself, whats the biggest size affecting factor to think of/keep track of?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks ! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dont think you will be anywhere close to filling up the whole card. But if you somehow manage to, worry about the compression later.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">16MByte is _alot_ to play around with.
<br/>
My largest creation so far is 1MByte, and it wastes alot of space with unnecessary bitmap graphics and a 300kByte mod tune. You can find it <a class="postlink" href="http://www.brolinembedded.se/projects/kaotik/" target="_blank">here</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is a valid question but in this case I agree with Lynx, that the size of a homebrew project should grow over 128MBit is the least of this guys worries.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
