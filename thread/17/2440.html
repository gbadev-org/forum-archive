    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have previously created small demos such as images being displayed and a sprite moving around the screen. I decided to wipe all the demos out in order to make room (more organization) for my other game I'm creating. I could play my demos just fine however when I went to use the ezf advance client v0.94 beta a3 it started to act weird. it detected the card fine but there was no game list there! I decided to upload something, I thought that might work so I uploaded a &lt; 1 M file to my card but then it wasy saying something like writing 28908% and kept going. I took it off the usb and now the ezf advance doesn't work when I start the GBA up without the cable. I can still load the 'server' type screen you get when you press select and start at the beginning when it's connected to the computer.
<br/>
<br/>
Quick update: It appears it doesn't like me using the cable in my usb hub. However when I load the file I made (draws one triangle on a black background, there is other stuff in the background it's weird! How can I completely flash over my card?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Any reason why you're not using the latest EZFA 0.99 or 0.99b client? 
<br/>
<br/>
You didn't mention 'formatting' the cartridge. Have you tried that? There is a visible button in the EZFA client window that lets you format the cartridge.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I never knew they updated it. I just downloaded it and I used the format button so it's all fixed now. Thanks for brining that to my attention.
<br/>
<br/>
For some reason my main problem was if I attached it to my USB hub it would mess it up completely.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
