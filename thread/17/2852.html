I got it working on my GBA, I messed up my link port though because I spilled some excess solder on the motherboard and the link port just poof stopped working. It does work, I downloaded some test code to it earlier before I got my cart. It works, double check your connections and make sure they are correct. If not post again and I'll try and help<br/>_________________<br/>Hello Everyone :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
