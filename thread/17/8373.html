    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have the SuperCard (SD) and I have tried to convert and upload a video from my computer (encoded in AVI format I think).  After conversion, plays fine on the PC but when I try to play it on my GBA, the picture is all garbled and blocky looking.  I have tried both NDS and GBA options upon converting, same thing for both.  Sound is fine.

<br/>
Also, I'm not sure whether I should choose NDS or GBA, I play it on my DS in GBA mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
