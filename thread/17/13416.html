    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I currently have a DS Lite with a DS-X and an EZ Flash 2 Powerstar.  Everthing works perfect, except the EZ flash sticks out the bottom of my DS (like any normal GBA cart would).  I was looking to replace it with one of the new "Lite" carts I saw which fit exactly like the stock dust cover.  Unfortunately, I have no idea which one to get.  Could you guys please help reccommend a new one?  Here are a few points I've noticed:
<br/>
<br/>
- I do NOT need DS support, as I already have a DS-X.
<br/>
- I would like a "lite" cart that fits exactly as the original dust cover.
<br/>
- I would like GBA support that's as good as my EZ Flash 2 Powerstar.
<br/>
- Having rumble support would be nice (I saw one that said it does rumble and has a Micro SD slot)
<br/>
<br/>
The ones I've found so for are the:
<br/>
"M3 Lite Perfect (MicroSD Version) for Nintendo DS Lite / GBA"
<br/>
<br/>
"G6 Lite 4GBit(512MB) Flash Cart and Passcard 3 combo for Nintendo DS and DS Lite"
<br/>
<br/>
The G6 looks like it has more features, but it comes with a passcard.  Could I still use GBA games if I don't use the passcard?  Is that even the best one to get?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your help and advice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Both should be compatible with the vast majority of GBA homebrew.

Except for one important feature: the ability to add more cheap memory. I can get another 8 Gbit of storage for my microSD based card for well under 20 USD if I look for a few minutes.

Soytainly. Without the passcard, the DS boots up in GBA mode.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Tepples,
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your reply.  What card do you use?  Also...and this may be a stupid question...but do they make any cards that are rumble packs and GBA cards?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Keldon,
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for posting.  The EZ Flash 3in1 looks great.  Are there any disadvantages over the other cartridges?
<br/>

I am located on the East Coast of the US.

Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I use a GBA Movie Player (CF adapter for SLOT-2) and an R4 (microSD adapter for SLOT-1). If you want the equivalent of a G6 with expandable memory, get the M3 Perfect Lite (microSD adapter for SLOT-2 with RAM). If you need another 8 Gbit, just buy a 1 GB (8 bits = 1 byte) microSD card at an office supply store or on an auction site.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
