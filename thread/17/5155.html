    <h4>#37392 - slag - Fri Mar 11, 2005 6:47 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">f2a works perfectly when I burn a single ROM, and probably if I burn
<br/>
multiple ones, although I haven't tried burning more than one at a
<br/>
time yet.  However, I am having loader-related troubles... how would I
<br/>
go about burning a rom to the cart without inserting the loader?
<br/>
<br/>
I assumed that I need to use the -n option; i.e.  "./if2a -W
<br/>
flashme.gba -n" however, whenever the -n option is used, nothing is
<br/>
burned... the splash screen just sits there, with the normal menu
<br/>
output, and "0001" above the text "Ready.  [v2.4b]".  Here is the full
<br/>
output in the console:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
slag@ieatnoobs slag $  sudo ./if2a -W flashme.gba -n
<br/>
<br/>
Please turn OFF then ON your GBA with SELECT and START held down.
<br/>
<br/>
File flashme.gba at address 0x8000000 is:
<br/>
Game Title:     POGOSHELL
<br/>
Game Code:      AGB-flas
<br/>
Maker Code:     01
<br/>
Not the same !
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
At this point the system just sits there.  It doesn't look like
<br/>
anything is trying to be done.  Is -n not the correct option for what
<br/>
I'm trying to accomplish?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to use pogoshell, and pogoshell has it's own load
<br/>
management; if I write flashme.gba to the cartridge without using the
<br/>
-n option, I have to use pogoshell's loader on TOP of the default
<br/>
loader, which causes all sorts of problems within pogoshell.  Any
<br/>
suggestions on what to do?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Could you try with 0.93-pre0 (see <a href="http://if2a.free.fr" target="_blank">http://if2a.free.fr</a> ) and see whether your problem is still here? If I recall correctly, it was fixed during development of that release.
