Don't buy EFA. I can't even write roms to it. The program crashes whenever I try to open the rom into the program. This is ridiculous. I tried my desktop and notebook no luck on both of'em. A lot of problems on the comparison chart isn't joke after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What version of Windows have you tested, and what happens when you don't connect the cart, click Search, and then try to add a ROM (should work until it says not enough space when trying to open)?
<br/>
<br/>
There's still some things to check, but it does seem probable that the cart is faulty. Still a few things to rule out though.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It should say "Not enough space for this ROM.", without crashing. Basically, I'm trying to make sure that your client only crashes with the cart plugged in.

Yeah it is to hard to test everything a retailer ships out. I think you're just a little buggered, but I'm sure you can see that it's too much to expect retailers to open and test everything before it ships. You'd be paying quite a premium if they were really doing that.
<br/>
<br/>
Faulty electronic equipment happens. They throw out Pentium 4's by the hundreds, it happens with flash memory too. Every once in a while a faulty one slips by, or a bad bump during shipping breaks a lose connection.
<br/>
<br/>
If Kicktrading makes sure to test the next one they are sending you, they are going the extra mile. If you think this was a big waste of time and money then you haven't spent much time trying to make software and hardware work.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, I guess you are right. But from the point of a buyer, should we worry about the vendors situation? Personally, I don't care how they do it, I just pay my hard earned money to get what they offer based on their own description. It means when I order something from them I expect to get exactly that something from them. It's simple. I ordered it, didn't get what I ordered, so I get angry. I'm not a person who is as kind-hearted as you are. Well, I guess it makes me a bad guy. And it seems as thou almost everyone in this board are on their vendors or makers side disregarding the fact that EFA is quite unreliable with all those h/w defects.. I don't know.

<br/>
<br/>
It's not being kind hearted, it's understanding basic economics. They get items and they mark them up, say 20%. So a $80 cart costs $96. From that $16 margin they must pay their employees and warehouse utilities/taxes. Maybe 5 employees actually deal with a given product, from unpacking, storing, retrieving, packing, to shipping. From that $16 about $15 is spent on the item, leaving $1 of profit. These are fictional figures, but they are somewhat close and should give you a basic idea of how retail works.
<br/>
<br/>
Now if they were to actually TEST everything they shipped, it would cost another $12 for this item, more for some. They'd have to allocate space and resources for a testing lab, and they'd spend more on materials to repack said items. You can see that $1 profit margin go out the window, and see the price marked up another $15 each. This retailer is now out of business as 95% of their customers refuse to pay 15% more for stuff that already works 99.9% of the time.
<br/>
<br/>
Some people would be very unhappy with unwrapped items too, as 90% of retail goods are sealed in some way, especially electronics.
<br/>
<br/>
It makes much more sense to lose $100 replacing a defective item for about 1% of all sales. So for every $1,000 they profit, the end up cutting out 10% to satisfy the 1% of customers who were unlucky enough to receive a bad item. Often enough it wasn't their fault at all, just bad shipping or a faulty item to begin with.
<br/>
<br/>
I am NOT being kind. This is how a store works.

<br/>
<br/>
All those h/w defects? Show me one other instance of a defective EFA cart? If you can do that, show me another? You seem to think that everything you ever buy should be in mint condition and work perfectly. Truth is, the EFA carts are favored because they are relatively fast and inexpensive. They certainly have their faults (GUI only client)...but generally they are good carts. Don't mistake "trying to help someone" for being "on their vendors side," but it makes sense for people to defend brands they have good experience with.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, I noticed your post in the Retailer Feedback forum. That's three bad ones we've seen from Kicktrading. I got 2 good ones off Jandaman... so it's either the retailer or the manufacturer.
<br/>
<br/>
Considering josath's problems in addition to bedrone's, I'd say it's the manufacturer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">FourScience, you are missing the whole point. My point is the satisfaction when we purchase something from retailers. I don't care how hard retailers work their everyday chores or how they are going extra miles to impress their customers. I sent an email to them 3days ago requesting for a new cart to be sent to me right after I send back the defective cart. All at the same time because I don't want to wait another 20+ days. And I still haven't received any replies from them. I don't trust them anymore. maybe I look like a whinning sorry ass to you but I have my reasons. 
<br/>
<br/>
I don't really understand why you sound so upset. Do you think I'm lying that I received a faulty cart? or maybe you think getting a defect is rare so it should be forgiven? What is your suggestions? should I just shut up and be thankfull that they are going to test a new cart and ship it after they receive my return? I asked for a help and I get all that basics of economic crap from a guy who have two perfectly working EFAs. This is just great.

Hey FourScience, I like you because you tried to help me and I honor that. But please don't go beyond that. It doesn't work and it will never do.
