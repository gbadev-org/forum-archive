    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, some of you may be aware I inadvertently posted in the "beginners" forum which, in retrospect, seemed to be the wrong choice
<br/>
<br/>
I'd be grateful for any help you could offer, as I can't seem to get this device working at all and there appears to be no aftermarket support.
<br/>
<br/>
PARALLEL PORT
<br/>
The device hangs off the PC's parallel port and allows the downloading of code directly into either the GBA memory or flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
So far I've been into my BIOS and set the parallel port to type SPP in accordance with the FAQ
<br/>
<br/>
Also, in WinXP SP2, I've been into the device manager and told the port to use IRQ 7
<br/>
<br/>
SOFTWARE APPLICATION - NO HARDWARE FOUND!
<br/>
When I've tried to use the app that cmoes with the Multiboot - which needs to be used from the command prompt, it informs me it can't any hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
Reading the FAQ, its told me that in order to get direct access to the parallel port, I should use a program like Direct IO or Give IO or Userport. Once installed these permit access to the port. I've tried all these to no avail. At least it doesn't say NO HARDWARE FOUND anymore, but the GBA isn't responding at all.
<br/>
<br/>
CONCLUSION
<br/>
If anyone can offer me any advice to get the device working, then please let me know.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I shoudl buy an alternative superior device which uses the USB ports on a PC. Any suggestions would be welcome.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all,
<br/>

Try heavily increasing the waitstates.  You can't do anything without adding waitstates.  Try 10000, then try decreasing the number until it still works.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks, I'll try that.
<br/>
<br/>
How long does it take to transfer a small program from the PC directly to the GBA's memory ? eg. how long should I wait to see if it works ?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I assume I just plug the cable into the GBA then turn it on. The GBA boots up as normal. I then try and send the program to it. Is this correct ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
On my PC, I can use as few as 10 waitstates, but your results may vary.
<br/>
<br/>
The USB Flash linker cables are much faster than the MBV2 cable, but the MBV2 seems to be much more durable.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Can you tell me, did you turn off your parallel port in the windows xp device manager ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I set mine to EPP mode in the bios, left it on in the device manager, and made sure to properly install userport.  Try re-installing userport.
<br/>
I have had full success, even while running a PSX-&gt;Parallel adapter driver in the background on the same port, swap out the MBV2, plug in the joystick, no driver problems ever.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I've tried all that - in fact I tried userport, direct IO and give IO and none of them give me a response on the GBA
<br/>
<br/>
Makes me think the MBV2 is faulty.
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Is there any diagnostic I can use to test if the MBV2 is working ok ?
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Does MB.EXE say anything once you've sent the file to the GBA ? When I try it, it says nothing and gives me the next command prompt &gt;
<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, its a GBA "SP" - this should make no difference ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I ran Win98 SE under emulation in VMWare Workstation so that prooves the MBV2 works.
<br/>
<br/>
Now all I need to do is get userport working in my WinXP Sp2
<br/>
<br/>
When installaing userport, I'm putting userport.sys (the driver) into the windows/system32/drivers folder
<br/>
<br/>
then I put the userport.exe into the windows folder
<br/>
<br/>
I set user port to the address range 378 - 37F
<br/>
<br/>
Do I set up any memory range or IRQ ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
