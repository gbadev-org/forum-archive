    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently stumbled across this web site and was hoping someone would be able to link me to a functional, easy-to-use GBA Flash Cart that I could write homebrew games to. I'm quite new to homebrew and flash carts, so I was hoping I could find some help here. I've seen several such as the ELink, EZ Flash III, etc, but I'm having difficulty finding any retailers or sellers, or reliable reviews/tutorials of any sort. 
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone recommend a specific Flash Cart and a link to a reliable seller?
<br/>
<br/>
extra details:
<br/>
- MUST WORK WITH GAME BOY MICRO
<br/>
- Will ONLY be used in a Game Boy Micro - no DS or DS Lite shenanigans
<br/>
- Doesn't have to be large - I only want to put one or two games on it at a time
<br/>
- Relatively easy - I'd rather not have to learn any complex methods to write ROMs to it, but I will if I must
<br/>
- I'd prefer a cheap card (no more than $50 USD)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
