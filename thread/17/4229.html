    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I there, I'm trying to get myself into GBA development, since kdevelop has the hability to compil GBA stuff.

<br/>
I bought a XROM at easybuy2000 because it look to be a nice quality card. however it only comes with windows software. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to have more information to know if there is any software that works with most cardridge, including the XROM. I've heard each cadridge have their own software and you can't really swap them.
<br/>
<br/>
any of you has any success with XROM under Linux ?
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
There is no known program to use XROM carts under Linux. However, there is one for MacOSX and since it uses libusb (IIRC) it should be portable... Do a search on the forum and you'll find it.
<br/>
<br/>
The flashing software on Linux is called if2a and supports F2A Pro and F2A Turbo carts. I am in the process of adapting it to Ultra carts. After that, I may look into other carts as well...
<br/>
<br/>
As well, as said Tepples, use an emulator first, it will save you hundreds of hours.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,
<br/>
<br/>
