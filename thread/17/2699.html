    <h4>#15203 - gamecaptor - Sun Jan 18, 2004 11:57 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am using the Flash2Advance Parallel port version with the 256 MB NON-ULTRA card, running Windows XP Pro.
<br/>
<br/>
I installed the v1.0 of the F2APowerWriter software. After the initial install, it requested to install DriverLINX driver. When attempting to install, it reported an error stating it could not copy the DLPortIO.SYS and DLPortIO.DLL to the C:\Windows\System32 directory. It says to make sure those two files are in the same directory as the application itself (which I verfied they are). I also copied those two files to the C:\Windows\System32 for good measure. After starting the application and attempting to actually write/backup anything I receive an error stating:
<br/>
DLPortIO.SYS device driver not loaded.
<br/>
Port I/O will have no effect.
<br/>
<br/>
I verfied that my configuration was setup for the Parallel Port verison and configured correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
I have no issues with the older v3.1 software.
<br/>
<br/>
Any advice you could provide would be appreacted.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That could be, but I was under the impression that it will work with the older line for F2A units as well (but I am unsure of that).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
