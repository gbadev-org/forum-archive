    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Recently bought an EFA Linker from Total GBA, installed software, cart worked fine. Just reconnected it to change ROMs and I'm getting a message that the USB Device is not recognized. The cart still works fine in my GBA, but when I run the EFA software it says No Card Found. 
<br/>
When I click Search it then briefly comes up with the card as Found before quickly reverting to denying its existence.
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions gratefully received...<br/>_________________<br/>T</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you connecting the USB cable directly to the computer, through a bus-powered hub, or through a self-powered hub (that is, one with an AC adapter)? Don't use bus-powered hubs.
<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried it on a different computer? When my cousin first got an EFA card, his computer's USB chipset was too flaky (frequent reinits) to have it work.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the reply - it's connected directly to the pc's inbuilt usb port.

I've now tried connecting it to my laptop - it finds it as new hardware but then just says it's ready to use without asking for drivers, yet it then shows up as Unkown USB Device. When I try to install the driver for it anyway, I just get the message "Specified location does not contain information about your hardware" 
<br/>
<br/>
It's the same with both cables, which leads me to suspect a faulty card, but if so why did it work perfectly first time round, and why does it still work fine in the GBA? I'm seriously puzzled here...<br/>_________________<br/>T</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I might be speaking out of my a** here, but I think the cable might need two drivers. First one is for when you connect the cable. The driver then connects and uploads to the cable a small link program. The second driver then connects and communicates with this program. I have seen it done on other devices so it might apply here too. Try installing the second driver for the cable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
chishm is right about how it works ... but I can't guess exactly which part fails.
<br/>
<br/>
What you can do is try to look for a tool that will show you the details about the connected USB devices (like vendor and product ID, Product and Manufacturer string, usb class, subclass and protocol) and post the results here. We will then be able to tell in which state your cart is.
<br/>
<br/>
One question : does the led on the cart turns on (green color) when you plug the USB cable ?
<br/>
<br/>
You can also try to look for and delete efa drivers in your windows directories, and then reinstall the driver from the version that worked well, or do the same with the latest version.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to look what happens by yourself and have Linux, you can use the infos available in this thread : <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=5054" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=5054</a> using the files which are now there : <a href="http://boeglin.org/static/efa/" target="_blank">http://boeglin.org/static/efa/</a>
