    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've bought a Flash2Advance Ultra 512MBit some days ago and today I wanted to erase the whole card and did as said on the <a href="http://www.flash2advanceultra.tk/" target="_blank">http://www.flash2advanceultra.tk/</a> FAQ and erased the card with Flash2Advance USB/XXP writer V3.1. After that I copied some games to the card with F2A Power Writer and since then the card isn't recognized anymore in my GBA. When I look on the card with F2A Power Writer now, the games are there but the GBA doesn't start up the card anymore and it looks as if no card is inserted (halt at logo).
<br/>
I could need some good advice what to do now. I have no clue how to fix it and the manufacturer of F2A seems to rather keep their contact infos a secret! :((</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a similiar problem. I filled it with movies and demos over the limit and it wont start. And the full erase isn?t full erase on my 1GB card. &gt;_&lt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've just solved the problem. There's a new version of Power Writer .... v2.20 with that I could overwrite all again and it works like before.
<br/>
I've entered the card size (512MB) in the config settings and didn't entered any boot rom so the program would use it's internal.
<br/>
Phew! Glad my card is back! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yay, thanx! My Card is also back. But how do you bacup the saves? If you want to switch games you have to delete them and the saves are gone then. &gt;_&lt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Errm, no. My savegames were still there after I copied the Games over.
<br/>
Maybe not after using the erase function of the old writer program but the power writer didn't made any trouble there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
