    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm looking into buying some kind of GBA flash cartridge, but I don't what type to get.  I don't think I'll be getting it so more for music and media as much as games.  I was considering the Super Card, but I've heard something about slowdowns.  I have used my friend's cartridge before, and I really loved it.  How does it compare to the other flash cards, and which would you recommend?  Once again, I'm not getting this to put on a ton of other things, so space isn't a concern nearly as much as price.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've also been thinking about buying an EFA linker, but probably because it's the easiest one for me to get.  
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a bit unsure about something though, i'll be getting a DS lite in a week, and after reading a little bit, i gathered that you need a PassMe or firmware flash or something similar to use DS homebrew off of a card, but does this mean i have to use a PassMe so that i could play GBA roms/GBA homebrew &amp; apps off of the EFA cart?
<br/>
<br/>
any help would be greatly appreciated</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

  I have an EFA Linker and a Supercard SD. The obvious difference is capacity as the EFA is between 256Mib and 1Gib ( remember most flash carts are measured in bits, not Bytes, so that's about 128MiB) while the Supercard can be up to 4GiB depending on the flash media you insert.
<br/>
  The SuperCard came later because I wanted to watch my DVD's and TV on my DS. The Supercard is more of a toy or gadget in this sense. It does simulate the work of any other flash cart, but any software you run requires patching to support the flash memory rather than any standard EEPROM.
<br/>
  The EFA linker, on the other hand, is a full speed, writable flash cart. Loading speeds are phenominal and so is battery life. The software that comes with it is a little clunky, but it really works when handled properly. I really do recommend EFA over any other flash cart I've tried. It's also getting a lot cheaper! <a href="http://www.kicktrading.ca/index.php?cPath=21&amp;osCsid=333a200e33082075c313b222ec36293a" target="_blank">http://www.kicktrading.ca/index.php?cPath=21&amp;osCsid=333a200e33082075c313b222ec36293a</a>

  The DS is essentially two GBA's, one upgraded. To run in GBA mode you don't need to worry about the other half. Any GBA flash cart will work without a hitch.
<br/>
  The only reason we need to fool around with these PassMe devices is because we take advantage of the fact that the other half can be redirected to the GBA cart as if it was a DS cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
