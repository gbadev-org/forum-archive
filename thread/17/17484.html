<br/>
<br/>
I found this flash cart for sale pretty cheap but I cant find any info on it as it doesnt have a name or model number or anything. It says its usb which is good though.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if anybody has used it and if its any good?
<br/>
<br/>
can it boot .gba files and can you read and write to it multiple times?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, that is the primary one I've used.  You can write to easily it using splink, I've had no issues with it, other than the physical shells are extremely accurately assembled, meaning occasionally you get one that is a little tight sliding in and out of the gba.  I'd buy more of them in a heartbeat if the price was decent (&lt;$15).

<br/>
Can you PM me the source of where you found them?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
