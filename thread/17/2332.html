    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a Mac running OSX &amp; OS9.
<br/>
I was wondering whether anyone on here has had any experience of running the software for the EZF Advance on a Mac using Virtual PC?
<br/>
Is there still no port of the software for Mac?
<br/>
I'm awaiting the arrival of my EZF Advance 256MB. I will try this anyway &amp; will report back.
<br/>
Any advice appreciated in the meantime.

The software works, but it is unreliable.. probably fault in the original program, because I have tested it on a real PC with Windows2000 and it had some problems there too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hrm, didn't think to give that a try, I've tried VPC6 &amp; Win2K to no avail.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
I've since tried VPC7 with Win98SE to no avail. I currently think the problem is that USB ports on my PowerBook start in low power mode. The USB spec states that a port may start in low power mode and until the device request more juice, full power won't be sent to the device. I've read that most don't follow the spec and don't know how to request more power. I've also read that most USB ports on PCs don't do the low power mode and so these "dumb" devices seem to work as expected. Maybe an externally powered USB hub will work as expected.<br/>_________________<br/>"He who dares not offend cannot be honest." -- Thomas Paine</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
