    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, guys.  I'm hoping you can help me decide which cart I should buy to best suit my needs.  I'm fairly new to this, so I'd be thankful for the benefit of your greater experience in this subject.  
<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I'm looking for in a cart:
<br/>
<br/>
1. GBA support.  I'm going to be using this on a GBA SP, and will not be using any DS games.  
<br/>
<br/>
2.  Real Time Clock.  I'll be playing games that require this feature, so the product I buy should support it.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Relative ease of use.  I'm not new to emulation, but I am new to flash carts.  I'd prefer not to have to perform any complicated maneuvers, but I will learn if I have to.
<br/>
<br/>
4. Reasonable price.  I don't need the top of the line for my purposes, as long as the card meets my limited criteria I'll be happy. I don't want to spend too much, certainly not over 100 US dollars, and hopefully rather less.
<br/>
<br/>
That pretty much describes what I'm seeking.  Any advice you could offer me on which product will best serve me would be greatly appreciated.   I would also welcome any imput on where I should purchase the device from. 
<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you for your time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What homebrew games require the use of a real time clock in a GBA cartridge?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, there is the "rtc.mb" program distributed by the XRom people, which lets you set and view the time on an Xrom flash cart.  I managed to get it to work on my F2A Ultra cart after wrapping it with Multiboot Menu and flashing it separately from all my other homebrew apps.  Granted, that's not what you were asking, but still...
