<br/>
I'm thinking about buying some hardware so I can test my GBA stuff on the real thing and not just on emulators and I have two questions.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Which do you guys think is the best, the Flash2Advance USB Linker or the EZ-Flash USB?
<br/>
<br/>
2. After you have send a gba file to the cartridge can you erase it and send another one or do you have to buy a new empty cartridge?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
1. Well personally I like the EZ-Flash USB better. Others might like the F2A better.
<br/>
I think you should also consider the cost of the units. You can get the F2A USB with a 64mbit cart for 57$usd at success. If you want the EZ-Flash though, you would have to buy the 128mbit unit, which would set you back 75$...
<br/>
Im not sure if the F2A has any client for sending multiboot images though...
<br/>
2. You can erase and write to the cart thousands of times...at least</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the EZF-Advance is better. The cable doubles as a multiboot cable, and there are fewer problems.
<br/>
<br/>
For ~$107 you can get the 256 Mb kit, don't waste money and buy a 64Mb or 128 Mb kit when sooner or later, you will want more space.
<br/>
<br/>
EZF-Advance also writes the fastest as I have heard. Also supports a real-time clock.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
