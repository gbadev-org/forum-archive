    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a way to add ROMs from different systems (GB, GBC, GBA, NES, etc.) on the same Flash Card and be able to play whichever one you want with/without the use of a GB-Bridge? If so, on which Flash Cards does this work, and can this only be done with PogoShell? Also, if it is possible, will there be any damage to my GBA SP if the bridge isn't used when trying to play an old GB/GBC ROM or if I try to play a GBA ROM while using the bridge? Thanks in "Advance".<br/>_________________<br/>"Amp up and amplify! Defy! I'm a brother with a furious mind!"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know whether PocketGB will be repurposed as a PogoShell app the way PocketNES can act as PogoNES, but yes, you can have PocketNES, PocketGB (monochrome), and GBA ROMs on the same flash cart, with or without PogoShell. I don't know anything about the GB Bridge, but no, emulators won't damage your machine.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
