    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought a Parallel port flash advance linker and a Flash advance card(256M) years ago.  I hardly used it.
<br/>
<br/>
for XMAS I got a DS and I thought I get the flash out and see if I can get some GBA games on it.
<br/>
<br/>
Well the first problem is the transformer??
<br/>
What power should I have as I'm not sure if is it the correct one anymore.
<br/>
I do get a read light!!
<br/>
<br/>
Also what software I have XtremeLink V1.25 but this does nothing and also tried Flash Advance Writer  3.2 and couldn't get anything to work either.
<br/>
<br/>
SO maybe the cable, I'm using a straight cable all the wires?
<br/>
<br/>
any help please, my xmas sucks at this moment !!!

<br/>
<br/>
I buy a second hand LPT port Flash Advance Linker and Flash Advance Pro 256 M from my friend.
<br/>
<br/>
At first I use six 1.5 V batteries but FAL don't work. After that I change batteries with 9V power adapter and it worked again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
