    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I used a GBA with a F2A Parallel Linker + 64 Mbit without problems.
<br/>
Then I got a SP and still no problems.
<br/>
64 Mbit wasn't enough so I bought a 256 Mbit cart.
<br/>
Problems occured. I read you have to buy an USB Linker.
<br/>
I bought an USB Linker and now it recognizes the 256 Mbit card as a 64 Mbit Pro so that I can't flash games more than 64. Please help, what am I doing wrong? I use the most recently version of the writer software.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. Problems appeared with the old Linker (game glichtes or only being able to start the first if there are more games)
<br/>
<br/>
2. Have already tried it but it's the same problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
