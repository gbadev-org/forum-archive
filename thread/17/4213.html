    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just baught a GameBoy SP as someone stole my old one. I tried to plug in the flash cart. and it was very very tight (Should not fit tight). Any tips? I dont think this cart was designed for this unit. But my buddy who has the 256 Mb cart. that he baught at the same time; His fits perfectly.
