<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this forum and am wondering if anyone has experience with the 1gbit version of this cart?
<br/>
<br/>
I have recently purchased a GBA Magic USB 256mbit cart which has worked fine but liked the 1Gbit aspect of this other cart and ordered it online.
<br/>
<br/>
After ordering it I found a couple of forums were users in January/February of this year complained that the whole 1gbit was not always accessible. The manufacturer stated it was due to faulty parts and they would replace the defective units (this was in april). Some users also complained about save game issues...can anyone with this unit tell me if these problems have been addressed?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
