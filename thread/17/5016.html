<br/>
They are much cheaper than the other carts I have seen... Are they any good? Or is it all a scam?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, just saw that... The company smelled fishy right away...
<br/>
But is this G6 cart real?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think it is that incredibly cheap... The XROM is about the same price.
<br/>
Whats more, theese G6 cards use NAND flash, that means long loading time each time you want to play a new game.
<br/>
Oh, and they say "USB 2.0 support". Ha ha! Right... Perhaps their USB 1.1 controller reports a 2.0 USB descriptor, but it does not operate at 480Mbit/s. Not a chance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
first:
<br/>
<br/>
Never ever (!!!) buy at <a href="http://www.ps2modchip.com," target="_blank">www.ps2modchip.com,</a> Hong Kong Toys, China Toys or something like that...it?s one company and you will only lose your money (!)
<br/>
<br/>
second: :-)
<br/>
<br/>
G6 was about 6 month ago a new card on the market...it?s working, but the software support is not good enough to be an alternative. The have to improve their software to become one....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
