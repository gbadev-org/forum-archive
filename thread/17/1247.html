Using Flash2Advance USB with a 64meg card.
<br/>
Using bart's F2A drivers posted on <a href="http://www.emuboards.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=14;t=3416;st=0;r=1;?entry23439" target="_blank">http://www.emuboards.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=14;t=3416;st=0;r=1;?entry23439</a> .
<br/>
Now, When I run the F2A 3.0 program to write, I get the following
<br/>
<br/>
Initial ULA ...
<br/>
Checking ULA....
<br/>
Launch BIOS...
<br/>
Turn on GBA and press START+SELECT... 
<br/>
Download BIOS failure! 
<br/>
No Adaptor Found!
<br/>
<br/>
When my GBA's on, a little screen pops up that says "Turn off your GBA." When I do this, I can get the glimpse of a screen that flashes for a very short time that tells me to turn it on holding start+select, however the screen flashes and I get the "Download BIOS failure" and "No adaptor Found!" messages before I can turn on my GBA. Also, if I turn on the GBA in multiboot mode while the program has stopped, I hear this extra tone and my screen goes to a picture of four curved lines that are filled in with red.
<br/>
<br/>
Or, every now and then, I turn on the GBA into multi-boot, and I get a white screen, and the messages
<br/>
<br/>
Initial ULA ...
<br/>
Checking ULA....
<br/>
GBA Ready   
<br/>
i-Linker Found
<br/>
ReadPack: ULA error!
<br/>
 Unknown cart. Opertion is limited!

Not that a company should put out software and drivers that work with their product or anything...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Ok, above problems, my question.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there something wrong with the Card, the Cable, The Software, or the GBA? And if possible, how do I get it to work?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The problem is most probably with the USb Drivers, as most people seem to have problem with. Someone posted a link to a website about a guy who posted a Usb fix, this might help you.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, here's what's happening.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried it on my brother's computer (practically identical), and it works just fine. I'm guessing that the problem is that I still have the old drivers in memory, so I'm going through and eliminating anything and everything that has to do with ezusb (except for the working drivers) and f2a.
