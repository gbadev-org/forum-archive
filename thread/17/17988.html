    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just a question regarding this. I see there are a few flashcards out there. A lot of them are system-specific and don't seem to work on every GBA slot. I don't know much about GBA programming as of now but I would like to know, if I actually wanted to make and distribute these games so others can play them (without the use of a flash cart or their own hardware), is there a way out there to do so?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the biggest problem you would have today is to find GBA flash cartridges at a good price. It was much easier 10 years ago...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Where can you find them at? Also I made a separate post in the DS forum wondering about that too (though I'm aware GBA programming is probably easier)

Recommended brands, etc. And how much would I expect to pay (per cart)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
