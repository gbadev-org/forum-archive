    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After a little tooling I've got my flasher working.  Now that it is going, I've noticed that the thing doens't see mto store anything for more than a few hours.  Is there a way to fix this?  It's an XG flash 2 lite.

<br/>
That's neither here or there though.....
<br/>
<br/>
what I was hoping for was a way to get pogoshell and roms onto this cart without having the loader.  Is there a way to do this?
<br/>
