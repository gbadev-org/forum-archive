<br/>
The GBA can't directly decode MP3 (yet). The "Play MP3s - Music" claim on the packaging seems to allude to things such as my recently updated <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/gsm/" target="_blank">GSM Player</a>, right?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

At least, the roms at PDRoms are homebrew roms. In the example pictures on that Magic USB site, you clearly see commercial roms listed in there (Super Mario Bros and Street Fighter). That's why I thought they were encouraging piracy more than development.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There aren't even that many commercial GBA games. Including all the foreign ones. Maybe they are including the NES games too?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Question is, are they using a F2AU ASIC copy, or do they simply not know what they are talking about?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys...I had a chinese co-worker buy this for me from an asian shopping mall. I bought the 256mbit version and I can honestly say it's not that bad...I haven't had any issues. I own several original games all of which run fine on the cart. Saves were a bit tricky to use at first because I didn't realize I had to back them up (to the carts sram) prior to running a new game or it would overwrite the save in memory.
<br/>
<br/>
I have had a couple of write failures which erases everything that was on the cart previously (cept for saves) but this after closing down TSRs and other programs and rebooting the flash program it would work fine.
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried it with Pokemon Saphire (daughter's game), Elite PD, Advance Wars 2, Metroid Fusion, Kirby in Dreamland and they all work fine.
<br/>
<br/>
I have also tested several of the emulators (DRM Sms, PocketNES and ZX Advance ) and the cart has performed marvelously.
<br/>
<br/>
So to summarize if you can find this cheaper than the more popular ones I certainly wouldn't have any trouble recommending it to you.  Have owned it for a little over a month now and no major issues at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
