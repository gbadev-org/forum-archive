    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I need to know what flash card to buy. I'm just starting coding for the gba and want something cheap. I want to use the card in my DS but I'm not going to be coding for the DS just for the game boy.
<br/>
<br/>
In other words it needs the following:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Cheap
<br/>
2. Ability to run gba roms in my DS
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1. GBAmp would do the trick ...
<br/>
2. ... but under that condition, SuperCard is the cheapest. I assume you mean ROMS from PDRoms.de, right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">by roms I mean the gba games I have made. by multiboot if you mean a MBV2 Cable then no multi boot won't work for me because it won't work with the DS right? the DS doesn't have the port that the gba has.[/quote]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was suggesting the GBA Movie Player, which only runs programs that load entirely into the GBA's RAM (which are under 250 KB and which are called "multiboot" because that's how they're typically used in commercial games) but which also allows programs to access the CF card to load data and further program segments.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GBAMP version 2 - only runs multiboots, can't be used with PassMe2, side-loading CF
<br/>
SuperCard - more expensive than GBAMP version 2, runs GBA ROMs, needs patches for GBA saving, works with PassMe2, front-loading CF or side-loading SD
<br/>
M3 - newer version of GBAMP, more expensive than SuperCard, runs GBA ROMs, better save support than SuperCard, works with PassMe2, side-loading CF or SD<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
