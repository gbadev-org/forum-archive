I want a flash cartridge that can do <span style="font-weight: bold">all</span> of these things with good or average quality:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as I know, any flash cart will do all of that. However - the flash cart you use doesn't effect how the emulators run - every GBA is the same (or roughly so anyway - you could talk technicalities and say they all have ever so slightly different processor clocks, but eh), and since the flash cart doesn't effect emulator performance, it means that emulators will run how they run. That means the SNES emulator doesn't really run very playably, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
You can expect NES games to run well, and master system/game gear games run really well too. 
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have experience with any of the other stuff, but I assume that the same kinds of rules apply.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

EasyBuy2000 has a very good deal, but it has a 2.41 lifetime rating on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.resellerratings.com" target="_blank">www.resellerratings.com</a>...

I don't have PayPal, nor a credit card to use with it... I tried looking at the icons to find Money Order, which is what I always use, but nope... Anything else? Thanks! ;-)

If you don't have a card, then you may need to borrow someone else's. How old are you? (Telling us your age is optional but it will help us figure out what strategies to use with your folks.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I bought the EZ-Flash III of 1GB for $115.04 with PayPal! YAY! :-D
<br/>

<br/>
OMG, he accepted, YAY!! :-D
<br/>
Now, I was looking at this:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">EFA II Linker</span> [line edited by mod]
<br/>
<br/>
Is that one good? I see it has the port on the card itself... I can't backup my saves with my other gamecarts, right? What other card lets me do that also? Thanks! ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
BTW: I also want PogoShell, RTC, good speed, and multiboot, if I'm not asking for too much... :-)
<br/>
<br/>
[edit]
<br/>
Hold on... How about one of the <span style="font-weight: bold">SuperCard mini-SD</span>'s? Do you just put a little card on the thing and it'll use it like a real flashcart?! Does it do the same thing as the other ones? If so, I think these are more convenient... Thanks! ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Edit2:
<br/>
Sorry for editing that much, but... Since those card adapters don't come with link cables to get data from my game cartridges, will a linker cable for any other type of flashcart work for that? Thanks! ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
PD: Sorry, mod, I didn't know I couldn't post links... :-/
