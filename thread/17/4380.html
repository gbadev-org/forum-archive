    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everybody.
<br/>
<br/>
Some time ago i bought from Lik-Sang a MBV3 cable but i received it without any software, just a simple cable withouth any information or manufacturer name, nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
Since i had other priorities at the time i did not try to contact them to get the software and now that i tried i could not send any email throught their site (the link does not work!).
<br/>
<br/>
Do anybody have a link on the original manufacturer of this cable or know how to get the software for it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It appears that the cable supports MBV2 protocol. If you have a working Win98 system, try the MBV2 software.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It was a rip off of something else, plus it had less features.
