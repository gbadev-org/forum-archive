    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have just killed my EZFlash writer, I left it plugged into my laptop when it lost power, now it doesn't work, the led doesn't light and my laptop/pc wont detect that I plugged it in. As for the Flash cart, I have no way of checking it, its empty (the last write failed, it sometimes does that), so I have no idea it that works or not, I assume it does, as it seems to be detected by my DS, although I get two white screens.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if the writers are fixable, If not I may have a EZFlash 128Mb cart for sale.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
