    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm guessing the 8-hour wait has something to do with the rechargeable battery it uses to power the SRAM that holds savegame data. So just let it charge, go to sleep, and dream of what you're going to do with the cart once it's ready.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">... or it may have something to do with the fact that during shipment the cart goes thru various temperature (possibly extreme cold or extreme heat). It is best to write to a fash memory after it has been stabilized at room temperature for some time, and hence the suggested 8 hour wait.
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, I would definitely wait the minimum amount of time suggested ... possibly a little more, just to be on the safe side.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
