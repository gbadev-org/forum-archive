    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hello all,
<br/>
this may seem like a stupid question but....
<br/>
i have installed the f2a usb driver and everything works perfectly.
<br/>
but, whenever windows 2000 boots up, i get a "at least one driver or service failed to load, see event viewer for details".  checking event viewer does not shed any light on the situation.  the flash writer works fine, but this error message is really annoying.   i even tried formatting the hard drive and just re-installing the f2a driver and i get the same thing every time.  anyone know what is causing this or how to get rid of it?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry to be so vague on this, but I have a recollection that I have seen a fix to this. Someone I know had the same problem I think, and there is a known fix. I believe that the problem stemmed from 2 copies of the ezusb driver being loaded, both having the same name. The fix involved renaming one of them. Sorry I don't have a link, but knowing it's out there may help.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">actually,
<br/>
2 drivers *do* get loaded.
<br/>
first, i install the f2busb.inf driver after i plug in the f2a cable.
<br/>
driver installs fine.
<br/>
when i boot up gba writer (v1.1 i think) it goes through a "detect new hardware" thing and installs *another* driver.  does this every time.
<br/>
i even tried a fresh install of 2000 and *not* installing the f2a driver first.  just by launching the f2a writer app, but no go.
<br/>
maybe we're on to something?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most of the issues people have with the f2a drivers come from the fact that the manufacturer didn't bother to give the device a unique USB vendor/device signature. Instead it uses the generic "ezusb" development kit codes. If you've installed any other hardware where this is also the case (it apparently isn't uncommon) then you can get hardware conflicts.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't use Windows so I can't help with specifics, but I'd try unistalling drivers for any old usb devices you're not using. I'd especially look at usb modem drivers, which are notorious for this.
