    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey Everyone,
<br/>
I just stumbled across the flash website, and I know nothing other than what the site tells me, which isnt much. Can someone please give me a rundown of everything i need to know? maybe a little help with which one to but also? I am mainly interested in gettin the NES games on my GBA SP. How do they work? are they easy for a kinda computer dumb kid?
<br/>
<br/>
            thanks, jon</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by jfran02 on Wed Apr 07, 2004 1:47 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

And this really isn't the board to talk about that kind of stuff. Feel free to look at the site but you won't get much help here due to legal issues.
