    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Using F2aw31 w/ a usb linker + gbc2gba.gb I can manage to get gb and gbc games to my F2A 64m cart. However, Once I insert the bridge into the my GBAsp and turn the power on it hangs at the GameBoy screen and what would say nintendo looks messed up. I cannot get this to load to the menu.
<br/>
<br/>
I just bought this as a package on linker4u.com so I believed that this setup would be compatable. I also followed this boards FAQ on using F2aw31 w/ Gb Bridge. Am I missing something here?
<br/>
<br/>
I have had no trouble loading and playing GBA games into my setup if that is any help.

Sorry If I left anything out of importance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
