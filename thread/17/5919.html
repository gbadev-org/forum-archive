    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi folks,  
<br/>
<br/>
*disclaimer* I am developing Live Music with the GB and i know this is the gba forum but i can't seem to find gb developers anymore, so it's a bit off topic. /disclaimer
<br/>
<br/>
I'm new.  Really new.  I know that some of the GBA flash carts operate through the aux port on the GBA and SP.  Now, what I'm trying to figure out is can I write a GB/GBC cart with the software that comes with these cart writers.  I have purchased LittleSound DJ. I am developing live music sets with it and would like to run in on my GB/Pocket  The problem is I can't seem to find a Cart or Writer for the GB/C.  Does anyone have any knowledge they would like to share about this process.  I have been looking all day and finally I have decided to do what everyone else does and just ask a total stranger or group of strangers.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for any help

I'm pretty sure that ndb wants the latter, a GBC flash card. Those aren't made anymore.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">right.  I need a gbc cart and a writer.  what I was painfully trying to ask was, If I find a Cart, (IF) can I write it with an flash2advance usb dongle on my gba?  The cables like $10 and it saves the headache of trying to find a writer.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the help thusfar.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Check <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gameboymall.com/" target="_blank">gameboymall.com</a> for an MBC1 flash cart. You will need an EPROM programmer (expect to spend at least $75). Don't expect it to work with your F2A though.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Or, try to get your hands on one of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.abdolian.com/gameboy/" target="_blank">these</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
the thread is now already some days old but you can put a GB/GBC ROM on the F2A card. But to use it in a GB/GBC you need also the GB-Bridge.
<br/>
I tested some GBC-ROM's that are using the IR-Port in the GBC by this way and it worked fine. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
