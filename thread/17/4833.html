    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My EZFA client stopped working and freezes my pc every time i open it now. It worked less than a week ago. ive reinstalled and shutdown my pc. I think something on my pc is interfering with it or something. Are there alternatives to the EZFA client for the EZFA card drivers?
