    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently bought a pre-owned GBA and I'm planning to run homebrew on it, so I asked fellow gbadev member and friend genecyst what I would need. He suggested me the 'supercard SD', but I really can't find one of those anywhere... or I am unable to search properly. :|
<br/>
I've found the miniSD version only, but I have no miniSD/microSD+adaptor spare so I would have also to buy a miniSD. Unless someone can suggest me a similar product (should work on GBA and on DS) that I could buy instead.
<br/>
Thanks! :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://bit.ly/yiQrz9" target="_blank">libXM7</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://bit.ly/yJwcOo" target="_blank">NDS programming tutorial (Italiano)</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://disjointedstudio.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Waimanu DS / GBA</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://adshomebrewersdiary.blogspot.com" target="_blank">A DS Homebrewer's Diary</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
