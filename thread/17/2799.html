    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got a 1 GIG flash2advance ultra, and i have movie files, but is there any way to patch or anything game files together.  I mean i have a movie that requires 512 mbits, but i know that the largest game file can only be 256.  Just wondering if there is a way to get the gba to read bigger files since i have a bigger flash cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could split it into two movies and tell the cart to bankswitch from one to the other when it reaches the end. I don't know whether the &gt;256 Mbit F2A carts use a variation on the Visoly bankswitching (like the &lt;= 256 Mbit F2A carts use) or not.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
