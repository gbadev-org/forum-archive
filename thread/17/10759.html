<br/>
I need to run ROMs at least 16 Megabytes in size, (but not commercial ROMs, just homebrew ROMs).
<br/>
<br/>
That's all the space I need. 16-32 Megabytes. I have no serial, parallel or PS/2 ports on any computer in my house, nor am I buying one just for that purpose, that would just cost more than a USB alternative. =P
<br/>
<br/>
So it needs to be USB, it needs to have 16-32 megabytes, and it must be around $60.
<br/>
<br/>
Precise enough?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

According your spec: 'Anything' would be the appropriate answer.
<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend you a place, but the rules don't allow me to say in-thread. Check through all the threads in the retailer section instead for some inspiration.

<br/>
Yes, you can put code into the chunks, provided that it's either 1. a complete mb.gba program or 2. compiled as position-independent code so that it can run when loaded anywhere into EWRAM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
