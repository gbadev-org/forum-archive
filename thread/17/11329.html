    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently purchaced a \"GBA EZFlash II 256mbit PowerStar Devkit\" from jandaman. The cart appears to have serious issues with one of the first ROM banks. The loader loads with glitches and won\'t run the first ROM on the cart (everything after that works fine) and I can\'t burn just a single ROM. (It either doesn\'t load at all or has serious glitchage.

<br/>
Is this a common problem? Is there any way to fix it? Do I need to negotiate an exchange? Help...
