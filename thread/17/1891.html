    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I just got my linker earlier today and tried to install it on my computer, and it didn't work... i tried severeal things, but still nothing.
<br/>
i tried one time on my other computer and everything worked fine
<br/>
i'm guessing it's those drivers that are driving everyone nuts.
<br/>
the thing is, when i install it nothing happens, i just get the sandwatch-icon from windows and nothing more.
<br/>
i've tried plug'n'play, but my computer recognizes it as "GlobeSpan ADSL USB Modem" and i'm unable to delete those, so that the windows-installer would ask me for files instead of searching itself.
<br/>
<br/>
i can't remember what the filename of the .sys was but i think it was something like glspausb.sys, i tried renaming that file, but windows got a new copy of it. i tried replacing the file with a dummy, and windows overwrote it. i tried to make the dummy read-only, still windows manages to overwrite it.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess my real question is "how do i delete drivers from the windows database".
<br/>
I've even tried deleting all files (*.inf &amp; *.sys) for that driver, but it didn't work. i also tried to replace the content in the .inf with the one from the f2a linker...
<br/>
<br/>
any ideas?!
<br/>
suggestions are welcome (even if they sound really stupid... i might not have tried them yet!)
<br/>
<br/>
thank you all in advance.
<br/>
<br/>
ps. i used the drivers i found on this board instead, but it still wouldn't work and i also use Windows ME and had a USB Wingman on my computer before... i've tried all with and without the wingman plugged in</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i just got my F2A usb linker + card, and when i plug it in, it also shows up/installs as the Globespan usb dsl modem.  is it supposed to read like this?  windows (me) automatically installs the software for it, not letting my choose any of my own drivers, so i would assume that it knows what it's doing.  But when i try to flash anything, i get the </span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Initial ULA ...

//edit
<br/>
look at that.  like 20 minutes after i'm desperate for help, i plug the thing in again, and it somehow freaks and asks me for the correct driver.  now everything works well.  i'm so confused....:D</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by blueskies on Wed Sep 24, 2003 10:42 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First, you need to uninstall the modem driver. Plug in your linker so that it shows up in Device Manager as the modem, then uninstall the driver and unplug the linker. Now go into c:\windows\inf (or c:\winnt\inf) and look for an .inf file that contains the modem driver's details - rename it to .old or something. If your version of windows has two files for each driver in the inf folder, one with an .inf extension and one with some other extension, rename both. Check the files called oem1.inf, oem2.inf..etc as well as they may contain more drivers.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, when you plug the device back in, you should be prompted for a driver again. Make sure you are not connected to the internet so that it can't contact Windows Update to find a driver. If it still doesn't prompt then you either didn't find the right .inf file, or Windows still has the driver installed. Uninstalling drivers manually under Windows (rather than through device manager) involves lots of very very dodgy registry editing in dangerous places which can easily kill your system.
<br/>
<br/>
If you can't get the above to work, or don't want to risk it, then contact me privately by email or IM and I might be able to help you further (probably by remoteing into your machine and deleting the driver for you). I have the Windows source code at work so I know how the driver database works. =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well after reformatting/reinstalling windows, and needing to go through all of this over again, i think i figured out the perfect way to get the f2a usb linker to work.  
<br/>
<br/>
1. plug in
<br/>
2. see that it's installing drivers for some modem
<br/>
    2.1 get mad
<br/>
3. uninstall modem
<br/>
4. unplug/replug linker
<br/>
5. see step 2-3
<br/>
6. continue to plug in, delete drivers, get mad, reboot, leave alone for 3 day.
<br/>
7. eventually, for some unknown reason, it will work
<br/>
8. don't...touch...anything.  just leave it alone.
<br/>
<br/>
this is what i went through two times.  i really hope i'm not the only one who's having this much initial trouble.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
