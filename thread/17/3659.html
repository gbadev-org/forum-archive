    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi, i've got a problem it seems like when i select a particular game to be deleted in the software this is what i've done
<br/>
'delete' -&gt; it shows 'hidden in cart' -&gt; 'Write F2A' -&gt; the game is still in the F2A software however it couldnt be played. i tried to install a new game on it but it says the game capacity is larger than the availble.. why is that so? why couldnt i delete? oh and when i press on recycle, the so called deleted games still have their capacity writen in the cart and it could be played.
<br/>
