    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone! :D
<br/>
Quick question, I'm buying an M3 memcard adapter, but which one should I get?  I need 4GB, as I got an EZ-Flash III, and 128MB is too little for me...  I like the SD, because it sticks on the side, but what are the chances of accidentally pulling the miniSD out of the cart?  What's the difference between SD and miniSD?  They (the adapters) cost the same...  Thanks! ;)<br/>_________________<br/>"My wealth has doubled since we last met."

2 x EZ4 lite microSD adapters

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">CF cards are much better than SD card (that is what I heard, anyways) and also more NDS software compatible with CF card.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the CF card stick out and SD card doesn't.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe a year ago this was true...SD is very solid and very popular...I don't think you will find may new products using CF any more...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is it still that crappy?  :-/
<br/>
<br/>
I also read that it's specifically designed for the NDS...  Will it still work with the GBA SP with the same features?  Anyways, where can I buy 4GB SD cards?  Thanks! ;-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My wealth has doubled since we last met."

I take this to mean that "where can I buy" questions on gbadev.org should not be answered, that members are expected to go to the Retailer Feedback section and browse each retailer's catalog one by one.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

My comment was purely on CF vs SD - not on the hardware that uses the CF or SD - sorry for the confusion.

Good point, 4GB SD cards are still a little hard to find....
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Mind you - its likely cheaper to buy 2x2Gig SD OR CF cards than 1x4Gig CF card....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
