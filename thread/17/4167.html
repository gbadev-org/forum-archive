    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, I've tried to find as much as possible on these two sets (of cards/linkers), but I would like to hear the opinion of experienced users. 
<br/>
<br/>
I've never used a flash linker for GBA, but I think I want one of these two. Would everyone please list as many pros and cons of each of these cards/linkers as possible? 
<br/>
<br/>
Also, what is Pogo Shell capable of? Is it important to have Pogo Shell support in a Flash card?
<br/>
<br/>
I am mostly interested in playing backed up GBA roms and NES roms on my GBA SP, but I'd also like to use the .txt viewer, slide show, and movie viewer tools as well. Which of these cards would you recommend for this? I'm not really interested in developing my own software for the GBA at this point (I have almost no knowledge of programming).
<br/>
<br/>
Any input is greatly appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
One more thing... what is the difference in EZ Flash Advance and EZ Flash Advance II? 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
F2A for developers, well supported, drivers for Linux as well. Original software not so good/stable. Pogoshell was nevertheless developed on this cart so it works perfectly with it.
<br/>
EZFA : for noobs. Easy to set up and to use. Don't know about Pogoshell support for it.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to have the txt browser and the pic browser in one solution, use Pogoshell. That means using a F2A, not an EZFA. Note that it is also possible to have a txt viewer and a picture viewer as separate apps, they will then work on any cart.
<br/>
<br/>
As a final note, Pogoshell does not work well with the latest F2A (the Ultra versions). But since the ultra bootloader manages saves as Pogoshell does (which is why Pogoshell is mainly used, apart from themes, viewers, etc), it is not so important.
<br/>

HTH,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would really like a EZFlash Advance 512 mbit cart... do they make them? or is 256 the largest for EZFA?
<br/>
<br/>
Bah, I think I'll just go with the EZFA 256. I've read nearly every post on these forums, and it seems that the EZFA 256 is the easiest overall to use (for my needs). Thanks to all you 1337 folk involved in this excellen project... Later!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
