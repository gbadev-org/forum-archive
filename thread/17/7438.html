    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">G6 has a recover utility (G6_PC_Full_install_v1.7\Maintenance\utility) did you do the full format or just the recovery? Was your card a beta?  hope you get it working, I am very happy with the changes, but the recover tool,  that is a lot of money to pay for an update to take a card out.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by pg65 on Wed Nov 09, 2005 4:35 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
