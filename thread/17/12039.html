    <h4>#113531 - Vengyr - Thu Dec 28, 2006 4:42 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a friend that ordered a game online. wich when it arrived appeared to be a fake. I only have EZ-flash equipment and tried to read from the cartridge. That was no problem. but I can't delete or add anything. I would like to know if it is possible to format the cartridge to become an EZ-flash cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
The reasons why we know its a fake.
<br/>
1. the cartridge doesnt have the shine sticker on it from the game.
<br/>
2. the model number doesnt equal the official model numers (AGB-022)
<br/>
3. at the end of the game the save file got corrupted. (happened to more ppl with the same fake cartridge)
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this is possible and that someone can help me. Cause I wouldnt know wich brand cartridge this is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, my guess would be that it is a flash cartridge and that you should be able to write to it with the right tools. Its been cheaper for the pirates to manufacture flash cartridges the last 2-3 years compared to OTP and if theres money to be saved you can be sure the pirates will go the cheaper route.

Note <span style="font-weight: bold">PCB</span>.  You'll need to remove the casing from the cart.  I'm not convinced it will be worth the trouble to figure out how to reflash it and then do just that, even if it can be done.  If you are, go for it.  =P

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I also got a pirate cart with the model number AGB-022. It has 2 flash ROM chips totalling 256mbit, but I couldn't find the data sheets for the particular model. It does bank switching by writing to the last 8 bytes of SRAM, but I'm not sure how to re-program the cart (unfortunately). I'll post pics when I can.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I am convinced; It wont be worth the trouble ;P

If you want a cart to dev on, buy a proper kit from one of the retailers in the retailer feedback part of the forum, its worth it. If you want to tinker around with some obscure hardware just for the fun of it, then by all means knock yourself out :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I dont mind buying one. but seeing we already have this it might have been easier to use this one. as for opening it. I dont have the tool for those screws. The only thing I can tell you is that on the back it says really large 128(I expect it to be the size)
<br/>
<br/>
But do you guys have any ideas how it is possible without opening them up?
<br/>
<br/>
and I got a EZ-flash 2 set. but my friend wanted to play the game I am making for school aswell.
<br/>
<br/>
officially the AGB-022 code was used for nintendo's official clean cardridge. but seeing with us a game is on. they must have reporgrammed it aswell.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Destroy the casing?  Fun, but your friends will probably think you are crazy.  (I took a hand saw to SNES controllers once.  It was a repair job.)

Psychic powers.  X-ray vision might work, but it depends on the specific type of X-ray vision.  With "real" X-ray vision, you won't be able to see the part numbers.  =P

What about option C: a cart to give a copy of your work to friends and family and/or a limited edition to sell over the Internet? That's <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=11535" target="_blank">this card</a>, right?

But, if you have to flash the authentication with the game, then it might not be, as I don't believe anyone has done this in the homebrew area.

The cart specs could always change without notice.  FWIW, pirate carts use horrible hardware.  (GB Pirate Pokemon carts- the SRAM died within <span style="font-weight: bold">days</span>.)
