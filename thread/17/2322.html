2. Yes. If your cart has some sort of bankswitch, you can put multiple games on your cart if they total smaller than the cart size. F2A and EZF type flash carts have bankswitch; Wise Card doesn't. However, if you're using replacement menu software such as PogoShell, the menu software must support your flash cart brand's bankswitch protocol. PogoShell's F2A support is much more mature than its EZF support because F2A bankswitching is based on the bankswitching of the Visoly carts that preceded it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
