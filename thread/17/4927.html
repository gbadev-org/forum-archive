    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll buy a gba flash cart for DS dev and emulation...what do you think it's the best one?
<br/>
<br/>
EFA looks very good but X-rom is way cheaper...and I have a gba.
<br/>
<br/>
Anybody knows if the usb interface in the EFA cart can be used by DS programs in the future (maybe to connect to other USB devices?)...
<br/>
<br/>
What advantages does EFA have besides the built-in usb?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
EFA and all other actual flashcards are 100% GBA devices and you will not have any chance to use them directly with your DS...you have to wait for other solutions in the future.....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's already possible to run amr9 code from a gba cart and those passthroughs will eventually become small and cheap.
<br/>
<br/>
For now I'll just use the cart to run gba stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
