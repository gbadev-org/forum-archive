    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm having a problem with my Flash2Advance.. it's the parallel model.
<br/>
<br/>
I followed the instructions in the manual, but they don't seem to be correct, or at least not working for me.
<br/>
<br/>
I connect the cable to by parallel, and GBA(not the new flip GBA, the old one) start the flash writer 3.0 software, and turn on my GBA while holding start and select.  I hear a little extra jingle, but it doesn't take me to the ilinker screen, it just sits at the "Gameboy" logo..  pressing buttons in the software doesnt seem to effect this state.
<br/>
<br/>
If I try to switch the GBA on and off about 50 times or so it will eventually work and take me to the ilinker software and I can then load my roms.. 
<br/>
<br/>
It's been this way since I purchased the cable a week ago. 
<br/>
<br/>
The port settings in the flash witer software are correct (as I said it works eventually).
<br/>
<br/>
Also my port mode is EPP, but I've tried the other 3 modes as well.
<br/>
<br/>
I thought the cable was loose or faulty, but wiggling it and what not doesnt change anything.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone had this problem or have any suggestions on how I might solve it?
<br/>
<br/>
I would greatly appreciate it; it takes me about an hour to get lucky and find the ilinker screen now.

I have an Acer Travelmate 721TX laptop and a Dell Dimension 4100 desktop. Should I avoid F2A linkers entirely?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

In my experience, laptops usually have 3.3v parallel ports and desktops have 5v. Some desktop mobos also use 3.3v for the parallel ports and this may be the issue with Dells.
<br/>
<br/>
We have 50+ Dell desktop PCs here, I guess I really ought to check at least one of them...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There  is also an issue on some PC's - I met it on an Acer 1300 - where the parallel port stobe signal has neither an active pullup nor a pull up resistor. In this case if the device connected to this signal does not provide a pullup resistor and is not actually LS TTL this signal can have a non legal high level. We had to fix a product which has been working for 12+years by adding a pullup resistor for Acer 1300 laptops.
<br/>
<br/>
Having said that the same laptop worked with my F2A when I tried, so
<br/>
I don't expect that to be the problem here.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well that's the perfect reply to my question.  I'm sure you are correct.
<br/>
I will try my F2A ona desktop as soon as I'm back in Canada.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you and others who gave advice.
