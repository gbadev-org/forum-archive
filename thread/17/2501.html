    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just wondering if the powerstar 256m cartridge sticks out of the gameboy advance sp.  I want it (judginng by the specs), but I dont want a product that is not flush to the system like a standard consumer cartridge.  Judging from some poor quality pictures I've found online, I cant seem to tell if the powerstar is a little bit longer than the standard gba cartridges.  If it's flush, then I'll definently get it.  
<br/>
<br/>
If this product does not run flush with the hardware, what do you all think might be a decent alternative (that will run flush).  Thank you all in advance...GAMEBOYADVANCE!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the info. Just to be sure, are you saying this from a perspective as an owner of this powerstar device? I couldn't find any info at that link other than a picture.  Perhaps I am harping on the subject but it just seems bigger than other cartridges.  
<br/>
<br/>
While were on the topic though.  If anyone owns the powerstar: What do you think?  Are you happy with it?  Are there any drawbacks?  I plan on ordering from jandaman.com.  
<br/>
<br/>
The price is the best I could find
<br/>
$122.00 something including shipping.  Has anyone actually tested therre powerstar to see if the power consumption is actually lower? If so: by how much.<br/>_________________<br/>iamashamanmagicianthesunispurple3ddimensionsiamformentalextensions</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, I was looking in to buying a power star, until I did some more research and found that there were several annoyances that gave it disadvantages over the EZFA which I just ordered. 
<br/>
<br/>
Apparently the internal battery doesn?t charge during game play, like the EZFA, instead every 2 to 3 weeks u must place it back in its usb dock or else your game saves will get killed.
<br/>
<br/>
The software, although better looking, does not appear to be as stable as the EZFA.
<br/>
<br/>
It doesn?t appear as if there is that big of a power consumption difference.
<br/>
<br/>
Some Newer games must be patched in order for them to work correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
The Power star dose appear to be the same size as a standard gba kart, according to several specs ive seen.
<br/>
<br/>
I also chose the EZFA because it seemed more developer friendly, and included a boot cable.      ---Hope this helps.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd recommend not buying a PowerStar; they seem to have problems with saves (they should in theory be the same as the EZ/XG but don't appear to be in practise)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you all, I picked the EZFlash Advance 256m (non powerstar version).
<br/>
<br/>
I decided to go with jandaman.com (who by the way is fucking awesome). BUY FROM JANDAMAN OR I WILL EAT YOU<br/>_________________<br/>iamashamanmagicianthesunispurple3ddimensionsiamformentalextensions</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
