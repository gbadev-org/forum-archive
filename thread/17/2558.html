<br/>
anyone help
<br/>
i have an ezf flash cart  256 child put it in her mouth yesterday and it got wet
<br/>
dryed it out and the writer is recognizing it as is the gba but it can  only write up to 2 mbs using small files like demos anything bigger and it just freezes up  anyway of bringing back to life or is it rubbish just wondering if there is any way i can get access to the rest  of the mbits  past the freeze point at 2 mbs or if everything is gone except the mbits at the start
<br/>
any help would be great</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I sugest you open it, and dry it, slowly, with a hair dryer, on lowest temprature, holding it far away from the cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Try to use a small brush on those places that seems to be very wet.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

*Sorry, its just SO out of the ordinary*

I am guessing part of the chip is damaged. Heat and electronic chips do NOT mix, (the same with electronic chips and saliva). I don't think you can salvage it. Its better not to waste your time trying to fix what may never again work perfectly. 
<br/>
<br/>
I am guessing that some of the saliva got on the pin connectors. I wouldn't put the cart back in your GBA as you run the risk of damaging that also.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope everything works out.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It may or may not work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I agree w/ the above poster about using a little Isopropyl (rubbing alcohol) to clean up the contact points. As a last resort, try opening up the cartridge and let it dry for a couple days.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
