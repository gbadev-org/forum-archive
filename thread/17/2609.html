    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody!
<br/>
<br/>
As everybody wants to get as much as possible out of their money, I would like to ask for advice or first-hand experience. I'm new to this "FLASH" world and I'm in a big dillema. I read a lot of tests and I came out with three packages wich are very interesting.
<br/>
They are:
<br/>
<br/>
1. EZF-ADVANCE 256M flash cart set
<br/>
2. EZ-FLASH II PowerStar 256M Cart set
<br/>
3. FLASH2ADVANCE ULTRA 256M Cart with USB linker set
<br/>
<br/>
So I'm asking all of you experts which of these three packages would you recommend and of course why? 
<br/>
<br/>
I know that there are many other possibilities, like the 1Gb cart from Flash2Advance ultra, but it is to expensive for me. I want to focus on the 256M carts which still have an acceptable price. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, and I hope I wasn't to long!!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">EZF-Advance 256 Mb kit from MWElectronics(check the retailers section) at $107 with shipping shipped to your door in 1 week at most, usually 3 days when paid with PayPal. Need I say more?
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, there is that Real-Time clock but the EZ-F will not play GB Roms(roms can be played on F2A but it needs a GB bridge)
<br/>
<br/>
Writing software is also ok. Could be better and it could be worse. 
<br/>
<br/>
You might want to pray to God hoping that Windows correctly recognizes the USB cable. I did. (Note: my methods do not work 100%, only tried once). 
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I speak from experience in owning this cart, so my views might be biased. Check the other kits too, they might be good, ESPECIALLY the forums of the owners sites. Don't only take my word for it but I bought mine only 1 week ago and am not complaining.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've had experience with card #1 and #2 you listed.
<br/>
<br/>
EZF-Advance has fewer parts and you can upload ROMs directly to your GBA rather than having to write to an external card docking device in the EZ-Flash II package. Write times to EZF-Advance is also shorter than its many counterparts (approx 5 minutes for a full write). I find this more convenient.
<br/>
<br/>
Reliability for both cards are the same.
<br/>
<br/>
However... As you may already know, EZ-Flash II PowerStar has a 1.8v memory chip as opposed to the 3.3v used in almost all other cards, which allows for ~5 hours longer battery life (GBA SP). This more than makes up for the extra few minutes it takes to write ROMs to the card.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I like the EZ-Flash II PowerStar card the best. At the time of this post, mwelectronics.com does not offer these cards, and <a href="http://www.e2city.com" target="_blank">www.e2city.com</a> has them at unbeatable prices.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys. 
<br/>
<br/>
1.I heard that the new Flash2Advance Ultra card has been made from a "special material" wich uses less power, and It has some special buttons called "unlimited revival". Any comment?
<br/>
<br/>
2.Is it true that you cannot put (it does not fit in) any other cart except the one you get in the package in the EZ flash 2 Powerstar writer as I read on the gbadev.org test page? Because the producer says you can backup games but that is impossible if they cannot fit in the writer.
<br/>
<br/>
3. ".........6. The new F2A Ultra also comes with a new flash writer program (supports Zip archive, Cheat, and with both English and Chinese interface. Further more, now you can add games to the Flash Cart, without rewrite the entire cart from the beginning). And new GBA starting-up program will gradually upgrade into a mini operating system, providing a Windows like interface, so that users can not just use the F2A Ultra playing games, listening music, watching video and eBook , but will be also able to run applications like education software." ......
<br/>
<br/>
Any comments about that, that this is the only cart you can add games to the Flash Cart, without rewriting  the entire cart from the beginning like with other carts. And what is this "windows like interface"? 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"Unlimited Revival" means that you can save you game at any time, regardless whether the game actually allows you to save at that point.  This comes in very handy for a great number of games that do not allow you to save at any time.
<br/>
<br/>
I just recently bought a F2A &amp; Linker package (not Ultra) and I can not say enough good things about it.  Load F2A Writer software, plug in the cable and everything works right away on my 3 year old laptop and fairly new desktop.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as "special" materials go, no clue, all I know is that the power consumption of the F2A (non-ultra) doesn't seem to be all that great, I have not had mine for too long, but so far I failed to notice any difference between F2A vs. no-F2A, of course I never really go 10 hours without to plug in either.
<br/>
<br/>
Adding games without to rewrite your card is a gimmick imho, don't let your decision which to buy be influcenced by that, simply because it is not an overly practical feature anyway.  I mean you load games, you play them, you can write your save files back to HD and load new games.  The whole saving and writing process takes like 3 minutes, you may save a few seconds by being able to add to a card rather than rewrite it.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have the cash, go for the 1GB F2AU, I have the 256Mb one, and I found that it will sometimes not hold two 128Mb games, many of the latest releases are 128Mb tho, so you are "stuck" with one 128Mb one and one or two 64Mb ones.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I also heard and read bad stuff about F2A non-ultra.
<br/>
<br/>
What do you think about F2A Ultra? Do you think I should buy that instead of EZ-Flash 2 Powerstar?
<br/>
<br/>
What about 512M? Do you think that would do?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I am sure when searching the net, or even this forum, you can find any number of negative experiences for each of the mainstream cards.  Some people get faulty equipment, some have screwed up computers they connect their cards to, for some the dog chewed the linker cable through, whatever.
<br/>
<br/>
I have had my F2A non-ultra for a couple weeks, and I have had zero problems with the card itself, the linker cable, or the writer software.
<br/>
<br/>
If I were to buy a new card right now, I would buy an F2A-Ultra, simply because the "save anytime", the realtime clock, and the large capacity seem like an excellent combination of features.
<br/>
<br/>
I am also not saying 256Mb is not enough, just saying that you may not be able to fit two 128Mb games on there at one time.  Which is ok when it comes down to it, because you can have one extensive 128Mb one and two fun 64Mb ones.  I checked into it, and seems like quite a few new titles are still 64Mb (i.e.: Advance Wars 2).  If you are on a budget, then go with 256 as your first card, after a year or so, when you feel it is really not enough, or when the releases start to get larger you can always get a bigger one.  If you have the cash, go big! ;)
<br/>
<br/>
From my experience I would buy an F2AU any day, but I am sure that many others swear by their EZF cards.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great thread, after some morning reading I came up with the exact same 3 linkers that I wanted to buy to replace my failed FA linker (yes, the original one).
<br/>
<br/>
I do still have a few questions though, for people in the know (why can't I find a FAQ on all this...):
<br/>
<br/>
1. EZF-ADVANCE 256M flash cart set
<br/>
<br/>
It seems this is the best all around set, and it definitely has a pro in that you don't need to remove the cart from the linker. But, what are battery times like? My old FA cart definitely drains the batteries faster than a regular cart (like 3-4 times as fast). The power consumption is the #1 reason for me to get...
<br/>
<br/>
2. EZ-FLASH II PowerStar 256M Cart set
<br/>
<br/>
So, apart from the cart-swap thing, are there any other known issues with this one? Like, save patches etc, the things I wanted to get rid of along with my old FAL. It seems that
<br/>
<br/>
3. FLASH2ADVANCE ULTRA 256M Cart with USB linker set 
<br/>
<br/>
can do all types of saves etc, but It also seems like there are a lot of issues with this one still. Can anyone confirm that there are issues with the 256M version or is it just the 1Gbit version that is buggy?
<br/>

I realize that lots of people are haveing problems with the 1Gb cartridge......however, mine works just fine. I filled it with about 1020 Mbit of Games and they all work. Also, this is the second time I wrote a fullGb onto the cartridge. The first time they also worked well. Of course it's a bit stupid that the cartridge cannot be formatted by the software and that the games cannot be renamed....but other than that it seems fine....

1. Currently FLASH2ADVANCE ULTRA 1GB cart is not a very good option since it has a lot of bugs and lossy software. Hope they will work out the problems.

2. EZF-ADVANCE is very good choice because it supports almoust all the functions (real-time,....) but it's only in 128 and 256 format and it's "a little bit older" than other two, but that doesn't mean it's bad.

3. What about EZ-Falsh 2 PowerStar? Nobody said nothing about that! Is it good? The 1.8v chip promises longer battery life and it also has real-time clock,etc... But those are just promises.....what about real life experience?

I had an EZ-F Advance and was very happy with it. It was just too small for me....Just as an update to my previous post: I rewrote the cartridge completely again....just under 1Gb and all is well again. I also restored savegames from the old games and one savefile from a gameI played on the PC (VBA). That all worked fine.

3.3V, but that's not really the point. Original carts use ROM memory (requires very little power), while flash carts use flash memory (requires much power).

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Actually I usually use original carts and just take flash carts for the travel.

<br/>
The GBA consumes about 100mA. A normal 3.3V flash cart consumes about 50mA. The PS utilise a step down converter to get 1.8V, this reduces the power consumption to 1.8/3.3=54% of a normal flash cart. 50mA*0.54=27mA.
<br/>
So, a GBA with a normal flashcart consume 100+50=150mA while a GBA with a PS consume 100+27=127mA. This amounts to about 10 hours of battery life for a normal flashcart and about 12 hours of battery life for a PS. Original carts gives you a battery life of about 15hours.
<br/>
<br/>
This is for a normal GBA or a GBA SP with the light off.
<br/>
The GBA SP backlight will add another 50mA to the power consumption, thus reducing the difference in battery life between the PS and a normal flashcart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking about getting either the EZFA or F2A Ultra, and would really like to use them in the GameBoy Player so that I can view them on my big screen TV.
<br/>
<br/>
If both of these work in GB Player, does one work better than the other ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">EZFA definitely works. And F2A Extreme works also. I haven't tried F2A Ultra but it should work fine because all the hardwares for GBA can be used with GB player. 
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I don't think there is any difference between them on GB player.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I just tried the EZ2 PS 512 with the same configuration. 
<br/>
My GBA SP lasted around 6 hour 30 minutes this time.
<br/>
<br/>
So if you care about the battery time, just go with
<br/>
256 carts and PS won't make any real difference.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">IMHO, power comsumption of logic circuits is dissipated in two ways. one is the DC power, which is used to power-up the the card, and the other is the switching states during every clock period. For the first way, if the new card uses a DC-DC switching converter to lower the power supply to 1.8V, the efficiency of is about 95%, so there is some advantage for 1.8V chip over 3.3V chip. However, 1.8V signals has to be level shifted to fit a 3.3V GBA machine. So you need some power to support these extra circuits, which could just consume more power. I guess that is why the EFA or EZFII PS card is even worse than the original 3.3V chip in terms of power consumption. By the way, EZFII PS card is not an upgrade of EZFA, as they are cards made by two companies. They are competitors, not partners.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is it any good? i know that you may have already said it as one of the ez flash... or something, but i don't know! Also, there are lots of different things about each one, but in my case (up to US$100 to spend) i have no idea. Oh, and I live in Britain, so do they post it here?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. Right now, the best choice is EZF-Advance 256Mb. The only thing that puts her infront is that you don't have to remove the cart from GBA like EZ-Flash 2 PowerStar so you can imediatelly check if flashing was successful. 
<br/>
<br/>
2. I also had the chance of trying EZ-Flash 2 PowerStar 256Mb and I can say it's a great card, but the "low voltage" doesn't really make any difference, just the price is higher than other two carts. 
<br/>
<br/>
3. My friend bought Flash2Advance 256Mb ULTRA and said that it's ok and works well with all the basic needs, but still "lacks the stability" (i think he was talking about bugs) of EZF-ADVANCE. i cannot confirm that, because I didn't had a chance to try it.
<br/>
<br/>
Let's see what the "flash-world" has to say about that.
