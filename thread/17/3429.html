<br/>
<br/>
  i'm sitting here trying to get this Flash2Advance USB linker to work, but the USB drivers aren't being recognized when i specify where they are on my hdd in the wizard that pops up when the cable is plugged in.
<br/>
<br/>
i'm specifying where they're clearly at, but they're just not being found for some reason!!
<br/>
<br/>
is there any way to manually install the drivers rather than going through this way?
<br/>
<br/>
my drivers are EZUSB.SYS, EZUSB2.SYS, and F2AUSB.INF
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for any help</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've had to uninstall the drivers and reinstall before... this might be what you're experiencing
<br/>
<br/>
Go to Control Panels &gt; System &gt; Hardware Manager
<br/>
<br/>
Then find the thing under the USB tree, right click and UNINSTALL.
<br/>
<br/>
You may have to do this two or three times.
<br/>
<br/>
Then plug the cable back in and go through it all again. When it barks at you about "Driver is not digitally signed" be sure to say "Install anyway."
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
well, I've just installed mine, and it worked ok. But my driver is named EZUSB_XP.SYS and resides in a XP_2000-directory. Maybe you simply have the wrong driver?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">positive i have the right drivers... i downloaded ones that were labeled as being fixed for XP from both the official F2A site and elsewhere, nothing works...
<br/>
<br/>
the set works fine on my laptop (win 98) but it's kind of a pain and i'd rather have it on my desktop.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
