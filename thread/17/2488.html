The best i have is 75 $US from <a href="http://www.success.hk.com," target="_blank">www.success.hk.com,</a> which is good for me, but with air mail shipping it's 88 $US (which means 115 $Can. for me).  Do you know a better deal ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey man, where in Canada do you live?
<br/>
<br/>
I am also looking into buying a EZF 128meg.  I was also looking at <a href="http://www.success.hk.com," target="_blank">www.success.hk.com,</a> it seems to be the cheepest site.  I was also looking on ebay, some people are selling theirs for like 90 for the 256meg.
<br/>
<br/>
On thing you have to worry about is the border taxes, as you said, its only 115 canadian, but once it crosses the border, there mayt be additional charges, I live in toronto and I know that once it gets here from hongkong, it will be a lot more then 115</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the flash cards are in megabits right? so if you get a 128 card thats only 16 megs, you cant really do much with that.  Also, the 256 is like 20 bucks more, so you might as well go all out,
<br/>
<br/>
If you get the 128 thats 16megs, and then the booter or your OS will also take up a meg or two, so your really not left with that much to work with
<br/>
<br/>
just some thoughts

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Seems like the EZF-Advance is the best bet for you as you won't wear down the cart by taking it in and out of the linker. Also the USB-GBA/SP cable doubles as a multiboot cable for testing code quickly.
