<br/>
People who own both a Nintendo DS and either a GBA, GBA SP, or Game Boy Player should look into Flash2Advance, if only for PogoShell.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think there is no "best" system. We have different systems, yes...but "best"... ?
<br/>
<br/>
EZ-Flash3 (not EZF-Advance III) is no problem using together with nds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I remember originally (I guess when only he and dovoto could even run code :) ) Joat mentioned that he couldn't get the EZFA to work. But I think that is the only complaint I've heard since then.
<br/>
<br/>
On the above list, the only really quirky one seems to be that Magic Flash 256. Would definately stay away from that. Also, the EZ-Flash III seems to have an issue that the EZ-Flash II doesn't have. I remember someone mentioning that III wasn't really produced by the same company. Any truth to that? I could also have them confused.. as all these carts sound the same.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, of course, stay away from the supercard type things.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, the EZFA has been confirmed to work if you take off the MultiRom option when no roms are on the cartridge after formatting.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
