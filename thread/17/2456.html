    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have you tried the search option? It might help.. And you might want to post what kind of flash cart you have and the specs for your computer, in case anyone else has the same problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Those things might help you (and others also).<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah I get this often as well with my USB Flash Linker.
<br/>
What I usually do in this case is I go to Start/Control Panel, click on System and then choose Hardware tab. Here I click on Device Manager and you should see your GBA USB device with an icon showing there is a problem. Then I just disable the driver and enable it again. And then everything works fine until next reboot... Strange but efficient !
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I run it on XP... Good luck !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
