<br/>
<br/>
I'm developing some microcontroller software and thought it would be fun to port it to the old gameboy/gameboy color. I do have one of those old bung linkers, but it's in my appartment in Europe, and I'm currently in Australia. 
<br/>
<br/>
So my question is, does anyone know where I can find an old bung linker, or perhaps a gb-bridge (I did bring my ez flash advance with me)  ? 
<br/>
<br/>
Any help other than 'google for it' and 'check ebay' is appreciated. If anyone has either of these things lying around and wants to sell it to me I'd be very interested. 
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The store I last saw a GB Bridge at apparently no longer sells them, so I can't link you to them.  However, Rob Webb appears to still sell some old-style GB and GBC flash carts, which you may be interested in.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
