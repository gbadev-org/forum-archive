    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just recieved a EZF Advance III reader and 2 256M cards.  The drivers say they have installed fine and Windows XP make the little jingle when I plug it in as if its working but I get nothing.  The Device Manager notices it and says its fine, but the Lillte LED on the Reader itself does not turn on.  I could really use some help please...
