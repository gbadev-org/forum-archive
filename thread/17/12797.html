    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hmm Its my understanding you can get a flash memory for either slot... I'll be honest.. I'm not a fan of piracy &gt;.&lt; But, I do think some of the hacks for ds are pretty cool.. the Dsphone, the irc chatting ect ect.
<br/>
<br/>
So.. if I get a flash drive will it matter which slot it is for? if I decide to get the opera browser (not released in america yet to my knowledge anymore) along with other stuff will it matter which slot its for?
<br/>
<br/>
Also.. I plan on getting a ds lite so I want to make sure they aren't programmed differently or something.. will it matter which slot I get it for?
<br/>
<br/>
I would like at 1 or 2 gigs incase I decide to throw a movie on there or something
<br/>
<br/>
I would also like the card reguardless of which kind to not be bulky one version I saw a few online that had some sort of bulky thing stickin out.. and my first thought is that I would screw that up.. it would break in my pocket.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">opera browser requires both slots anyway, so that wont matter (slot 2 is a memory expansion type thing, slot 1 is the program itself)
<br/>
<br/>
I think the slot 1 cards are more popular now. .  but you can get slot 2s that dont stick out of lites at all (eg supercard lite)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Only if the author of the software you want to run has designed it to only work on a slot-1 media.
<br/>
<br/>
But, that doesn't take the future into account.  When using a slot-2 device (with FlashMe) you have an empty slot-1 that can be used for the current NDS Motion Card or DSerial.  If you have have a slot-1 device, you have to take it out to insert either of these options, which you will no longer have read/write access to your media (obviously).  But, as slot-1 soltion acceptance continues to grow and they become fully homebrew compatible, then we will see more slot-2 addons and the reverse will be true.
<br/>
<br/>
So basically, you have to decide if you want what is available now, or want to look toward the future and what "may" be available then.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Pros use slot 1.  In theory you could flash it to an official card, but I don't think that means much here.  Slot 1 can scan slot 2.  Slot 2 could scan itself, but that is not exciting.  (Then again, it could scan slot 1.)

Run in a future DS 2 that doesn't have a GBA slot perhaps?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
