I think that answers your question quite nicely. Some brands ARE interchangeable, others are not. It just depends on who designed them. An F2A is very close to the old first-generation Visoly carts. However, don't go thinking a EZFA linker will overwrite a F2A cart...<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It would help to know what cart he has in the first place then. He didn't say anything about that and replied directly to my post instead. 
<br/>
<br/>
So what kind of cart do you have?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry, I didn't say the cart I have.  It is an XG-Flash2 Lite 128mb.

BTW, why does the GBA freeze at startup when I hold L, R, Select and Start?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
