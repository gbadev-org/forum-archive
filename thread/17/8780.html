    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I plan to get a linker cable this weekend and I had two quick questions :
<br/>
<br/>
1) For small demos and such all I need is a linker cable right ? That will work for up to 256k ? And then any larger and you have to get a cart ?
<br/>
<br/>
2) Does the site affiliate link to linker4u or other sites ? Meaning, if I click on a link on the site when I buy, the site is supported ? 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any answers.....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you have a small demo (under about 250 KB), and it is designed for multiboot, then it will work with just a linker cable (on GBA, GBA SP, or Game Boy Player only) or just a GBA Movie Player (and CF card). But not all small demos are designed for multiboot, either because they need to use EWRAM as scratch space or because the developer was lazy.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
