<br/>
<br/>
The loader might be finding programs in the space after the ROMs, which wasn't entirely erased when you rewrote it with just two small ROMs.
<br/>

If you're using a 256 MB F2A cart, I recommend PogoShell over the loader that comes with the F2A (which is probably no more sophisticated than the old "bluescreen" loader that came with Visoly carts).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
