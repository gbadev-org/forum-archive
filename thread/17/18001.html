    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I've been trying to get my Flash2Advance Linker to work, but can't. I have both Ubuntu and Windows XP Professional so if you have any knowledge on how to install the Drivers for the Flash2Advance USB linker on either Linux or Windows That would help me out a ton.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I have the drivers installed but I read somewhere it needed some extra drivers outside it's own to work. What other ones do I need? Maybe you could create a ZIP file that contains instructions and all the Drivers and Software I need to Read and Write the the Flash2Advance 256M cart. 
<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to ask any questions.
<br/>
<br/>
I greatly appreciate your help in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SO basically I can use my NDS to write and read to the Flash2Advance 256m cart? I can still use the Flash2Advance USB linker and the Cart the only thing different will be the software and instead of a Gameboy it will be a DS?
<br/>
<br/>
Also I am assuming the software you mentioned is easy to install. For instance when you download it, it clearly and accurately describes how to properly install it and/or it comes with all the Drivers/Software or tells me exactly where to get them? 
<br/>
<br/>
The only reason why I can't get the Flash2Advance software to work is because I have gone to a couple different websites trying to find one that tells me how to properly install it and none of them do. I know it comes with a instruction manual on how to install it, but even if I follow every detail it still doesn't work for me.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Just looked this up on the website
