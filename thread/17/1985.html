    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i have recently purchased an XG-Flash from console Plus
<br/>
Anyway I plug it into the linker and normally It recognises the cart straight away but it hasn't for the passed two days. I fear Its the linker that's faulty but carn't rule out the software.

Anyone had this problem and if so how did they solve it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's not only that but the games I have now on it keeps crashing but I think this proves it's the cart not the software or the writter but without me being able to write to it there is no way I can format it. Rats. I hope I can get a replacement. I think Im' passed my chances of getting this thing to work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If you had, you should check if one of the component in the upper left corner doesn't miss. I had the same problem, i couldn't write the cart cause when you open the cart it tear off one of the component. That's why they now sale a new design with an easier way to change the battery. I'am gonna try to fix the component to see if it works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
