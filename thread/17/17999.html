i7 with 16GB dual channel and discrete video card

i7 with 12GB triple channel and discrete video card
<br/>
Pentium 3 450 with 384MB PC100, AGP 2X, USB 1.1 (PCI card for USB 2.0)
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to retire that Pentium 3 box, but it has a parallel port and that is what my flash device uses.
<br/>
<br/>
I know there are USB to parallel adapters out there, but the manufacturers of some say they are for printing only (perhaps unidirectional?). Some do claim bidirectional support, but I have not found one claiming even Zip drives would work. So I was wondering if anyone has had success with a USB to parallel adapter when working with GB games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've the same problem, although I am just using the parallel port for sending over multiboot games.
<br/>
<br/>
Therefore I have on old laptop with a parallell port and BartPe disk with working software to keep sending those multiboot games.
<br/>
<br/>
I also tried to get it working with an usb to parallel adapter with my cable, but sadly I couldn't get it to work.<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
