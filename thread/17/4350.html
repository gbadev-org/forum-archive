    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was browsing some info on the EZF Advance carts (hopefully one is winging its way to me soon) and noticed that it said with game roms being somewhere between 32 and 64Mb you can get 4 to 8 on a 256 cart at once. Now the few demos I've made or seen of other peoples so far are minute and even the few Roms I've got are rarely over 10Mb, so is this really a good average figure or are they just covering themselves for extreme circumstances? Or is it that the files will take up more space on a cart for some reason?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Commercial ROMs are at least 32 megabits, which equals 4 megabytes. Up to 32 megabytes of ROMs (minus about 64 kbytes for the bootloader) will fit on a 256 megabit flash card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Aaaaaah *slaps forehead* I'd never made the connection that they are talking in Megabits when talking about the size of Flash Carts. I thought 256 megabytes was a lot for storing GBA games. I used to get confused about the rates of modems too... d'oh!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
