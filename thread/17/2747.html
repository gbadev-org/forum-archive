Hi everybody, I'll try to make it short.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to use a GBA as a controller on the USB port.
<br/>
I guess there's an API to do this kind of things, so as i am a REAL
<br/>
beginner in the GBA world, i hope somebody here could help me.
<br/>
I have strong knowledge of C/C++, the only problem is I have no
<br/>
documentations about how the USB port works. I think this could be
<br/>
possible without hardware addition, because all the USB protocol is
<br/>
already managed by the little chip in the cable.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is my idea: I want to use the USB cable and a GBA to display
<br/>
an audio playlist while I am in my car (the GBA is connected to a laptop,
<br/>
the laptop is connected, under a seat,  to the car audio system).
<br/>
It will allow me to control the sound with the small GBA graphic
<br/>
screen much more easily than with a laptop 15'inch screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This would be possible, but unfortunately nobody really knows how to communicate with the F2A and other USB-&gt;GBA cables. It's no problem to write the GBA side, it's just not known how to develop a PC-side program for it. You would be able to do it using an old parallel F2A cable (if your laptop has a parallel port, or using a USB-&gt;parallel conversion cable), however, as the programming interface for that is known.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
