    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got a 256MB card last year and everything was good for 2 months then when I tried to connect it again on the third month it wouldn't connect, I kindof forgot about it but now I want to use it again and I have the same problem.  Every time I connect it to my computer it says usb device not reconginized and says it might be damage.  It didn't take any falls that I could have seen and it didn't get wet.
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried the other wire and it did nothing and ive uninstalled and reinstalled this thing 100 times, I was able to get it connected for a couple of seconds yesterday but that was it. It read the card and I was atempting to write and only got 35% into it.  any help will greatly be appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
