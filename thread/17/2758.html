    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi all i have an ezflash2ps i'm trying to play a game that saves to an eeprom on it.  unfortunately the game is not saving.  any advice on what i can do to make the game save?  i feel maybe it requires either a patch to the loader or a patch to the rom itself.  any advice appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do SRAM based games save properly? If so, you probably need a patch.
