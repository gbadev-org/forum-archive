    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now that the big N has made things difficult, I haven't found any stores that are selling GBA flash cards.  I'm looking for reasonably priced small flashable carts for GBA.  Anybody have a source where you can still get them?
<br/>
<br/>
I know links to retailers aren't allowed here, so if you do have source, maybe respond and describe the product and price, then PM me with the retailer information?  If the retailer exists in the retailer feedback section, you could link to them.

Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Are they the standard ones that you can write to using splink and a parallel cable?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I still have them. They are EFA LC 512Mbit cartridges. Top quality. I know the writing software works in Windows XP...not sure if it works in other versions of Windows.

<br/>
I'm open to offers...
