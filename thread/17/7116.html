    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there an actual store that sells M3 (I don't need PassKey)? I want it, because my aunt is travelling there this month and I want to get one (some people don't let you buy from online stores, damn!)
<br/>
<br/>
And a side-question: Can I expect CF I/O for M3? Buying it for movies only is a bit waste of money...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wish GBAmp had at least 20 fps at 256x192.
<br/>
Do you think MoonLight will be capable of doing this on his MoonShell (currently it run 12fps :( )
<br/>
<br/>
I want movies (PlayYan'd be great, but...) and homebrew.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
