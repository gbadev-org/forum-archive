    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">other things:
<br/>
<br/>
i don't know if i can put the save files into the flash cart with f2a, i know that the fza let's you easily put the save file into a rom and back-up it but I don0t know if it is possible with f2a
<br/>
<br/>
another thin i have read is that you got to use sometimes a program to convert the roms to eeproms i don't know :-s
<br/>
<br/>
