    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi There.
<br/>
<br/>
I just bought a flasch2advance usb link cable and have problems programming the flashcard.(265mb pro)
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried several versions of the driver,on win98 and xp.All versions of the software and about 20 romfiles.
<br/>
<br/>
What happence is that during programming the card a burn error occurs.
<br/>
And with the same rom file it always happence at the same point.
<br/>
<br/>
If I use romfile a of 32mbit it stops at block 19
<br/>
romfile b stops at 12 eg.
<br/>
<br/>
Also connected an adaptor to the gba to insure there is enough power.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know what is going on here?
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you can help me.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there other software I can use to program the card with my f2a?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Also, check in the options if fix data is set.
<br/>
I also had problems with mine today(got it today...), but I've downloaded from the flash2advance site the latest Usb driver and the Usb software(only for USB, as the one furnished is a generic software).
<br/>
Everything got fine then.
<br/>
Uninstall the driver you have and reinstall the new one manually. Then launch the exe.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope it will be enough to solve your problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I did all that.
<br/>
<br/>
What I think is strange is that the errors alway occur al the same block #
<br/>
for a file.
<br/>
<br/>
another file stops at another #
<br/>
<br/>
hope to solve this problem soon 8-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
