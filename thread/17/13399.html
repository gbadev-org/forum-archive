    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hmm, wouldnt it be possible to make carts, like originals, availeble, so homebrewers can buy, and, from some serial solder points or something, program with theyre game, test, and then they assemble it, slap a sticker on there, and voila, a rwal gamecart with theyre game, so theyre icon shows on the ds, with their textm and not the r4ds first, and then you have to boot it from there, anyone gets what im suggesting?
<br/>
<br/>
like a "assemble your own HB carts for selling/giving away"
<br/>
<br/>
should be cheap, be able to choose from availeble cart sizes and eeprom save sizes, and of course, buy in surplus, 200 pcs at a time
<br/>
of course, someone with alot of money will have to take this project on, im just bringing the idea ^^<br/>_________________<br/>Starter of the project TrueLoveDS :D

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, not exactly ds linker, it wouldnt have any sort of os, like an m3 simply or anything, only the game/app code, so it would be almost like an original cart.
<br/>
<br/>
you would "burn" the rom (homebrew), and as soon as youve put it in its casing, its non writable, only your homebrew cart :)
<br/>
<br/>
its only and idea for hardware developers, like natrium42?
<br/>
<br/>
lets say, the cart itself would cost same as an original cart, with game 30-50$, and you have to buy them surplus (maybe a single sample first, for the price of one) in packs of 20, 50 , 100, 200, etc
<br/>
<br/>
someone could make serious money of this, if it becomes something wanted, i for one, would love making cartridges of my future apps/games and sell/give away, and i wouldnt mind oaying several hundreds of dollars for that :)
<br/>
<br/>
so i brought this topic up so someone makes it reality XD

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good luck.  Look at the R4DS/M3 Simply.  If manufacturing a cart was cheap, why would M3 cut a deal with the manufacturer to reduce cost?
<br/>
<br/>
I think you will find that if you are able to talk a manufacture into producing carts that can't be used for piracy they will require you to pay for all production cost (which won't be cheap, as they have to setup machines to produce your specific product) as well as purchase in HUGE quantities.  And I'm not talking 1,000..  Probably more like 10,000.  And even if they could (which they probably wouldn't) sell you the cards at $5 each, your talking $50,000 + shipping wich would probably be another $1,000.
<br/>
<br/>
The only way you will see a "cheap" homebrew card is if homebrewers make it.  It would be like the passme, where some schlub (like me) is sitting in a room soldering chips all day long, woundering how he got himself into this mess to begin with.
<br/>
<br/>
That won't happen until the elite few that know how to produce the card encryption make it available in a format the rest of us can understand and use.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The thing is, I don't see why anybody would really want to sell their code. If they would, then it wouldn't really be homebrew. Would one be selling their game on carts so people without homebrew capability would be able to play the game? If this is the case, wouldn't it be better to get them to buy a flashcart so they can support more homebrew games? Or would they be selling the game for a slight profit?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, wouldn't it be less convenient if homebrew games were distributed on carts? At the moment I like the idea of having loads of homebrew games on my Supercard SD without having to carry loads of cartridges. Of course, this post if completely irrelevant if developers also release their games for download, but not if they choose solely to sell their games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
But there's the contradiction, somebody developing a program as a hobby certainly wouldn't need compensation for their time, as they would be primarily doing it for their own gratification in their own time no? I don't know, I always thought of a homebrew community as a community of developers and players who make games because they want to, helping each other through the process and supporting developers by using their games and applications, but for free. I always thought that homebrew developers wanted to create a game or application for others to use for free to support the community, I thought that was the "special" aspect of the homebrew community, that everything was free and that people did it because they wanted to let the scene grow and to provide more software for people.
<br/>
<br/>
I do however definately see the view that full-time homebrew developers need compensation for their time, especially people like yourself who have contributed countless time to the scene with applications such as DSOrganise. I just never thought of the money-aspect of the scene before and how it affects full-time developers, interesting I guess :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I said nothing about any need.  Hobbyists make money at their hobbies all the time.  What about people that make furniture for a hobby.  They don't just give away their creations, even though it was fun.  What about people that paint for a hobby?  They sell their work.  If you look at most hobbies, it's the norm to make money at it while still enjoying it.  What's so special about homebrew that states you can't have fun developing with it but still earn extra cash?

This is flat out not true.  Unless you beg for donations you don't get them.  I don't want anyone to take this as a lame attempt to lash out at anyone or beg for anything.  I am just letting you know that people will generally demand support for free.  Just to give you an idea, I've recieved five donations to date for DSOrganize.  I also haven't recieved any hardware donations.  Yet, whenever a new card or card revision comes out, I'm assaulted with requests to make it work.  Same goes for the new DSLite wifi, etc.  The only donation offers I get are rediculous ones like "If you make DSO display pictures in web browser I'll give you $20!!!"<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

Profit or no profit, it's easier to provide a game card with your homebrew on it for $15 (if that's possible with you making a little profit) than to suggest someone purchase a $40 + $10 media card.  Plus, if you wanted to send out copies to friends/family as well as present your homebrew to publishers.  But, you don't want to go broke sending them out at $50 each for media adapters.

That's fine if SimonB doesn't care about my suggestion. I believe that quote was in reference to not tolerating a user asking how to "get X game running on your gba flash setup", I certainly hope I didn't imply that's what I was talking about. I was discussing the convenience of having all homebrew games on the same flashcart as opposed to using produced homebrew carts, I wasn't asking anyone how to do this or that.

It's more about convenience rather than the price of a game card wallet, of having all your homebrew games in the Nintendo DS so you don't need anything else to carry around, or keep switching cartridges when playing different homebrew games and applications. But I guess if a developer wants to sell their software and chooses to sell it via downloading, then he's only opening himself up to piracy easier.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
While I don't think that the cards from NeoFlash discussed in the second link are ideal, I do think that low capacity flash cards from some commercial manufacturer are ultimately a more likely proposition than homemade write-once cards.
<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping that the small 128MB N-Card would pan out, but it looks like those are no longer being made.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it's only a matter of time in my opinion before some good solution becomes available.  I'm actually working on a game that I plan to sell on flashed cards whenever they do become available.  It's a very long-term project, but hopefully by the 2008 holidays the game will be done and a card to write it to will be available.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't plan to sell the game for a profit (though it's still early in development...maybe I'll change my mind after working on it for a year and a half).  In my opinion, that's not the real point of selling homebrew games in this way.  I just think it would be cool.  I can certainly understand the attraction Rajveer mentions of having all your games on one cart, but in my opinion, at the same time there's also an attraction to having a single game on its own media complete with a case and manual.  I've been buying my games that way for too long not to feel an attachment to it, so it only feels natural for me that a homebrew game that I work very hard on should have the same treatment.
<br/>
<br/>
It's also a fact that selling homebrews this way would expand the market for our games greatly.  Yes, you could try to convince everybody to buy a flash kit and play your game that way, but that sort of thing only works to a limited extent.  Having your game for sale on a card that anyone with a DS could just buy and play right away without any other variables is much more effective.  Also, it seems to me that a homebrew game sold in this way would get more attention.  Homebrew games are often treated as throw-aways.  Even very good games sort of seem to get lost in the shuffle and don't get the attention they deserve from people who can play them.  It seems like more people would actually *PLAY* your game if it was on a card just like other commercial DS games than would if they were downloading it like all the other homebrew out there.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know about those topics.  If you don't plan to make a profit, that is great.  If you do, they aren't.  Once you add the cost of the card+shipping, and then try to make a few bucks, good luck selling your homebrew.  You have to keep in mind that full commercial games can be purchased for $20.  You have to give the buyer a reason to pick your $25 homebrew game over a $20 commercial game.
<br/>
<br/>
The components that make up these cards don't cost more then $8 (just a guess from past experience in small quantities), but add development, manufacturing, distribution and you end up at $15-$20..  Flash your game to it and your in the $25 range just to make $5 profit.  That is, if you can sell it.
<br/>
<br/>
So, the real topic here is homebrew.  What would it take to create a homebrew flash card?  Really?  Not much, if you have the encryption needed to talk to the DS.  I believe that is the only thing stopping it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
There's absolutely nothing preventing homebrew games of the same quality and scale seen in even the best commerical releases.  It's just a matter of whether the homebrew coders in the scene have a desire to actually create a game as opposed to just a gameplay engine.  That would require spending most of your time on stuff other than pure programming, like level design and scenario plotting.  Some of the people working on games are also pretty good graphics artists, but for me, art is also a limiting factor, but I'm hoping I'll be able to find a good artist or two once I have my game's main gameplay engines in a good working state, so that there's something to show.

That would be fine, too, but I'd prefer to write it to cards and sell them.
<br/>
<br/>
For games that don't take up much space, the cards from NeoFlash look like they'll be a good option in the meantime, assuming the issues KiethE mentioned are worked out.  A bit expensive, in my opinion, given their size, but not too expensive to make them unusable.

Quality, maybe.. scale?  Hmm.. Homebrew games normaly consist of one programmer.. and with the "bigger" projects you have three or four people working together..

What is the average number of people involved with a commercial game?  What is the average time frame for it to make it to market?

Well, that's not a very big concern for me.  Three commercial homebrew games will be released this year for the Dreamcast and the Dreamcast has been a "dead' console for five years.  Charles Doty just released Frog Bog for the SNES last month.  New homebrews are released quite often even for the Colecovision and Atari 2600.  In my opinion, the DS is an all-time classic system just like those and people will be playing it for generations to come.  I know I will.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I would prefer to release my game while the DS is still a current console since more people will play it that way.  And I think I will assuming the DS is still a current console in 2009.  I think you're underestimating what can be done if a developer uses available resources more creatively.  Commercial game development is a very wasteful and inefficient process.  Of course, I may be over-estimating what I can do, but only time will tell, right?  I'd rather assume that I can do it and be wrong than assume I can't and not even try.

I'm not really certain, but would assume that the carts he's selling are cannibalized commercial carts anyway, so they would probably still have the original lockout chip on them (assuming the lockout chip is a discrete piece of hardware like that).

Who said profit was the motive?  If we were only concerned with making money, none of us would be here doing this stuff at all, would we?  There would be no homebrew scene.  Instead we'd all be hanging out on investment forums or something trying to screw each other over for a penny.
