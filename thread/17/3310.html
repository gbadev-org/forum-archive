    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey guys i know noob question but how exactly does the flashing process work? would i be correct in assuming that you just hook the usb cable into a port on a computer, run software and it images (essentially) the game onto the computer or vice versa? i was looking at a website ti get a  flasher with 256 mb is that enough or should i look for a 512 mb card? thanks for the help guys.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe those are 256 Mega bits not 256 Megabytes. So in that case its probably a lot smaller than you thought. However I believe the largest commercial cart used is 128 Mbits. (Final Fantasy Tactics)
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to have more than one games on your system then get the bigger one but I don't think anyone needs more than 128Mbits.
<br/>
<br/>
It is flashed by connecting your card to your computer. I've got the EZ Flash Advance 128 and it connects to the linkport on my GBA and then to the computer with a usb cord. There are other connectors that can connect to your parallel or rs232 ports. 
<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend getting the 128 because that's really all you need. Try searching the forum there are many discussions about this very subject. (which one to get)
<br/>
<br/>
Well I hope you understand a bit better what you may need if you plan to develop for the GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
