    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I just got my 128 EZF Advance USB set in the mail.  I am having trouble writing to the cart.  Every time I try loading a game, the software just hangs.  When I turn the GBA on, the multiboot menu shows up, but once I choose a game, the screen turns white, and nothing happens.  
<br/>
<br/>
I can successfully dump my GBA games, but when I try writing them on the flash card I run into problems.  I know the dumping function works, because the copy of Golden Sun I dump works with VisualBoy Advance.
<br/>
<br/>
Has this happened to anyone?  Am I just being impatient with the writing process?  The EZF Adv USB set said it only takes 42s to write a 64M game, but I have not had success even after a few minutes.  Please help me out.  Thanks for your time.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been experiencing pretty much the same problem as you are. When I try to write a game to the cart, the software just hangs and stays there forever. 
<br/>
<br/>
The software could detect the cart and it could even dump games onto my pc, but it wont write games onto the cart. I've tried everything from reinstalling the driver and the client software (and used older versions of the software), I even used a different pc to burn the games but it just wont work.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows how to fix this problem please help us.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My EZF-Advance 256 arrived today.  I managed to get my save games off my cartridges but when I tried to write to the supplied 256mb cart it doesnt appear to do anything.  I think it is actually copying stuff but just at a very slow rate - I tried to copy pogoshell across and while I have on one occasion been able to get it to open, the files I copied with it were not fully copied and just gave me a white screen or in the case of an ebook file, garbled text.  
<br/>
<br/>
I have emailed the guy at ezf-advance so hopefully I will get a reply on this soon.  If I find a solution I'll post it here.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has already found a fix or knows the cause of the problem it would be much appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
btw I'm using Win 2K and the latest v0.99 ezf software if that makes a difference<br/>_________________<br/>I'm shiny...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The first time I flashed the cart successfully using ezfa099b running in XP pro (although the software did seen to hang then too). Tonight tried to re-do it getting rid of some of the games I don't play &amp; adding some others. Flashing seemed to go fine until the end when it said 'Writing to cart' at the bottom for like 15 minutes. I figured the software just hung. I fortamtted the cart &amp; tried it again, same problem. If I turn on the GBA I get the menu with only the first game I sent to the cart - if I choose it I get white screen.
<br/>
The more I think about it, the more I think it must be some sort of software problem with the Client program &amp; XP?? Any one else have this problem?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

PogoShell 1.3 supports carts that use Visoly bankswitching, such as Flash2Advance. The EZ-Flash support doesn't really work yet. Do you have any information as to how EZ-Flash bankswitching works?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just found this excellent site explaining pitfalls for the ez-flash advance loader software. (If a moderator could put this site on FAQ if possible on the cart review). Also, it IS possible to load one game onto the cart with no menu (not tested by me yet).
<br/>
<br/>
This basically is a VERY good instruction manual/FAQ for the kit.
