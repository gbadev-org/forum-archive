    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i have recently found my flash advance cartridge that i lent to my lil bro
<br/>
only prob is i now still have to find my hardware or i'm stuck with the same games forever
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://n64.icequake.net/mirror/64scener.parodius.com/gba/hardware/fal4s.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a> this is what i lost
<br/>
<br/>
unless someone knows of another way to upload roms onto the cart....
<br/>
<br/>
i was looking at using the xploder cheat cart cable but can't seem to get this to work at all? the cable connects into the back of the gameboy advance EXT1 port
<br/>
<br/>
the cable lets you upload codes to the cheat cart so surely this would be possible to send roms to my flash cart??
<br/>
<br/>
any ideas peeps</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do you have an MBV2 cable? The MBV2 software lets you flash, say, a PogoShell image onto a Visoly Flash Advance cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you have an F2A cable? The Visoly Flash Advance 256 Mbit cart is so similar to the F2A 256 Mbit cart that the same software may work.
<br/>
<br/>
It appears LittleWriter can write to many different carts over many different cables.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
