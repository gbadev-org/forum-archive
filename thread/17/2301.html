<br/>
I just got the Flash2Advance USB linker + 256M Flash card; I'm running on WinXP.  I tried to load a game onto the card, following all the instructions.  When I hit "Write Flash", I get:
<br/>
<br/>
Checking ULA...
<br/>
Launch BIOS...
<br/>
i-Linker Found
<br/>
Flash not found!!!
<br/>
<br/>
It almost seems as if the linker is working, but the flash card (brand new) is not.  Has anyone else seen this?  Any tips?  Am I doing something wrong?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this question has been asked before, but I didn't find it when I searched through the board.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I had all sorts of troubles with my F2A and XP when I got it, mainly having to reinstall the drivers everytime I switched the computer on, so I installed the updated drivers for it, and have not had any trouble since.
<br/>
<br/>
I am not at my home computer now, and cant remember the link etc for the drivers, but Im sure its on here somewhere . . . Maybe they will help your problem

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I tried the drivers from the flash2advance site, didn't help.  Then I tried some modified drivers that were mentioned in a post here and referred to a post on emuboards.com.  That didn't help either.
<br/>
<br/>
The weird thing is, after trying many, many times, I've gotten it to work a few times.  I don't understand why it would work sometimes, but not always.
<br/>
<br/>
A good example is when I click on "EraseFlash".  If I click over and over, I usually get repeated error messages.  Sometimes it says "No Adaptor Found!".  Other times it says "Flash Not Found!!!"  And then once in a while, it actually works and takes me to the erase menu.  Then I shout "Yahtzee!"  It seems completely random.  
<br/>
<br/>
If you find the link you're talking about, please let me know.  Maybe the drivers you used are different.  Thanks for your help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just found these links - cant remember if they are the exact links I used, but they cover the problem I was having, and I havent had problems since.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe not specific to your problem, but worth a try anyway . . .

<br/>
This solves problems with using Win XP and the f2a 3.0 software

<br/>
<br/>
This is an update to stop having to reinstall the driver on xp each time you plug the linker in
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
As I say, they may not make a difference as your problems arent quite the same as I was having, but anything is worth a try.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks a ton!  That first link did it.  I saw that file on the f2a site, but it doesn't really explain what it's for or how to use it.
<br/>
<br/>
For the benefit of those that don't know,  the "USB Writer 1.1" (f2a_usb11.zip) on the F2A website is just a version of the F2A Writer that only supports USB.  Works much better for me!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
