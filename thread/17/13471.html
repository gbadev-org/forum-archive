Ask to use your parents' bank card. You don't need a PayPal account to buy from a vendor who takes PayPal, just a valid bank card VISA or MasterCard logo.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Apart from Datel, most makers of DS-compatible flash cards don't have a distribution deal with any major U.S. retail chain. So yes, you do have to shop on the web to get flash cards.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can easily get a Games n' Music, made by Datel.  Now that there's a DLDI patch it's pretty good.  It costs about $40 and I got mine at Best Buy.  Datel also makes the MMD (Max Media Dock) which may or may not be available in your local retailer.  The Games n' Music takes microSD cards and the MMD takes CF/MicroDrive cards.  I only have the Games n' Music (I also have a GBA Movie Player CF v2) and it comes with 128MB microSD, USB 2.0 adapter (works with my USB 1.1 laptop too) and starter software CD, though I'd recommend searching these forums / the Internet for software like MoonShell.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
