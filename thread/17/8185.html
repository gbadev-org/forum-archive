My question is; Because I am using Win98 and when I plug my cart in, the little green arrow that shows up when a USB device has been plugged in doesn't show up in the taskbar by the clock. It happens on 2000/ME/XP and all of the rest, but I don't think it shows up on Win98. So is it okay to just unplug the card when I am done flashing or recharging the battery? Because with every other usb device you must first disable it from the taskbar then you get a confirmation message that's like "It's now safe to remove bla bla bla" and then you remove it.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it okay to just unplug it without disabling it or something first? Won't the hardware in the card mess up or something?
<br/>
<br/>
If someone could clear this up, that'd be great. Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
