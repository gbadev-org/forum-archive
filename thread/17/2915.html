    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys...I have a question that I believe hasn't been mentioned on this forum.
<br/>
<br/>
What if I want or need EXTRA carts for the linker system I have???
<br/>
<br/>
I currently have the EZF Advance with it's 256 Mbit realtime flash cart.  This is fine to store a couple of games, but what if I want to store the entire game collection I have on my pc in flash carts?  In that case I would need more EZF Advance realtime flash carts to put more games in.  But I can't find any website that sells or has links to sell JUST EZF ADVANCE CARTS, not even the official EZF Advance site itself!
<br/>
<br/>
Any of you guys know where I might be able to buy replacement carts for the EZF Advance.  Or does that mean if I want more carts that I have to buy the whole 256mbit EZF Advance SET all over again?  What about people who lose/destroy the cart that comes with the set?  Seems to me there should be a way to easily buy replacement carts for EZF.
<br/>
<br/>
If you guys could post links to any places that have replacement carts, that would be great.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
PS - I HIGHLY suggest you guys take a look at the G-Bank thread in this section of the forum...it looks like the future of GBA backup/saving.  With SD cards you can literally store an ENTIRE GBA game collection on one card!  I'll be checking that thread to see if anyone has had any experiences with the G-Bank, what it's advantages/limitations are, etc.  It looks like it's so new, no one has tried it!  From what little info I've been able to find on the web, though, it looks to be the next step.  What do you guys think?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
That pretty much means that it is simply not cost effective to buy several carts to store games in permanently, because buying the games themselves is cheaper (alot of the best games nowadays are 128mbit, which allows you to only store 2 in a 256mbit cart, if you're lucky).  Spending ~$60 on two original games is better than spending ~$100 on a flash cart to put two downloaded games into it.
<br/>
<br/>
It certainly seems as though a mass-storage solution like the G-Bank is the way to go in my case.  (Since I already own several SD cards, and considering 256 MBYTE SD cards are selling right now for around the price of one GBA game, and you can put more than a dozen roms on that SD card).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I apologize if I somehow implied that I am pirating these games.  It certainly was not my intention, and I am not aware of anything I've said to that effect.  I did say I had my GBA games collection on my PC, but that certainly does not preclude the fact that I actually own these games (which I do).
<br/>
<br/>
I simply wished to be able to put my GBA collection in one device/solution, so that I can play the copies, taking them with me on the road, and leave the originals safe at home.  I assumed this was self-evident, and perhaps I should not have.
<br/>
<br/>
With that aside, perhaps I can get feedback from someone who currently has implemented something like the G-Bank or something similar?  Is this the first product out there of it's kind?
<br/>
I also did a little googling and found something called the GameWallet and read up on it.  Just wondering what some of the experiences you guys have had with it and its postive/negative aspects.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could of course start selling those extra cables. I know a lot of people would like to by just the cable itself since it can replace the MBV2 cable and it's USB.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
