    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The new F2A PowerWriter v2.0 was released yesterday at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.flash2advance.com/" target="_blank">http://www.flash2advance.com/</a> but the donwload link seems to give a 403 error. Anyone got a copy of this program ? What are your comments on it ?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, they mention on the website that they have released a new database which is huge (34MB) in size and contains many game patches and artwork. Was anyone able to download a copy of this ? Is it possible for someone to host it somewhere (since it was released by F2A, I am guessing it is perfectly legal).
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any info on where to find the full database, please post it here.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is what they say on the website :
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">2004-04-04
<br/>
<br/>
F2A Power Writer 2.0
<br/>
<br/>
It is the first version of F2A Power Writer with supporting database. The initial database contains only the 2874 screen captures of 1437 games totally in a 34M byte installation file! This big file will only be released in <a href="http://www.flash2advance.com" target="_blank">www.flash2advance.com</a> for hours (about 1 day) then it will be taken away. It'll be re-available again some days later. In future time, user can just download small files to update the database for new game captures and DieHard patching data and the coming new features(e.g. the gold finger with Englash and Chinese language supported).
<br/>
<br/>
Download : F2A PowerWriter 2.0 (1.6M byte) 
<br/>
<br/>
(The 34M byte installation file of the initial database will be re-available again some days later)

<br/>
I got it on the Cd they dent with my F2aultra.
<br/>
It has screenshots (initial screen and in game screen).
<br/>
These show up in the "title screen shot" and "in game shot " on the writer.
<br/>
Don`t know if you can do anytihng else with them cos I'm a total noob.
<br/>
PM me with your email and i`ll send em on</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The whole database is available in the success-hk forums. Like farmer said, it just contains the game screen shots. The writer will work perfectly fine even without these screen shots ... so they are just eye candy :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
