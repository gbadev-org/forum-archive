    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought a GBAMP in November of 2004. I was using it in my DS sometime during summer of '05, when the music it was playing started to get scrambled  and messed up. When I turned it back on, my DS refused to load the menu for it. So I tested it with my SP, and it works sometimes, but not all the time. Whenever it does work, all it takes is a small squeeze of the GBAMP to mess it up. I've tried opening it up and cleaning it, using different CF cards, and updating the firmware, but none work. I think it may be a hardware problem, but I can't identify it. I want to use it for DS/GBA Hombrew, but it can't even start up most of the time. Any ideas anyone?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, when you write update.e19 to it, does it work every time in GBA Mode?  That would at least help rule out it being a hardware issue.  But, I have had a GBA MP that worked perfect in GBA Mode using update.e19, and worked perfect in NDS mode with Chishm's firmware update, but when updated for NDS mode, it wouldn't work in GBA Mode anymore.  Only way to use it in GBA Mode was to write the update.e19 back to it..  Wierd.  But, I've had my main GBA MP for a long time, and it has received a lot of abuse and it's still working perfect..  So hopefully it's not the hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Its updated to e19, and it rarely works in GBA mode. I haven't even recieved my PassMe yet, so I haven't tried DS mode. So i'm pretty sure its the hardware. Especially because it starts displaying junk when I lightly squeeze the movie player while its still inside the Game Boy. I just wanted to see if anybody experienced this before and knew of a way to fix it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
