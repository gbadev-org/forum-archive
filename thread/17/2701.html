    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everyone! I'm about to get a Game Boy Advance SP, and seeing as how I'm studying Software Engineering, I found gbadev.org very interesting and would like to learn how to program for the GBA. To do so, I will need some Flash Equipment, but I have no clue what to choose. So far, the ones that caught my attention are EZ-Flash Advance and Flash2Advance Ultra. I'd also like to play older ROMs (GB, GBC, NES, SNES, etc.) and run some applications for music, movies, etc. I read most of the posts, but since I'm not loaded with cash, I want to make sure before I make a purchase. Does anyone have any suggestions on which one I should choose and why? I know you must all be sick of reading such a post, but programming for GBA is something I'd really like to learn and any of your help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!<br/>_________________<br/>"Amp up and amplify! Defy! I'm a brother with a furious mind!"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I assume your in the US so I would suggest getting either an EZ-Flash USB 256mbit (100$) or an EFA 256mbit (110$) from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mwelectronics.com" target="_blank">MWElectronics</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Only the F2A can allow your GBA to switch to GBC mode if you buy a GB bridge, it also supports PogoShell, a Windows-esque type OS for the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Are you really sure you want to play GBC or GB roms on it? (I think you were rambling when you said an SNES ROM, not possible)
<br/>
<br/>
If your just going to be programming, like you said, the EZF-Advance is a lot better to me. The linker cable doubles as a multiboot cable for sending really small ROMs, good for testing too.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think you need flash equipment right now, wait about a month or two. You don't want to spend $100+ on something you won't really use for a while.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
