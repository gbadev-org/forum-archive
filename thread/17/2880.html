    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">on Windows 2000, as Administrator:
<br/>
<br/>
1. downloaded and unzipped UserPort
<br/>
2. copied userport.sys to C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers
<br/>
3. looked in Device Manager to see what ports my parallel port (LPT1) uses
<br/>
4. started UserPort.exe and made sure those ports were listed
<br/>
5. clicked Start below the lists
<br/>
6. started faw32.exe
<br/>
<br/>
result: EPrivilege, just as if I were not using UserPort at all
<br/>
<br/>
mb.exe, the MBV2 driver program, gives a similar error.
<br/>
<br/>
What should I try in order to grant the programs access to the parallel port?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
