<br/>
using interrupts?!?
<br/>
For me it doesnt work it is like the interrupts just isnt recognized have anyone here had a similiar problem or have an idea of how to fix this weird problem, then please repost.
<br/>
(there is no wrong with my code) it works fine if I flash it to a card
<br/>
and Ive tried other examples all with same result no interrupt handling!
