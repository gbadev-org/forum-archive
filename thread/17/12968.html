I think about Homebrew GBA Roms, like pogoShell and 2004Mbit Compo Game...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are several homebrew games that are small enough to run on a GBAMP v2, such as LOCKJAW: The Overdose, Vitamins, Luminesweeper, LOCKJAW: The Reference, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
You need M3 (GBAMP v3) if you want to run the compo game. Even the M3 Pro (halfway between M2 and M3 Perfect) should work for 32 Mbit games like this.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My apologies for the confusion.  However, an SD card is too slow as well, so my mistake doesn't really change the overall point.  
<br/>
<br/>
In addition, I believe Chishm's firmware hack is used for running DS binaries from the GBAMP, correct?  Even if you had the CF version, you wouldn't be able to launch GBA files larger than 256 kb.  The main advantage you'd get with the CF version for GBA stuff would be the specialized versions of PocketNES and Goomba Color, which use paging systems to allow for .nes and .gb/.gbc binaries larger than 256 kb to be run.  These are the only two programs that I know of that use such a paging system though.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that while what tepples said about the M3 Pro and the compo game is correct, note that larger games won't run.  The M3 Pro only has 4 MB of RAM for use with GBA titles, whereas the M3 Perfect has the full 32 MB needed for full GBA compatibility.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
