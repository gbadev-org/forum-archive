<br/>
<br/>
I've looked around, and everything I've come across has said no - but I haven't come across anything recent (mostly it's forum discussions from like 2008 or earlier), so I'm wondering if there's been any recent developments?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GBA <span style="font-weight: bold">homebrew</span> (please read the forum rules) can only be emulated from the slot-1 iPlayer cart, which has upgraded hardware originally meant to be used for playing back unconverted video files.  The emulator is a port of gpSP and isn't perfect, but reportedly works fairly well.  Unfortunately none of the sites I've seen have bothered to do any extensive testing with GBA homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
The upcoming Supercard DS:TWO (release date unknown) will reportedly contain the iPlayer internals, so it will also be compatible with this same GBA emulator.  They're also reporting that there will be an SNES emulator on the DS:TWO as well, but there has been no information about that.  I'm hoping it's an entirely new emulator built for the upgraded hardware rather than simply integrating SNEmulDS or something like that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Careful, the iTouch is an entirely separate, regular old slot-1 device (I think made by the M3 Team but I'm not positive).  It's the iPlayer that has the faster CPU.  Easy mistake to make though, I'll admit.

The main reason is that the slot-2 provides 32 megabytes of memory-mapped ROM, whereas the slot-1 is not memory-mapped.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right, the memory mapping is a major issue.  The GBA works by directly executing instructions off the ROM chip, which has lightning-fast read access.  DS cartridges are block devices and load chunks of ROM into RAM before execution.  This works fine for DS games, which are programmed to work that way, but emulating GBA games that expect that lightning-fast response would be difficult, especially for larger file sizes.  There's also the question of whether or not the DS has enough horsepower to emulate the GBA on its own, which is debatable at best.  
<br/>
<br/>
Also consider that the ARM7 functions entirely differently in DS mode than it does in GBA mode, so it's not like you can just send everything to the ARM7 and be done with it.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're asking why we don't just run the GBA file in GBA mode but storing the game on slot-1, it's because the instant you enter GBA mode, everything DS-specific gets disabled and any RAM gets cleared (minus a small portion of VRAM where you can place a border in the dead space around the GBA frame if you'd like).  In other words, in GBA mode the system has no idea slot-1 even exists, let alone how to access it or stream data from it dynamically.  Thus, in order for slot-1 to be used at all, it would have to be some sort of software emulator running in DS mode, which in essence is what the GBA emulator for the iPlayer is.  The difference is that the iPlayer has the extra hardware that is multiple times more powerful than the components on the DS(i) itself, so it can manage the emulation without too much slowdown.
<br/>
<br/>
Really, your best option is to get some sort of slot-2 device, which will run the GBA files natively in the DS's GBA mode, no software emulation needed at all.  If you've got a DSi, your only option at the moment is the iPlayer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
