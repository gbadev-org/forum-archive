    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi
<br/>
I`m a totall noob at this but i just received my 256MB flash2advance ultra with USB linker.
<br/>
With it was F2A Power writer 2.0.
<br/>
I`ve installed the software and tried using it with the USB drivers that came with it alsoi with the f2ausb driver download from the flash2advance site.
<br/>
When I load up and try to connect to  the card i get
<br/>
"Wecome to use F2A powerwriter
<br/>
Checking ULA
<br/>
waiting renumerating..."
<br/>
and then it stops responding.
<br/>
Also if i load up powerwriter without the usb cable connected I can't use the add button ( can't use any with it connected cos it doesnt respond).
<br/>
<br/>
I'm probably missing something simple but I`ve been tearing my hair out all day.
<br/>
Can anyone help?????</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This might sound daft but I tried connecting to the usb port at the back of my pc instead of the hub on my monitor and hey presto..... all is well.
<br/>
Hope this helps someone.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This does kinda defeat the point of USB's architecture, though. Connecting to the backplane connectors is still connecting through a hub in almost all cases (a USB interface has one port; almost all motherboards and USB cards have at least two ports per interface, and thus have an internal hub). I don't know enough about USB's internals to decide whether it's the hub, the device, or the driver that's at fault in these cases. =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Some USB hubs, such as the Belkin 4-port hub connected to my computer, can operate either in mains-powered mode or in bus-powered mode. If you don't have a DC connector coming out of your hub, it's in bus-powered mode, drawing power from the computer's USB chipset, and some devices may need more power than the computer can provide on its own. Find the adapter that came with your hub, plug it in, and flip the switch to put it in mains-powered mode.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">tepples: This doesn't change the fact that the hub is required by the USB spec to tell the host computer that it's only got x mA of power available due to being bus-powered, and thus the host should be able to tell you when you have gone over-power.

I didn't know that. Is the general lack of this functionality an issue in hubs, in USB host controllers, or in Microsoft Windows?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not sure, really. Windows doesn't pop up a box to tell you about it, but it does know; if you look in the device settings it should be able to account for the power available and used (I forget exactly where). I do know that many devices claim wildly incorrect values for power consumption, and that cheap hubs often claim the same value whether they are bus- or self-powered (the value for self-powered), so it's not like it could do all that much with the information anyway as it seems so likely to be wrong.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have the Flash2Advance 256MB with USB adapter.

I have updated the drivers (thanks Bart!) and have the USB adapter plugged into the back but I still get the same error everytime.  As soon as I turn my GBA back on the program freezes.  Does anyone have any other suggestions?
