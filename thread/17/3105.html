    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i tried it myself using the f2au, but it didn't work... I think you will either need a gb flash linker or the GB Bridge (but i am not sure if this would work)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Somehow I doubt the GB bridge would work.  As far as I know, it is a GBA to GB convertor, not a GB to GBA convertor.

Thanks for your input.

By the way, I'm assuming your signature is a joke due to my opinion that 'actions speak louder than words'.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got into the GB development scene about 6 years ago or so and purchased the Gameboy Flash Linker from Bung (now no longer in business) of Hong Kong.  It looks exactly like the new F2A parallel port version I see all over the internet, however the software that came with it doesn't let me download/backup original gameboy cartridges.  
<br/>
<br/>
My question is is it the exact same hardware as the F2A and I just need some software to enable me to download/backup original nintendo carts, and can I use this with Flash Advance Cartridges, or do I need to buy the new F2A to work with Flash Advance carts?  Does anyone have experience with this, or know anything about this old bung hardware?  Any help is appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is definitely a different version of the hardware.
<br/>
They just use the same plastic parts and framework.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
