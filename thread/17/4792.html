    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe someone with experience could write up a product guide for the numerous flash cart choices out there.  There are so many similar sounding names it is extremely confusing for newbies (like me).  I have spent hours sorting through posts, reviews, and websites trying to figure out which products are made by whom, which are most recent, and which features they all support.  The irregular use of abbreviations hasn't helped either :(.
<br/>
<br/>
A nice guide would help people make a purchase decision and could leave out the where to get it part so as to be unbiased (or have separate retailer guide).  
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think I am going to get a EZF Advance 256 (the one with the USB linking cable) but I still am not sure I can even identify the product I want on the various websites that sell carts.   I think that one is the most recommended.
<br/>
<br/>
What I want is a cart that supports USB to GBA link as a cable (to do flashes and transfers), the ability to backup save games to PC and back to carts (I have about 8 so far?), support for RTC (not proprietary just Nintendo standard), and enough room for trying out my games I am working on (both small multiboots and larger full size game).  I figure a 256 cart is the max a "real" game could fit in (32MB addressable by hardware right?).  Is this correct? I want as much room for my RPG as possible.
<br/>
<br/>
I have no desire to "backup" or download real game ROMs or anything like that (unless it is a game a hobbist made).  I just want to be able to test my games on actual hardware and backup real game saves to the PC (and send them back if I ever have to replace a battery).
<br/>
<br/>
Also I noticed in the Cowbit specs that there seems to be room for identical images in a cart that can be accessed at different delays.  Does this mean a larger cart can allow interleaved access to multiple images or does that mean something else? In that case, should I get a larger 512M cart?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx for any advice!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
