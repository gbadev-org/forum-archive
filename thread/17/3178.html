    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just recieved my 64mb cart in the mail today, and was all excited to try it out when, after installing everything, I tried to transfer something to my GBA and recieved this error:
<br/>
<br/>
Start writting ... 
<br/>
Checking ULA....
<br/>
Launch BIOS...
<br/>
USB.Linker Found
<br/>
Flash not found!!!

I JUST got it and I'd like to know what's wrong... I have the cart in there and everything, and I'm using F2APowerWriter 1.01.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
My F2A does the same thing. Maybe you have the same problem...
<br/>
<br/>
Just keep pushing the "Write Flash" button over and over and over and over until it manages to find the cart. Usually for me it takes 5-10 clicks before it does the write, but sometimes I have to do it for 20 seconds.
<br/>
<br/>
Stupid, I know. I keep waiting for a decent driver to come out. I have to reinstall the crappy thing on a regular basis.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried that, but it still doesn't seem to work. It just keeps spouting out "flash not found." I think it may be a defective cart. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It could be a defective cart... you may want to see if you can find a computer running something besides XP and try it from there.
<br/>
<br/>
Other guys on the forum have suggested cleaning the contacts in the cart. Might be worth a shot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
