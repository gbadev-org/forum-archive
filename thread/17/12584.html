The biggest CF card that will work in a GBAMP is probably 2 GB due to FAT file system limitations.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">FAT16 technically supports up to 4GB (I've done it with my M3SD), even if it's not standard. It's possible the GBAMP can use 4GB cards.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My 4GB card works fine in NDS mode, though I haven't got it to do anything in GBA mode. I'm not sure if this is incompatibility with the card, or if it's just busted.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
