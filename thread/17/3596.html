    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello! Firstly, I should point out that I'm a very simple person who fears anything the slightest bit complicated. I guess the word I'm looking for is NOOB. Actually, looking for this site is probably the most brain taxing thing I've done. I've got a Flash2advance 64mb and all I want to know is the simplest way to get some roms from my mac (OS X 10.3) to the flash cart. Before you point out that I should search these forums, I already have. All posts I found were almost a year old and all I got were a couple of terminal apps that I can't get to work. Maybe I should invest in a copy of Virtual PC. Has anyone tried it? Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ported the f2a stuff to OS X. And although I'm not doing any more development on it and it's buggy it should at least work. What specific issues are you having? Have you made sure you're testing with something that has been tested on hardware by the author?

<br/>
It lists all the commands -

-r   read data from cart 
<br/>
-w  write data to cart
<br/>
....etc...
<br/>
logout
<br/>
[process completed]
<br/>
<br/>
...nothing happens.

I know that the answer is something very silly but I am a very dim person. Thanks very much for your help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Iggy, You're going to need to use the Terminal application. Fortunately you can use a really easy and lazy methods to do it.
<br/>
<br/>
Try this.
<br/>
Plug your linker into the usb port.
<br/>
Run the Terminal application so it brings up the prompt window.
<br/>
Drag the f2a program onto the prompt window. This will copy the location of the program onto the prompt.
<br/>
Drag the ROM you want into the window. This will add it as a parameter to the program.
<br/>
Press the 'return' key to execute the program.
<br/>
<br/>
Since writing a single ROM is the default action this SHOULD run the program and send your ROM. When it tells you to start the gba in multiboot mode turn it on with 'start' and 'select' held down.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps. Otherwise search in the help or online for tutorials on using the Terminal/command line.

I used eli's soft, worked really nice (thanks) but I can't write more than 64Mbit carts. Trying to write 128Mbit it gave an error after writing 64Mbit. I also would like how to copy more than one rom at once with it.
