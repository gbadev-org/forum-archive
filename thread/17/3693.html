Features up to 2G, RTC, multi-boot, USB 2.0, hardware saves.
<br/>
<br/>
Comes in sizes from 256M to 2G.  Although, reading their FAQs (nice bit of Engrish there: Frequence Asked Questions) it seems that it uses two types of memory: Slower and cheaper NAND memory to store the roms and 256M NOR memory to run the games, similar in concept to what the Game Wallet does.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to see how good the software and drivers are and how using the dual memory configuration affects the price.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd hope that the NOR part uses single-level cells (100K to 1M erases per sector) rather than multi-level cells (around 10K erases per sector). If it gets rewritten every time I turn on the GBA, then limited rewrites may become a problem.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is probably only rewritten everytime you switch to another game, so if you turn your GBA on, and choose to play the same game as you played last time, the memory is not rewritten.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT
<br/>
Lots of bullshit in that FAQ.
<br/>
And don't be fooled by that USB 2.0 Hi-Speed crap. USB 2.0 Hi-Speed is 480Mbit/s.
<br/>
The GBA link port is limited to 2Mbit/s.
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing unique about their product is that they combine NAND and NOR flash, it is certainly a easy way for them to decrease component costs, but the downside is the loading time. It takes at least 17 seconds to load a 32M game. 34 seconds to load a 64M game. 1 minute 8 seconds to load a 128M game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
