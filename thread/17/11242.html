    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a 256 meg flash2advance cart for the gba... I used to just install the usb driver, and the usb writer program and then I was good to go.
<br/>
<br/>
Sadly on my new computer nothing is funtioning as it should. I have all the drivers installed and everything. I turn on the gba, then try to erase/write to the cart and this comes up
<br/>
<br/>
Initial ULA ...
<br/>
Checking ULA....
<br/>
Launch BIOS...
<br/>
Turn on GBA and press START+SELECT... 
<br/>
Download BIOS failure! 
<br/>
No Adaptor Found!
<br/>
<br/>
Now I don't believe that at all, becuase I left my gba on and the program was still able to detect that, and told me to turn it off. As soon as i turned it off that error came up and it never even gave me a chance to press start+select like you usually have to. I'd say it's my usb ports that are screwed, but it detects that the gba is on... and every other device I have works fine via usb.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas would be much appreciated, or even a different program to use... I use pogoshell normally so I only ever write 1 rom to the cart at a time, and I rarely touch the save files. I'm really lost though, got 10 gigs of gba roms and nothing to do with them.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for any help :D
<br/>
<br/>
Note: My cart is just the basic 256 meg flash2advance one, it doesn't say pro or turbo or anything, but when i tried to see if littlewriter would work it detected it when i put it as a pro cart... but then nothing worked at all whenever I tried to do anything other than get it to detect... littlewriter seems flaky anywayz cause it wouldn't always detect even when using all the same settings.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you sure you installed the right drivers?  I know that with Flash2Advance Ultra carts, there are two versions of the drivers, one for Windows 9x variants and the other for NT variants.  If the F2A drivers are similar, then perhaps you installed the drivers for the wrong OS.  
<br/>
<br/>
Do you ever hear any "ding-dong" sounds upon doing anything with the USB cable?  This happens to me occasionally, and it indicates that the PC thinks the hardware has been removed.  I wait until I hear the sound that indicates that the hardware has been plugged in before continuing with anything. 
<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried using the shareware FlashManager program by Mootan to flash the cartridge?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried flashmanager, no idea how to use it but I think it's detecting the gba and then nothing happens... gets to "fowording fwlib to gba" then nothing happens.
<br/>
<br/>
I am going to take the software and my gba to my dads place and try it on his computer, to see if something with mine is just messing it up.
<br/>
<br/>
This is really frustrating... I stop using this gba for a 3 month period and the developer website no longer exists and nothing works, I think my money has been wasted if nobody has any different programs or ideas as to whats going wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
I also trying using each different set of drivers and it still has the same response.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Update: I installed everything on my dads computer and it worked just fine... dunno what the hell is going wrong with my comp, but for now I can still use my gba.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, if you got any ideas whats up with my computer, lemmie know!
<br/>
<br/>
Thx for the help</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
