    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I recently bought PassMe for my Nintendo Ds and i'm trying to use it with my Ez-Flash III 1gb in size. But i tried to flash on to my cart Tetris that has been made for the Ds as a homebrew, but when i start the console it shows me the Nintendo Ds logo on top screen and those warnings on bottom that it normally does and and after that both the screen goes white and it doesnt change after that. I'm using ez3manager203 to flash my cart. And now few questions
<br/>
1) Now does it matter what DS game i use with PassMe?
<br/>
2) What files do i need to flash to the cart to get those homebrew games to work?
<br/>
3) I think i read that there was some update for Ez-flash III for using with PassMe, what do i do with those files that came wtih the update do i flash them to the cart or what?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks to anyone who replys in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
