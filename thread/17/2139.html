    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just recently I recieved a 256Mb EZ-Flash2 rompack in the mail.  Today was a wonderful day - very energetic, my teachers didn't hate me too much.  Then came the fateful moment.  I finished installing the new drivers from the main site, and tried to open EZWriter.  The program locked up.  This isin't your standard lockup.  It's the sort of lockup that comes from beyond the grave to haunt your OS until a reboot comes about.  Nothing you can do will kill the munged instance floating around and sucking up 3k of memory.  On top of that, I am unable to open any more copies of EZWriter while the first is still locked up.  Has anyone had these problems?  I've finally given up after un/reinstalling various versions of the drivers clearly marked for the EZFlash2 units.<br/>_________________<br/>yet nothing went unsaid</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can you kill it by logging out of your account and logging back in? That fixes almost as many app problems on my Windows 2000 installation as restarting the PC does. Or are you still running Windows 9x?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unfortunately no - it takes an ungodly long time to actually log off (five minutes or so) and after logging back on, the program will still be there.  I'm running 2000 Professional, if that helps at all.  I've restarted multiple times after each driver install.  I would hate to think that the hardware is damaged, since it took an ungodly time to get here.  I can't even imagine how long it would take to get an RMA shipped, if the supplier would even allow it.<br/>_________________<br/>yet nothing went unsaid</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe this problem is caused by USB2.0 - I think the EZF-Advance only works with USB1.  A bit of a pain as I am getting a new PC soon and I'll probably have to make sure it has some USB1  ports.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm shiny...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
