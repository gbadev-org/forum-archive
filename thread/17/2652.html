    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a 256M Flash2Advance.  I have backup up a few games and I put them on my F2A so I don't have to carry around multiple cartriges.  Unfortunately when I try to save my progesss(in a game) it seems to fail.  
<br/>
<br/>
For example:
<br/>
Super Mario 4, I just get an error that my save file is corrupt, the game wont even start.
<br/>
<br/>
FFTA, My game saves sometimes, but then sometimes gets wiped out, losing all my progress!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone explain what I'm doin wrong, does it have to do with the "save location" I set up for the game?  How do I know which bank to use for each game?

What I was really hoping for here was an answer to a question, not a bunch of ranting, or more questions.  If you dont' know the answer or the peice of hardware I'm asking about, feel free to *NOT* leave a reply.

<br/>
Thanks ;-)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Straight answer: <span style="font-weight: bold">You'll need a save patch to use some commercial games with F2A carts.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Some of the newer commercial GBA games use save methods that the maker of F2A carts did not know about when it designed your cart's circuits. Specifically, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.success-hk.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=1033&amp;whichpage=1" target="_blank">Super Mario Advance 4 uses a 128 KByte flash chip</a>, presumably to support expansion through the e-reader, while F2A directly supports only games that use smaller flash chips up to 64 KBytes. If those games are patched to work with the older save methods, they may work better with your model of flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are having problems with backing up commercial games to your flash cart, <span style="font-weight: bold">gbadev.org may not be the best forum</span> in which to discuss them. Some cart manufacturers, retailers, and backup scene sites run their own forums.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
