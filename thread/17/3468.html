    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just wondering if someone might have a fix for my problem...
<br/>
<br/>
I have a flash 2 advnce (parallel) linker and a pro 256mb cart.
<br/>
<br/>
It erases fine.
<br/>
<br/>
My crappy little demo's ive been writing copy over fine as they are tiny but as soon as a bigger file goes over (im talking about big homebrew games not just commercial stuff) F2AWriter just says Write Error.  It seems to be at a different spot each time but usually between 20 - 40 seconds into the transfer.
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried it on 2 computers so i presume it is the hardware.  Just seems weird that it's not the same spot each time which makes me think maybe the cable is a bit dodgey?  
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers for any help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My F2A cable died on me (No response from any host computer when plugging in cable).  I've got a sinking feeling that these cables' build quality isn't the best possible.  In any case, does anybody know where I can buy a new one?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
