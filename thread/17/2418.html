    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was thinking of getting a flash cart for christmas, but I wanted to know just how many games one could hold. I am looking at a 128Mb cart, how many games can it hold? Thanks in advance</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It depends on the size of the ROMS you want to use. The typical illegal commercial ROM that you get of some IRC channel or warez site is between 3 Megabyte and 16 megabyte. A  128mbit Flash Cart can hold 16 megabyte of data.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The above is true. I don't think there's a game that's larger than 128mbit so the 128 should suffice.
<br/>
<br/>
Tip: If you install a large 128mbit / 16megabyte (whatever) game, you may need to disable the menu loader (the cartridge lets you pick which game you want to play) because it takes up space and it is not needed for just one game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have an F2A 256Mbit card, and it doesn't hold two 128Mbit games, says they will take up 256.25, and that the card doesn't have enough space.
<br/>
<br/>
I was under the impression it would hold two 128MB ones, was I wrong or is my card screwed up?
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
Had another look and here is what I found.
<br/>
One game (128) reads 16777216 bytes, I am unable to load two of those and the loader that has 32760 bytes.
<br/>
<br/>
I am, however, able to load one game that has 16777216 bytes, and <span style="font-weight: bold">two</span> games that have 8388608 bytes, and the loader.
<br/>
<br/>
So this is really beyond me, two 128MBit ones should fit if one 128 and two 64 ones fit.  I am puzzled. Two 128 ones add up to 256.25, while one 128 and two 64 add up to 256 even in F2A Writer 3.1</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Many games are not exactly 64M or 128M. The remaining space is padded with ones or zeroes. Some tools can automatically detect this and remove the padding. This way space for the loader can be created.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
