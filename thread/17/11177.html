    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The only cheating tool that uses homebrew hardware and doesn't involve romz is a save editor. In a lot of games that use SRAM or flash to save your progress, you can back up the save, edit it on the PC, and restore it to your Game Pak. In theory, you could also load a GBA hex editor, pak-swap to your Game Pak, and edit the save file that way, but I don't know whether such a hex editor has been developed.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The same hex editor would work on all genuine GBA Game Paks with the same save type (256 Kbit SRAM or 512 Kbit flash), but you'd need to 1. know the addresses of the values you want to change and 2. how to make the game recompute the checksum.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Say it were a "homebrew" GBA game being played on the DS. Would I be able to edit that save without figuring out how to make the game recompute the checksum?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, in theory, I should be able to open a RT save with wordpad, and have it come out as clear text...right? o_o;<br/>_________________<br/>Butt Monkeys.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If a homebrew game doesn't use a checksum for its SRAM save, you can edit the game's SRAM at will. But if it does use a checksum, you edit the SRAM save, and you don't edit the checksum, then next time the game runs, it will recognize a damaged save record and (more than likely) erase it.

Real-time saves are binary, not text.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Blah. Do you know if there are any GBA Gameshark or something of the like programs that can be run on a G6? The one that comes with G6 Lite is configured in a weird way. If I could figure out what the syntax is, there may be hope...
