<br/>
Sorry, didn't know.
<br/>
<br/>
It did have a good comparison on the types of flash carts though. Oh well.
<br/>
I'll just some up the info on there.
<br/>
<br/>
A flash cart works by using client software to flash data onto the cart. 
<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 types of flash cart linkers:
<br/>
<br/>
1) The flash cart is put into a linking unit and data is flashed onto the cart. The downside of these types of carts are that you constantly have to take the cart in and out when doing some sort to development testing. It wears down the connectors.
<br/>
<br/>
2) The flash cart linker that uses your GBA by using the multiboot function of the GBA to flash data onto the cart while it's plugged in the GBA. It uses a cable that goes from the GBA to your PC. This one is common now as it doesn't wear down the connectors when compared to type 1.
<br/>
<br/>
Some linkers use the parallel port, and some use the USB port. USB linkers are known to be faster but have sometimes have driver issues.
<br/>
<br/>
PogoShell is a little app designed to be like Windows on the PC. It manages ROMs and saves on your cart. Only works with F2A and XG carts.
<br/>
<br/>
Anything else?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
