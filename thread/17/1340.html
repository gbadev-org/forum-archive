    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. I'm having a very strange problem. I have a rom that I wrote that works perfectly fine on the MappyVM emulator, BoycottAdvance emulator, and on the actual GameBoy Advance (both normal and SP) using the "Flash Advance Linker Xtreme". However, I just bought the XG-Flash linker and the exact same rom is full of crashes when I play it on the actual GameBoy Advance. Now, I am using both C and ASM and am doing some jumping around in memory quite a bit. Is there something that anyone knows of where the memory layout might be different when using the XG-Flash linker? Anything else I might need to know about when using the XG-Flash linker? Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks.<br/>_________________<br/>- RegularKid</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Update: I kept playing around with it some more and realized that the crash was happening at the same place everytime. Not the same place in the game, but the same time amount. I turn the gameboy on and everything runs fine for about 3 seconds and then boom...game go crash. It doesn't matter what I do in the game: I can move, look around, press buttons, or just sit there, but everytime around 3 seconds into the game starting (after the Nintendo intro) the game comes to a halt. Very strange. Again, any help would be awsome! Thanks.<br/>_________________<br/>- RegularKid</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">have you tried some homebrew (or, erm, "other") roms on the cart, to try and determine if it's a bad cart or your app doing something that the XG dosen't agree with?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
