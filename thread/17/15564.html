    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm sorry if this has been covered in a FAQ or somewhere else, as I don't have access to the gbadev.org site from here, only the forum.  If it is covered somewhere on the main site, just note as such &amp; I can dig it up later.

I spent about 45 minutes last night chasing the ghost of what was GBA flash equipment.  I couldn't find a site that actually sells anything for the GBA.  Every link that was coming up under Google or Yahoo didn't have prices.  Any "click to add to cart" or such links, just took me to DS flash information.  Does anyone still sell GBA Flash equipment?  Or is this the new "yesterday" topic &amp; no one has it anymore?  I realize that I got into the scene a little late, but still.  This is what I get for only using Lik-sang for years.  They go under, &amp; now I'm as lost as when I was looking for info to mod my PS1.

** <span style="font-weight: bold">off-topic</span> ** Does anyone sell DS lite video cables?  I see some sites that sell just for the DS, but I didn't find much of anything that has DS lite video cables.

Just don't get anything that has rumble; the version of the SuperCard with rumble does not work on a GBA or on a DS in GBA mode.

What the heck is a DS lite video cable? Are you talking about that proprietary video capture device that nintendo doesn't sell to the public?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
