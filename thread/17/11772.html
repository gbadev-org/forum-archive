    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Back in the day I bought a 64mbit GBA flash cart, Flash Advance Linker, and an MBv2. I'd like to mess around with the cart, but first I want to back it up. So I downloaded FLinker 1.72, plugged in my Flash Advance Linker, threw in the classic zelda, ran ./fl -s Zelda.gba 
<br/>
<br/>
Attempting to run this in VisualboyAdvance tells me 
<br/>
"GAME PAK ERROR
<br/>
<br/>
TURN THE POWER OFF."
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, FLinker defaults to 32mbit, I dont really see the classic zelda being larger than that though.
<br/>
<br/>
Am I on the right track for backing up my flash cart?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Back up the save, or the card itself? The latter is considered off-topic on gbadev.org.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have you tried using the FlashManager shareware program by Mootan?  From what I can tell, it supports the Flash Advance linker.

I believe the confusion is based on the fact that you keep referencing Zelda and such, the relevence of which we don't understand.  If you're trying to backup your flash cart, what does Zelda have anything to do with it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
