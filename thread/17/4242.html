<br/>
<br/>
I just got a 256MB ezf advance cartridge, and I installed the drivers and seemed to have gotten things working.
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering what the column "I.G.F." stands for in the client, and what turning the option on to making IGF the default means.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem I am ocassionally having was when I tried to add a ROM my friend made it took about 4 tries, the first three I kept recieving the error:
<br/>
<br/>
"Error opening file" or "Error loading file"
<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, it just worked on like the 5th try.  This error would occur when I would just try to add it to the list, not when I would try to burn.
<br/>
<br/>
Any idea what could be causing that error?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
