<br/>
Is it possible to buy empty cartridges which aren't rewriteable (like one of the 99in1 games)? If yes, where can I buy them and how much does it cost?
<br/>
I'm thinking about programming a game and give it to some friends with a real GBA.
<br/>
Thx, Ilomoga</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
