    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1) I understand that Flash2Advance allows you to save game save information to your PC.  Does EZFlash have this feature?
<br/>
<br/>
2) Does the Flash2Advance (256) have a real-time clock (like EZFlash)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Note that while EZ has a RTC, it is NOT compatible with Nintendo RTCs. EZ software patch Pokemon to use the EZ RTC instaed of the Nintendo RTC.
<br/>
Because of this, no one currently knows how to access the EZ RTC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And it seems EZFA is keeping the info to themselves about it, too...
<br/>
<br/>
I wish they would release a library or something so I could use it. Or I could figure out what the EZFA client looks for in a ROM when it wants to patch the RTC.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
