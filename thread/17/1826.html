Yes, I'm here, and no, I don't know the difference between the carts.  The "no" was implicitly stated by my not answering your previous post, but if you want an explicit response here it is.  Somebody may give you a meaningful reply.  They may not.  At any rate, it might take a couple of days.  People have lives to live.

No, I probably don't.  Feel free to stop reading my posts.  Too bad we don't have a killfile here...

<br/>
<br/>
The latter has a 1.8v memory chip which consumes less power from the GBA, yielding ~5 hours of longer play (battery life). EZF-Advance has a 3.3v memory chip which consumes power rather quickly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
