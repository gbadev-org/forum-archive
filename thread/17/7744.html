    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone.  I browsed the forums a bit and seem to find two contenders for a GBA Flash Cart that I can use to bring homebrew goodness to my NDS.  They are the EFA-Linker and EZ-Flash.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me if there is a real difference between the two?  Also, I realize that video game and PC memory are measured differently, so about what size flash cart will I need to be able to take advantage of most GBA and NDS roms?  Finally, while I have not see any recommended places for buying the EZ-Flash cart, someone posted a link for the EFA cart pointing to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.kicktrading.ca/index.php?cPath=21&amp;osCsid=31c0dc6a5c56b856cfa26db95a78dea1" target="_blank">this site</a>.  Does anyone know if that is EFA Linker I or II?  Is there a real difference that I should be worried about?
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I have heard it mentioned in a few threads about the "old" and "new" NDS.  I have been unable to find any place where I can read more about this.  Might anyone please recommend a page that would help me determined if the DS I have is of the "old" or "new" stock and what limitations this places on me?
<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks in advance to all those who answer!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
