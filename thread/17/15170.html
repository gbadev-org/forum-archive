    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">By "instead of cartridges", what kind of cartridges are you talking about? What's wrong with using an SD card, a USB SD writer, and an SD adapter such as a SuperCard? If you tell me more about what you have been using, I might be able to understand your situation to help you better.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
