    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ask around from where you bought your EZFA II to see why it is not working. Search Google if you need to. Or, if you get fed up with the cart, kindly return your cart and purchase the original EZF Advance, of which you will get much support from it's official site: <a href="http://www.gba-toys.com." target="_blank">www.gba-toys.com.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, take a look at the<a class="postlink" href="http://bbs.gba-toys.com/" target="_blank">EZF Advance Forums</a> for reasons of why you should not have bought that product.
<br/>
<br/>
I do hope you get a working flash cart as they are really useful in development!<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
