If it does, I think it's safe to say that this could be the best card out there (then again, I'm new to this stuff so feel free to contradict me and tell me why you don't feel the same way). I'll keep you posted as soon as I get a reply.<br/>_________________<br/>"Amp up and amplify! Defy! I'm a brother with a furious mind!"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
