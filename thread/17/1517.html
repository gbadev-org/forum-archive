    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I've just ordered my Flash2Advance 128Mb set; and I've been browsing a bit the topics in the hardware section. What worries me is that it seems that we cannot burn the flash cart with this kit on GBASP. Can anyone confirm?
<br/>
By the way, I've ordered the USB kit; and if I really can't burn my cart, what can I do?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to anyone who will help</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

From everything I've read about it, turn off the GBA SP's internal light and it'll be more likely to work. Get the USB version and it'll be more likely to work.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I know that there a site that tells you how to do it, but it includes opening the F2A and adding some power through a USB cable ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

By the way, it seems that flashing from a laptop won't work as the USB port is powered by 3.3V (unlike the 5V for desktops). It's apparently the only problem for the F2A.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Would it work with a mains-powered USB hub between the laptop and the F2A cable? Would the hub appropriately boost the signal to 5V?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've checked some site related to USB Hub (self powered), it is said that each port is powered by 5V and intensity is near 500mA; so in theory there should be no problem(<a class="postlink" href="http://www.skyhawkusa.com/USB_Hub.htm" target="_blank">http://www.skyhawkusa.com/USB_Hub.htm</a>).
<br/>
Better check your Hub notice, it should be written somewhere, or even try it once. When Voltage is not enough, the rom won't burn as I've seen some posts relating this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey,
<br/>
I installed an afterburner, without dimmer switch. Now, when i try to burn a rom when the GBA is runnin of the mains, it restarts. It works fine with batteries, but i was hopin to use the mains to save power. Has anyone else had this problem, and is there a way around it?
<br/>
