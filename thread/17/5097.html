    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I've brought efa cart with me on my gap year to Australia, unfortunately its stopped working, the screen just goes black after the gameboy logo appears.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I didnt bring the usb lead with me, is it posible to buy these leads from computer shops? Is there a name for these type of usb leads?
<br/>
<br/>
Even if I managed to get hold of a lead would I be able to fix the cart by connecting it to a pc and having a "fiddle about" with it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any help on this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
The EFA cable (if you are talking about an <a class="postlink" href="http://www.efa.cc/" target="_blank">EFA-Linker</a> cartridge) is just a standard mini usb cable. I used mine with the cable I got from a digital camera. you can have a look at what it should look like here : <a class="postlink" href="http://images.google.com/images?q=mini%20usb&amp;hl=fr&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi" target="_blank">Google Images</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I personally never got any issue with my EFA... then my guess is 100% unreliable, but maybe your EFA battery is just empty...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right tried cleaning the connectors with cotton buds and lighter fluid but that didnt work. 
<br/>
<br/>
I ve been wandering around melbourne's electronic shops and I still cant find a lead that fits the cart. What type of camera has the same usb lead, there seems to be a million different types of mini usb connector.
<br/>
<br/>
I can get the cart to work by tapping it a few times of my knee or a table, it works for about 2 minutes then then freezes with graphics corrupting etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Is my cart completely bust?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for any help in advance!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh crap I didnt know you had to keep charging it, I ve only ever charged it once, did a full eight hour charge though.
<br/>
I thought the battery was for saves only........

Yeah, it's supposed to be for saves and the real time clock, and not so much to do with regular read/writing, but who knows. There's got to be a mini-USB to USB cable somewhere. It's not really common but it shouldn't be totally impossible to find either.

Would passing flash memory through airport scanning devices possibly corrupt the data stored?<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think so. I've passed various camera flash + hdd + gba flash cart a bunch of time (on transatlantic flights) and I never had a memory loss (at least a flash memory loss... still can't remember where I parked my car though).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
