    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone know the pinout for this cable (The GBA cable has more wires and they are different colors compared to the USB cable).  
<br/>
<br/>
I have a GBA Link cable and a USB Cable, I would like to try and create one of these cables myself.
<br/>
<br/>
Any information would be great.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That is not possible.
<br/>
The only type of multiboot cable you can build yourself is the nocash xboo cable. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Search</a> and you will find it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Their is a USB cable available.  MBV2 is a USB cable.  I have seen the xboo cable and am not interested in programming through a parallel port.
<br/>
<br/>
I have seen the USB cables, unfortunatley the pinout is somewhat safe guarded.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks anyways.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My appologize the MBV2 is parallel.  The Flash Advance kits are USB to.  
<br/>
<br/>
These cables are straight through USB to GBA cables.
<br/>
<br/>
The carts are programmed while the GBA flash cart is in the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
The software does all the work basically.
<br/>
<br/>
If a chip is needed then what chip and what code is loaded on them?  
<br/>
<br/>
Just out of curiosity why would you need a chip on the USB cable to program a ROM?  The cable is just for connecting the PC to the flash cart is it not?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

USB is a complex protocol that requires the device to implement all manner of things. The GBA can't act as a USB device by itself (even if you implemented the USB protocol in software, you wouldn't be able to load the software onto the GBA until you had the cable working). There are some pretty small chips that implement the USB serial spec; i.e. you connect a USB cable to one side, and a normal serial connection (like the GBA's) to the other side, and it works. I suspect you'll find that there is a very small chip in one or the other plug on the F2A cable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If anyone knows of a way to do this feel free to add your 2 cents.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
