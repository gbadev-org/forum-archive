    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I purchased a 256M EZFA cart about 6 months ago. It's worked great until yesterday.
<br/>
<br/>
The savegame memory appears to be shorting out.
<br/>
<br/>
I can load rom images, development code, whatever and it plays fine, and I can save fine in the first couple minutes. But if the GBA stays on over 5 minutes or so, it does something to the memory.
<br/>
<br/>
Any attempt to save results in "save error" and upon reboot, the memory is wiped.
<br/>
<br/>
All my regular carts work fine, so it's not the GBA. 
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas what causes this or if it can be fixed easily? I'm wondering if the save memory chip has gone bad...
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I guess there is a warranty?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
