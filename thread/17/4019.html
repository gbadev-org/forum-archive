    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a XG-Flash1 with a 256M cart, but the linker (cradle) died ! The led is always red very weak, and the windows doesn?t recognize the linker :(
<br/>
<br/>
But now I?m with the cart, and want to buy a link cable, but I don?t know if the cart work with cables like the "Flash2Advance USB Linker".
<br/>
<br/>
Does someone have a compatibility chart?
<br/>
Dows someone knows if the XG-Flash1 Cart works with any other linker/cable.
<br/>
Thanks !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Many different carts work with different linkers. The only thing preventing any cart from working with any linker is the software.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, littlewriter supports several different linkers, and several different carts. I think Jeff also has a good piece of flasher software which supports many different cart/linker combinations.
<br/>
As far as I know EZ/XG stuff is generally incompatible with other hardware/software.
<br/>
But many visoly/f2a/xrom carts are compatible with each others linkers. You just need the appropriate software.
<br/>
<br/>
A compatibility chart would indeed be nice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was only referring to the EZ1/XG1 as not compatible; they don't work with any other linkers or any third-party software other than LittleWriter. Lots of the others are swappable.
<br/>
<br/>
I have never managed to find docs on how to make the EZ/XG writable, which is the first impediment to creating better software. ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If littlewriter do support them, then they should work with other linkers too.. (using littlewriter)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
