    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So the SRAM battery in my 3-in-1 died. Again. Anyone have any tips on how to replace these without fucking up and breaking shit, like I did for my last 3-in-1? Can I install a higher-capacity battery somehow so it doesn't die after five or six months?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
