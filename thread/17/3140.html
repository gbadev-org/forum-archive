    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi All,
<br/>
<br/>
I've been reading about flash kits for a few days now, as I need to purchase one.  I thought I had my heart set on the EZ-Flash II 256Mb- Power Star, then I noticed the F2A Ultra 256Mb USB Kit.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I've read on this site that the Ultra carts had some issues with them.  Has this been solved?  Is there new software now which has no issues?  Or was the problems specific to the 1Gb carts?
<br/>
<br/>
I have found a supplier here in Australia that sells the F2A Ultra at a good price.  I just need some reassurance that this is a good kit to get.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers from Aus...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, i have no problem with my f2au, the only problem i have is that after i reboot my PC i first have to deactivate the flash cable in system settings and then activate it again (the drivers are a bit crappy but it really doesn't matter).
<br/>
<br/>
The cart works quite nice (i got the 256mbit one) and i don't think you'll need more than 256mbit any way!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>
