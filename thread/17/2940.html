    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I have bought a F2Au, burnt some games on it and was happy at first.
<br/>
<br/>
but the Problems occured when I want to save a game. somehow I can't open the savegames and the buttons on the cart seem to do nothing :(
<br/>
<br/>
My second problem is POGOshell.
<br/>
After I flash the flashme.gba I can choose Pogoshell in the F2A-Menu, but all I get then is a black screen :(  
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for any help on this :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">PogoShell is not supported by F2A?! PogoShell was designed for F2A. The problem isn't F2A, it's F2AU. This past week, F2A has announced that there was a problem with the first batch of F2AU cards shipped on the market. They're defective. You can contact them, send them back your F2AU card, and they will send you a new one. I believe the new shipment should arrive within the first week or March. You can check the actual web site for details (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.flash2advance.com" target="_blank">www.flash2advance.com</a>). You can also search the forums for a copy of the article.<br/>_________________<br/>"Amp up and amplify! Defy! I'm a brother with a furious mind!"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But as far as contacting the F2A people there are no details on their site about how to contact them, just a vague mention of returns. Maybe I missed that too though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm interested in ordering the Flash2Advance Ultra 512Mbit flash card. I have not ordered it yet for the following reason. The manufacturer recently stated that there's a defect in these carts on Feb 18th, 2004. <a href="http://www.flash2advance.com/" target="_blank">http://www.flash2advance.com/</a>
<br/>
When will you have the new fixed flash carts available for purchase? 
<br/>
<br/>

So the only person(s) who can give us a straight answer is the manufacturer of Flash2Advance[/u]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
You have to set the shell.bin as your boot rom in the config screen of the F2AU PowerWriter, and then flash your rom.bin on the card.
<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, it only supports up to 256M so you'll only be using half your card if you do that.  For now if you want to use your whole card you have to use PowerWriter</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
