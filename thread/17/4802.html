<br/>
<br/>
I have a whole bunch of roms in my rom folder, i send one to the cart and play the game for a good period of time...when im done with that game for a while, do i have to dump the rom to file + the saved file or can i just dump the saved file only? This way when i want to play it again, i just load the file from the rom folder and the saved file from the saved folder or do i always have to dump the rom file at the same time i do the saved file. I hope this makes sense to you all. tia</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As you know, ROM stands for Read Only Memory.
<br/>
So you compile your OWN code into a gba file and copy it onto the Flash cart - there's no benefit from dumping the ROM after you've played it, since the ROM (read-only remember) part of the game will not be written to.
<br/>
<br/>
And even if your console did mess up the rom, you could always get your source code for your own game (that you wrote) and recompile it anyway, couldn't you?
<br/>
<br/>
It would seem that home developers receive a lot of bad press since they are often associated with the tools used by many software pirates.
<br/>
<br/>
And you're NOT running pirated games on your flash cart, are you?
