    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Basically a friend of mine was playing pokemon saphire on a flash cart (EZFA), now he has picked up a cheap legal copy of the game. Anyone ever tried to transfer a save game from a flash cart to an official cart.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a gameshark sp, and that can do save replacement, but im worried that whatever it pulls off the flash cart (even in single rom mode) wont be quite right because I understand the game is patched to use sram instead of flash.
<br/>
<br/>
Another option I have thought of is using his save in visualboy advance, then doing the export gameshark game state, then using the gameshark to put the game into that state and then saving.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone tried either of these things (or know how to convert between ezfa .sav and gameshark saves)?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>
