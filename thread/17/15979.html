I'm not looking for the standard "hold all of your roms" flash kit.  
<br/>
<br/>
If it's already been posted, then I apologize.  I searched for about 5 minutes, but was not finding what I was looking for.

Thank you for your time.<br/>_________________<br/>-#2pencil</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, correct!  I want to make a couple of carts just for myself &amp; friends by taking apart existing ones.  I'd like these rather than a flashable kit.
<br/>
<br/>
We're no where near ready for actually going through a production facility to get this game sold, &amp; probably never will be.  But I think it would be fun to have on a cart.<br/>_________________<br/>-#2pencil</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's probably the cheapest generally available writable cartridge for the GBA. One place has them under 10 USD for 128 Mbit (16 MiB).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">tepples' suggestion is probably best. But if you really really want to find the eeproms instead, then first figure out what part numbers you need, then plug them into one of these sites: findchips.com octopart.com digikey.com</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I too am looking for EEPROMs.  mouser, digikey, newark, allied and allelec do not have them anymore since they are a end of life product.
<br/>
<br/>
What can I use as a substitute for building my own carts? (note I am not building a re-loadable cart)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, how do you know what size to get?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
