    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everyone.  I new to the GBA Flash Rom scene.  Just wondering which one is better?  the EZF-Advance or the Extreme Flash Advance?  I have read good reviews on the EZF-Advance but there not many reviews for the Extreme Flash Advance but the ones I have seen are good ones.  The reason I want to consider the Extreme Flash Advance is because I like taking it on trips and it says the Extreme Flash Advance lasts longer.  But peopel say the Extreme Flash Advance is not stable as the EZF-Advance software.  
<br/>
<br/>
Any info will be great.  Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i am happy with my f2au 256 mbit, it works good and i have nothing to complain about. Just buy the one you think is better, i don't think there are *really* bad carts on the market (or do you know one?). Well, this doesn't make decission easier of course :)
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you should judge it by the pricing... if that matters to you<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have had a chance to try out most of the gba flash kits available and if
<br/>
you have decided to go with either the EFA or the EZF-Advance you have
<br/>
made a good choice IMO. The EZF-Advance might be cheaper but the EFA
<br/>
enjoys a much better writing speed. However, as far as I can tell, you cant
<br/>
leave the EFA cartridge connected to a GBA when you write to it. Thats
<br/>
something I like about the EZF-Advance, that you can leave the thing
<br/>
connected and not have to keep removing it and connecting it all the time.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Please</span> stay (far, far, far) away from the EZF-Advance II though!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">e2city.com EFA for only 80, takes 2-3 to deliver in canada, 5-6 days for america, good services and everything. There were some sites that made comparasion, and most(I haven't found any that disagrees yet) says EFA is the best, followed by EZF.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
