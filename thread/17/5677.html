    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I am just getting into Gameboy Advance programming. It doesn't seem to be all that hard once you get used to it, and I feel like with a bit of practice I'll be able to create some simple games. What I need to know is, what's the best flash linker kit that's also really cheap? I don't want to waste loads of money on something that's just going to be a sort of hobby. My point is, I don't need all the uber spiffy features or whatever, I just want something that does what I need. Any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why not just look at all the retailers and find which one is cheapest? They will pretty much all work for gba development.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the suggestion. The only problem is that I want to make sure I don't buy something from some off-brand that doesn't work, breaks in 2 days, can only fit 128 kilobytes of stuff on it, or anything stupid like that. Please help me!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">all flash carts cost about the same. You should at least get a 256mbit flash cart (i think flash carts with less memory aren't produced any more), 256mbit is pretty much everything you need for development and for "backups" of your games. I think a 256 mbit cart always costs about 60$-80$...
<br/>
<br/>
I own a Flash2Advance 256mbit and it's good enough for my needs.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>
