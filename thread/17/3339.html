    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am interested in the "EZ Flash 2 Powerstar"
<br/>
<br/>
The official site: <a href="http://www.ezflash.cn/dealere.asp" target="_blank">http://www.ezflash.cn/dealere.asp</a>
<br/>
lists Robotpig.com as one of the dealers
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.robotpig.com/gba.php" target="_blank">http://www.robotpig.com/gba.php</a>
<br/>
&gt; However the product is called "Magic Flash PS RTC 256Mbit Kit" selling $75 USD &amp; modest shipping cost + allows credit card payment
<br/>
Product description-
<br/>
 Power Star version with Real Time Clock 
<br/>
? Compatible with GBA and GBA SP machines 
<br/>
? 1 year warranty 
<br/>
The Magic Flash kit is the latest flash kit available. With superior power saving and the latest Real Time Clock features, this is the best kit available on the market. It comes fully boxed with all the necessary cables and software
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* How reliable are Robotpig.com?
<br/>
* It is cheap. Other places are selling 256mb for above USD104
<br/>
? I am not sure if the product is "EZ Flash 2 Powerstar"
<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any feedback.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
