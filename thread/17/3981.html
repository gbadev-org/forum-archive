    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there any generic loader/writer software out there?  I am using an xg2 lite card with an ez-flash writer and it writes single games fine, but that is all it can do.  Any help?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From memory there is something around called "little writer" or something that works with several models of several cards.
<br/>
<br/>
However note that this isn't because it is generic because the cards are similar, it is generic because it has seperate code for each card from what I understand.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

I mean the little program that lets you select multiple programs on the gba is not functioning.  The one I use in windows seems to be working fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
