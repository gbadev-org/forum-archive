    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have an EZ Flash II devkit and I'm having some problems.  I'm almost positive that the problems are software related because prior my hard drive reformat it worked fine.
<br/>
<br/>
What I did was install the latest driver for the card reader and then install the EZClient v3.16 (and later tried 3.17).  The problem is that when I insert a catridge the program detects it and displays "Analysing Cartridge, 0%" but then locks up.
<br/>
<br/>
So I see that its detecting the cartridge properly but having problems reading it (or something like that).
<br/>
<br/>
Has anybody else ever had this problem?  Can anybody help me out?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
