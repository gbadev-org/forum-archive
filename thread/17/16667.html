    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I've been searching for writable cartridges to use with my GBA SP.
<br/>
I've found several different types, one of them a "Supercard SD". I'm looking here: <span style="font-weight: bold">[No links to retailers please - MOD]</span>  From the images, it looks like there is an actual SD card slot in the cartridge itself. So I have a few questions about this particular kind of card.
<br/>
    Am I correct in saying that to play a game on this cartridge, I put an SD card in my computer's SD writer, write a .GBA file onto it, plug the SD card into the cartridge, and insert the cartridge into my GBA? I do not need any special cables?
<br/>
    It calls it a "slot 2 adaptor". what exactly does that mean?
<br/>
    Does this use a regular old SD card? not an SD mini or anything?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Supercard comes with software that converts DS and GBA roms to a format the supercard understands. it changes .nds to .dsq and creates a .sav file, gba remains gba, but it adds .sav and .sci files. once you convert your files, you put them on an SD card and put it in the supercard. 
<br/>
<br/>
it's called a slot 2 device because it's designed for DS. there's a DS card that goes in slot 1 (DS), which by passes the main system software and accesses the roms you put on the slot 2 device, which goes in the GBA slot. 
<br/>
<br/>
there's versions of the supercard that take SD and SD mini. i think the mini version is called Supercard SD Micro? not completely sure. 
<br/>
<br/>
you CAN use it on a GBA with out the DS card, but in my experience it takes way more batteries to run. i just got a GBA from a friend like a week ago to run stuff like nanoloop 2.3 and M4G tracker, found out with the supercard i can only get about 3 hours out of two fresh AA batteries.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">supercard for slot2 are known to be some major power hog... the difference between my supercard, and my M3perfect or EFAII is quite big... too bad the supercard seems to be the only slot2 (mini)SD card still avaible...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
