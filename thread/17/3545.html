    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When I first started looking for a linekr, all the sites recommended success-hk, so I bought an EZF Advance II from them.  I now know that this was a mistake, but I'm stuck with it, so I'm wondering if anyone has got any insight into my present situation.  
<br/>
<br/>
When it arrived, the real time clock did not hold the time (It was reset everytime the GBA powered on, though I am unclear on whether this was 'normal' or not).  Everything else about the cart functioned properly for about two months.  Last night, I flashed a new batch of roms to the cart, and played for a bit.  I turned off the power, and turned it back on to back up my savegame.  The GBA hung at the white 'Gameboy' screen.
<br/>
<br/>
This is all it will do now.  Holding start and select while powering on does not play the 'successful' sound effect as it should.   I tested the GBA with a normal cart and all functions properly.
<br/>
<br/>
Because of the clock issues and sudden failure I suspect a bettery problem.  Is there anyone out there who has had a similar issue?  I opened up the cart to take a look and it appears the leads are somehow spot welded to the actual battery.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what the board of the EZF II Adavnce should look like exactly, but theres a black blob on the left half that has me a little suspicious.  I can send images if this would help.
<br/>
Thanks!

Return the cart to success and demand a full return. They know full well what crap the EZF Advance II is.

It's sad that some products go this far. Why did they have to start the name wars, even if the name isn't copyrighted (or copylefted)?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I dont think they wanted to start a name war..."just" cash in on the "EZF Advance" brand. I mean c'mon, they sell gba flash carts used 99% for pirating games, do you think they care what people think of them? I dont...

<br/>
And if I may quote myself (<a class="postlink" href="http://gbadev.org/index.php?ID=310" target="_blank">from this post</a>)...
