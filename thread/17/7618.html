<br/>
<br/>
I got me a micro the other day - lovely piece of kit. I hadnt owned a GBA for a couple of years (since I gave my GBA to a cousin with the promise of GBA emulation on the GP32). Anyways I quite liked the homebrew side so I got me a flash cart. (a XG2 Turbo + USB Slim Loader III).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways here is my problem. I installed the drivers on the cd (Usb_Slim_Loader_III_English_V1.20). I then plugged the usb cord in, did the wizard thing, pointed them at the folder with the driver in and nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
I then installed the latest drivers (from the site) - wouldnt accept these drivers either.
<br/>
<br/>
I then manually pointed the installer at the inf file and apparently it contains no information about my hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
Sigh. Im getting a new motherboard in a few days, if I havent got it working on this machine or then that I shall have to sell on :( - Blah... Im beginning to hate every usb peripheral ever.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways... anyone got any ideas? Any help would be appreciated :)
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
