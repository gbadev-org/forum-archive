    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was just about ready to order an M3 adapter this morning when I noticed their website is down, replaced with a default page by their ISP.  This makes me a bit nervous; I'd hate to get the adapter and find out the group has been dissolved (or worse) and there will be no further software updates.  Does anyone have any info about this or know where I can at least find the latest software / firmware for the M3?  Chances are it won't have the latest stuff when I get mine.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, while I'm at it, has anyone here used the M3 for development?  I did a quick search of this forum and didn't find any references to M3.  Is there any reason for that?  I did some GBA development back in 2001 but I'd like to get into coding for the DS.  Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
