    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am trying to help someone troubleshoot their F2A but do not understand what is going wrong.  I am communicating over e-mail with this guy, this is what he said....
<br/>
<br/>
"everything you said is exactly what I did.  I have tried several different 
<br/>
roms and I have the same problem with all of them.  the roms work fine when I play them with an emulator.  I am going to try it with several different gba's and see what happens.  When I shut off the gba sp and unplug the cable and then turn it back on...I get the white screen that says gameboy and the word "nintendo" will appear underneath that, followed by a noise.  Then the screen changes to an all white screen and stays frozen."

Thank you for any help,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If the screen is frozen at all white after the "Nintendo" screen, then the program has a bug which is evident on a GBA but not on the emulator.

Is the emulator VisualBoyAdvance, or is it something less accurate?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just got a 256mbit F2A and I had the same frozen white screen/ screeching noise error when I tried to backup my Castlevania:cotm cart and then flash it to my flash cart. I've also tried backing up several of my other gameboy games with limited success. Really the only cart I own that seems to have been backuped correctly is super mario advance. Others, like wario4 seem to load alright in the gba hardware but then bug out and are not playable. I'm hoping that I'm just such a newbie to this flashing thing and I learn some techniques to fix problems like this. Does anyone know of any tips to backing up legally owned carts and then putting on a multiboot cart like the F2A?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
