    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
F2A linker works as follow :
<br/>
+ you plug the linker : as it is based on an AN2131 chip and because F2A designers did not change its default USB ID, it is detected as a generic AN2131 device (prototype board).
<br/>
+ when the linker software starts (powerwriter for Ultra models, f2awriter for older models), it  uploads formware to the chip which resets and comes back as a totally different device as the AN2131 : the F2A linker.
<br/>
+ the software then uses commands to talk to the linker and write to the cart.
<br/>
<br/>
The first point above means that if you have another USB device that is also based on the same chip, there will be a driver mismatch with two drivers trying to use the same device. This is what happens with the Westell ADSL loader trying to configure the F2A linker. 
<br/>
You could try to locate and remove the Westell INF windows file to prevent this; this however may not be possible if you are really using the Westell modem as your ADSL device. In both cases, try to install and use the software on another computer to be really sure there is no problem with the linker itself.
<br/>
<br/>
You may also want to try the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.emuboards.com/invision/index.php?showtopic=3416" target="_blank">modified WinXP drivers</a> to see if you get better results.

I don't have the Westell Modem running but i
<br/>
did prior to my wireless setup, so i will try and
<br/>
remove the drivers manually. Will let you know
<br/>

<br/>
this is where it crashes. When I turn on the GBA, and press the buttons, it plays the game I somehow managed to put on it. The program on the PC stops reacting..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Well what i did was copy the .dll files into the 
<br/>
same folder of F2A on my harddrive as for some
<br/>
reason on installation this process did not happen
<br/>
then it worked. Let us know how you get on.
<br/>
This is exactly the same place mine was freezing
