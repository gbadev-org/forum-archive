    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi, i just bought myself a 512mb flash2advance cart
<br/>
and i have installed the drivers, the f2apowerwriter version 2.13 and i've read the faq but it doesnt have the solution to my problem.
<br/>
heres what i got when i tried to 'burn' a game
<br/>
the configurations are mostly in default 
<br/>
i didnt put anything in the section 'GBA BOOT FILE (Winf2a##.gba)' as i'am not sure what it is. anyone could tell me?
<br/>
<br/>
the game doesnt boot after it shows installed successfully on the software,  however on the gba itself it always shows burn error 'serious error!'  any idea why?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
