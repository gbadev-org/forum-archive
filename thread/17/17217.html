    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi to all,
<br/>
<br/>
I purchased a few "cheapest I could find" NDS carts with micro SD cards to install my own demo.  This happened to be the r4i - which I believe its a clone from research.
<br/>
<br/>
My problem is that I am not interested in the menu system that the card firmware / software has, but I would like it to boot directly in to my own game.
<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the binary, called _DS_MENU.DAT, under a hex editor I believe this is just a NDS ROM (not encrypted).  However renaming my own game to this file did not work.  Infact it wouldnt boot any homebrew or alternative firmware / menu that I tried to replace it with.
<br/>
<br/>
So I guess my question is because I can not replace this ROM but how can I hack it?  maybe I can have it launch my own ROM for me, or can I change an offset so it reads my ROM instead of itself?
<br/>
<br/>
If this is possible, how should I go about it?  does anyone know how to find the ROM's main entry point?  which disassembler should I use?
<br/>
<br/>
One of the options in the menu is to boot "media", this lauches the ROM called _DS_MSHL.NDS which CAN be replaced.  I would rather skip this step though.
<br/>
<br/>
Many many thanks for tips, pointers or suggestions!
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">unfortunately that doesnt work with my version of the card.  A bit of a shame because it looks exactly like what I need to do..  I'll see if I can find out how he did it to do something similar for my card.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much for your response!
