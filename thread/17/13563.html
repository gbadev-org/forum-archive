    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Years ago I had a GBC Gameshark that came with a parallel cable. It was supposed to let you backup and restore game saves. It worked once then bricked itself. When I returned it and got it back later, the same thing happened again. I decided to cut my losses there. Are there any GBA flash solutions that can also handle GBC carts?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
