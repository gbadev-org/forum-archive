    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am quite new to the GBA flash scene, although I have been lurking for a while, and I wish to purchase a GBA flash card mainly for playing Emulators on the GBA port of my Nintendo DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any reason why I should not purchase this card?  Will it work with all available emulators?
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The above link is the homepage for the card!
<br/>
<br/>
Also if I am playing a game on the flash cart (Zelda for example), when I save the game, If I wish to delete the ROM from my flash card, can I transfer the save game onto my computer, so that if I wish to play it in an emulator, or transfer back onto the Flash cart at a later date, my save game would still be intact?
<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any opinions anyone may have!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I have had my extreme flash advance 512mbit linker set for about a week now. I can honestly say that its a great cart! And the price too... this cart is excellent value for money.
<br/>
<br/>
It supports all of the emulators I tried - pocketSNES, pocketNES, DrSMS, etc... because this is a relatively new product compared to say the flash2advance you need to adjust the SRAM settings when flashing *some* emulators. For example, pocketNES requires 512kbit to be manually selected, but if this is the case its made clear on the website so you wont have any problems.
<br/>
<br/>
The flash software *does* allow you to backup the saves from a game before you delete it from the cart - and you can restore the saves at any time you want. Its also the fastest flashing cart on the market. And to top that off, the battery for the saves and RTC is rechargeable! It charges while you have the cart connected to your USB port.
<br/>
<br/>
About compatibility: Everything I have tested on the cart works perfectly, so you shouldn't have any problems here. The RTC works quite well too. 
<br/>
<br/>
Overall: EXCELLENT value for money, get it!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
