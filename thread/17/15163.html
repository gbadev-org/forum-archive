I have an M3 Real. As mentioned, it is only useful for the DS, not the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
The version I ordered came in a bundle with a (GBA) rumble pak, but there are other options. Next time, I will get either a 32 MB expansion or a GBA expansion, or both. I wish they'd bundle them, rather than the rumble pak, which no-one (IMHO) really needs.

Oh, and I can't give you any comparisons to other systems; I only have this one, and it works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
So about this supercard SD, how is it? Also how accurate is it compared to a commercial cart? Is the access time for the data and code the same or slower compared to commercial carts? Is the M3 also similar in performance?<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The SuperCard runs at 4,2 wait state, which is slower than the 3,1 that other devices (M3, NOR cards, and official GBA Game Paks) provide, but a lot of homebrew productions don't care about the slowdown.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I see, so M3 is similar to a commercial cart and SuperCard is a bit slower. Can you guys suggest a similar product(flash memory adapter type) that can be used on a GBA?<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a M3Real with Rumble+Ram pack
<br/>
<br/>
1) The Rumble pack is ok...but the detection - used by libnds - which works for an original Rumble pack does not work. Nio idea what forcedevice they use. I did not open the pak...to look on the IC's
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: They use a mobile phone vibration device!
<br/>
<br/>
Just writing to the RUMBLE register...works fine
<br/>
<br/>
2) I have no idea what size/speed the Ram has....a memtest application by tepples says it's a G6 with 32MB but writing to the ram fails
<br/>
<br/>
I send some questions to the M3 Team..they awnsered my mails twice...but NEVER awnsered to my questions...so support seems limited for homebrew developers.
<br/>
<br/>
So FAT support is there...support to develop for the extened ram NO, support for the Rumble pak NO</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by a128 on Thu May 08, 2008 8:52 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
