    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just got an EZ-Flash II Power Star 512M cart and set everything up. I've written a ROM containing som of my code onto the cart but when I try to boot it the loader asks for a password and I can't enter anything into the box. If I burn only the ROM to the cart without the loader I get a white screen and the GBA freezes up.
<br/>
The times I do get to edit the password option the writer seems to ignore my input when writing to cart and set some password that I did not choose.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried pretty mucg all the different drivers/writers without any luck.
<br/>
The only code I've been able to run is some publicdomain loader I found and the graphics were all corrupted.
<br/>
<br/>
ROM check fails after a few seconds at 0% and gives med a very useful "ERROR".
<br/>
<br/>
I know my code is working since it runs fine from my other cart which is a EZF advance 256M cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas? Has someone hacked the loader and remove the password options? This is really starting to drive me nuts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
