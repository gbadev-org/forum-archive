    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have recently bought a EZFA usb cable to use it as a multiboot cable in order to try my software on real hardware. I was very surprised to discover that certain gba graphic mode didn't work using this cable. I was able to display background in mode 0 but not sprites, and mode 1 didn't work. So i posted on the EZFA forum to ask for some help. The only response i got was :</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">If they work they work, if they don't they don't, there is nothing you can do that is just how it is, development has stopped on this software and will never be continued OMHO. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">. I think i am gonna try to reverse engineer this product so if anybody already try and could provide me some information, iit would be cool.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

An ezfa user myself, I can only think of a few things that would stop you using the ezfa for multiboot:
<br/>
- You didn't set the linker up for creating a multiboot rom (there's different ways of doing this with int's or defines)
<br/>
- You didn't code your ROM correctly (there are some discrepancies between some emulators and hardware)
<br/>
- You're not using the correct ezfa client for your cart. Afaik, you can't use any other software for multiboot except the EZFA Client by Borden.
<br/>
- Your rom is too big for multiboot
<br/>
- Your gba is busted in a very odd way.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
