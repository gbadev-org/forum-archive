    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here is a step by step instruction.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Check if your computer has a USB port.  If not, you can't use the linker.
<br/>
2. Double click on the driver file and extract the contents to a folder.
<br/>
3. Plug-in the cable to the computer. This will show you the "new hardware found". Choose the folder you have extracted the driver and install the driver.
<br/>
4. Run the flash writer program. At this time you will see another "new hardware found". Follow the same procedure and install the driver again.
<br/>
5. Put the cartridge in the GBA SP.
<br/>
6. Connect the other end of cable to the GBA SP. 
<br/>
7. Try writing files (or choose backup saver). It will show you the window "turn on gba and press select + start". 
<br/>
8. Now press start and select button at the same time and turn on GBA SP. You can release those buttons if you hear a melody or the loader screen appears on your GBA SP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
