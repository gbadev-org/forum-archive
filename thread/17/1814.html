    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure wether I should get  the older type EZ Flash 512Mb or the EZ Flash Advance 256Mb???
<br/>
Will I really need more than 256Mb?
<br/>
Is it true that the internal battery can be replaced in these cartridges?
<br/>
Is the EZ Flash Advance able to work with the linker devices?
<br/>
Do I really need the "Realtime Clock" in the EZF Adv.?
<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know, friends, if this is what I should get or if you recommend it. I noticed the older EZ Flash 512Mb is reasonably priced also.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if my questions sound silly or too many but I hope you understand I am very new to all the Gameboy Adv. Stuff and don't want to regret my choice for this item.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
All currently manufactured GBA flash carts are good enough for GBA development. If you are going for some more exact needs, read some reviews of the carts. If you need to talk to someone about your choice, then consider some other forum or channel before forum.gbadev.org or #gbadev. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
