    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I tried devloping for GBA before, and I'm intersted in giving it another go, back when I tried the first time I was annoyed by the awful bulky, paralel-port-connected thing I had to get and run off a seperate power supply, and the cart itself was really really expensive and didn't fit in a GBA SP.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been looking around and it seems like there are usb devices that look nice, like real carts and take mini SD cards. I've been looking at the EZ Flash 4 kit, would you recommend this? or is there something better / more popular / more often used? Superficially I think it looks good to me, but I need some opinions.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
