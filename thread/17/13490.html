    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey people.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a lovely old 256Mb F2A cart which for many years I have had to flash from work where there are PCs with parallel ports.  I'd love to flash it from home with my Mac which of course is USB/Firewire only.
<br/>
<br/>
I've done a lot of reading and I have come up with a few options.
<br/>
a) get a F2A USB cable from somewhere
<br/>
b) make a USB -&gt; GBA cable
<br/>
c) get a USB -&gt; parallel cable and use my linker with it
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know where I'd get a) any where, particularly since I only need the cable, plus it just occurred to me that it wouldn't work with my micro anyway (?)  b) is pretty tricky, I'd need an EZ-USB dev board or something, which I'd then want to connect via USB to the Mac anyway... I don't know if that even makes sense.  c) is looking really attractive since ebay wants to sell me these little cables really cheap (just search for 'USB parallel' and see what pops up.)
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm wondering if I went with c) would the linker even work with it, and is there already software that will use it?  if2a will only work with the official F2A USB cable, right?
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.
<br/>
d) just buy an M3 Perfect mini SD and don't tell the missus about it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
