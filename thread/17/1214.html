    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a problem getting the F2A USB Linker to work on my laptop. I'm running Win2k and using the F2A Writer V3.0 Software.
<br/>
<br/>
When trying to read or write i get the following messages:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Initial ULA ...
<br/>
Use DLPortIO
<br/>
Could not find xLA system !!
<br/>
Checking ULA....
<br/>
USB or driver error
<br/>
No Adaptor Found!</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, when i unplug the cable and plug it in again while the writer is running and already has given me the error message above, it will say:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Checking ULA....
<br/>
Initial ULA ...</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
then a tiny alert box will aprear with the title "USB-Linker-Advance" and the message: "ULA Re-plugging and initialized."
<br/>
When i click on the OK button the window closes and i get the message:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Waiting renumerating ...</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
There it will finaly stop, making the writer non-responding to anything. Only being able to shut it down with the windows taks control.
<br/>
<br/>
In the Device Manager there is something about an Error 31 on the EZ-USB for Flash2Advance Driver.
<br/>
<br/>
Also the driver does re-install often when I plug in the cable, but not every time. Tried to deinstall, reboot and reinstall, but it didn't help.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have an idea what the problem is or what i need to do to get it running?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Exactly the same here. Fails in the same way on ME, 2K and XP on three different machines.
<br/>
<br/>
Worked perfectly the first time I used it. Went for something to eat and came back an hour later to use it again and it wouldn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
I suspect a hardware failure occurred in the cable the second time of using. I have contacted my vendor with a view to getting the linker cable replaced.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
That is, imo, the only problem with the F2A usb cable (the damn drivers). Plus you only have their software and it won't let you use the cable to send other .mb files.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks a lot, i just tried the modified drivers and it works fine now ... no more need for that bulky old writer and that power suply, especialy as my notebook doesn't have a native printer port. With usb cable it's now oh so easy :)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using Win2k, just so you know, as in the readme of the drivers the author says he only tried with WinXP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
