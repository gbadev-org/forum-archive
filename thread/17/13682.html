    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all!
<br/>
<br/>
So this is a faily basic question, I realize, but I hope someone can help me out...
<br/>
<br/>
I own a GB Xchanger from back in the day. I haven't touched it for several years. I am now interested in getting set up to copy stuff to a GBA cart and run it on a GBA (need to buy one first...). My question is, can I use the old GB Xchanger to write to GBA flash carts? Do I need to buy totally new equipment? If I do need to buy totally new equipment, what would other users recommend as a cheap way to get started with this?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot for any help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No. Game Boy and Game Boy Advance use different cart bus protocols for accessing ROM. They use similar protocols for save memory, but the pin assignments and voltages still differ.

SuperCard is probably the cheapest way to get started with full-size GBA homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

-- You know, the human.

Like Tepples said, if you want NAND-based media, a Supercard would probably be a good bet.  Just make sure you don't get the Rumble series, as that has no GBA functionality whatsoever.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
