    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So i have this flashcart , but it seems that no matter what i try(i have tried every possible software ) the GBA won't boot any game at all(not even the menu doesnt appears).
<br/>
<br/>
The official software seems to be so buggy that even when it detects the cart
<br/>
it always asks for FORMAT(-- Only Neo power kit v2.3 seems to write/read correctly the data , but that's all--)...
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas what should i do to run homebrew on my GBA???
<br/>
<br/>
IM desparate and NOT wife...
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
