    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok I'm trying to get pogoshell working on this flashcart mainly because the provided shell/menu program is mostly in Chinese. I am working with the 512Mbit version and Pogoshell2.0b4. I'm not sure if the 128 has the same menu or not but the burning software for that was in english unlike the software for the 512. I've got the burning software in english now so now on to the shell.
<br/>
<br/>
The burning software uses a file called rbasic.gba for booting and is the shell software as well I've got pogoshell running instead of it by renaming the output flashme.gba file to rbasic and replacing the original with it. It will burn(I provide a small .gba rom for it to burn) and run upon startup just fine.       
<br/>
From there I can do everything pogoshell was made for except boot a .gba file which seems to involve a reboot cause thats what it does. To be specific I  get a black screen then go back to the menu.
<br/>
<br/>
Anybody got any Ideas how to get this working?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the burning software for the 512Mbit card and instructions on how to get it working in english. It also includes the software for the 128Mbit card if anybody was looking for that.
