<br/>
<br/>
PW 2.30 is out. Available at usual place <a class="postlink" href="http://www.flash2advance.com" target="_blank">http://www.flash2advance.com</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
It solves all known problems about savetypes (i.e all savetypes are supported) except for, one (FLASH512_V130 that works sometimes but not always). Bugs in the PC software have also been corrected.
<br/>
<br/>
Seems the best PW release so far. Great !
