    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok i got an ezflashii powerstar 256mb for chistmas and i've tried all the drivers i can find but after i agree to use an unsigned driver my computer spontaneously reboots.  also i know there is 2 versions of the ps a 2chip and a 4 chip version my question is where are these chips???  on the cartridge or what?  i guess what i really need is a link to the right drivers for the ezflashii powerstar in windows xp...
<br/>
<br/>

I assume this is the first version since it has 4 chips.
<br/>
If your EZ-Flash has 4 chips, you can download the drivers here: <a href="http://www.ezflash.cn/zip/ezdriverps.zip" target="_blank">http://www.ezflash.cn/zip/ezdriverps.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
And, if your cart only has two chips on the back, it is the second version. Those drivers can be downloaded from here: <a href="http://www.ezflash.cn/zip/ezdriver.zip" target="_blank">http://www.ezflash.cn/zip/ezdriver.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Should hopefully work....if not you can always contact the retailer who sold the device to you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey thanks for your response SimonB i got the flasher working and that is indeed a four chipper you have pictured because mine has 2 chips and the difference is now obvious!  i'm really really enjoying my powerstar now but i have no idea what was causing the problem originally.  when it started to work the only thing i changed was i unplugged the powerstar from my usb hub and plugged it directly into the pc suddenly it worked! apparently a power issue ?? oh well at least it works now</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most flash cards cables are meant to be used with a USB port directly plugged into the motherboard. For some reason, they do not work 100% on a USB hub.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
