    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I dug out my old stuff and want to use it once again. I have a Flash Linker Advance (from Visoly Inc.) with a 256M Flash Advance Card.
<br/>
<br/>
My current PC runs Windows 7 64bit and Mac OS X 10.7.3 (it's a custom built Mac clone). I also have Windows 8 Consumer Preview installed, but I doubt that helps.
<br/>
<br/>
I have no parallel port on my PC. I bought a USB parallel port adapter that works with Windows 7 without requiring extra drivers.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way that I can flash new software onto the cartridge with my current setup? Or do I need to install another old OS somewhere?
<br/>
Do USB-to-parallel port-adapters even work with the Flash Linker Advance in general? Can I run an old OS in a virtual machine (like VirtualBox) to use old flashing software instead?
<br/>
<br/>
I managed to download LittleWriter from the archive.org copy of the homepage that used to be at <a href="http://mapage.noos.fr/dadywriter/" target="_blank">http://mapage.noos.fr/dadywriter/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The latest archived version of the page seems to be from 2005:
<br/>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050304162746/http://mapage.noos.fr/dadywriter/" target="_blank">http://web.archive.org/web/20050304162746/http://mapage.noos.fr/dadywriter/</a>
<br/>
I installed it and ran into the error message "DLPORTIO.SYS device driver is not loaded. Port I/O will have no effect."
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also tried Flash Advance Writer 3.2 for Windows 2000/NT but that just told me
<br/>
"Could not open the DriverLINX driver."
<br/>
<br/>
Best regards!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Ghouzam on Fri Apr 06, 2012 11:02 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I downloaded DriverLINX Port I/O driver
<br/>
at <a href="http://www.winfordeng.com/support/download.php" target="_blank">http://www.winfordeng.com/support/download.php</a>
<br/>
but Windows 7 64bit refuses to run it. I guess it's 32bit only.
<br/>
<br/>
I found another version at <a href="http://www.jalcds.de/files/" target="_blank">http://www.jalcds.de/files/</a>
<br/>
but it suffers from the same problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I found Inpoutx64 which apparently also solves the problems with parallel port access, but for 64bit systems.
<br/>
I read at <a href="http://forum.velleman.eu/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=3773" target="_blank">http://forum.velleman.eu/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=3773</a> that since V1.0.0.8 it is compatible with DLPortIO.
<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded the latest version 1.5.0.0 from <a href="http://www.highrez.co.uk/Downloads/InpOut32/default.htm" target="_blank">http://www.highrez.co.uk/Downloads/InpOut32/default.htm</a>
<br/>
I installed it using the installer in the Win32 directory.
<br/>
I coped the files from the Win32 directory into the LittleWriter\bin\ directory.
<br/>
Then, I made a copy of the inpout32.dll in that directory and named it "DLPortIO.dll".
<br/>
<br/>
The README of InpOut32 states that it will not work with USB parallel port adapters. Oh no! I'll try anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
LittleWriter starts without complaints.
<br/>
<br/>
However, in the lower window it reports: "Linker not found".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm wondering if I can get the flash advance linker to work with any software, with any OS with the USB to parallel interface...?
<br/>
<br/>
The one I have has USB VID 067B PID 2305 REV 0200 according to the Windows 7 control panel device manager.
<br/>
It is listed among the USB-controllers as "USB printer support".
<br/>
It has no I/O address.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I'll buy a cheap PCI parallel port controller card. And try ucon64.
<br/>
<br/>
--------
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
I ended up using an old PC I am about to sell that has a parallel port and is running Ubuntu 11.10.
<br/>
Flashing worked right away using ucon64.
<br/>
<br/>
Using Linux, I also found out about my USB parallel port adapter: It's a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.prolific.com.tw/eng/Products.asp?ID=6" target="_blank">Prolific PL-2305</a>. However, that doesn't really help me using it :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for posting this, even if nobody could help. I still have to dust off an old Win98 laptop when I want to flash GBA games and I'm worried about it giving up the ghost eventually. Not to mention the inconvenience of it all. I use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from my dev machine, fire up Firefox 1.5 on the old clunker, download the gba file, and finally flash it... not pretty. Shame the usb -&gt; parallel port adapter didn't work under anything, would have been a good workaround.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yep, it's quite a mess really. I'll probably get a PCI or PCIe parallel port card for 4-10 EUR or maybe a EZ Flash IV (around 23 EUR at the cheapest place I've found).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
