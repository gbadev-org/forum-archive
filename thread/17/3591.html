    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heya, I just got my new shiny XG flash linker in the mail (128mbit, the first version).
<br/>

I am wondering: What software/drivers should I use with it? It's incredibly confusing to search through the net, because there obviously is a lot of software to pick.

What do you use with a working XG 1/Windows XP installation?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yet I got it to work thanks to you on IRC. I anyone else with XG problems is reading this thread, I can tell you if the cart is found by EZ POP, and you are unable to write to it, try to disable the loader option.
