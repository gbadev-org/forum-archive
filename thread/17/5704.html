    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been working on a leetle game for the GBAX competition, and I've hit a bit of a snag...
<br/>
<br/>
I think I've used my grey EZFA USB cable too much and I've worn it out!
<br/>
<br/>
It's meant to recognized by Windows XP as "USB &lt;-&gt; Serial": as I could replace the drivers and make it "EZF Advance Cable" as in <a class="postlink" href="http://bbs.gba-toys.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=242" target="_blank">the EZFA guide</a>)
<br/>
It is instead recognized as "Unknown Device", which I can't seem to do anything with and EZFA client refuses to see it as a "EZF Advance Cable"
<br/>
<br/>
Would you kind folks recommend me ordering a replacement from somewhere like Jandaman's? Or is there a cheaper/faster alternative rebuild guide lying around? Or has anybody got an EZFA Cable (gotta be the right one!) for sale? ;D
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I sometime had trouble with my cable when I plug / unplug it. I found that the best is to let it plugged or at least always plug it in the same USB port (I got 11 on my machine so that sometime is a pain to remember which one is EZFA's one).
<br/>
If you installed some USB &lt;-&gt; Serial adapter, the driver may have been f*cked up as EZFA people managed to let the original IDs in their product instead of using customs ones.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I myself am thinking of buying a new cable. It's dirt cheap and that would allow me to have one connected to each of my computers.
<br/>
<br/>
Only place to buy that I know of is Jandaman as you mentionned it : <a href="http://www.jandaman.com/games.mvc?p=ezfacable&amp;Category_code=GBADEVKIT" target="_blank">http://www.jandaman.com/games.mvc?p=ezfacable&amp;Category_code=GBADEVKIT</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've had the cable plugged in constantly for over a month... :( It suddenly just stopped being recognised as a cable.
<br/>
<br/>
Guess I'm-a gonna have to buy a new one. Okie doke!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!
<br/>
<br/>
Edit - Bought one from Jandamans! Should be arriving in a week!<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
