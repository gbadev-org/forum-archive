    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">[b]I have a flash advance xtreme 256mb set running in usb mode.  This has been a great system when the software works.  The prob i'm having is that I will start the program and it will crash before it starts running. it gives the standard sorry for the inconvenience.  I have tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it and damn near everything.  The only thing that seems to fix it is rebuilding windows.  Even after that it will work for a while then break again.   
<br/>
CAN ANYONE HELP ME.   
<br/>
I am using the v1.25 and the newst drivers and XP

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using a Flash2Advance USB on Win98. I've found that either the USB Linker or Windows USB support is rather flakey.
<br/>
<br/>
If I leave the linker plugged into my computer all the time, then eventually Windows will stop recognizing the device. I'll try using it, and the software will report that the linker couldn't be found.
<br/>
<br/>
When that happens, if I unplug the linker, I'll get a blue screen. The system won't be very stable, so I reboot. If I wait until after the boot finishes to plug the cable back in, it will be detected fine for a while, until the cycle repeats. Plugging the cable back in before rebooting will just lead to another blue screen, and it still won't work.
<br/>
<br/>
So, if you leave your linker plugged in all the time, that may be the problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
