    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The one that constantly gets my goat (as everyone on here probably knows by now) is data being put into header files.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to see a tutorial that shows how to append data as an array in a simple C file with a corresponding header file. It could also talk about using assembly files, binary files, and file systems such as GBFS, but this is the simplest, easiest-to-understand way to include data and it should be made available to newbies.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The "incorrect" tutorials I learned from (like so many on this forum) were the excellent Pern tutorials.
<br/>
<br/>
A new set of up-to-date tutorials would be wonderful. Just keep it SIMPLE. The thing that I loved about the Pern tutorials is that I was able install the devkit and compile the first little game in under an hour. From there, it only took me another couple of hours to build my own crappy game.
<br/>
<br/>
Granted, it was all Mode4 without sprites, but it was EASY. 
<br/>
<br/>
After that, I was hooked, and I've slowly learned the "proper" way to do stuff. 
<br/>
<br/>
So... if you want to write a "beginner's" tutorial, make sure that it's simple enough for a bonehead like me to figure out. Assume your audience knows VIRTUALLY NOTHING about hardware registers, endian-issues, and the like. And provide some demos that include complete make files that are as idiot proof as possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Or, perhaps a better approach would be to write some "intermediate" tutorials that assume you've already gone through the PERN stuff, and now will enlighten us to a little better way.
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, it's a good idea. If it's half as good as the FAQ, the community would benefit greatly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think this is the only thing I really take issue with. Not because the advantages of data in assembly over C aren't apparent, just because I believe having to do <span style="font-style: italic">anything</span> involving assembly will be intimidating to new users. And they have to get their data into a raw format anyway before they can use bin2s.
<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of teaching C arrays because it is very familiar, is compatible with the famous tools everyone seems to use (less work = more appealing to newbies), and means they'll be less likely to just go and do it the way Pern and GBAJunkie show them how.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is: make it easy for them to append the data <span style="font-style: italic">properly</span>, early on. They can worry about what the best method is later, so long as they aren't screwing around with improper header files.

This is true, but it only means you need to manually know/look up the addresses in memory you wish to debug. This is a tradeoff for not bogging down the elf file with tons of extra symbols that aren't necessary programmatically.

Not only the 4 wasted bytes is the problem but the slowdown when reading/writing to a register... and you really get no more typesafety since ALL pointers in C will be 32 bit (because of 32 bit addressing), no matter what type of pointer.
<br/>
I really don't get the advantage of using memory... I think you should take a look into asm and try to understand how it works in hardware and then you will understand what your code will compile to.

Personally I'd rather see tools that output gcc object files and autogenerated headers - I have no idea why people persist in turning binary data in source code 8 times bigger than the original data only to have the compiler turn it back into binary again. If you have a look at some of the code examples (such as they are so far :) ) you'll see the method I generally use for data. For bigger projects this method combined with GBA crusher <a href="http://members.cox.net/jsensebe/gba/GBACrusher.zip" target="_blank">http://members.cox.net/jsensebe/gba/GBACrusher.zip</a> is pretty much ideal. DevkitARM also provides a version of GAS which includes the .incbin directive for another alternative.

I can't see any reason to avoid the 'official' names since they are publically available on many sites, including the main documents used by homebrew developers - gbatek &amp; cowbite. The headers in libgba are based largely on those documents and I'd be more than happy to receive feedback on how those could be improved. Ideally I'd like to see libgba become a community effort with contributions from everyone who finds it useful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not only the 4 wasted bytes is the problem but the slowdown when reading/writing to a register... and you really get no more typesafety since ALL pointers in C will be 32 bit (because of 32 bit addressing), no matter what type of pointer.

I really don't get the advantage of using memory... I think you should take a look into asm and try to understand how it works in hardware and then you will understand what your code will compile to.

Hi :)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid you're a bit misinformed about what the compiler does with the variables that Sweex has suggested using. He's right in that gcc will generate identical code for the register access when defining registers as const but unfortunately additional data is placed in the .rodata section. Understanding asm &amp; looking at the compiler output is a good idea though :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For me, this is better than the 16-bit attribute method, and should be superior to bitfields in any case. At least in my OAM usage, the options can be determined at compile time, so there is no significant overhead using <span style="font-style: italic">long long</span>. This method is not ideal, however, for anyone who ? for instance ? is often using H-flip or V-flip.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The pointer and ref code is identical here but I understand good compilers can optimise better with references because they cant be changed to point elsewhere.

Anyway, not trying to prove a point just showing that there are other options. In my x86 code the whole difference is 4 bytes in memory and a single instruction that does a fetch. I would allow a little sacrifice like that for nicer code :P

Well, its kind of an aesthetic thing, but also a very functional thing. I'm too young to have been poisoned by C (joking) and learnt C++. Most C++ experts pick on C's way of doing things alot, I'm a little more liberal though and use <span style="font-style: italic">some</span> C style things.

That's a valid choice, but keep in mind that when you are doing GBA programming you are doing hardware programming, and you are using memory-mapped registers, not variables. #define simply keeps your code closer to the true hardware representation; using variables instead adds a layer of abstraction that I find pointless.

I do this alot, especially with registers that have slightly strange uses, to use a define here I would really have to undefine it after the code to keep my code from having names like _VIDEO___CONTROL and shit like that which I see in tutorials. I far prefer my engine.Background2.Colors(256) over remembering the defines every time, and my code runs pretty damn fast,and the files are small.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

this way you get your neat code with no macros, the pointer version costs the same as using #defines, if you use the references version, you only pay the extra 8 bytes once instead of per register.
<br/>
[EDIT: using references costs per access as pointed out in sajiimoris reply - and the const shouldnt be there in the references version]

as you can see, the pointer variant &amp; the #define result in identical code. The reference generates an unneeded memory reference and an additional 4 bytes in the .rodata section.

ASL and LSL assemble into the same thing. I suppose theoretically an arithmetic left-shift would produce a carry output whereas a logical left-shift wouldn't, but on the ARM this is handled by the CPSR-update flag.
<br/>
<br/>
ASR and LSR are mightily different, as ASR sign-extends whereas LSR only pads with zeros. Most mathematical applications, as you observed, require the use of ASR whereas most bit-juggling applications use LSR.

If you plan on including something about affine functions, &lt;i&gt;please&lt;/i&gt; make sure it gives a proper matrix.
<br/>
<br/>
On including binary data: as much as I can see why this would be a good thing, I've always wondered just how to do this since it's not an easy thing to find in manuals. A particular question would be: what'd be the name of the variable/reference/point whatever that one would use to find it? In assembly you can use a label, but somehow I doubt that'd work for pure binary files. Related to this is the question of what you actually got in the binary file, what's the width/height bpp of the data? Would the binary have a header, or should you just remember all that? Also, in the event that the conversion to GBA data went awry, browsing throught C or assembly is a lot easier than through pure binary. But of course, converters never fail, right? :P

what this does is redefine the standard _binary_&lt;filename&gt;_&lt;extension&gt;_start style labels to &lt;filename&gt;_start, &lt;filename&gt;_end and &lt;filename&gt;_size and generate a header with the appropriate externs. By default objcopy places things in the data section, --rename-section takes care of that &amp; moves things to the .rodata section where they belong.
<br/>
<br/>
Ideally you want some sort of header with your binary data to make things a bit easier otherwise you're pretty much stuck with doing things manually. You can of course write tools which will ouput directly to an elf object and allow a little more flexibility.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Don't spell INTERRUPT:

INTERUPT

INTRUPT

INTERPT
<br/>

I can't stand the registers having bad spelling.
<br/>

<br/>
Also, I must say that I want the game to operate with HBlank and VBlank correctly. Not just some void function with if conditions.
<br/>
<br/>
And the flags for setting interrupts that have been used, it should be something that's taken care of automatically. It's just confusing and annoying since I can't seem to understand what it's good for.
<br/>
<br/>
No more for-loops for loading sprites and graphics. I know it seems more easy to do it that way, but it's so crappy. Memcpy or DMACOPY it instead. It's the samr thing and everyone understands it.
<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to give out tools that work. Not just that worked with this sample, like some crappy PCX2SPR
<br/>
<br/>
And also, I hate this thing so much. All tools use different ways of storing data. Some is in header files. Some is in C files with externs. And most of them use u16 types but doesn't include the type. And some of them never add the last line that GCC complain about, making it hard to see if you got errors.

<br/>
On the HBlank, VBlank thing, I'm assuming you're talking (at least partially) about using the VBlank interrupt for vsyncing instead of checking REG_VCOUNT? As much as I agree this is better, the use of interrupts is still often done via a custom crt0.S/lnkscript where you have to uncomment certain things (if you can find it amidst the assembly and comments). This is probably not something you want newbies to confront with right at the start. Having a nice separate interrupt handler (like devkitARM's libgba's single_ints.s) for that would certainly help, but even then you'd have to wait until after discussing interrupts (and possibly assembly). 
<br/>
And isn't it possible to set the interrupt flags in the main interrupt handler so the separate isr's don't have to?
<br/>
<br/>
On copies: yeah dma is great, but apparently you should go overboard with it, see <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=3392" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=3392</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=1803" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=1803</a>. Wish I'd known about that stuff sooner. And about using the standard memory routines, remember that these assume bytes, not (half)words. Though memcpy should convert itself to use 32bit copies (at least the Visual C version does, I don't know about the GCC one), using memset can wreak havoc, especially when trying to copy to VRAM.

You are right, but still better force people to use Interrupts instead of making them being lazy. Sooner or later they will have to understand them anyway.

<br/>
Checking REG_VCOUNT is <span style="font-style: italic">infinitely</span> easier for new programmers to understand, it gets them thinking about and understanding the relation between their code and the hardware's performance and behaviour, and even more to the point, using the interrupt is an <span style="font-style: italic">optimization</span> and not something that is required for or contributes to basic functionality or even performance of a program.
<br/>

At best, all that using the interrupts does is spare a little battery drain. At worst, it confuses the heck out of a new programmer.

And it's an <span style="font-style: italic">optimization</span>, people! Remember Knuth! I <span style="font-style: italic">still</span> use REG_VCOUNT to sync my programs in the dev stage to VBlank, and I have yet to be told a compelling reason not to!

So, the real reason why I see that there are bad habits in tutorials, is that there is no <span style="font-weight: bold">one</span> way to do something on the GBA. Questions like, "Should we teach them how to use DMA first, or have them use a for loop?" and "Are interrupts something a newbie really needs to learn first (for VSync), or will checking REG_VCOUNT be ok?", confuse tutorial writers, and they end up writing about whatever feels comfortable to them.

<br/>
DMA copying and interrupt-based VBlank synching are both optimizations that have simple, C-based equivalents.
<br/>
<br/>
#including object data in a header file is erroneous and leads to worlds of problems as a project grows. The fact that the compiler lets you get away with it is no excuse for teaching it that way.
<br/>
<br/>
There is a tremendous difference between the two.
<br/>
<br/>
In the case of the former, I will always advocate teaching the C-based technique first and introducing the optimization later. Otherwise you end up with people who can't even debug their code properly because it relies on them using the DMA incorrectly or something. (I regularly use the DMA, but one of the first things I'll do when a block of code doesn't work properly is take out the DMA and replace it with a for-loop copy.)

Header files are meant to contain meta-data: basically shared information on how to access other information. This can include structs, function prototypes, references to external variables, and macro definitions.
<br/>
<br/>
They should never, ever contain executable code (exception: static inline functions) and that includes arrays of data.
<br/>
<br/>
A data file that is #included into two separate C files will end up defining the same symbol twice, which will cause an error when you get to the linking stage. These errors can be very difficult to track down.

I'd love to. I wrote a book reader app for the SP. During testing (aka reading full length books), on a full charge I could get about 5-6 hours with the frontlight on. I already knew about the intrwait functions and used them to halt the sp until next keypress.  I also added in code to disabe sound, making sure only the key interupt was active, etc. The result was on a full charge, I could get over 9 hours reading time. I know this is not related to vblank intrwaits, but it is relevant to the issue, and is useful info for those who wish to develop apps that need to conserve battery life.

OK, forgive me for being blunt, but I've just moved a whole apartment into a trailer and I'm dead tired. You're right that it's not relevant to VBlank syncing. Your frontlight battery-draining example on the SP has no bearing whatsoever on my question. So what's your point, then? Yes, it's useful info for those who want to develop apps that need to conserve battery life. But for the umpteenth time, it's not necessary for an introductory tutorial and makes things unnecessarily complicated for beginners.

DMA is a built-in feature, but I don't expect beginners to use it to load data into memory. Why? Because it's an optimization. It's nice-to-know, not need-to-know. Beginners need to know the need-to-know stuff. The nice-to-know stuff can come in the later chapters, but if you try to dump it all on them at once they'll just do things the Pern way because it's more familiar to them, and you'll have accomplished nothing.

Because even if the beginners of today read all the tutorials around and worked as hard as humanly possible it's unlikely that they would ever find work developing for the GBA, considering the handheld is having a midlife crisis about now.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I realised this made me sound jaded, I really do think that you should teach the best way first no matter how technical it is, I know too many people who have read a shitty "Teach yourself C++ in 24 Hours" book and not only dont know anything advanced, they know the <span style="font-style: italic">wrong</span>way to do simple things.

Also someone mentioned the tests nintendo does to allow publishing of games, could someone send me a comprehensive list of these?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

The alternative, which is more common in the real world, are people who think they know how to do specific "advanced" things, but don't understand the principles enough to extend their knowledge.

I definitely agree.  With the majority of my math and computer hardware classes, we'd have to learn the long, drawn-out ways of doing things before we learned the "shortcuts."  Granted, these shortcuts represented the <span style="font-style: italic">right way</span> to solve the problem, and advanced students and professionals, I'm sure, would use them.  But beginning students won't appreciate these shortcuts and will likely have a more difficult time understanding the concepts if they don't muck through the simple, less efficient way first.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I agree with pretty much all of what Dan has been saying, especially regarding GBFS.  Tepples, I'm sure any tutorial you'd write would be correct and concise and a great learning tool.  But if you force people to use GBFS, you'll probably lose a chunk of your audience, if only for that section of the tutorial.  Many people will want to code everything by themselves, and others still may not want to learn an additional system to get their demo to work.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, when I started out, I read about things like DMA and interrupts, but I didn't bother implementing them right away because I could achieve the same results doing something I already knew how to do (using memcpy, waiting for Vblank using a loop).  Had your upcoming tutorial been around back then, I probably would have skimmed over the GBFS section and used another source to show how to include data the "quick and dirty" way.  I think you should keep the GBFS info in there, sure, but I'd suggest doing it in addition to explaining the simpler way first as a more basic technique.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Vblank syncing is one of the most fundamental tasks when writing a game, especially on a machine like the GBA where access to VRAM is restricted outside the vblank period. If you want to put things on screen you *need* to know about it.
<br/>
<br/>
while (REG_VCOUNT&lt;160); is not sufficient for a working wait for vsync, especially with simple programs. The correct way to do this is to wait for the vblank period to finish, then wait for it to start again.
<br/>
<br/>
Given that REG_DISPSTAT contains a flag which will tell you if the machine is currently in the vblank period, I fail to see why people feel the need to use the scan line counter for this purpose apart from someone getting it wrong back in the mists of time.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">

<br/>

<br/>
while (REG_DISPSTAT &amp; 1); // wait for vblank period to end
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
If the second wait is not present and your code does not consume the entire vblank period then it will quite happily execute several times a frame.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem with this is that most of the time your code will be sitting in a loop doing nothing more than consuming the battery. This can translate into 50 - 60% less battery life (yes you did read that right) and so the IntrWait functions have been provided as a simple method to wait for events while conserving energy.
<br/>
<br/>
The issues people have with complexity are, I think, related to having only full interrupt dispatchers available as examples. To make use of the IntrWait functions does not require that all the interrupts are serviced, it merely needs some code to indicate that an interrupt has taken place.
<br/>
<br/>
here's a spectacularly nasty piece of code - I wanted to put together a completely self contained example for illustration purposes. The IntrMain function is given as inline assembly only to allow the mixing of ARM and thumb code within a single source file. The confusing casting &amp; anding of the function pointer is part of making this work. Normally the definitions would be in a header file and the interrupt handler in a separate file, compiled as ARM code.
<br/>
<br/>
This code is not what I would consider clean and is only given as an illustration of using the IntrWait functions.

This is true, and it's important that tutorials teach it this way. I'm not certain whether or not the Pern tutorials do.

<br/>
<br/>
Let's be clear on one thing: counting scanlines isn't "getting it wrong". It's not wrong because it works just fine and makes perfect sense from a hardware perspective.
<br/>
<br/>
But yes, checking REG_DISPSTAT is just as effective and an equally viable way to teach VBlank synching. One is not inherently more right than the other, though.
<br/>
<br/>
I like using the scanline counter because often I am interested in trapping other phases of the CPU in addition to VBlank. Scanline counting is an easy way to do this.
<br/>
<br/>
I like scanline counting in tutorials because it gets the programmers thinking about and comprehending the way their software interacts timing-wise with the hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
But these are both personal, subjective reasons. I think a tutorial that teaches either method is fine.

Thats the neat thing about dependencies is that different authors could write different tutorials:

"mode 7" speed version (needs rot scale bgs, and HDMA)
<br/>
"mode 7" space version (needs rot scale bgs, and ISRs)
<br/>
<br/>
Assuming that more than one version of a topic has been written, it allows for specialization.  Somebody might finish learning about HDMA and really like the concept.  Great!  There is tutorial out there that draws on those skills.  If the learner skipped DMA and learned about ISRs first, then s/he can still learn about the "mode 7" effect.

That's such a ridiculously inappropriate thing to say I can barely formulate a response to it. I could point out that I've backed up every single point I've made with logic and relevance to the topic. I could point out that if I am a troll, I must be a very good one since you're the first person to find me out in the 800-odd posts I've made; I've managed to trick just about everyone else in thinking I'm a valued contributor to the forums. I could point out that a troll is someone who baits others into responding with intentionally inflammatory, non-substantial posts, not someone who argues a point well. I could say it looks to me like you're a bit of an idiot who isn't capable of attacking my argument so is trying to attack my character instead.

Odd, a lot of documention suggests that this isn't the case. I've also seen it reported that it is not possible to write to VRAM which is currently being accessed by the LCD controller.
<br/>
<br/>
I've just done some tests which confirm that this doesn't appear to be the case. I find it difficult to believe that the VRAM is actually dual ported though - it seems more likely that wait states are inserted (Nintendo being renowned for doing things on the cheap - DMA and the 16bit write to VRAM being prime examples). Must try some speed tests later.

The best way to do this is just to put the calls in a library as I've done with llibgba. GCC uses r0 - r3 as parameters to functions with 4 or less arguments with the rest going on the stack for 5 or more. I've played around with inlining these calls but I came to the conclusion that it's just not worth the trouble.
<br/>
<br/>
*Warning*  do not place this function declaration in the same file as code which calls it. At higher optimisation levels gcc will inline the function and mess it up quite badly. Fixing this makes the compiler generate more code tthan it would for a simple function call so, personally, I'd recommend just not bothering.

Battery life is of <span style="font-weight: bold">paramount</span> importance, regardless of what a personal 'finding' may be. Nintendo, being the ultimate authority on official protocol and guidelines, has layed out what is termed as proper, and dismissing battery life is just downright juvenile.  A fundamental question would be what do you think most beginners would prefer to be taught - the proper way, as outlined by Nintendo themselves, or in a manner that is contrary (particularly because some post on this board says it's ok)?  I would wager most would want to be taught what is proper, as defined by Nintendo, especially if they have sights on pursuing a career in the industry.  There is a 'right' way, and beginners ought to be taught the right way - or don't teach them at all.

I'd also like to point out that no amount of posting to these boards should ever be a measure of some self-imagined authority over what is proper and what is not.  This is Nintendo hardware, and we should be following their guidelines - and let's not bring up the fact that we shouldn't even be aware of said guidelines when everyone is being pointed to documentations and manuals that often lift naming conventions and documentation verbatim and everything the homebrew 'scene' has (docs, emulators) is owed to leaked material (*sniff*, *sniff* what's that? oh! that is the smell of hypocrisy!).
<br/>
<br/>
Let's agree to disagree and keep it at that, and leave it civil.  My vote is for teaching the proper method.  I am agreeable to counting scanlines as long as there is sufficient documentation explaining why this hits the batteries hard (yes, it <span style="font-weight: bold">does</span>).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I see, you've appointed yourself an authority on what beginner tutorials should teach too, because I don't see an "I think" or "I feel" in there anywhere, so you must be right!.  I'll say it again, you ask a newcomer if he or she would rather learn the way the professionals do it, the way Nintendo wants it done, or some halfhearted method for the sake of being simple and making things 'easy' because you don't have faith in the tutorial writer's ability to explain it properly (which is bordering absurdity because setting up a vblank irq and syncing with it is trivial), my gut tells me the majority of beginners will want to do it the <span style="font-weight: bold">right way</span>.  A well constructed tutorial will guide readers appropriately and explain things thoroughly using the industry accepted methods. End of story.

It's been something I've been meaning to do for a while but haven't yet decided on a format for. One of the problems I keep coming back to is just how much depth to go into regarding the hw register definitions - it seems like a lot of work to essentially replicate extremely good documentation like gbatek.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps building your tutorials around libgba would be a good approach towards a good set of documentation. Having the tutorials explain the registers and  having a quick reference guide with libgba.

I don't mean to shower them with information. But balance good practice with the learning curve. Nothing should take more than 20 minutes to learn, and anything bigger than that should be carefully taught (usually by breaking it down).

<br/>
That depends on one's personal definition of save.  Once you ignore the noise, this topic *is* saved.  People can argue about how a tutorial can be done from now until the end of time, but until they have written a tutorial and received feedback on it, I can not give their side comments much merit.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather hear the constructive criticism that the tutorial writers have received instead of theories about what would make a better tutorial.  I think that talking about how existing tutorial material could be inproved is productive.
<br/>
<br/>
Bickering over another persons opinion strikes me as out of place.  My question is, "do you feel strongly enough about it to write your own tutorial?"  Yes?  Excellent.  I look forward to reading it.  No?  Let it go and the thread will become less noisy.  (Note that unless one *is* a troll, should not not bickering result in less stress?)

<br/>
I like the code. Very clean, nice comments.
<br/>
<br/>
The header file is so simple! Very nice for a beginner's tutorial.
<br/>
<br/>
The documentation is a little cold -- maybe a little too technical for my taste [emotionally -- the technical aspects of the document have the right amount of technicality :) ]. Maybe that's what you were going for, though. I like when technical documents throw in some jokes, a quote at the beginning of the chapter, that kind of thing.
<br/>
<br/>
The flow through chapter 2 seemed a little awkward, the jump from GBA info into fixed-point arithmetic and Newtonian physics mainly. If I were reading a book I would expect those things to be in appendices.
<br/>
<br/>
The physics section could be fleshed out a bit, also. Next draft, I'd suppose.

I don't think the goals conflict. It's just that when I was reading along, the fixed-point section kinda caught me be surprise. I'm probably making a bigger deal of this than is necessary.

<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to offer myself to the group as a guinnea pig for future tutorial stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
A little bit about me: 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm an experienced PHP developer with a few years of web development under my belt.  I'm familiar with basic C structures and constructs -- PHP borrows heavily from C and C++.  I understand general OO design concepts (classes, methods, functions, pointers), but I'm *not* used to accessing hardware and memory directly.
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully I can be a good resource for you guys, providing feedback on the tutorial from the perspective of a user competent at the core skill set, but one who's still a neophyte for all intents and purposes.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm terribly bored with web development, and am looking to develop a new skill set.  I'm very appreciative of your efforts, and am looking forward to really getting my game development chops together.
<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if I can be of any assistance.

<br/>
How do you debug your gba proggies when they are running?? Ive taken the code from the second tute and tried to add a generic line drawing fucntion that uses bresenhams algorithm but it aint working, and not being able to check the values of variables at run-time means i have pretty much no chance of getting it working proplerly!
<br/>
<br/>
Im used to developing in visual studio and setting breakpoints and all that jazz, is there anyway i can do something like this for gba dev? is this going to be covered in one of your tutorials?
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
1) They are being rewritten with proper grammar and spelling (at least more proper)
<br/>
<br/>
2) Day 1, and 2 rewrites are complete and up, and include such things as how to get data into your games by every means other then some sort of proprietary rom file system.  The new graphics converter (improperly named pcx2sprite) can output raw, c, header, object file, and source code will be provided when I have time to comment it.  Day 3, and 9 should be up in this weekend.
<br/>
<br/>
3) Defines are fine for registers...if your emulator does not have a register viewer get a new emulator.  But the tutorials purpose is not to give you a library but to teach you the hardware.  The implementation is completely up to you.  Use bitfields for all I care :)
<br/>
<br/>
4) Day 3 and nine should be up by the end of the week.
<br/>
<br/>
5) make is a waste of time for single file projects such as 90% of my tutorials and I felt (and still feel) that make is a complexity that has no place in my tutorial.
<br/>
<br/>
6) In response to 5 and as a compromise I will add an appendix to cover make files, and be sure to enlighten readers on the proper way to manage projects.  
<br/>
<br/>
7) I have several hundred hours of effort invested in my tutorials and well over a hundred pages of GBA info.. I have no editor and I can?t spell, but I do now write my text in a word processor before posting it for the world to see.  My tutorials are always open to feedback of any sort. 
<br/>
<br/>
8) I have only made it to page two of this thread and felt compelled to post so if i am being redundant please forgive :)
<br/>
<br/>
9) My tutorials were at one time very popular and their accuracy and "correctness" both in a technical sense and in an aesthetic sense are important to me.  Instead of starting a new series can we instead just give me feedback to incorporate into my rewrite?

Anything that involves converting bitmaps won't be a single file project, as you need at least one file for code and one for graphics.

    <h4>#25256 - Deanonious - Thu Aug 19, 2004 4:09 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have significant experience writing software in Windows... mostly Visual Basic and some Visual C++, and because of that I have absolutely no hardware programming experience, so prior windows programming experience a side, I consider myself a complete newbie.
<br/>
<br/>
I have looked through many of the tutorials out there, I even read through all of Mr. Harbour's book, and I have some comments on what I have found or not found in them, and I think this insight would be quite useful to the discussion at hand.
<br/>
<br/>
1) Coming from a totally "Modern" Windows programming background I do not completely understand Timers or Interrupts.  I understand procedural programs and Event driven programs, and although Message Handlers are a direct descendent of Interrupt Handlers I have been so completely sheltered from the hardware aspects of coding them that Interrupt Handlers still remain mysterious to me.  I do realize and undestand there importance in GBA programming, but I have not found a concise and adaquate reference on them.  I believe that a good introduction to them should be made as early as possible in the Beginner Tutorials, and then as the tutorials progress more in depth coverage of them should be given.
<br/>
<br/>
2)  Memory management is another GBA programming issue that I somewhat struggle with, "Modern" PC programmers are not taught to maximize memory usage, and since I have started learning GBA programming I have decided that this is a great shame, and I now consider it "bad" programming practices.  I believe that the non-technical aspects of memory management should be covered very early, perhaps even in the introduction to the tutorials, and then more in depth coverage should be given as the tutorials progress.  
<br/>
<br/>
I am a Math/Computer Science major at Texas Tech University, and most modern Computer Science classes (here anyway) don't ever cover 
<br/>
malloc(), realloc(), memmove(), memcpy()... in fact in the last CS class I took I actually got in trouble for using memcpy() in my code and was told that the For Loop method for copying memory was the only "Acceptable" method (besides using the STL Allocator Class) because most modern programmers would not understand my code.
<br/>
<br/>
3)  File System Support (or the lack thereof) is a huge stumbling block for me, from my non-hardware programming background, I do not understand how to attach binary data to an executable but I very often find myself needing (or atleast wanting to) include binary (or even occassionaly ASCII) data to my programs.  I do agree that using a "third party" library like GBFS may not be the best approach to teaching this, but attention needs to be given to this subject early on.  Perhaps even an Advanced Tutorial on how to write your own GBFS like library.
<br/>
<br/>
4) Lastly I want to see a detailed well commented Header file of ALL the registers that are needed for programming the GBA.  Although, I agree that a beginner should be introduced to them slowly and as needed, some of the tutorial writers seem to lump the needed ones togather every project and I find it tedious to re-write #define's all the time, besides from personal experience typing in memory addresses is extremely error prone, it's easy to make a typo in a memory address and until you become familiar with the addresses it isn't always easy to find where you made the typo.  I know that DevKitAdvance and HAM both have there own Register Defintions included but I would like to learn GBA programming from scratch, so I would like go through tutorials and eventually write my own complete Register Defination file.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope that you find some of my comments helpful.

Then that was not a very good class.  Part of knowing the language is knowing the standard library, and if a "professional" C programmer doesn't know C then they have no claim to that title.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, these particular tutorials have the prerequisite of knowing C, so it's appropriate to leave out explanations of standard library functions.  There are many C tutorials already out there.

I was just saying Universities do NOT teach "C" anymore, it's considered outdated and obsolete.  From day one when you walk into a CS Class at Texas Tech University you start learning C++, strings are the STL String class, C-Strings are just some stupid thing left over from C so if you need one call string::c_str() and all dynamic memory is either handled by new/delete and for loops or by the STL Allocator class.  It's been that way since before I started here in 2000.  I personally thinks it's stupid my self, I learned C over 10 years ago that's why I know the C-standard library, but that is the way things are going now.  Sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as the GBATek goes, yes it is a wonderful reference; however, a beginner isn't going to want to weed through technical references to look for something, when they probably won't even know what they are looking for.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A couple of things to be aware of:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Universities still teach C. <span style="font-style: italic">Your</span> university doesn't teach C. You may believe that your university is better for this reason, but you would have an extremely difficult time making an irrefutable case for it. Already working against it:
<br/>
<br/>
2. Extensions like STL are a total speed/memory kill on a platform like the GBA. So those "outdated", "obsolete", "stupid things left over from C" are, ironically, of critical importance if you want to do anything on many embedded platforms.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I didn't mean to offend you, but in my honest opinion it's a bad idea to teach students to be willfully ignorant about certain parts of the subject language.
<br/>
<br/>
Ask yourself why the standard C library is included in the C++ definition.  It's for backward compatability, right?  Well if C++ was designed with backward compatability in mind, shouldn't C++ programmers be backward compatable as well by knowing the standard C library?
<br/>
<br/>
This may seem like an abstract or overly intuitive argument, but cross-platform compatability is one of the main reasons C++ has become so popular, and firms that use the language take advantage of this feature regularly (e.g. by using 3rd party libraries written in C).
<br/>
<br/>
About GBATek, I thought you were looking for a reference.  Sorry if I misinterpreted.  At this point I'm not sure what you were asking for, because a big list of all the registers and their usage sounds like a reference to me, and I can't imagine how such a list could alleviate the chore of hunting down the information you need.  Tutorials have that goal, which is why I tended to rely on them until I was more comfortable with the hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In fact I have gotten in a LOT of trouble because I challanged and/or refused to buy into there crap.  I am like most of you I started with C over 10 years ago, and I totally disagree with my Universities teaching approaches to Computer Science.  I never said that I think my university is better than any other university, I was merely pointing out the fact that some "programmers" are coming from a different background than most of you and that they shouldn't be talked down too because they weren't taught techniques that they are assumed to know.  Yes I think it's a real shame that a lot of these techniques aren't taught at my university, I have gone too the Chairman of the Department on numerous occassions to voice my opionions on the subject, and have debated with numerous professors over there "policies" and/or teaching style.  Hell, I almost failed a C++ class because I used OOP techniques???

I was trying to point out a few things that I believe should be addressed in a beginner tutorial, I never said that you should go out and write the next "Teach yourself systems programming in C in 21 days" book, I was just making a few points on my experiences as a beginner GBA programmer and certain things about Memory/Resource Management were and in some cases still are a mystery to me.  At least include a link to Rafael Baptista's great article "Gameboy Advance Resource Management" on Gamasutra.com and maybe in the introduction link to a few really good C tutorials that are pertinent to the subject, and say something like "Hey if you aren't familiar with 'C Standard Library Memory Management' go brush up here... &lt;insert link&gt;"
<br/>
<br/>
The URL to the Baptista Article is:

Unfortunately, I think that you have to log-in to Gamasutra.com to read it :(.  The Code is no longer available as Nintendo has decreed that it as usual violated there intellectual property rights and has confiscated it, those among us that are "licensced" still have the joy of obtaining it via Nintendo's developer site.  He wrote a more general "Memory Manager" tutorial on his website it can be found here.

It makes me really sad that Nintendo is such a jerk, I can understand some kind of Quality Assurance testing, like maybe Windows, if you want to put a Microsoft Windows Approved sicker on your game you have to pass there QA tests, but making developers pay thousands of dollars to write Software for your system is just crappy.  
<br/>
<br/>
If I were Nintendo I would want people to develop software for my system it seems to be that the more quality games that are out there the more people are going to want to buy your system and that means more profit.  With the PSP coming out soon with all it's raw power, Nintendo may very well die if they don't come to there senses, in my opionion Nintendo hasn't had a home console worth buying since the SNES, the Gameboy is there only saving grace.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, that just came to be because I was trying to dl the source to Mr. Baptista's article and I got really depressed when I couldn't.

I didn't want or mean to start another flame war in this thread, I merely wanted to aid the community by stating my take on the current state of GBA programming tutorials.  I'm sorry for causing such a stir, I just wanted to help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Think of Nintendo's position in 1985. The U.S. video game market had just crashed from a glut of poor-quality third-party software for Atari 2600 and a few other early 8-bit console platforms that didn't use signed binaries.

That said, I'm still working on my tutorial off and on, but given that The Pern Project's tutorial is being rewritten, I might trim down the scope of my project to cover only what New Pern doesn't.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nintendo was smart to limit the 3rd party developers in 1985, but that business model doesn't work quite as well today.
<br/>
Sony proved that when Playstation became the #1 console back in the mid-late nineties.  They charged developers something like $5 for a license.  Nintendo has been playing catch-up ever since.
<br/>
<br/>
It make me wonder about how well the PSP is going to do up against the DS.  If I had to put money on it, I'd put it on the PSP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
