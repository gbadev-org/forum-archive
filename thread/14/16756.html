    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">im trying to follow the 'Gameboy Advance Programming for Beginners - Loriak Development' (here's the link so you know what im talking about: <a href="http://www.loirak.com/gameboy/gbatutor.php" target="_blank">http://www.loirak.com/gameboy/gbatutor.php</a>) but i think im having problems with the installation.
<br/>
<br/>
First off, I'm running vista. Is this a problem?
<br/>
<br/>
If not then I'm not sure what to do. I unzipped everything to C:\devkitadv and added C:\devkitadv to my path. I copied the code for a "hello world" program into a file called hello.c. Then I copied the next bit of code into a file called make.bat. The tutorial tells me to double click on "make.bat" which is supposed to create an elf file and hello.gba. the problem is that I'm getting errors when I run "make.bat". A command prompt will open up and it says this...

I have no idea what any of this means! I've looked around at different tutorials but none of them say what to do if you get an error like this. Any ideas? If this has already been dealt with in another post, please pass the link on to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">AFAIK, devkit advance is very outdated. use devkitPro instead.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">http://www.devkitpro.org/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
also, I'm pretty sure that that tutorial is old, as it refers the gba as new.
<br/>
<br/>
I think most people would use tonc as gba tutorial.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am running the 64 bit version of Windows Vista. I use devKitAdv (yes, not devKitPro) and everything works just fine for me. I never ran into those errors when installing though. Dunno if this would make a difference, but are you the admin on your computer?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
