    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. I'm relatively new to GBA programming and am currently figuring everything out. I've been reading through several tutorials (PERN Project, now TONC) and I've also been reading through the forums. I've also been messing around with the different development environments, having followed and succesfully setup the Eclipse/devkitARM/vba-sdl-1.7 environment as described in a tutorial here.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I wanted to get down to the basics and having removed everything prior, I got the latest devkitARM release (16a) and VBA SDL 1.7.2 alongside VBA DEV 1.7.2. I created a master makefile setup so that I can "make sim-debug" and "make sim" which makes my gba program and launches it in VBA SDL (sim-debug) or VBA DEV (sim). With VBA DEV, I can exit out of the VBA environment, but with VBA SDL the terminal remains open and I can't manually close it. I'm not sure if this is because I haven't created an exit key in my GBA program or if it's something to do with the VBA SDL itself, so I was hoping for some clarifications in how the VBA SDL works.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.<br/>_________________<br/>.ahad</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
