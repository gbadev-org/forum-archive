    <h4>#51924 - psycorpse - Wed Aug 24, 2005 6:41 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have decieded to make a bejeweled clone as one of my first projects. I know it is going to be a little more difficult but it will be a good learning experience. I have read several tutorials on how to display sprites and so forth and I know how to display them and move them. I haven't been sucessful in finding the answers to my questions so I am posting here. If you don't want to give the answers because they are lenghtly then can you point me in the right direction and I can research from there? Anyways here are my questions.
<br/>
<br/>
1. I have three sprites (I know there could be more. But I am keeping it simple) that I am using. I have them loaded in OAM and I can display them fine. The question is how do I go about repeating them on the screen?
<br/>
<br/>
2. How would I go about checking to see if three of the same sprite are in a row? 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.

Create multiple OAM entries that point to the same tile in VRAM, but have different x and y coordinates. Just don't go over your 128 OAM entry limit.

By keeping track of the location of your game's entities in an array of their own data structure. Then for each row, loop through the array and keep a running total of how many of each different type you've found.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another helpful hint: If you're making a grid-based puzzle game such as T*tris, C*lumns, Kl*x, P*yo P*yo, L*mines, M*nesweeper, or B*jeweled, it's most efficient and most common to draw most of the game objects as tiles in a mode 0 background unless you have an oddball playfield size. In fact, the coin-op <span style="font-style: italic">Tetris</span> by Atari Games (now part of Midway) used a video chip that didn't support sprites at all.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And play Zooo, (the GBA version of DS Zoo Keeper) it's a pretty good commercial bejeweled clone. It uses sprites for the animals, as witnessed in the 'angry animals' moment when you run out of time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
