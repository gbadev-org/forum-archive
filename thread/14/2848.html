<br/>
i'm new to GBA programming so i read book on your site which can help me on this. i downloaded some zipe file as book suggested, such as agb-win-core-r5.zip etc, and unzipped all into the forlder like this:
<br/>
g:\myself\works\devkitadv\
<br/>
and the book said after unzipping i can check whether it work by running make.bat simply with command prompt, but when i run it the prompt display this line:
<br/>
make: ****no targets specified and no makefile found. stop.
<br/>
what's wrong here ??? 
<br/>
<br/>
btw, i'm with win2k pro

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's nothing wrong with that. If you run make without specifiying a makefile, or being in a directory with a default-named one, that's exactly the message you should get. Your install is probably correct.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
