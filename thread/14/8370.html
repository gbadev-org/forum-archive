    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi
<br/>
<br/>
I have been using HAM v2.80 for about six months and I lost my only copy of it. I get an error tiring to get it from gbadev and there website <a href="http://www.ngine.de/" target="_blank">http://www.ngine.de/</a>  is down. Is there any other place I can download it or could you please email it to me at.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll check when I get home from work and school, but I think I deleted the setup file that comes with ham(it did come with a setup file right?). Also, are you using ham because of a tutorial that uses it(that's why I'm using it)? Once I am done with the book I am going to use devkitPro because it makes fast and smaller programs. You may want think about this yourself as the HAM compiler hasn't been updated in years and wintermute keeps devkitPro updated.
<br/>
<br/>
But if you still want HAM and I have the file at home I will e-mail it to you, but that won't be until late. So research devkitPro in the mean time and let me know.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yep, but if you notice that topic was started by me(on Jan 08) and is mainly about using devKitPro with VisualHAM. I'm sure the reason he wants to stay wil HAM is because of visual Ham and it's ease to set up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
