    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, this is probably a simple question, but I haven't been able to confirm it.
<br/>
<br/>
I know that the rotation/scaling registers (BGxPA, etc.) are in a fixed point format (1 sign, 7 integer, 8 fractional), but I wasn't sure exactly what format it was. Playing around, it looks like it might be a 2s complement, but I wasn't sure and wanted to ask about it. Is it 2s complement, 1s complement, or just a sign bit?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The IO registers all use two's-complement, the same internal representation used by the C compiler and the ARM7. This means you can safely assign a negative number or signed variable directly to the register from within C.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks, reading my docs made it seem like there was a just a sign bit, and I was told that ARM uses 1s comp (which I'm not so sure about anymore), yet the little output I could check was 2s comp.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the BGxX_L, BGxX_H registers, is there any advice on managing these? I've just been doing arithmetic on 32bit signed data, then doing something like
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
BG2X_L = x0;
<br/>
BG2X_H = x0 &gt;&gt; 16;
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
which seems like it should be sensible, since 2s comp just repeats the leading bits when youre within some +/- range of zero.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just use the entire 32-bit register, BG2X. Don't treat the low and high half-words separately.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">int     x = 134 &lt;&lt; 8;     // Fixed point 24.8 format
<br/>
int     y = -47 &lt;&lt; 8;
<br/>
<br/>
BG2X = x;
<br/>
BG2Y = y;</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
