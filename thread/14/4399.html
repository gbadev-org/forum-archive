    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">out of curiosity, I was wondering what libraries or/and development tools do you guys use when developing you games. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have always like writting my own tools and lib. it usually takes too long and I end up not finishing the Lib or the Game idea :-( 
<br/>
<br/>
So please do share your development practices or tool :-)<br/>_________________<br/>Keep it real, keep it Free, Keep it GNU</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
MapEd is the mapeditor of my choice and as emulators I use mappyVm and VisualBoyAdvance (mainly for debugging and cause mappyvm has no sound).
<br/>
<br/>
I wrote the basic headers, wich includes all the registers and basic macros, myself. 
<br/>
<br/>
For my soundengineering I use Modplug Tracker.
<br/>
<br/>
If I want to test everything on hardware I use LittleWriter to flash my card.
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I only use some commandline tools to convert graphics and sounds into a compilable format.

I've just been looking at MapEd v0.98.5 off the main page, is that the same version you use? It looks amazing, though I was completely stumped by the lack of scrollbars when I first loaded up the sample map. And who on earth though the middle button was a good place to hide the scrolling ability? But the paralax and collison layers make it look fantastic, plus the GBA preview is nice too. I assume in the sample there's a custom collision data bitmap saved within the file as it isn't a bitmap and isn't quite the same as the default. Have to see what it's like getting the information into a program.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Surprisingly well. Mozilla can handle an HTML page with thousands of little tile images. IE can't.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a fair amount of javascript to handle swapping out the images as you use the editing tools. Changes that are on screen also get reflected in hidden variables that post back and get stored in the database. Then there's a PHP script that translates the raw map data and scripting data into a .c file.
<br/>
<br/>
It's not the fastest thing in the world, since the amount of data being sent when you load up a large map can be substantial. But since PHP/web scripting is a thing I'm familiar with, it made generating the tools relatively easy. Ultimately, I think I'll move over to some other approach due to these performance problems...
<br/>

If you're really interested, PM me and I can set you up a login.
