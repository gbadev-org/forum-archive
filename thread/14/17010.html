    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've having problems hooking my EZ Writer to my pc.  I'm not sure if I have the proper drivers/sofware installed. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have this model :EZ-Flash 2 PowerStar
<br/>
<br/>
It used to work without a problem a few years ago when I had XP, but now with VISTA is doesn't seem to work properly.  The link for the software and the driver on the manufactures site is broken, but I couldn't find that same software on gbadev.org.  I have downloaded almost all of then to try to figure it out..
<br/>
<br/>
EZFA cannot locate the cable, even though I think I have the drivers installed properly because now the LED on the EZ Writer base is green.  I don't think that's the proper software.
<br/>
<br/>
I have EZ-Flash2 Writer 1.02 downloaded, but I get an error every time I open it.  I've tried to set the compatibility for XP, but it still doesn't work.  I believe this is the software I need.  Has anyone got this to work with VISTA?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:  I just tried the EZ Writer software on an XP machine and had the same results: it errored when I tried to open the file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
