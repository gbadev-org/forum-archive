    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am trying to get gcc setup under linux to develop gba games and am having the overlap problem that is mentioned with the latest version of devkitadv for linux.  I know that he mentions replacing the lnkscript and crt0.o with the downloaded ones but I haven't been successful in getting anything to work.  I followed the instructions on linux.gbadev.org for setting all this up except I used the latest versions of all software available.  The exact errors I get when trying to compile are as follows:

there's a precompiled binary &amp; also a set of build scripts which work well.
<br/>
<br/>
once you have the toolchain, by whatever means then it's really just a matter of linking with arm-elf-gcc (or g++ as appropriate) and using -specs=gba.specs for a normal cart image or -specs=gba_mb.specs for a multiboot image.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

because ld doeesn't know where the libraries are, which libraries it should be linking or which order they're supposed to be linked in. The drivers (gcc &amp; g++) do and call ld with the proper parameters.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're not using standard libraries then in most cases you'll get away with ld but I really don't recommend it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
