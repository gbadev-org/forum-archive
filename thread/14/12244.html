    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I\'ll be blunt about this. I want to be able to access and controll/update the wiimote with the bluetooth device on my computer. 
<br/>
<br/>
I use VB.NET for all of my PC developing. I did some basic searches and I\'m not quite sure where to start. If I can get my program to send and recieve reports from the Wiimote, I can run from there. So here is what I need to know:
<br/>
<br/>
I can already pair with a bluetooth device, I have a program that does that for me. I need to know how (using VB.NET) to access the list of available bluetooth devices on the computer. I then need to know how to send and recieve packets to and from the device. Once I have it doing this (and have a nice event set up for handling recieved packets) I should be able to work out the logic of handling the remote relatively easily, thanks to the wealth of information on the subject.
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone help me out with this \"should-be-so-simple\" operation? Thanks!
