    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, I have compiled many programs in the past with devkitadv on windows 2000 without much in the way of problems. Recently I have decided to make the switch to linux, suse 9.1 to be exact, and I'm having some troubles. This is when I try to install devkitARM (not adv like on my 2000 system). I have followed the well written tutorial on setting it up at linux.gbadev.org but I run into troubles once I try to compile. Here is the error message I get.
<br/>
<br/>
arm-thumb-elf-gcc test.c -o test.elf -T lnkscript -DMULTIBOOT -Wall -marm -mapcs                  -32 -mcpu=arm7tdmi
<br/>
/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/arm-thumb-elf/3.0.4/../../../../arm-thumb-elf/bin/ld: can                  not open linker script file lnkscript: No such file or directory
<br/>
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
<br/>
make: *** [test.mb] Error 1
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I know those directories all exist, so I don't really understand where my problem is. If anyone could help me out with this that'd be great, because I really want to get writing programs again. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, sorry found my answer, I though lnkscript was supposed to be in one of the mentioned directories in the error message, not in the folder of where the makefile was. But yay, now I can program games on linux hehe ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">um, hate to burst your bubble but that's quite obviously not devkitARM.
<br/>
<br/>
there has never been a 3.0.4 build of devkitARM.
<br/>
<br/>
the binaries are not named arm-thumb-xxxx
<br/>
<br/>
the tutorial at linux.gbadev.org has no relation to devkitARM in any shape or form and is also missing a vital step in creating a gcc toolchain suitable for GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
devkitARM currently contains gcc 3.4.1, binutils 2.15 and newlib 1.12.0 as well as built in crt0 and linkscripts suitable for both gba &amp; gp32.
