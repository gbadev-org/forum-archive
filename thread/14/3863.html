    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No.
<br/>
<br/>
edit: Well, there are a number of open-sourced PC games, including older games from id Software.  From a code design perspective, the difference between the platforms is not that significant.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can use Visual Boy Advance's disassembler to view the raw assembly code instructions of a game.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are also tons of smaller homebrew games on the main gbadev site that include source code. For a beginner, deconstructing a nice, simple pong game is better, because you can focus on the code syntax and structure rather than a huge mess of complex game logic.

Trust me on this one. You want to start simple. :)
