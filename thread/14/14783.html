    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">C++ is a very good language to use and you can use it with or without classes so it can be VERY C like.  There are some minor differences with C++ without classes and C but in general C is a subset of C++.  
<br/>
<br/>
There are times when the object oriented support in C++ can be an overhead but that can be dependent on the runtime libraries.  For small memory machines a trim and minimal runtime library can be very helpful.  Of course this can also be the case with C.  Finding a good book to use can be helpful and understanding the under lying architecture can be very helpful for embedded machines (like the GBA/DS/GP2X ...).  
<br/>
<br/>
You can do OO in C but the compiler does not help you do it you have to do it yourself which can lead to lots of problems.  
<br/>
<br/>
The original C++ compilers generated C and then compiled it, but that is not the case now.  If you need lean and mean close to the hardware code then C is valid choice because it does not supply many extras.  
<br/>
<br/>
I think of C as portable assembly language (not a lean or fast as ASM) because there is very little extra there.  C++ on the other hand provides classes and other things (templates, operator overriding, encapsulation, etc..) that can make putting together the code faster and less prone to error.  You need to pick the correct tool for the problem you are trying to solve.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW:  I use C almost exclusively for the things that I code on embedded systems but for other platforms I use C and C++.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#148387 - StoneCypher - Sat Jan 05, 2008 5:11 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, there's a lot of bad information going around here.  Let me endeavor to clear some of it up.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1) There isn't really much of a reason to use C anymore; the standards committee has been debating whether or not to end the language for the last several years.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2) C++ includes quite literally all of C, and with three tiny details which most people won't understand, all C is legal C++.  
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3) Almost every overhead you hear about with C++ is fictional.  C++ actually optimizes significantly better than C, largely due to that the compiler has a whole lot more information in C++ code, so it can do things that wouldn't be safe in C, where certain things remained unknown (by example, the method of typecasting, or the static const volatile register problem.)  C++, just like C, was designed with zero-compromise efficiency in mind; it discards features instead of speed (which is why we have compile time templates, but no generics.)  When someone hand-waves about arbitrary overhead, it's a red flag that they probably don't know what they're talking about; if they did, they'd be citing specific examples.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4) The size difference between C and C++ isn't nearly as large as most people make it out to be.  The problem that most people see is that C++ includes more libraries by default than C does; all they really have to do is turn them off, turn TU paring on, shut off RTTI, shut off exceptions, strip symbols (because name mangled symbols are hueg lol) and quit being such a whiny bitch about it.  The C runtime is about 40k, and the CPP runtime is about 80k, in the case of GCC with pretty much everything turned off.  That was a modest difference in the GBA era; on the DS it basically doesn't matter, unless you're talking about a wifi binary, and since the homebrew community can't make those, that doesn't count.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5) C++ is <span style="font-weight: bold">SIGNIFICANTLY EASIER FOR NOVICES</span> than C is.  Yes, it's a larger language, but not by much; there's only about 15 new keywords, and about two dozen new operators.  Classes are just structs with methods and publicity.  Inheritance isn't hard if it's explained well.  Yes, the libraries are enormous, but novices don't need to learn them.  Yes, writing your own templates is hugely difficult.  Other than that?  You get all the benefits of type safety, polymorphism, and a much more complete set of fundamental libraries.  There's really no question about this when you talk to anyone who knows both languages well, and it's worth noting that Kernighan and Ritchie - the two guys who invented C - both say that a new programmer should learn C++ first.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
6) None of you (nor I) are writing code at the level that you can compete with the C++ compiler or the GCC STL, so don't even pretend it's about efficiency.  Nobody's fooled.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
7) That jagoff who says classes invoke a bunch of overhead doesn't know what he's talking about.  Unless you're dealing with RTTI, which is off in devkitpro by default, it's quite literally zero extra overhead unless it's a polymorphic call, and you can't actually implement as fast a polymorphic dispatch system in C as fast as the compiler in C++ unless you're willing to compile code on the fly.  Since C doesn't do polymorphism, it's pretty clear that Kyofu hasn't the faintest goddamned idea how compilers actually work.  Static calls are simple jumps; they're resolved at compile time.  Static calls into classes aren't different.  They're still static calls.  All the class does is provide you a mechanism for organization.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
8) There's really no reason you'd need to "back-port" from C++ to C, unless you're trying to target a device so small that it would seem absurd by today's standards (64k is about the danger line for C++, 20 for C.)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
9) That's not what a dynamic language is, Will.  Stow it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
10) Lick is otherwise generally correct.  Clinging to C is generally appropriate for the GBA era if you're making a game at the very edge of the system's capabilities.  That said, you can generally get more just by implementing algorithms with an eye for space, and the space saved in C++ by removing unnecessary jumps through better inlining is generally larger than the space consumed by the C++ RTL once you're over a few hundred K.  Incidentally, if you actually do care about space, go download one of the free ARM compilers; the ARM C++ runtime is smaller than the GCC C runtime.  But you're not going to do that, are you?  Because it isn't really about space.  You're not strapped for 40 k.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
11) MikeD: because C++ is a better C compiler.  C++ is a much stricter language than C is.  GCC catches way more of your bugs for you in C++ mode than C mode.  And frankly, you don't have to use all of the features; just one feature is enough to <span style="font-style: italic">set a single command line flag and move on with life</span>.  If you can't think of even one good reason to set that flag, then you don't know C++ well enough to comment.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
12) Sajimori: you raise a good point, and I'm going to rephrase it, because some of the people here won't realize how important what you said actually is.  The design of the C++ language allows you to turn off quite literally everything with overhead.  If you're not using it, shut it off, and it costs you nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
13) Kyoufu, the reason the Nintendo SDK - which you shouldn't have, creep - is in C is so that it can be used by both C and C++ programmers.  Most APIs are still C apis, because they want to support legacy dinosaur people.  Essentially all internal Nintendo code is C++.  This is API design 101.  Please stop feigning understanding what's going on, or familiarity with Nintendo code other than the stuff you managed to steal on usenet.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
14) GMiller knows his shit and speaks clearly.  Keldon too.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
15) zxcvbnm: "<span style="font-style: italic">So c++ is for making high end games that push the limits of the system while c is for games that are less cpu intensive?</span>"  No, they're both machine-near languages, appropriate for high performance applications.  C++ evolved from C; it's C with a whole bunch of new tools.  That doesn't mean it's any less appropriate for simple stuff, though.  The reason you should prefer C++ is that it gives you more options, and allows you to express yourself more precisely in less code.  It's just fine for small things.  For large things, it provides tools that you really need.  Can you build big stuff in C?  Sure: linux is C.  But, that's because Linux is older than C++.  Modern unix kernels are almost exclusively C++, with the notable exception of embedded kernels for ridiculously limited machines.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
16) <span style="font-style: italic">A lot of professional games, even today, are still made in C. I have proof where Pok?mon is concerned ;)</span>  The current pokemon codebase is older than C++; its being C is a reflection of the tools that were available at the time it was written.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Brag about software theft again and you'll be removed from gbadev.org .  Several of the people at this board are the people you're stealing from.  <span style="font-style: italic">Shame on you, Kyoufu</span>.</span><br/>_________________<br/>Quidquid Latine dictum sit, altum Sonatur

The other two are the change in sizeof(char) and the extensions to TU named linking under generic probe which were necessary to make export work.

I'm really not sure where you get these figures from - the size of the binary you end up with depends largely on what language features and/or standard functions you use from the runtime libraries. I fail to see how you can assign an abitrary size like this.
<br/>
<br/>
As an example, with devkitARM a simple test which mallocs a buffer comes in at ~6k but the same code using new weighs in at ~42k. Not such a big deal on the arm9 using the 4meg RAM but possibly a disaster for the arm7 core where we only have 96k.
<br/>
<br/>
If you start using iostreams with gcc you'll find that you're losing around 300k - Probably not something to be overly concerned about while your application still fits in available RAM but could become quite significant later.

This all really depends what it is you're actually debating. Using standard libraries is more efficient use of the programmer's time and makes for more portable code. In the microcontroller world where storage is at a premium C is an incredibly useful tool for preventing the programmer making use of memory hungry features and assembly is often used to gain absolute control over what gets used where.

Ultimately for me, there isn't really a question about whether a novice should learn C or C++. The latter implements a superset of the latter so by learning C++ you're also learning C with the handy side effect of improving your employment prospects. Ideally you should really be familiar with as many languages as possible if you want to pursue a career in programming.
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html" target="_blank">How to become a hacker</a> suggests you learn Python, C/C++, Java, Perl, and LISP. Personally I prefer PHP to perl and I've been known to write bash shell scripts for small tasks.
<br/>
<br/>
My personal opinion is that one of the singularly worst things you can do as a programmer is become a language evangelist. The best language to program in is the one which makes you most productive and that will depend a lot on the project you're part of. There's no point spending your time arguing about how C++ would be better for the task if significant work has already been done in C or even vice versa - you'll be a more productive team member if you just dig in and work within the framework that's already there.
<br/>
<br/>
libnds and libgba are written in C not for performance reasons or because of resource usage but because users should have the choice and it avoids the issue of having to recompile everything when the gcc version in devkitARM is updated. Similar reasoning probably applies to the nitroSDK.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

I thought it was added in C99, but I seem to be wrong. Thanks for the corrections, and for the overview of the dissimilarities. I've got one more though, size of character literals; sizeof('a') is equal to sizeof(char) in C++, but sizeof(int) in C.

While your solution might do the trick for some projects, it wouldn't work for us. The problem is, our customers are actually changing our code for their implementations, and they get multiple deliveries. Generated code is not something that is easy to work with. Sorry, your point is still invalid IMO. There are still reasons to use plain C, and in "my world" they are not uncommon. That doesn't mean that someone should choose C over C++ "just in case" though. C++ is a far more productive programming language than C, and I'm using it for most of my spare-time projects myself.

Yeah, but whether or not old projects need to be maintained, the original question was about what language a new project should be in.  That the language may end is of great importance to the original poster's understanding of the situation: C as a language has been eclipsed.  It's going to fill a legacy role for a long time, but then, we wouldn't tell him to use COBOL (which is entirely possible) just because it's legacy, and there's a whole lot more legacy COBOL out there than C.
<br/>
<br/>
He's asking what language to start in, and if C's been eclipsed, he should know that, and why, so that he can make appropriate choices, in my opinion.  That's why I raised the issue.

Ok, so you're actually seeing a 36k difference, as compared to my 42k.

Anyway, I bet there's also a bunch of measurement differences - for example, once I had a binary, I put a header on it and so forth, made a legal-except-thumbprint binary.

And hey, maybe you just did *way* better than me.  I'd like to know how you got C++ down to 42k, if indeed you generated a legal-except-thumbprint binary.  Have you considered documenting the state of your making-it-omg-tiny work?

Incidentally, if you actually do care about space, go download one of the free ARM compilers; the ARM C++ runtime is smaller than the GCC C runtime.  But you're not going to do that, are you?  Because it isn't really about space.  You're not strapped for 40 k.

On the GBA, code is guaranteed to be in ROM only for the first player. Players 2 through 4 run code from EWRAM (256 KiB) if they don't have a copy of the game; in fact, this is the origin of the name "multiboot".

I know you like to work with absolute definitions of everything, but at some point you have to accept that the human mind doesn't work that way -- not even yours.  And it's a good thing, too!  Intuitive definitions greatly optimize communication.  It's like JPEG compression: lossy, but much more compact.

Actually, Linus Torvalds <span style="font-style: italic">really really</span> hates C++, and there's no doubt he'd still write the Linux kernel in C if he had to start over from scratch. He has the sort of venom for C++ that is usually reserved for languages like COBOL. His issue isn't so much with the language itself -- he, like everyone else, knows you can basically use C++ as a "better C" -- but with the way other people use it. <a class="postlink" href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/57643/focus=57918" target="_blank">Here's one of his rants on it.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I think if C++ were really so bad as he makes it out to be, nobody would be using it. Still, I can't help but side with him just a little: there really are ways in which C++ is a hideous monster. I can't remember what made me buy the book Exceptional C++, but when I bought it, my eyes were forced wiiiiiiiide open. (Even more so for me than most people, since I was used to pre-standard C++ with &lt;iostream.h&gt; and all that.)
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, at least for the DS, you're advocate compiling with exceptions off, which does eliminate problems with exception safety -- at the expense of missing out on the benefits of exceptions, of course. (But then, you could always try something like leaving exceptions on only in debug builds, if you're careful to never need them in a release build.) A lot depends on the project and who's working on it, too.
<br/>
<br/>
I do think that, realistically, C++ is the way to go for a homebrew DS project. If you (switching to the generic "you" here, not StoneCypher) have particular reasons for preferring C, there's nothing wrong with that, though you may end up making more work for yourself as a result. If you don't know either language yet and you're trying to decide which to use, I really can't answer that -- except I'd advise you to start with the PC and gradually work your way towards the DS rather than just diving in with it. It's a more sane environment to work with.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, are RTTI and exceptions really that bad on the DS? I imagine you might want them off for a high-performance game, but it shouldn't hurt so much for a Tetris clone or something, should it?

I'm an advocate of the "Don't start with C [or C++]" approach. My language of choice -- i.e., the one I use whenever possible -- is Python. It's useful for learning programming, for writing quick scripts, for game development (not on the DS, obviously), and all kinds of stuff. For me, Python is the language that keeps on giving. I'm sure the same can be said for some other languages, like Ruby. (Perl, not so much. Perl's definitely a language for people who already know how to program...)

I haven't read that one, but I have read parts of <span style="font-style: italic">Effective C++</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">More Effective C++</span> by Scott Meyers. In the first book, he encourages the use of &lt;iostream&gt; over &lt;cstdio&gt; because &lt;iostream&gt; is easier to extend in a standard way (E2). But in <span style="font-style: italic">More</span>, he devotes an item to admitting that no library is perfect (M23). Some are comparatively bloated, such as GNU libstdc++. Sometimes your platform's &lt;cstdio&gt; is the right library for the job, especially on resource-constrained platforms like handhelds:

In fact, &lt;iostream&gt; of GNU libstdc++ calls the underlying platform's &lt;cstdio&gt; to do its work, guaranteeing that it is bigger and slower than &lt;cstdio&gt; alone.

Based on my conversations with StoneCypher here, on IRC, and even on Slashdot, he wants you to think about 1. the difference between the overhead of the language and the overhead of a library, and 2. the difference between the overhead of a spec and the overhead of a particular implementation. This adds up to four things to juggle: the overhead of each C++ feature, the overhead of g++'s implementations of those features, the overhead of the C++ standard library, and the overhead of GNU libstdc++.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think we got a little confused on the iostream thing. I was referring to the use of "#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;" as opposed to "#include &lt;iostream&gt;". When I first learned C++, the standard was still fairly new. The closest thing to a standard before that was the ARM (Annotated Reference Manual; nothing to do with the ARM CPU of course). So the book I learned C++ from used ARM. The next few books I used either used C or happened to use a subset of C++ that worked both with ARM C++ and ISO C++, so I still had no exposure to standard C++. That didn't come up until I picked up Exceptional C++. (By the way, Exceptional C++ is much more focused on gotchas than Effective C++ is. I don't have More Effective C++, so I can't really comment on it.)
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, in case anyone's wondering, the difference between &lt;iostream.h&gt; and &lt;iostream&gt; is basically the same as between, say, &lt;stdio.h&gt; and &lt;cstdio&gt;. That is, no 'std' namespace. I think in some cases &lt;iostream.h&gt; might actually behave differently from &lt;iostream&gt; in other ways, though. I don't really know because I didn't learn terribly much about iostream.h anyways.

For very simple type distinctions, I've sometimes used virtuals that return an enumerated type value as an optimization.  I'm leaning away from this strategy in newer projects because it's a waste of programmer time.  If RTTI is too slow for a particular use case, simulating it is probably not the best solution either.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, Linus Torvalds <span style="font-style: italic">really really</span> hates C++, and there's no doubt he'd still write the Linux kernel in C if he had to start over from scratch. He has the sort of venom for C++ that is usually reserved for languages like COBOL.

Yep.  I think the C++ language itself is just fine.  But the abuses I've seen...  *shudder*

<br/>
I had to lead a programming team in managing about a million lines of C++ code, taken over from an external developer when they couldn't deliver their milestones.
<br/>
<br/>
THAT was the project that taught me a healthy respect for the loaded gun that is C++.  Until that project, I had made the mistaken assumption that programming a million lines of (sort of) working C++ code meant that you probably weren't a group of retarded monkeys on crack.   My mistake.  :(
<br/>
<br/>
On a philosophical note, I think that learning how to write C code using an OOP approach can be helpful as one learns C++, because (IMHO) the programmer may be less prone to abusing the language if he or she has a deeper understanding of WHY C++ language features are there in the first place.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It was definitely a business decision.  We had a $10M product to ship, and the external group just wasn't cutting it.  Of course, during my evaluation of that group a year earlier, I had predicted (in writing) that they wouldn't make their milestones, and had recommended at the time that we either pull the plug on the project or bring it in-house.
<br/>
<br/>
After taking over the code, I really hated being right on that one.  LOL

Sure.  Business decisions always trump technical decisions.
<br/>
<br/>
Back on topic.  You can shoot yourself in the foot with both C and C++.  Don't do that.  Evidently you can also shoot someone else or your company in the foot with either language as well.  Don't do that either.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Socially, one of the biggest problems I've seen with the way people use C++ is that they try to follow an "ideology" and apply "principles".  The result is usually code that's twice as long as it needs to be, filled with boilerplate and structural nonsense to wade through.
<br/>
<br/>
It's easy to see why this happens.  C++ adds features that greatly expand the design space for any given problem.  If a coder wants to find the "best" design, they have to sift through a vast sea of options, many of which they wouldn't have considered if they were writing in C.
<br/>
<br/>
Faced with this task, many coders look for quick "once-and-for-all" answers:  Usually some flavor of OOP, mixed with "best practices" from a book of 101 C++ tips.  This narrows the design space to a level they're more comfortable with.
<br/>
<br/>
But it's possible to get past the "sea of options" problem, and the paralysis it causes.  If you invest a lot of time on fully exploring a few problems early on, it gets much easier to quickly find near-optimal solutions for future problems.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree with sajiimori ... I have seen crap code written in many languages and there are many ways to do that.  Writing good code in any language requires more than surface understanding.  Any time you write a piece of code there are potential trade-offs between the "religion" of your design approach and the practicality of the language you are using.  Begin able to make decisions in this space is difficult and easy to take the wrong path but some experience in doing so can help you avoid the obvious wrong paths.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The problem is that they are all problem specific.  If you need a system that can do A, B and C, then build a system that can do those things.  If your system will only ever need to do A, and you spend a bunch of time making a system that can also support B and C because it is a "better architecture", that is time wasted.
<br/>
<br/>
Rules of thumb are just that- they apply <span style="font-weight: bold">most</span> of the time.  If you insist on following them all the time, you are doing something wrong.  Of course, you have to know what you are doing and why the rules of thumb were stated in the first place before you can "break" them appropriately.
<br/>
<br/>
I once heard someone criticize Python because it forces indentation on the programmer.  His criticism was that, most of the time that is OK because you want properly indented code, but it does not give you the flexibility to indent differently when it is important to do.  In effect, it doesn't matter for routine code, but this damages the readability of important chunks of code, precisely where readability is most important, because indentation can not be negotiated in the Python universe.
<br/>
<br/>
If your language lets you use dynamite, that is fantastic.  Sometimes you need it, but this will be rare.  Knowing when not to break out the dynamite is part of your job.  The few who will legitimately need to use it everyday will know who they are.  (They will also know how to properly deploy the dynamite and clean up the mess when they are done.)
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully someone else has a simple, practical, concrete example.
