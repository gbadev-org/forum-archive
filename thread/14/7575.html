    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a slight problem: I am making a Windows shell and I need to create a 'click' routine.  I think that making 'buttons' and checking if they are clicked.  The problem is that I need to make an array for the buttons and their coordinates and size.  I suppose that I should use a 2D array.  I just don't know how to make an array.  It is EXTREMELY different from a minor programming language called RPGCode.  
<br/>
<br/>
So my question is how would you create an array, and how would you create a 2D array?
<br/>
Is it possible change the size of an array without changing the contents?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this is a simple problem, but I literally just switched to GBA programming not even a whole week ago.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Look up structs in your C tutorial.
<br/>
<br/>
And if you aren't comfortable on the GBA, then perhaps you should work through a C tutorial entirely on the PC first.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can pretty easily understand C, its not too different from RPGCode.  I have two books on C++ programming as well.
<br/>
Your idea makes sense, I guess I could use structs, but I would rather stick to something that I know more about to first.  I am still taking structs into thought, though.
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of something like this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">for(loop = 0; loop &lt; noofbuttons; loop++) {
<br/>
      if(cursorx &gt; xbutton[loop] &amp;&amp; cursorx &lt; xbutton[loop] + xSbutton[loop]  &amp;&amp; cursory &gt; ybutton[loop] &amp;&amp; cursory &lt; ybutton[loop] + ySbutton[loop]) {
<br/>
            //All of the things it would do if I clicked the button
<br/>
      }
<br/>
}</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
To do this, all I need to know how to do is make an array, and how to modify its size, if possible, to accomodate all of the buttons.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello Friend. To make two dimentional arrays in C++, simply declare them with two dimentions rather than one. Like this:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">u16 myarray[5][10];</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
would create an array with 5 elements by 10 elements for a total of 50 elements. You access them the same way.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
u16 i = 3;
<br/>
u16 j = 7;
<br/>
u16 click = myarray[i][j];</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Should be simple enough.
<br/>
<br/>
I assume you want to use the first element for x, the second for y, and the third on for actions and such?
<br/>
<br/>
The thing that makes C++ so different from RPG code is the fact that you have to be comfortable with types and type declarations. RPGCode, I believe, doesn't have you worry about that at all. It's even more important for GBA programming, as most hardware registers require you to store a specific size to them.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
