    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">is it really nessesary to send 2 bytes at a time?
<br/>
<br/>
I only ask because I havent got a cart yet (next week) so I am playing around with emulating it, I'm guessing the visual boy advance is just more tolerant right?
<br/>
<br/>
if I write 1 byte at a time to video memory on actual hardware will it do the thing ppl have mentioned (upper and lower byte same). as I have a small problem with writting 2 bytes....
<br/>
<br/>
I'm making an dynamic loading tile game, and I need it to load 1 row of tiles down the left and right edges of the screen (of screen)
<br/>
<br/>
as the screen is 30 tiles wide, and I have set buffer to 32x32 tiles, what should I do? (if I need to do anything about it)
<br/>
<br/>
hopefully I dont need to make a change, as it works perfectly on visual boy advance, but I suspect that is just VBA not being true to the hardware?<br/>_________________<br/>-Rory

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">visualboy advance emulates the problem correctly. both bytes are set to the same value. sure you aren't just not noticing that the x-resolution is divided by two? remember, you're only getting every second pixel drawn twice. kinda like a shitty mosaic-effect.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

so no, I'm not getting 2 pixels at a time the same.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm sure that if this looks right on VBA, it will on hardware too. VBA is generally weaker with things like sprite and window clipping and has minor timer issues, but this kind of thing is true I believe.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

Unless they've fixed it in more recent versions, in my experience it did not correctly emulate the waitstates for the different areas of memory.
<br/>
<br/>
As a result, my initial Mode 7 engine looked fine in VBA but would overrun HBlank on hardware.

On those versions, just about any code ran faster on VBA than on hardware, but DMA copies took about the right amount of time.

Recent versions of VBA have flip-flopped entirely on this issue. Now the Toast GSM decoder runs <span style="font-style: italic">slower</span> on recent VBA than on hardware, causing the <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/halo2/" target="_blank">Halo 2 demo</a> to glitch whenever the player isn't looking straight up.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
