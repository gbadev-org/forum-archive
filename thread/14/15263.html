    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Gang,
<br/>
<br/>
I have a few questions geared toward transitioning from Homebrew to Nintendo's SDK and was wondering if anyone knows enough about Nintendo's SDK to answer these questions. I wasn't able to readily find answers to these in the newbie forum so please humor me:
<br/>
<br/>
1) I understand that main memory is 4mb. Can I use an arbitrary portion of that memory for executable code? If I'm limited to a certain size, can I swap in code at runtime?
<br/>
2) What's the maximum amount of memory I can use and safely assume would fit on a shipping DS cartridge?
<br/>
3) About the homebrew APIs themselves: how closely do the match Nintendo's APIs? Could I just take my homebrew code and drop it over Nintendo's SDK and expect to recompile with no problems, or are the APIs totally different?
<br/>
4) Does the compiler in DevKitARM come anywhere close to Nintendo's compiler in terms of optimization capabilities?
<br/>
<br/>
That's about it, thanks for reading. I've download DevKitARM and played around with the examples. Everything looks straightforward so far and I'm looking forward to doing some real coding.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
hint: people who (*legally*) got in touch with the official nds sdk had to sign a NDA prior to that. don't expect anyone to answer your questions. at least not in great detail.
<br/>
<br/>
if you start working with the sdk, you'll have a lot of docs and demos to start with. so, come on, what do you need that info for? it's not all *that* related to the nitro sdk and also applies to libnds, because it's really about the hw.
<br/>
<br/>
most likely nitro sdk and libnds are totally incompatible.
<br/>
hot swappable code can be done (ds organize and others support .dll-style plugins) with some effort on your side.
<br/>
4mb are 4mb are 4mb are... ;^p desing your code to fit data in 2mb as needed and you'll have enough memory for the code and memory buffers etc.
<br/>
devkitarm is cool! especially for a free product! :^) i don't know if it's better than nintendo's though.
<br/>
about official cartridge sizes: they are floating somewhere on the net. i remember sizes of 1024 megaBIT (= 128 megabyte) and up.
<br/>
<br/>
last but not least: WELCOME TO THE SCENE! :?D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. I've not had an issue with the memory footprint of the SDK.  You link what you use.  Yes, you can page code in at run-time via overlays or whatever, but it's a bit of a pain to debug.  I doubt you will have need to do this.
<br/>
2. Nintendo carts go from 32MBytes to 128MBytes right now with various save game sizes and options, but that's subject to change at any time.
<br/>
3. I haven't done homebrew, so I can't comment on difficulties.  That said, most of your code should be machine independent which makes porting a bit easier.  Personally, I don't think it would be too hard to part across.  Just getting the initial hardware layer in place will take a bit of time.
<br/>
4. Lol.  The homebrew compiler is far superior believe it or not.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure I've violated no NDAs with the above info.  That said, I am treading somewhat carefully here so don't expect too much more in depth info that the above.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DevkitARM uses GCC as its compiler. GCC is a very old compiler... now, "old" often means "bad", but that's definitely not the case here. Since GCC is still very much used and maintained -- in fact, it's probably the most popular compiler in the world next to Visual C++ -- that just means it's really stable and really good at what it does.
<br/>
<br/>
I recall hearing a couple of years ago that some official developers also use GCC as their Nintendo DS compiler. I'm sure they don't use libnds, though.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1) Read the homebrew docs.  Everything you need to know ought to be in there.
<br/>
2) Read the homebrew docs or find game specs or worry about this when it becomes a problem.
<br/>
3) Abstract your code.  If you build on top of whatever API your are using you should be able minimize the code rewriting.
<br/>
4) Miked0801 knows what he is talking about.
<br/>
<br/>
Just make a game.  I guess my advice is:
<br/>
A) Use tools and flexible PC files that can easily be converted into some platform specific format.
<br/>
   CSV and TXT are good places to start if you need something simple and standard.
<br/>
B) Work from a spec.  If you have clearly defined what you are doing, even 100% module rewrites should not be a huge deal.
