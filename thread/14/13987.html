I found HAM, then Visual HAM, which I got running. The Visual HAM people dropped their support and suggested using the free download MS C++ Express Edition 2005, which I've installed.
<br/>
<br/>
The instructions I used are here, which I followed. I think they missed something. <a href="http://www.pixelproc.net/vs2005.html" target="_blank">http://www.pixelproc.net/vs2005.html</a>

<br/>
Any ideas ?

I've read through some more posts and it seems I must uncheck the box that says "create directory for solution" which I've now done - and the app seems nearer to building. This time the error is:
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

I also noticed I had to go into the makefile and change some of the paths from forward slashes to backslashes eg. 
<br/>
<br/>
include $(HAMDIR)/system/standard-targets.mak
<br/>
<br/>
changed to
<br/>
<br/>
include $(HAMDIR)\system\standard-targets.mak</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
