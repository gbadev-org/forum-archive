    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a question about the various registers used when programming for the GBA.  How are the registers initialized, or are they even initialized at all?  In other words, before I even start modifying the bits to REG_DISPSTAT are all of the bits initialized to 0?

Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The registers are initialized by RegisterRamReset() in BIOS, but not all of them are initialized to 0.  And for most registers, you don't even need to read-modify-write; you can just write a new, fully composed value.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
