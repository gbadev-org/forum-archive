    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What debugging methods are commonly used in gba development? Obviously cout is out of the question and when I tried to write out to a file, my program wouldnt' compile. The command prompt just filled with garbage. Mappy VM doesn't seem to have anything I can really read as far as debugging goes... So what methods are there to debug a working program?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

if you go to the faq section on visualboy advance, you should find a lot of the material there as well as the neccessary files.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are several ways to debug. The most emus have internal debuggers, like the MappyVM, but the most of them have major bugs ( i never pulled it of to debug in mappy). But the best opportunity at the moment is using gdb like yauster said. It works pretty fine and you can use a bunch of UI's like Insight GDB or Eclipse (my favorite :-]).
