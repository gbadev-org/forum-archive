    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm just getting into this and I'm having trouble finding a set of tools that work together that I can use.  I want to stick with C files (no pal, raw, or asm files).  I'm looking for a tool that will convert a bitmap into tile and palette data that can handle 16-bit color.  And it would be nice if it would convert it in a way so that it's compatible with the C files that come out of Mapedit, but Mapedit assumes you use Stripestripper then Hackit, which doesn't suit my needs.
<br/>
<br/>
So basically, I want 16-bit color (256 color just ain't cutting it) and I want C files instead of raw and pal files, but after trying out countless tools, I can't seem to find what I'm looking for.
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?  I would greatly appreciate it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

One question, is it possible to have 16 bit colour backgrounds? I thought the max was 256.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The way I understand it, the background palette can have up to 256 colors, but those 256 colors can come from any valid 16-bit color, which there are some 32,000 colors to choose from, I think. (That's why it takes 16 bits to specify a color in the palette.)  If all the graphics were restricted to the 256-color scheme (instead of 16-bit), then there would be no need to create palettes at all, since it would always consist of the same 256 colors.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's possible to have a mode 0 or mode 2 background in glorious 14-bit color by blending two 128-color backgrounds. Unlike mode 3, this allows for smooth scrolling on large maps, but you'll probably only be able to use one such layer pair because of VRAM issues.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
