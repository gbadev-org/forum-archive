    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The topic pretty much says it all.  It looks like the template makefile included with devkitpro is putting my .data and .bss sections in iwram by default.  I want them in ewram by default (and possibly in iwram with the IWRAM_DATA macro).

<br/>
How can I do this?  Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you sure it puts the data and bss there?  Mine defaults to code in ROM, data in EWRAM, stack and heap in EWRAM and nothing by default in IWRAM.  Of course this is for GBA development.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

However, use of .sbss in a multiboot will interfere with use of appended data files.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

This is what I've started doing, and it works fine.  It would be nice if there was an easy way to make everything default to iwram rather than ewram though.

Multiboot isn't a concern for me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
