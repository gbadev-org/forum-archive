<br/>
<br/>
Bought one from Lik-Sang the other day as I thought it would be cool to have some code load up and run on my GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
HARDWARE INSTALLATION
<br/>
I've plugged the device into my printer port and the other end into the GBA using the cable provided.
<br/>
<br/>
CONFIGURE THE PARALLEL PORT
<br/>
1. Went into the BIOS and changed the parallel port to "SPP" in accordance with the FAQ.
<br/>
<br/>
2. I'm running WinXP SP2, so again, in accordance with the faq, I've installed an app that will allow direct communication with my PC's LPT1. In this case I'm using Direct IO trial edition.
<br/>
<br/>
ERROR - NO HARDWARE FOUND!
<br/>
When I used the supplied application, MB.EXE, to transfer a program from the PC to the GBA I got this error. So I tried to transfer a tga image and got the same error.
<br/>
<br/>
Thought I'd try and enable IRQ 7 for the parallel port, so went into device manager and did it. This got rid of the "NO HARDWARE FOUND" error.
<br/>
<br/>
CURRENT SITUATION
<br/>
I can only get as far telling MB.EXE to transfer something to the GBA. MB.EXE seems to think its done its job and returns me to the next DOS prompt. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Gameboy does nothing but display the usual GAMEBOY text on the white background.
<br/>
<br/>
The image I'm trying to transfer is only 76KB and the program I'm trying to run is only 67KB
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone advise me of what to try next ? Any help would be appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Are you using a Multiboot program?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
