    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I'm new about programing and I have a problem. I want to edit my favourite game, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Red Rescue Team, by adding many things in it for example: Pokemons, Dungeos, Items, Mechanics, Soundtracks, Attacks and Stories. I'm playing emulation on my PSP console and I can't use in-game save file. This makes, that I can't check my game progress so I want to change that too. My question is what programs i need for that, and what I should to do. I hope for you answers and I'll be glad if you help me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Wonksi. What you are talking about is Rom Hacking, which is a bit offtopic for this forum. It's a large and fairly complicated subject, harder than simple programming -- I suggest you do some googling for "Rom Hacking" and read through whatever turns up, as you likely won't get much help here.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
