    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">can devkitadv compile c++ code as well as c code?  object oriented programming would make things much easier...  actually, more of the question i'm looking for is:
<br/>
<br/>
are there any limitations to the c++ capabilities?   is the devkitadv an ANSI compliant compiler?  does it meet all of the standards?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DevKit Advance is a build of GCC, so yes, it supports C++.
<br/>
<br/>
It also has all of GCC's non-ISO-compliant qualities, but there really aren't many of those anymore.  You're only likely to encounter them if you're doing weird template voodoo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
