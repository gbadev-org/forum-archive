<br/>
<br/>
I have a few questions regarding different topics:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Is there a way to stop playing sound which was initialized and played with 'playsound()' (i.e. writing a ceratin value to a certain sound register)?
<br/>
<br/>
2. Is there a known way (maybe a example with source) to play a movie sequence? Something in the quality and kind of animated GIFs?
<br/>
<br/>
3. In which format should the icon file (the icon.bin) be, if I want to link it to the nds file with DarkFaders ndstools?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks...
