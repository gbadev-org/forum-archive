    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was really excited about seeing this game for GBA, as I was a huge fan way back when. I was super pissed to find all the music missing for no good reason. Is there any way to extract the old midis (most likely already done somewhere) and recompile them back into the game? If anyone would like a stab I'd be happy to provide a rom and even search out the music.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Good reason: lack of CPU time, given that it's a 3D engine. Even Doom uses the GBC tone generators for music to save CPU time. Difference is that with the instruments used in Wolf3d (I've only played the Jaguar version), it would be more obvious that the music is being played through something about as capable as a 1985 NES.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It was also done by crummy programmers. :P  For Doom to run at a higher framerate <span style="font-style: italic">with</span> music is just ridiculous.  16MHz should be plenty to run Wolf3D with everything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
