    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I recently changed my 256 colour sprites to 16 colour sprites so I could fit more on the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I used another tool to convert the gif (gif2sprites as was suggested), and everything went fine, apart from black is no longer transparent.
<br/>
<br/>
How do I set black to be transparent?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>_________________<br/>---

<br/>
Sorry to sound a bit slow on this, but I dont quite follow. (complete beginner)
<br/>
<br/>
My sprite was originally made in MSPaint, and saved as 256 colour bmp. Transparency was fine, but didnt allow me enough sprites. All I did then was save it as a 16 colour bitmap, then re saved that as a gif, and put it through gifs2sprite.exe.
<br/>
<br/>
Where and what do I set 0? Is it in the code, MSPaint, or elsewhere?<br/>_________________<br/>---

My black values were 0x1111 and they should have been 0x0000. You made perfect sense the first time.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, i'm a beginner myself, and though I already knew that the first color in the palette is the transparency color, I'd like to know how you people usually set this.
<br/>
Changing palette and sprite values on C or ASM code is easy but seems to take a lot of doing just to set a transparency value.
<br/>
Is there a simpler way to do this, in MSPaint for example? (or do you need a more sophisticated graphics program, like PSP?)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think some picture converter allow you to pick which color in the palette will be transparent, and when you convert it, it move it to palette entry 0.
<br/>
<br/>
The other way is to modify our palette in a picture program. Making sure that your background color is indeed the color 0 of your palette.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
