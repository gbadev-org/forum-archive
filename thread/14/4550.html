    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dumb question, yet the answer is just so I know, as I am a C programmer anyways, but would anyone be able to tell me if I should aim to program my AGB games in C, or instead use say Java or Perl??

I don't want to use a WYSIWYG system, as that's cheating, so come on anyone know what's better to use?<br/>_________________<br/>Do you want me to cook that or not?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think you'll find a java or perl gba compiler.
<br/>
I guess there may be a java2arm compiler somewhere, but it's hardly a practical solution.
<br/>
<br/>
You could also use Dragon Basic, or straight Arm Assembler.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's nothing inherently impractical about Java on GBA, but you'll need library support for operations that require direct hardware access.  Didn't somebody get it working already?
<br/>
<br/>
Perl is a monster... I don't know why anybody would want to program games in it.  But feel free to try it out.  Not sure how portable the implementation is.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd suggest looking into Lua for a higher level supplement to C.  It's light, it's very easy to tie into a C engine, and its coroutines really bring game development to a new level.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">LOL, agree with the Perl, shock here- I tried that before I went to C, glad I did move to C in the end. Perl's a bugger to learn!

I guess I'll leave Java for now.<br/>_________________<br/>Do you want me to cook that or not?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm a big fan of using the usual C/C++/Asm mix on the GBA, but I tend to write a lot of code to pre-process assets before putting them on the GBA.  I used to write that code in C, but now I'm switching over to Python for that kind of code instead.  Very flexible, cross-platform, and fun to code in as well.  I highly recommend it.
<br/>
<br/>
As for using it on the GBA, I've never actually tried.  But, due to the limited memory of the GBA, I would probably avoid languages that use garbage collection.  But, that's just me ;)<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are some major problems with using Python on GBA, but garbage collection is not one of them.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a big language.
<br/>
<br/>
It emphasizes extension rather than embedding.  That is, Python wants to be "in charge" rather than a subordinate to a lower-level engine.
<br/>
<br/>
It's extremely dynamic.  Compilation basically amounts to pre-parsing.  Try using a debugger to trace an addition sometime.
<br/>
<br/>
It allocates lots of things on the heap, e.g. the results of additions.  (Does it use fixnums under a certain range?  I seem to remember some very small number that it can hold as an immediate.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You would think the guys making the AGB WinOS would make a IE, or well Firefox for it. Mod a linkup cable with a USB to network via your PC and there you are online with your AGB! Hmmm, saying that didn't the old GBC have an IR port that in Japan (only, I believe) have some online games? I know about 2 years back there was a talk of making a telnet for the AGB for MUDs and other MMO games.
<br/>
<br/>
There was once on Realms of Kaos's forums talk of someone making a verson of the game for the AGB. Who knows maybe we'll see Everquest on the AGB with online gaming next ;)<br/>_________________<br/>Do you want me to cook that or not?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
