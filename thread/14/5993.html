<br/>
<br/>
I would really like to make a music demo, after a little bit of research I found "afm" which is a free mod player.  woohoo!
<br/>
<br/>
Trouble is: I do not have a clue how to go about including an actual mod file?!  the sample program makes references to a mod, but I cant see how you can do this before the mod is added to the binary?!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not using a makefile, (batch file to complile my projects) I'm guessing its something to do with the makefile?
<br/>
<br/>
this line of code is where to address the mod:
<br/>
<br/>
afm_init(&amp;mod);
<br/>
<br/>
perhaps I need a tool to include the mod as source, as most do with graphics?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time and any suggestions, Im sure its something simple :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
