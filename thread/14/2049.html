    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
Q.1  What's the max map size in mode 0?
<br/>
<br/>
Cowbite spec says
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">They are made up of 8x8 tiles, the bitmaps of which are stored at the tile data address. The HOFS and VOFS registers can be used to scroll around a large area of up to 512x512 pixels (or 64 x 64 tiles).
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
but 512x512 pixels is pretty low considering 'Link' from the zelda games seems to walk around a massive map.
<br/>
<br/>
Also (from GBA Junkie)
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Rotation Backgrounds    (Text Backgrounds) Size 0 128 x 128 (Size 0 256 x 256) Size 1 256 x 256 (Size 1 512 x 256) Size 2 512 x 512 (Size 2 256 x 512) Size 3 1024 x 1024 (Size 3 512 x 512)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
If these sizes are in pixels, then the maps are still pretty small.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the values (e.g 256x256) are in tiles, in which case they are 8 times bigger.
<br/>
<br/>
Or the maps are small but are loaded dynamically or multiple maps are loaded and glued together using chewing-gum or wood-glue or something.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The typical map size is 32x32 tiles, or 256x256 pixels. You can create a larger virtual world by replacing the map entries that just scrolled off the edge of one map with new map entries that appear on the other edge.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you remember, the original zelda only allowed you to walk in one map, and then loaded a new one when reaching the edge. This is easy. 
<br/>
<br/>
You can also load dynamicly the map as you walk around, reloading entries in the map as they get offscreen, as Tepples mentionned. This is harder because you have to manage in real time the tiles and map entries, but is the way to go if you want the screen to just scroll around without having map reloaded a la Zelda.<br/>_________________<br/>-Inside every large program is a small program struggling to get out.
