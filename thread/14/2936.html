    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am compiling my files with a simple make.bat, files have *.cpp extension
<br/>
and int main () as the main starting point for the rom image.
<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure, but it looks to me that i am compiling with c++ support, although i am not sure about that, is there anyone that can tell?
<br/>
<br/>
Since i am not using any of the c++ specific commands. It would like to code and compile in c.
<br/>
<br/>
Then i've another question, regarding the compiling of *.c files to *.o files and then putting them together into the rom.
<br/>
I am not sure how to do that.
<br/>
<br/>
I basiscally lack the knowlegde of the commands in devkitadv, i tried searching but that didn't help me much further.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
