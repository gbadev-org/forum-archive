The book (even volume 1) is made for people who already know C.  You probably won't appreciate a lot of it unless you've been using C for a while.  C++ is just C with some extra features (most notably templates, inheritance, and operator overloading), very few of which are useful for a beginner.
<br/>
<br/>
Start with the "C Primer".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The only coidng book that I have is Code Complete by Steven McConnell which teaches you the princibles of coding rather then the languages.

The most common language for GBA development is C.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd recommend against putting any faith in the content of the books that 628man claims to have enjoyed. Herb Schildt's C books and C++ books are full of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/jargon/B/bullschildt.html" target="_blank">BS</a> that may lead readers to misunderstand the languages. For example, have a look at fan errata sheets for Schildt's <a class="postlink" href="http://herd.plethora.net/~seebs/c/c_tcr.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: italic">C: The Complete Reference</span></a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/schildt.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: italic">The Annotated C Standard</span></a>. Learn more in the answer to question 16 of the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/C-faq/learn/" target="_blank">alt.comp.lang.learn.c-c++ FAQ</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Rule of thumb #1: If you open a C or C++ book in a bookstore and see a programming example containing <span style="font-weight: bold">void main()</span> that's not clearly marked "incorrect", put it back because the author doesn't understand the C or C++ language specification properly.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's true that he's not a genius when it comes to sticking to standards, or an expert on the languages, but he's what you call easy to understand. You either love him or you hate him. 
<br/>
<br/>
I should add, if it weren't for Schildt I probably wouldn't be able to write the code that I want or have gotten as far as I have. I learned C back about 12 years ago (mostly from text C tutorials) but didn't really grasp it until after reading Schildt sometime later later, mostly because of his hands-on "get the job done" 'hack' style.  He may be of benefit to disorganized thinkers or people who don't understand too deeply like me.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't read all of his books but one you really might stay away from is his win32 book.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No book is perfect. Buy(look for) more than one.

<br/>
My recommendation: C++ for the Absolute Beginner.
<br/>
<br/>
One of the few books I would recommend by the way. 
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, don't get sucked in to buying books you don't need. I have 3 books that talk about C++ for half of the book. I bought 2 of them for beginner graphics programming (DirectX).
