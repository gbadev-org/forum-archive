I personally recommend that you start learning a bit of BASIC, but keep in mind that the code is entirely different from C or C++. I know some people will disagree with me and tell you to learn C directly.
<br/>
<br/>
So you are not confused, C++ is an extension of C and it's probably easier to learn C before C++.

I agree that learning BASIC first is a good idea.  It's important to abandon BASIC before you try to write anything big (more than a few pages) because you'll start picking up some very bad habits that are hard to fix.

Also, spend some time with an assembly language before learning C, or you'll invariably come back asking what all this "pointer" nonsense is. ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't really have an opinion to venture forth on this topic, but I find it interesting nonetheless.
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking as someone who first learned to code in LOGO, then in BASIC (both on the Apple IIc), I had the advantage/disadvantage of working in languages that were very high-level, but probably in some ways much lower-level than modern languages... or at least more <span style="font-style: italic">cumbersome</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
Although I had some exposure to assembly code early on, I found it intimidating and didn't return to it, probably until I hit university. When I finally started programming MIPS then (and even lower-level stuff like VHDL), I found the low-level aspect of it filled a void I'd frankly been missing since my BASIC programming days.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, back before compilers, <span style="font-style: italic">everyone</span> started out on assembly language. Nowadays, though, people start on stuff like Visual BASIC and JavaScript, and have OOP thrown at them from day one. It makes me wonder if modern programming languages are more useful to experienced programmers (who can make sagacious use of their features) than they are as learning tools beginners (who may become dependent on tools they don't really understand).

Hey, that exactly where I started! Even down to the 'c' in the model name. :) Then I moved on to Apple II machine code (Yes, machine code, not asm. I didn't have an assember or even know what one was :) )

<br/>
But that does remind me, LOGO (especially in command-line interpreted mode) is an excellent first-time-programmer language. You'll outgrow it very, very fast, but the instant graphical feedback is great for teaching the very basics of procedural code (And contrary to what many CS professors I've met believe, understanding procedural code is essential to grasp before OOP will make any sense.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because in my experience, C++ isn't what most people think. Most people treat it as an enhanced C, and I find that those people generally learnt C first and got used to the way C works. Besides that, I have seen people take classes to learn C, and the way they are forced into printf/scanf/#defines/structs etc almost seems cruel to an extent, and I ended up having to help a lot of them. C++ However I feel prepares you to step backwards (as I see it) to C when you need to (and you do need to sooner or later, C is too old to not be everywhere). So in summary, I feel that in all cases (and I mean all, not just some) that C++ is a far better place to start (after toying with something simple like QBASIC) because it is easier to learn and gives you more desirable skills.

This however, is true. It goes mostly against my previous remarks at the top of this post, that C++ is better to learn for you. I agree that C is a better choice if the GBA is your main goal. This is NOT because it is better suited to it (I use C++ with all the bells and whistles for GBA and anyone who says thats a bad idea just doesn't know how to do it just right).

More specifially, there is no C++ specific code in most of the tutorials available. And often you end up not really using C++ specific code until you are doing higher-level code such as general game design and such. If you make a library, C++ won't be everywhere because C-style code is more efficient.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've given a little more thought to this topic, and again, I have yet to really formulate an opinion. But speaking as someone who has taught C programming in a university environment for a number of years (as a classroom instructor for first-year engineers primarily), I think it's easy to take for granted the notion that high-level == easier to learn.
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, I wonder if it would have been easier for some of my students (the ones who wanted to be civil or nuclear engineers, rather than software or computer engineers) to start in RISC assembly, and then "graduate" from that to C. Assembly may be ugly, but it's <span style="font-style: italic">honest</span> and there is no obfuscation between code and what the hardware does. They would need some kind of interpreter or GUI that lets them step through their programs and view the contents of the registers, and they wouldn't be able to do anything with standard input, and I wouldn't even go so far as attempting to do any string-related programming. But I think the people who found C difficult to grasp would probably find assembly much more straightforward. Then when they moved onto C they would be in a much better position to appreciate the advantages it affords them over assembly-level coding.
<br/>
<br/>
There were far too many times in class - such as when describing the ANSI console-library routines to them - that I would have to say things like "you aren't expected to understand how or why this works". And God help them if they had been expected to learn C++ I/O streaming.
<br/>
<br/>
What's convenient for an experienced programmer is useful because they are experienced enough to know <span style="font-style: italic">why</span> it's convenient. High level == quicker gratification, but it's kind of like the dark side of the force that way. :D

I would say that understanding C++ needs no knowledge of C, but it helps some things. I mean really, if you understood C++ to a great enough extent, the only C features you wouldn't have been exposed to would be really crappy ways of declaring things and performing tasks, because C++ shares all of C's features (including the standard C library).

I agree, I have personally become a far better coder (particularly for embedded work) since learning digital electronics through to assembly through to higher level languages through to technologies like .NET, but this process has taken quite some time as you can imagine. Learning everything you can always makes you a better coder. I entirely agree that learning C is absolutely priceless, because you will need to know it without a doubt, I just don't agree with the order most people feel about learning languages.
<br/>
<br/>
I have read books that say "You need to learn to walk before you learn to run" when discussing which language to learn first out of C/C++. I find that quote very true, C compared to C++ is like walking compared to running, but its walking backwards in clogs through knee deep syrup compared to running through a maze for a new coder. Thats why BASIC is important, it's a good enough grounding in procedural languages for anyone, then they can move on and learn a better way of programming, <span style="font-style: italic">not just a cooler way of writing procedural code</span>. Of course once again, with the GBA, beginners go for C without a doubt :P<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

<br/>
Modern BASIC (by which I generally refer to MS's Visual BASIC, as that's the only modern version of BASIC I've really been exposed to) is so homogenized that I don't think it has an appreciably different learning curve from C. While C has a more rigid syntax, the complexity of syntax rules isn't what really affects the ease of learning, I find, since VB just makes all of the C syntax features available to you one way or another.
<br/>
<br/>
Give them line-number BASIC where they've got a reduced instruction set, the only primitive types are number, string and array, they're forced to use GOTOs and GOSUBs to branch around and PEEK and POKE for direct memory accesses. Then plonk them down in C a month later and watch them revel in its high-level sweetness... suddenly stuff like prototypes and macros and pointers seem a lot less daunting when you understand why they're there.
<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, I'd say the only way BASIC makes a better starting point than C is if you can convince them to use the reduced subset of instructions and take advantage of features that originally made BASIC for Beginners. Sure, you can still just assign values to variables in VB and it will work, but I'll bet 90% of tutorials teach you to use "Dim &lt;var&gt; As &lt;type&gt;" instead. So what's the point?

Regardless, I see your point, if stuck with VisualBasic I can see how it just dilutes the issue of a first language even more. Maybe a compromise then? How about the idea that a new coder should learn C, but has to compile it in C++ mode so they are forced to learn to be type safe and can slowly add new ideas such as templates/inheritance into code as they learn it?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

The difference: good luck finding a C tutorial or primer that mentions "goto"*. Heck, I was probably programming C for five years or so before I realized "goto" existed in C when I saw it in someone else's demo code. And my first thought? "This goto could be eliminated with a better-structured loop."

<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">* - I realize some people are literal enough to take this as an actual challenge; I haven't bothered to see if any tutorials actually mention goto or not, but if they do it's most likely for completion's sake and not to actually advocate its use.</span>

<br/>
1.  Many languages use format strings.  C# and Common Lisp are two that I've used.  You're picking a big fight.

<br/>
2.  The relative speeds of sprintf and ostream depend entirely on the case.  Sometimes it's slower to repeatedly call and return from various output routines when using a long string of ostream calls.
<br/>
<br/>
3.  The implementation of a string of ostream calls can be replicated in C by explicitly naming the output routines for each type.  The need to do this is one reason I like ostream better than sprintf, but it is an issue of convenience and consistency, not efficiency.
<br/>
<br/>
4.  Speaking of efficiency, text output is not a bottleneck for the vast majority of applications.

<br/>
It may just be a personal thing, but doing the top-to-bottom-to-top learning routine is confusing to me.  On my way down, I'm frantically trying to fix my views of the higher levels based on all the new information, and on the way back up I'm frantically trying to forget everything I learned the first time I was at the top.

Starting at the bottom gives me a clean slate, so I can simply add to it and not retrofit anything.

Well, it helps when learning Asm ;). But I still don't completely buy into the "BASIC is bad for beginners" argument.
<br/>
<br/>
For one, it could just be a matter of the moving on at the right time. I had been using BASIC extensively for at least 5 full years before I moved into C. So, at first I learned a lot about prodedural code, but then it was later on that I started getting accustomed to going the wrong direction with code organization. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also, it depends on the flavor of BASIC.  Any version that doesn't support block conditionals is definately going to be teaching bad habits very strongly right from the start. But something like QBASIC allows the beginner to avoid having to use many of those kludges without introducing any of the problems that come from starting on C/C++/Java/etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, I'd bet that if there was a version of BASIC that had the same set of loops and conditionals that C does, then it's users wouldn't need to use goto at all, thus eliminating the bad habits that other variants of BASIC can teach. (I'm going to have to go back to QBASIC sometime.  Since it supports block conditionals and while loops, I'm starting to suspect that I may not have needed to use any goto's back when I used QBASIC.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I started way back with basic &amp; some assembler (on the good old speccy).  It was still basic (Blitz) + assembler on the Amiga till I went to college where I learned pascal before being exposed to C, so if it's an interim language you're after could pascal be the answer?  I never used it once I'd learned C, but IIRC it was much stricter and less 'dangerous' than C, so if you're starting out, and have got an idea of the programmer mindset (variables, subroutines etc) with BASIC, then pascal (or delphi which is descended - I think) from it might be worth a look.

If they were to be able to get something to happen in code with no real challenge, and get something cool on the screen, wouldn't that thrill them and give them the insatiable appetite for coding that we have? Would they then drive themselves to learn as much as possible? I am willing to think about ideas for months and write up designs to do a project and decide on some issues for speed and simplicity etc, but you can't expect someone who just want's to write something to do this yet.
<br/>
<br/>
So opinions? What do beginners wan't? Just to get things happenning as soon as possible (BASIC etc). Be more commercially viable as soon as possible and learn something higher (C/C++/ASM whatever)?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

<br/>
I can only think of 2 reasons to choose real game programming instead:  Either you want to do things that those programs don't let you do, or you want a challenge.
<br/>
<br/>
In the first case, it will take any new programmer a lot of effort to achieve that goal, so there's no choice but to accept the challenge.
<br/>
<br/>
In the second case, making things easy is exactly the opposite of what will make them happy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's not that it's bad.  Just heavily biased towards a certain language.
<br/>
<br/>
But he's correct a language is a tool it's only "bad" if you use it wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
I mean.  until recently if you wanted a way to design gui and fast it was all VB (now I recommend java or c#)  
<br/>
If you wanted power and speed most companies seemed to use c. 
<br/>
If you want easier to maintain code and better organization use c++.  
<br/>
If you want portability use java.
<br/>
<br/>
if programming for the gba use c or c++ (unless you want high opt. then use asm).  and it wont be bad for your computer because you're not running it on your computer.  You're running on an emulated gba.  And anything stupid you would do in c, you would do in c++.
<br/>
<br/>
And again like it was said.  It's only bad if you use it wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
If you're trying to learn to program I would suggest c or basic.  Although I highly recommend c.  It's more to learn, but I think c has more applicable standards when it comes to learning other languages.  most languages don't use control statements like basic does, where as most common languages seem to follow structure c does.  (Note common.  Excludes lisp and prolog.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think that's a good point. While going through the computer science curriculum at a Univ, I saw a LOT of people who were turned off from programming because (as beginners) they found C/C++ to be so much work for so little payoff.  And losing all interest in programming certainly isn't going to help anyone become a good coder anymore than bad habits would.  I think this is one of the good points of LOGO, low effort, large tangible payoff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sajimori gives a good explanation of the paradox that prevents what you describe from occurring. My response was less based in logic, and just comes from years of experience and empirical observation, on the Internet, in the classroom and in life. In general, people either want to do things right or they want to do things easy, and there is very little you can do to persuade a leopard to change its spots.

<br/>
I agree for certain situations languages top other languages.  Which was what the whole listing was for.
<br/>
<br/>
Like Lisp and prolog are known for being better with ai applications, although not limited to this.
<br/>
<br/>
I think that "virtually always better" is dependant.
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, pointers or references.  Some programmers think that languages that support "real" pointers are better than references (java vs. c/c++).  Even though they provide almost the same functionality.
<br/>
<br/>
What about pointer addition?  is that a good thing or a bad thing?  Is a language that prevents you from address hoping into someone else's program better or worse?  I think it's all very subjective and dependant on the application.
<br/>
<br/>
And a language that has an alternative that's more practical just means it's old not really a bad language.  I mean outside of console programming and electronic device programming (chips and such) asm is relatively impractical.  Does that make it bad? no.  Makes it a bad idea to try to program a windows program in asm, but the language itself is not bad and becomes useful in other applications.
<br/>
<br/>
Also define what you consider a part of the language.  I mean is c++ better than c because of strings or stl?  probably not and if it was you could implement them in c.  ::shrug::</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Someone will always think one language is better than another in general or completely.  Which is cool.
<br/>
<br/>
By "rational" I hope that you mean the discussion (inclusive of both of us) and not just me, I'd hate to think you're being rude over something so subjective.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
I do give you this though.  If a language was devoid of functions, variables or control statements (branch instructions or loop abilities).  I'd call it a bad language or a poorly designed cpu architecture(if the architecture doesn't support it)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
