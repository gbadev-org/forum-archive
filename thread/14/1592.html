I'm just wondering if someone can explain how to port a pc game to GBA. Do you have to remake the whole thing or can you "convert" it.  Take for example Wolfenstein 3D or Doom II - how was that done?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually i don't know this either.
<br/>
<br/>
But i think nintendo must have some sort of porting system
<br/>
for their snes2gba port, but i don't know it.
<br/>
<br/>
And for doom/wolvenstein, i think they build the engine
<br/>
for the gba and then convert all scripts in their engine.
<br/>
<br/>
but i don't know for sure, so someone else might have
<br/>
better thoughts, or know it.<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unless I'm mistaken the GBA doesnt have DirectDraw or Direct3D.  Just that fact alone and having to convert a PC game makes it not simple in my opinion.  I have never tried to do this but to me it sounds like you would have to convert all or at least most of your PC code to GBA code.<br/>_________________<br/>There is no spoon...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When well planned, a game has the high level stuff (the dynamic game) and low level stuff (the access to the support's hardware). So in theory, the high level only use the low level API meaning that oen would only have to re-write this low level codes and the entire game would work. In theory. It doubt very much this is how in happens though, there's always tweaking, and in some case it's just impossible (lack of memory, speed,...) and use of particular sotware/hardware capability non-available in the new console (3D hardware, etc...)

I'm rather new to this thing, so someone with more experience could confirm, add to what i said.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well... As a bit of a reminder, I doubt that Doom was honestly a PC to GBA port in this case. I'm not familiar with the differences in versions, but it just makes more sense to me that the GBA version of Doom would be a port of the existing SNES version.
<br/>
<br/>
But on the topic of the question... I see no reason that PC to GBA ports would be very simple at all. As has been stated, the GBA has no incarnation of either DirectX or OpenGL, or even the Win32 API or any other APIs that are commonly involved in PC development. In porting any game, therefore, there are a lot of complications. The main graphical engine, and every other part of the game that directly involves the hardware, as it seems to me, needs to be completely rebuilt. The GBA by its own nature has various restrictions and capabilities that do not exist on the PC, such as sprite sizes and attributes. Once this is rewritten to work on the GBA, other stuff can be ported into place much more easily, however. Most maps, for example, as well as scripts, or anything else the game may involve, are more than likely to be more or less ready to use as is.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm probably just repeating what's already been said, but I can always hope I've added a bit of detail. :) The important thing is that communicating with the Gameboy Advance is quite different to communicating with the hardware of a computer, and these differences make it a pretty ugly task. Processor power isn't the only thing that keeps most PC games newer than.... cripes, ten years or so... off the GBA.<br/>_________________<br/>-Arek the Absolute</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The GBA version of Doom was actually a port of the version for the Atari Jaguar.

<br/>
For example, after I had ported the graphics engine (which had been designed for portability), it took me about three hours to drop the gameplay code from Vitamins for PC (a Dr. Mario clone, part of freepuzzlearena) into Vitamins for GBA.

Some single-player 2D games have been made for the PC in the last ten years. What keeps more recent single-player 2D games off the GBA is copyright, when a publisher refuses to authorize a GBA port.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
