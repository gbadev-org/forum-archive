    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm completely new to GBA programming, though I have done some programming in C, Basic, and a few other languages, so I've got some experience.  I've been trying to set up a programming environment on Mac OSX for at least 2 hours now, with little success.  All the tutorials I have found have been geared toward PC users.  Can anyone point me in the right direction, preferably to a GBA development tutorial or set-up tutorial for Macs?  Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Download the devkitARM kit for Mac OSX at <a class="postlink" href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/devkitpro/devkitARM_r18-osx.zip?download" target="_blank">sourceforge</a> if you haven't yet, double-click the downloaded installer if it doesn't open by itself, and authenticate and install.
<br/>
<br/>
Then in Terminal run the following code:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">echo "export DEVKITPRO=/opt/local/devkitpro
<br/>
export DEVKITARM=/opt/local/devkitpro/devkitARM
<br/>
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/opt/local/devkitpro/devkitARM/bin" &gt;&gt; ~/.profile</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">  Then type in:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">export DEVKITPRO=/opt/local/devkitpro
<br/>
export DEVKITARM=/opt/local/devkitpro/devkitARM
<br/>
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/opt/local/devkitpro/devkitARM/bin</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
This sets up the correct enviroment variables to the compiler and tools.
<br/>
<br/>
That's it (I hope).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I might look like an idiot for saying this, but isn't it silly that there isn't just <span style="font-style: italic">one</span> folder I can download that has everything in it?  Just a zip file that includes everything one needs...devkits, includes, examples, readme's, and all of that crap in one nice neat package?  I feel like I running from site to site picking up different files that are going to help me compile GBA code, and somehow they're supposed to come together like Legos.

I haven't done programming for a few years, but I once managed to get a programming environment for Atari 2600, just using a text editor.  That's a ghetto system, and I'm surprised that GBA is proving so much more difficult.  Then again, that was ASM, and I'd much prefer to code in C.
<br/>
<br/>
Please please please someone help!  I've been scavenging these forums looking for others with my problem.  I've stumbled across a few quick tutorials specifically for Mac users, and they all give a different explanation.  I've pretty much tried them all, and I run into all sorts of problems.  If there's a clear explanation with step-by-step instructions on how to set this up on a Mac, <span style="font-style: italic">please</span> link me to it!
<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for sounding like such a noob, and I'm trying to do as much as I can on my own, but I've had no success.  Thank you in advance for your help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok so still no luck, and I've been working my ass off trying everything I possibly can.  I just wish I could get to this point: <a href="http://gnufoo.org/gba/GBASDKdemo.mov" target="_blank">http://gnufoo.org/gba/GBASDKdemo.mov</a> .  Unfortunately that video isn't very helpful.

How do I create a new SGADE project in ProjectBuilder?  What is ProjectBuilder?
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I know this is a long shot, but if anyone lives in the Santa Barbara area and wants to meet me at a Starbucks or something, I'd be willing to pay 10 bucks for someone setting this up on my computer.  I know that sounds odd, but hey, I really want to get this set up.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm really really frustrated with getting this to work.  I'm calling it a night.

Sorry for the triple post, lol.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
