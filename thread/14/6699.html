    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What I want to do is program an RPG, and there is not enough space in VRAM for all of the sprites (plus i need a place for my maps, dialogue, etc.) so I need to figure out how to make sure my data is stored in ROM.  Then I need to know how to access the data from ROM.  Can someone please help me with this?  I tried searching the forums, but to no avail.  Thanks :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When you declare your data, just put "const" in front:
<br/>
<br/>
exemple:
<br/>
const char var[]={some value..};<br/>_________________<br/>山猫</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can access it any time... by referring to its variable name. If it's an array, use the variable name to grab a pointer to the base of it. If it's a literal value, structure, etc. use the address-of operator (&amp;) to get the address of it.

Not very easily. That's why we have linkers to link a variable name with a location in memory: so we don't have to keep track of what address every variable is stored at. Why would you want to do this yourself?
