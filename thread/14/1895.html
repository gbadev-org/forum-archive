    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a beginner in the gba dev world, and I've tried a lot of tutorials, but I've seen that all the .h they used are differents (gba.h, screenmode.h, keypad.h ...)
<br/>
<br/>
It's difficult for newbies to find what use to do what...
<br/>
<br/>
Is the gba dev community have a favorite .h set to use ?
<br/>
<br/>
tks, bye</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've good skills in C/C++ and I can understand all the code that is in all the .h (mostly some define) given with the tutorials, but, where the iostream.h stdio.h math.h ... are common to ALL the C tutorials, the gba.h are differents in thepernprojet / downtoyou / gbajunkies / gbadev.
<br/>
<br/>
And it's just boring to adapt your code or your .h at each new line you add in you program... That's the reason why I ask if everybody use a different *.h set or if everybody have choosen the same...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Different developers often use different .h files to describe the GBA chipset's memory-mapped registers. Some developers have some sort of paranoia that if they use widespread names, those names might actually be the official names and they'll get in trouble with Nintendo for stealing trade secrets; others just choose names that make more sense than the widespread names.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are following an author's particular tutorial (eg pern/dovoto or gba junkie) then use the headers that they use/supply. This will help you get on with doing stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
After a while you start to understand what everything does and adapt to most minor changes from one header to another.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, Daikath is right, if you dont understand the basic C/C++ statements/syntax then you are asking for trouble.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
