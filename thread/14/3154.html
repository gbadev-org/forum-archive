    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey - just wondering something:
<br/>
I had a look at a sprite from the newest metroid game for gba and it seems to be about 36px high. would they have had to use a 64 high sprite to attain that size of character?
<br/>
I ask because originally I wanted to make the character in my game 38px high and figured it would be a bad idea.
<br/>
Any input is appreciated. thanks!<br/>_________________<br/>If you think you think outside the box, you're trapped in one.

They use mappings. Mappings are basically more than one hardware sprite put together to make a big sprite.
<br/>
<br/>
The hardware will render it as many sprites, but these mappings will make it look like they're together all the time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am sure they have some kind of mapping system that will calculate the best mapping for a variable size sprite<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

I know :P
<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to reply because I had nothing else to do. And you never mentioned the mappings word.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any open source project or tutorial that has a good mappings engine around?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
