    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ytmnd.com/list/?search=tiger" target="_blank">Go on ytmnd.com and search for tiger</a>. See if you can expand one of those parodies of <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_YTMND_fads" target="_blank">YTMND fads</a> into a real game design. This will give you practice in design as well as implementation.

But seriously, if you want to clone a G&amp;W game directly, try <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_%26_Watch" target="_blank">Game &amp; Watch at wikipedia</a> and then see if you can pick up a <a class="postlink" href="http://search.ebay.com//search/search.dll?from=R40&amp;satitle=game+watch+gallery" target="_blank">G&amp;W Gallery Game Pak for GBC or GBA on eBay</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I just finished pong and am ready to do an RPG ==

I just learned how to count to 10 and am ready to do calculus.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What he is talking about is not too bad. A little room with a goemon sprite and a chest was one of the things I did in my early days too. It doesn't take a beginner too long to figure do it either.

<br/>
<br/>
Habeshaw T. Gibbs G. (1989) states that, ?simply giving students information by telling them, or asking them to read, will have no impact on their understanding unless they can have sport with this information?. It later goes on to say, ?Also, the meaning which students construct will be unique. This is because their existing understanding of the world, which they are using to make sense of new ideas, is itself quite unique.?
<br/>
<br/>
Habeshaw T. Gibbs G. (1989) notes that assessment is a powerful tool which can influence student learning and that students ?may study unimportant material and work towards inappropriate goals? with it.

Activists like to actively lead discussions and meetings. Theorists like to probe and ask specific questions on the subject matter.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
