    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would it be possible to make an emulator that plays C64 games on a GBA?
<br/>
The Commodore 64 is an 8bit computer right?
<br/>
<br/>
The dream would be to able to play C64 and/or Amiga games.
<br/>
Amiga is probably too heavy for it.
<br/>

But have anyone given the C64 a thought?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Is anyone else talking about a similar project?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">AFAIK, Amiga is *way* too powerful, even for DS.
<br/>
<br/>
C64 is pretty possible. There's threads about it in the DS section.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
