But when you write to 2 consecutive regs wouldn't it be more efficient to do a signle 32-bit write ? Apparently, the libgba have no provisions for this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also, individual register writes aren't usually a bottleneck or choke point.  The biggest chokepoint is how fast your memset/memcpy routine is, and newlib still doesn't compile to a very good routine on ARM.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry but I what is a bottleneck or choke point ?
<br/>
<br/>
Regardless I just wanted to be sure it's ok to do 32-bit writes as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Bottleneck or choke point: Something in the code that makes it run slowly.  Like how a bottle would pour much faster if there wasn't a small hole at the end.
<br/>
<br/>
Small things like Register Writes that are run once infrequently generally aren't worth optimizing.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
