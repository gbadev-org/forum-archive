    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, I've had visual studio 6 installed for awhile just to use VB for work. I decided to attempt to write some stuff for NDS, but i have no C++ experience.
<br/>
<br/>
I followed the tutorial here: <a href="http://www.dev-scene.com/NDS/Tutorials_Day_1" target="_blank">http://www.dev-scene.com/NDS/Tutorials_Day_1</a> to get set up. I used the auto-windows installer at devkitpro.org, and downloaded the examples. The tutorial had me navigate to one of the examples and type the make command. I get an error message "'make' is not recognized as an internal or external command"
<br/>
<br/>
I made a C++ makefile project with the command line of "make -r 2&gt;&amp;1 | sed -e 's/(.[a-zA-Z]+):([0-9]+):/1(2):/'" and tried to build with that and i get errors.
<br/>
<br/>
Opening the programmers notepad project file for hello_world and hitting ALT+1 to build yielded a file not found error.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?

That sounds suspiciously like either the installer hasn't managed to set up the path and environment variables or you chose not to install MSYS.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You [i]did[/]i restart after installing the devkit on windows, right? That's necessary for the path variables to actually take effect in most cases. If that doesn't do it, you will most likely need to either try the install again and make sure that the variables get installed (aka default options) or set the paths manually. I would tell you what to put there, but I just discovered that apparently Windows Vista hides that file form you, even if it's on an XP partition. Strange.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're just starting out, I would highly recommend that you go play with some GBA development, as the documentation and tutorials for it are a lot more plentiful, accurate, and complete. DS development using the devkit is very similar, so once you have GBA down fairly well (play with the OAM and backgrounds a LOT, they're the same in both) DS dev will come a lot easier.
