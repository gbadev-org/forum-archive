    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey,I downloaded StaringMonkey's Library,Text thing and DirectSound thing stuff.
<br/>
Now i just want to start with the text thingy to try and make some text appear there and just try out some stuff so I get a bit on how the text stuff works.
<br/>
But,All it shows is non-recognized files and a make.bat.
<br/>
Are all those non-recognized files C++ Files?
<br/>
If so,I have to install C++ to run them and be able to compile the samples and stuff. Correct me if Im wrong.
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
