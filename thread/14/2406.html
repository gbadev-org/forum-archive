<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if you are the ones to ask, but you'll probably know if anyone does... I'm interested in developing any new software at this time, but would like to learn more about how to edit existing roms. NOT FOR REDISTRUBUTION of course, but for my own personal entertainment and educational value. What I am speaking of is replaceing sprites/maps/sounds/etc but leaving the overall mechanics the same.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,
<br/>
