    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone, 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just about to start a bit of coding for the GBA, and hit a snug with Vham (well, it's not so surprising... it's always trouble to get the hang of the quirks of a new IDE).
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a fairly expierienced C++ programmer, and kind of wanted to develop for something else than PC for a change...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, the problem is this:
<br/>
I created a new C++ project in Vham and tried to build it, but can't. I get the following error messages:

I suppose it's a dll that vham tries to link but can't for some reason, though I can't make out what the reason is (every IDE has it's own language... took me long enough to figure out what visual studio was trying to tell me some years ago, but there's a wee bit more documentation around for VS).
<br/>
<br/>
 I'm kind of worried that it's because I'm on a 64-bit OS, although I have been able to compile some C-samples just fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Can somebody tell me what exactly the problem might be?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Uhmmmm... :awkward: The project actually executes despite the errors, as I just noticed. That's certainly a first as far as IDEs are concerned... ?
<br/>
<br/>
It would still be nice to know what goes on here, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, sorry I'm not answering your question but since you've at least got it to output something I figured you'd know the answer to this question. Where did you put your .vhw files. I put mine in a a folder I made called 'vhmworkspace'. However when I try to build the program, nothing happens. I already have it running on windows xp so thats not the problem. If you have any advice please reply, thank you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
