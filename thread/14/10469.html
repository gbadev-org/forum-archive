    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi again,
<br/>
<br/>
Started from the base ground this afternoon in coding homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, things are not as easy as I thinked. Lots and lots of tutorials available here and then, but a lot of them are ow outdated. Damn !
<br/>
<br/>
I peeked at the PCXView example provided in the DevKitPro. If I understand well, using bin20 transforms a PCX file into an linkable object. However, it seems, reading the sourcecode, that there is a header file to be generated with some extern const adresses linking to the .o bytes chunks.
<br/>
<br/>
I am unable to generate this header file with bin2iso and reading the makefile does not help much. Perhaps I'm not looking the right way.
<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
And by the way, is there somewhere an *up to date* tutorials set ? Pern project is fine but outdated, a lot of things have changed in libgba since they were written and it is now hard to follow.
<br/>
<br/>
See ya dudez.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Putting arrays in headers is extremely bad practice, please don't suggest it any more.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Is bin2iso a different tool or just a typo?
<br/>
<br/>
bin2o is a makefile macro defined in base_rules. It uses bin2s to generate an object file and some sed fu to output a header in the build directory.
<br/>
<br/>
Is the example not working for you or are you trying to do the same thing with another tool?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Well, that was a typo. I was extremely tired when I wrote this yesterday late in the evening.

<br/>
Yes. I saw that this morning reading your post. I thought it was the utility bin2o, I found the link in gbadev tools page. I read the makefile carefully this morning and found the macro source in base_rules. I have to revise my makefile knowledge obvisouly. I was an *NIX dev once, but it was more than 10 years ago now and things seem to have vanished into some kind of mental void :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I succeded in displaying a picture by making some headers with gfx2gba util and making some memcpy from the headers generated to Palette and Graphics memory. But I wanted, as you suggested it by telling about "bad practice" do to it in a cleaner way.
<br/>
<br/>
Again, many thanks to all for advices and tips.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm really new to this too, but I've gotten a background to show up in my test1 example.  I agree that keeping the images in header files seems like a not-so-terrific way to handle them.  What's recommended now, and are there any tutorials/clean examples?
<br/>
<br/>
In the Pocket PC world, I just keep all my images as .PNG or .GIF files, with occassional .JPG backgrounds, but that simply doesn't seem to be possible for GBA coding.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,

It's not too hard to implement a ROM file system on the GBA. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#gbfs" target="_blank">Here, use mine</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's still possible to use standard graphics formats on the GBA but it's not really as useful as it is on a PC. While there are bitmap modes they're intended mainly for cut scenes rather than an entire game. You will get more efficiency from the tiled modes so you should really be preprocessing your graphics.
<br/>
<br/>
As it happens I'm currently in the process of getting Cearn's Gameboy Image Transmogrifier working on big endian machines. I hope to be including this in the next release of devkitARM.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
