    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi guys
<br/>
            I've downloaded all of the devkitpro settup files manually (because the updater one kept giving a 404 error saying that oh ffs was not found) and stuck to everything it says on the faqs on installation but now that i want to use the <span style="font-weight: bold">make  </span> command it just says its not a recognised batch or executable program...... 
<br/>
<br/>
what do i need to do to make
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance matt</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm talking about the problem with make; I doubt he has msys because he used the release I linked to that does not come with it. Try this link for the <a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&amp;package_id=160396" target="_blank">devkit pro installer</a>; if there are still 404 errors it is most likely down to a problem on the server side, like renames files; who knows?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I do have the msys program, as i said i downloaded everything. 
<br/>
can i possibly use the make command in msys or is that something completely different
<br/>
<br/>
edit: thanks guys i got it working with the new link provided
<br/>
<br/>
btw if anyone's interested, microsoft have made this powertool called open command here. you basically right click the folder you want to have the directory automatically sent to and select it really handy for the make command as you'd usually have to cd C:\________ first
