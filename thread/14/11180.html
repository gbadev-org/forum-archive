    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I read through the FAQ and tried my hardest (3 days) to get it going. I downloaded the MinGW compiler for starters, however, it doesn't recognise included header files.
<br/>
<br/>
This is strange to me since the MinGW main site states that downloading and installing of the files will allow you to compile via the console. (I'm running through Windows 'cmd') typing "gcc -c hello.c" returned the following error correlating to my above problem.
<br/>
<br/>
hello.c:1:No include path in which to find stdio.h
<br/>
<br/>
the file is saved in the parent directory of the include files. They're folder is named "include"
<br/>
<br/>
This is probably just one of the problems I'm gonna be encountering along the way, but some assistance would be greatly appreciated, since I've  navigated through all the provided directories that came with MinGW, and I can't find any file that would allow me to set up where the compiler should look for include or lib files.<br/>_________________<br/>I-am-so-smart.

I am not an entire novice to programming, I've had several projects finished in other languages, but just to get into console development, I wanted to try making games for the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried several different methods for setting up an environment for this, but none of them worked.
<br/>
<br/>
So, what I want is the package designed for the GBA. I'll try getting that devkitPro and see how well it works for me =)

Thanks again guys, I'll keep posted if anything else arises.

<br/>
<br/>
I looked through some documentation on the gbadev.org site and found the "Crash Course" tutorial. However, even the supplied code won't compile. It gives me an error about "undefined reference to `main'"
<br/>
<br/>
Far be it from me to understand what PN's definition is for that error. In C++ whenever I saw that it meant I had a logical error in the vicinity of the part of code I had been working in.
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone "recommend" a tutorial for me? I'm looking through these and follow them in my head, I understand what they mean and their logic behind it, but if I can't get the code that the tutorial is supplying me with to compile, then how am I to believe that what they say is true???

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is just insane...
<br/>
<br/>
Why is it that every tutorial is recommending a different environment for usage? This is a completely denormalized way of trying to teach someone to program.
<br/>
<br/>
I feel like a little kid going to school where each day the teacher tells him to scrap everything he did yesterday and install something else because TODAY'S lesson won't compile the way yesterday's lesson did.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there some sort of way for me to learn how to do this without sorting through masses of tutorials for one that uses the same setup that I have? Or at least a group of tutorials that use the same setup?
<br/>
<br/>
My setup is as follows (I think... I'm not too sure, since I've installed several different things in an attempt to make a working environment):
<br/>
<br/>
devkitARM (Downloaded because the "Read First" recommended that it be installed)
<br/>
devkitPro Updater, and everything it downloaded for me (as per the recommendation... this has allowed me to at least compile and run "Hello World")
<br/>
Programmer's Notepad (The updater gave me this... it hasn't given me too many issues. I assume everything is the Makefile's fault)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm programming in C... because I hate assembly, BASIC is too weak, and from what the FAQ said C++ won't be as fast as C.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Using that setup, what should I be looking at in order to further what I "think" I've learned thus far?
<br/>
<br/>
I really don't like the way things are looking for me. I can sit and read a tutorial until the cows come home, but in the end if I can't even get a 20 line program to compile because every tutorial I've read wants a different setup, what do i have to show for it?!
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone please answer my call for assistance?

Let's just say that the subject could be discussed for weeks, and no one involved would ever change their opinion. I recommend C++, even if it's slower you're code will probably end up more readable. But, you can learn C first and then move onto C++ when/if you feel ready.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The main problem is that most of the tutorials are <span style="font-style: italic">very</span> old. Like 3 to 5 years old. The standard was DevKitAdv (DKA)back then, so that's what everyone used including the tutorial writers. Then devkitArm (which is now part of devkitPro (DKP)) came along and essentially took over once DevKitAdv wasn't updated anymore either, while devkitArm continues to be upgraded and improved. The only tutorials that have been updated since then are <a class="postlink" href="http://www.drunkencoders.com/index.php?system_id=2&amp;page=Tutorials" target="_blank">new PERN</a> (up to DKP r18), and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm" target="_blank">Tonc</a> (up to DKP r19). Use those instead of the older ones.
<br/>
<br/>
The exact tools with which to build don't really matter, though, code itself is (mostly) independent of the toolchain. What does change is the path and the name of prefix of the tools (arm-agb-elf-gcc (DKA), arm-elf-gcc (DKP &lt;r19), arm-eabi-gcc (DKP &gt;=r19), etc) and maybe the '-specs' linker flag. Switching between toolchains require only minor changes in makefiles, so they aren't discussed very much.

It's probably the path thing, though. The devkitPro installer adds the the 'msys/bin' to the system path and (I think) 'devkitArm', but not devkitArm's 'bin' directory, which is why it can't find the tools.
