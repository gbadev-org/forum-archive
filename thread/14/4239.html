    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all!
<br/>
<br/>
I've been working for somtime now with VisualHAM, but since yesterday
<br/>
when I relized, that I can use only the Debug library, I am searching
<br/>
for a compiler with IDE configured to it, which will use Release library
<br/>
as well.
<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded Devkit Advance, and even tried to compile a little program
<br/>
with it.
<br/>
But, it fails. I have no idea how to configure VC++ 6.0 to it,
<br/>
and also don't know how to do and how to use a makefile, that would support optimizations flags and etc... and will use a release library as
<br/>
well
<br/>
<br/>
How would I do all of that exectly as soon as possiable?
<br/>
<br/>
PLz, if you are willing to help me, so be specific.
<br/>
Help is much appreciated, thanks in advance
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, tomer</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I know it's long but go through it (at least the baic concepts) and you should be able to make a makefile.
<br/>
<br/>
It's worth learning it, trust me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In the gbadev.org tutorial section ( <a href="http://www.gbadev.org/docs.php?section=tutorials" target="_blank">http://www.gbadev.org/docs.php?section=tutorials</a> ) is a nice Makefile tutorial wich will teach you the basics about makefiles.
<br/>
It's all you need to start out so i would read that first.
