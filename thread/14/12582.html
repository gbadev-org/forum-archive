    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there - I'm a database programmer by trade, but am interested in trying to code for the GBA. I currently have a GB Micro, however, and I'm not certain if the F2A linker cable will work with the smaller port on the Micro.

Should I therefore be looking at something like the "Flash 2 Advance USB Writer V1.0", or would I be better off picking up an old GBA/SP and using the linker cable?

Thanks for your help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

a normal sized gba flash cart should fit in a gba micro, just as normal-sized games does. I'm strongly suspecting non-normal sized to fit also.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, I'm certain that the normal size GBA flash cart will <span style="font-style: italic">fit</span>, but it's a question of how to get the code onto the flash cart in the first place.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm brand new to all this, remember, but my understanding was that the Linker cable connected the GBA to the PC via USB, and you could then read/write to the flash cart whilst it was in the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the Micro has a smaller link port than the GBA/SP, and the linker cable looks only to work with the larger version of the port.
<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, I'm thinking that I need a way of writing to the flash cart when it's not actually inside the GB Micro. But I may be miles off base, so corrections gratefully appreciated...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, it's a pain.  I bought a gba regular to gba micro link converter, but it converts the wrong way (assumes all your cables are micro cables, and lets you hook a normal gba up to them) so it's not as useful.  I still haven't figured out the best way to do what you're asking.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could try the Supercard SD or miniSD or something similar from e.g. M3. The GBAMP with CF is also a good choice. It seems the regular flashcards are not so popular anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
AFAIK there is also a flashcard which do not need the GBS to program it, because it has the plug inside the flashcard.
<br/>
For the F2A (?) is IMHO a external and cheap "programmer" available (so you do not need the GBA).
<br/>
<br/>
Which choice is the best, depends on your environment.
