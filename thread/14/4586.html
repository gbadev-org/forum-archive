I wanted to emphasize this part.  You should use DevKitARM at that website (http://www.devkit.tk) instead of DevKitAdvance.  DevKitAdvance hasn't been updated in ages and is just kind of dead.  DevKitARM replaced it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I tried using the exes in a .bat file the same way I've been using DevKitAdvance and it didn't give any errors but just gave me a ROM that didn't do anything. It would be nice if there was something on the site but it just goes as far as getting the stuff on your hard drive which seems to be the easy part. Plus I only have Win 98 and it doesn't say anything about what to do if you don't have XP/2000.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Really sorry, I've been totally lazy in searching for stuff on this and have managed to find pretty much everything I needed just now, just had never been bothering to look properly. Still think it's a bit awkward that there's nothing on the DevKitARM site apart from the example makefiles which fly right over my head.....<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">CanIKickIt(YES_YOU_CAN);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I downloaded and installed DevKitArm and I couldn't get anything to compile. Of course, I only spent about fifteen minutes goofing with it, but that was enough to get frustrated and go back to my "dead" install of DevKitAdv.
<br/>
<br/>
If it's not broke, don't fix it. When I first started I followed the Pern tutorial and had compiled my first DevKitAdv program in a matter of minutes.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone put together a decent tutorial of taking DevkitArm from install to successful GBA compile? If so, I'd like to read it, and I'm sure a bunch of other compiler-newbs like me would like to too. I probably just missed some simple but critical piece...

I have found three important differences between DevKit Advance and devkitARM: <ul><li>DevKit Advance has an old version of GCC; switching to devkitARM brought a speedup in some of my code. </li><li>Where you used arm-agb-elf-*  in DevKit Advance, use arm-elf-* in devkitARM. </li><li>In the devkitARM linker command line, you need to add -specs=gba.specs in order to bring in the crt0 and linker script for the GBA. (Use -specs=gba_mb.specs for multiboot.) </li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Set up yes, but there's no information on how you use it to compile things, it just takes you as far as choosing something to edit your text in. It doesn't describe the necessary changes to your makefiles as tepples has so nicely laid out above. I think my main problem was working with examples that did not separate out the compiling and linking so I kinda had my DevKitARM bat file almost right but not quite.
<br/>
<br/>
I still can't get any makefiles to work through VC++ and even if I try and type make in a DOS box it doesn't recognise it, I think my system must be a bit screwed somewhere....<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">CanIKickIt(YES_YOU_CAN);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

However, when i tried again, and eventually, with some googling and mixing different make.bat files, mangaged to get DevKitARM to work, the difference was <span style="font-weight: bold">amazing</span>. It compiles <span style="font-weight: bold">much</span> faster code, even though my code was pretty optimised before compilation. It (strangely) takes much less time to compile (about 3-4 seconds rather than 10-15).

Yup that's pretty similar to mine, though I've got arm-elf-g++ for c++ and it's split over two lines. I think that makes it easier when you start to use more than one file as you need to compile then link.

I didn't have the -O2 until you mentioned it, hope that's in the right place, it seems to make a difference though its hard to tell with my emulator so slow generally.

Ah, that's useful as I didn't want to set the bat file up so that it closes when done as I wouldn't see errors.

Does seem to work with me yeah. It may be due to just having the one line in your bat file that messes it up. When I tried putting the -O2 in the first line where the.o file is made, it compiled but when I ran it there was nothing at all apart from the lower half sprite of my character O.o<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">CanIKickIt(YES_YOU_CAN);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
