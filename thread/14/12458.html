While this may work for smaller concepts, a game is build up of many components linked together where tinkering doesn't quite help you to learn in the same way. Think of it like a maths equation the size of a blackboard, because that is pretty much what programming is like. The simple stuff are line long equations, eventually you get into functions and find that you have lines of functions and so on.

In short, what works in the small world does not necessarily scale up to the real world situation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
