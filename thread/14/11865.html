    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Where Can I find a good DevkitPro tutorial? I used to be coding for the Gba and then it fell by the wayside, but I'd like to start up again. I was trying to make the Pernproject tutorials work with DevkitPro, but I didn't know what to chang in the Bat file to make it compile correctly.

Thanks for the help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First try porting your existing GBA build scripts (be they .bat files or makefiles) to devkitARM. Watch these points:
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>The program "gcc" now refers only to native GCC (e.g. MinGW); cross-GCC (e.g. devkitARM) has a prefix. </li><li>As of devkitARM release 19 and later, this prefix is "arm-eabi-". For example, the compiler frontend of devkitARM is arm-eabi-gcc, and the program that turns a .elf file into a .gba file is arm-eabi-objcopy. Older GBA targeted toolchains used "arm-thumb-elf-" or "arm-agb-elf-" or "arm-elf-". </li><li>If you are upgrading from DevKit Advance or earlier, understand that the stage that produces a .elf file (-o something.elf) now needs a "specs" file to specify that you are building a program for a GBA, not a DS or a GP32 or a GP2X or a Pocket PC or a Dreamcast's audio coprocessor. </li></ol><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
