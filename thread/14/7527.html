    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, you will need to recompile and in most cases modify the source code to run as a multiboot. This is because non-multiboot games expect a flashcart to be in the GBA, and willtry to load stuff from one even if it isn't there. Any game that doesn't do this has most likely been compiled as multiboot anyway, unless the author was ignorant of the non-flash card users out there.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
