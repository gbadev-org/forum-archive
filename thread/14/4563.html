    <h4>#30983 - ghostils - Mon Dec 06, 2004 9:20 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi , i've been diddling around with some basic ideas for creating a font system and displaying them.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried creating a bitmap with photoshop that has a few characters in series for a test. Then converting with gfx2gba (1.03) with the following params: gfx2gba font.pcx font.h -8 -w 48
<br/>
<br/>
(as of right now I'm just testing using the standard stdio.h  in a dos box using 1's and_'s to represent the bitmap and discarding pallete info for now.  (just to clarify the code I'm currently working with is not running on a GBA or emu), its running on windows as a test program before it gets ported to gba specifics.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem I'm having is that most of the characters display fine however photoshop doesn't have the same spacing or a fixed size for the characters apparently for some of the fonts and the code will start grabbing bits from the next character inline before it should.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a good solution to creating a font set in photoshop instead of hand spacing the characters out. I use the program regularly but I didn't notice a spacing option.  
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to make an 8x8 px font. I also messed around with a program called imgfont that is supposed to take teh characters out of the bitmap and put them in a raw format that is easy to parse, but it didn't work as intended. 
<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I take it that your font engine is fixed-width? If so, the eaiest thing to do is to put the characters in a vertical row instead of a horizontal row.
<br/>
<br/>
In other words, instead of your graphic looking like this:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">ABCDEFGHIJKL...</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Do it like this, with a carriage return between the characters:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">A
<br/>
B
<br/>
C
<br/>
D
<br/>
E
<br/>
F
<br/>
G
<br/>
H
<br/>
I
<br/>
J
<br/>
K
<br/>
L
<br/>
...</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Photoshop does support fixed width fonts... you just have to use a fixed width font. Try "courier." You'll want to keep your kerning/letter  spacing at 0 and use a pixel-sized font (10px or 12px, not 11.4pts)
