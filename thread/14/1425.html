    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I have been out the scene for a while. So maybe this is a dumb question.
<br/>
<br/>
When I first bought my GBA I also got a 256 flash advance card, that was programmed using the parallel port.
<br/>
<br/>
What I was wondering has this changed now can it programmed by the gba itself??

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you have already managed to multiboot the GBA through your own cable, here is what you have to do:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Write a GBA program and a PC program that talk to each other.
<br/>
2. Figure out the Visoly handshake and the flash chip commands to write to the flash cart.
<br/>
3. On the PC, read the ROM you want to flash and send it to the GBA. On the GBA, receive data from the PC and write it to the flash cart.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
