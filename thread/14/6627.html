    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">let me tell you something..i'm very happy coz' i finally able to use blending for my bg...i was reading the TONC tutorial and realizes that his tutorial is SO hard... but well after a lot of reading and reading again..i finally came to one conclusion..i had to make my own library...and after a lot of work i came out with a little and very basic library for blending...but, hey...it works...
<br/>
<br/>
well now my question...
<br/>
how do i make (if in example, im using bg2 and bg3, bg2 is a white bg whith some black letters bg3 is the same as bg2)...a totally white screen appear first and then JUST the letters from the bg2 shows (fade to black)
<br/>
coz when i use the first kind of blending (the one involving two bg's) the screen start totally black and then the ENTIRE bg2 fades to white...i don't want the ENTIRE bg to fade...just the letters!!!
<br/>
<br/>
so here's some of my solutions!!!
<br/>
<br/>
a)the bg2 and bg3 MUST be the same (same white bg and black letters)
<br/>
<br/>
b)the bg2 is a white bg with black letter and the bg3 is a black bg whith the white letters
<br/>
<br/>
c)the bg2 is white bg with blacks letters and the bg3 is totally white, without letters
<br/>
<br/>
d)the bg2 is white bg with blacks letters and the bg3 is totally black, without letters
<br/>
<br/>
e)im completly wrong and i have to make a different approach to the problem!!
<br/>
<br/>
BTW if you can't understand this maybe i can bring some pics of my bg...
<br/>
<br/>
for second time this is what im triyng to achieve!! 
<br/>
<br/>
the bg2 is an entire  white bg with some black letters at the center...i want this bg goes from white bg and white letters to white bg and black letters...just the letters are changing!!<br/>_________________<br/>All human wisdom is summed up in these two words, - 'Wait and hope"

start off with a black screen and fade to white

From your description, I assume you have used the first approach. You need the second one so your screen starts off saturated and fades to your image. This is used in loads of RPGs splash screens - have a 'lightning flash' that then fades from blinding white to the game logo - I think Riviera was the last game I saw use the technique.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want just fading the letter, you need only one bg.
<br/>
But the tiles you use for letter must have a white bg and the letter draw with the same color of another palette entrie.
<br/>
So after,just change the color of the the letters.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
