    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to make my program scroll in tile mode now that I have stuff working and I was wondering about something.
<br/>
<br/>
The screen tiles, so the vofs and hofs increase and the screen wraps, what happens when the number overflows?  Does it just reset to 0 and look as though nothing happened?
<br/>
<br/>
Or should I just be scrolling one tile over, then redrawing the entire background and reset the offsets back to 0?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can't overflow the scroll registers, because they are write-only which means you can't "add" to them.  You can only write new values.  Any overflowing that occurs will be in your own state variables, which are under your control.
