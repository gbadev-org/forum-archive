    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there anyway to have different size sprites other than multiples of 8?  I will be working on a puzzle game and 16x16 is too big and 8x8 is too small.
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't think there is a way to do this but could using 16x16 and then masking them or using transparency work?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can use transparency to achieve this.  There is no rule where you have to use all the pixels in a 16x16 sprite or any size sprite for that matter.  Just set the pixel value to 0 when you don't care about the pixel.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok cool that's what I was thinking.  Now I could also just use the transparency color with the palette and set the bit to use transparency right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
