    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am attempting to write a simple gba program that uses the keypad to select and play  music and sound effects.   I am interested in using sound channels 1-4 to do this.  I have looked at the belogic site and have managed to produce some very simplistic  programs that start and stop a sound using BUTTON_A and BUTTON_B.
<br/>
In searching the gbadev forum I came across these functions for using channels 1-2 posted by Vortex at the bottom of this thread .

<br/>
What is needed to make these functions play selectable music/sound effect patterns.
<br/>
I have also download and unsuccessfully attempted to change the sg_tone_demo for this purpose . This code was somewhat more confusing to me, as I am new to both GBA and C. 
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for any help</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Second, if you want to make music, you're going to have to write a sequencer that takes a list of notes in order and plays them. Step 1 is to learn about basic music theory and acoustics including "equal temperament" and/or "just intonation" (use Google) in order to convert note names (C#, Eb) to tone generator period values, and then use that to write play_note(). Step 2 is to write interpret_sequence() that calls play_note(), and then make your main program call interpret_sequence().<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
