First question, how much memory do I have please specify in MegaBits or MegaBytes (dont use MB as too many people confuse it)

Second question, if i have a big game that can not fit in the memory of the GBA, is it possible to make a server that runns on the PC and uses the XBOO communicator to act like a server and whatever data the GBA requires, the XBOO communicator sends.

You have 256 kilobytes of external memory. That's 2 megabits, or 0.25 megabytes.

It might be possible, for a custom game, but you'd never get the kind of latency you'd need to approximate ROM waitstates in a normal game not compiled for multiboot.

Xboo Communicator already has that functionality, have a look at the XbooLoad example in cvs.
