    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm fairly new to GBA development, and I'm trying out devkitARM after my experiments with devkitadv a few years ago. I'd like to work my way up to DS tests eventually, but I can't seem to get things compiled to GBA format at the moment. I've tried to compile my own code, as well as the example code included with the installation, but I keep getting strange output when I try to compile. Here's the mess of jargon I get:
