    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering what the best way to show a menu when the user presses the start button in mode 3 without "damaging" the background, I can't redraw the screen because that information is not stored anywhere. I was thinking about using sprites. Does anyone know another way or are sprites the way to do it?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can use one of the background for a menu, i don't really see a problem there (only if you use all bg layers already...), otherwise you would have to use sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
street fighter for example is just using the background that is used for HUD.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

What is HUD?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Modes 3-5 do only have one background.  HUD stands for "heads up display", and refers to the various overlays that many games use, such as radars and health meters.

Sprites could work for your purposes.  You could arrange a 4x3 block of 64x64 16-color sprites and use them as a second frame buffer, or you could arrange sprites in a way that reflects the arrangement of your screen objects (such as having a seperate sprites for each menu selection).
<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, you can rearrange your code so that you can redraw the background at any time.  If you can't redraw the background because the screen isn't stored anywhere, you could store a copy of the screen somewhere (i.e. a backbuffer), or you could store the information that was used to generate the screen in the first place, and regenerate it at will.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
