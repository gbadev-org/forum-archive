    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hmmmm, I think the only real documentation for that are the docs that come with it. Where exactly are you stuck?
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. why are you not starting with GBA development? Half of the tools that made GB colour development so easy have disappeared off of the Internet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I know that the gameboy is obsilite but I am using an emulator that can ONLY use Gameboy and Gameboy Color.  The emulator does not run on the PC but on PalmOS. So I dont have much of a choice...
<br/>
     I need begginning Tutorials on how to use GBDK or help learning how to use it. I allready know how to use C so I understand some of the examples on the net.  I just want to make some basic color games. (No 3D at this time)

You can get far more than a 256 colour background by changing background pallettes during HBlank</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I program for emulators compatible with the NES. Divide that by ten.
<br/>
<br/>
(A sky color, four 3-color background palettes, and four 3-color sprite palettes make 25 colors. Unlike on the GBC and GBA, rewriting the palette on the NES requires turning off the display for a couple scanlines.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
