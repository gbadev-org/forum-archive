    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I bought a MBV2 cable only so I could run the dead pixel fixer on my GBA. I've connected it to the printer port. 
<br/>
<br/>
I run Give IO and type mb to run mutiboot in the same folder. I've got the gilb.mb demo file and type: mb -s gilb -w 500
<br/>
<br/>
the GBA is on but no change and the command line hangs and nothing happens. I have to end the program now to get rid of the dos screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Im on win XP SP2, all I wanna do is run the pixel program. Seems a little to hard to get working. Am I better off buying a usb connection?
<br/>
<br/>
Any help or links to detailed help pages would be great as most of the ones I've seen I dont know what they are on about.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, DJ.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tip #1: You can end some DOS programs by pressing Ctrl+C.
<br/>
<br/>
Tip #2: Major label PCs that came preinstalled with Windows XP are new enough that the manufacturer cared more about USB than the "legacy" ports, and as such, they tend to have substandard parallel ports. A USB cable might work better.
<br/>
<br/>
Tip #3: You can take your multiboot programs on the road with a GBA Movie Player CF.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
