<br/>
<br/>
As good as all the tutorials are i still cant get my head around the most basic of setting up,
<br/>
<br/>
all i want is to display graphics on the bottom screen and text on the top screen, now i can do one or the other but cant seem to do both at the same time, i know it's simeple, maybe im trying to hard and just missing the point
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
