    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1024 in 256colors.
<br/>
2048 in 16colors.
<br/>
<br/>
Notes:
<br/>
-For every map you use, you lose 32tiles in 256colors, 64 in 16colors.
<br/>
-A map can't access more than 1024tiles (unless some hardware tricks).
<br/>
-You can have has many tiles as you'd like (given it fits inside a 8megs cartridge), What's important is how many tiles are loaded at any given moment. You can just load dynamicly the one you need.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
That depends on the mode you are using.  Using scale/rotate bgs you can only use one palette of 256 colors.  Regular text bgs can use 256 color or sixteen palettes of 16 colors.
