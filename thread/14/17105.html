<br/>
<br/>
If you haven't ever done any programming, budget about 2-4 years of intense learning and practice before you could consider STARTING a game of the scope of MegaMAN Zero.  (is that what you meant?)
<br/>
<br/>
This isn't something anyone can easily teach you.  You have to start very small (pong, like Azenris suggested, and do it on the PC, not the GBA or DS), and work up to it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Before you can fly, you need to learn how to  - what?  Walk is too advanced a metaphor for where you are starting.  Perhaps breathe?
<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, make pong, then make asteroids, then make tic tac toe.  Then, you will at least know which questions to begin to think about asking.  Good luck on your journey.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This person seems to be a total fanboy who's trying to get in over his head and go off the high dive while he hasn't learned how to swim yet, to go with Miked0801's metaphor joke.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
