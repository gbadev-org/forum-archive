First off, can someone point me to some good and complete documentation of libnds (like a command reference or something) and libfat (same here).
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to make a dual-slot file browser.  So far I've gotten a simple text app to load from both slots simultaneously, displaying the contents of SLOT-1 on the top screen and the contents of SLOT-2 on the bottom, but it can't do much else.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm now trying to work on a GUI that I can browse files in.  I'm using PAlib because sprites and backgrounds are easy.  I'm still using libfat.  I got it to read files and folder names off the card, and display either a folder icon or a file icon, but I have a few problems:
<br/>
<br/>
A: I don't know of a pixel positioned text command in PAlib that works.  All the text functions rely on tiles, and when trying to match tiled text against pixel positioned sprites, the result isn't good.
<br/>
<br/>
B: Check my post in the DS Development forum for details, I'm having compile troubles with an array and difference in types.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
