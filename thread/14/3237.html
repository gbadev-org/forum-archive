    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not quite sure about the legalness of developing using unofficial developing software to compile code etc. Could anyone who knows for sure whether it's legal or not (assuming I don't rip stuff from existing Nintendo or liscensed 3rd party games etc.). Also, do you have to be liscensed by Nintendo if you made games worth selling (though this is very unlikely to be a situation I get into anyway). Action Replay seems to get away with it, but then that isn't actually a game. Please could someone explain to me? Similar topics have been posted, I know, but I still don't quite understand. I would probably only distribute the game amongst friends for free anyway, or on the internet as a free downloadable ROM, but again I'm not sure how legal this is. Also, is it true that emulators eg. Visual Boy Advance or whatever are only illegal if you play ROMs of commercial games?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if you're interested in emulation history, including legal precedents, I'd suggest reading the emufaq, written by Sam Pettus. It should be the first item in an "emufaq" google search. Wait, don't try it now, I've done it for you <a class="postlink" href="http://overclocked.org/emufaq" target="_blank">http://overclocked.org/emufaq</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
If I remember correctly, this document concluded that:
<br/>
<br/>
1) emulation is legal
<br/>
2) emulators are legal
<br/>
3) Downloading commercial ROMs is illegal (even if you own the game).
<br/>
4) Selling or giving away ROM backup units is illegal.
<br/>
5) The only truly legal way to use ROMs is if you backup the ROMs yourself from a backup unit that you made yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
And as far as legality of developing for the Gameboy Advance:
<br/>
If you're just planning to develop software for yourself, it is definitely legal.
<br/>
If you're planning to sell software... I can think of two legal precedents, but there are probably more: Nintendo v. Color Dreams and Sega v. Accolade.[/list]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
emulation of a nintende-gba-rom is illegal, even if you own the original cartrigde, that rule is based upon a rumour, spread by everyone to make emulation (of nintendo-gba-roms) acceptable.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Please correct me if i'm wrong then but is the general idea that:
<br/>
<br/>
-Homebrew amateur games developed with unofficial software OK, at least non-commercially.
<br/>
-Playing non-commercial homebrew games on emulators also OK (assuming the creators permission to do so, I seem to remember reading somewhere...)
<br/>
-Playing ROMs of commercial games on emulator illegal
<br/>
<br/>
is that right?

One question I have to ask. I'm thinking about applying to DigiPen Institute of Technology in a few years. Since they are directly associated with Nintendo, would it be a good idea to say that I have done some GBA programming(legally and unofficially) and put that on my application? Because I don't know if it will help me or seriously hurt me.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But tepples makes a good point not to appear fixed or single-minded in your ways. Make it clear that you are there to learn.

<br/>
to produce a commercial game you <span style="font-weight: bold">MUST</span> be a Nintendo officially lisenced developer.  This goes bad to the older 'vintage' gaming days, with machines like the Commodore 64 where anyone could develop and there was so much utter crap released thatit started to effect sales of the actual console.  From the beginning of Nintendos console days (with the Famicom) licencing was required, in fact for a long time, only Nintendo could develop and release games for the Famicom (later the NES in the US &amp; Europe).  This was to control the games on the consoles, so no crap would be released.  Due to the shear popularity of the Famicom, Nintendo then had to releant and grant licences to other game developers (amoungst the first were Hudson - of Bomberman fame, and Namco - we should all know Namco!)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this licencing is now depicted by the 'Nintendo Official Seal Of Quality" - a little gold oval symbol on PAL stuff (not so sure about NTSC mind)
<br/>
<br/>
Apperently if you do get a licence from the big N to develop and released a commercial game (very difficult) the prices they charge to manufacture the games is so much you struggle to break even unless you sell a crap load of games (like 1,500,000 copies plus!)

Tell that to American Video Entertainment and Codemasters, whose NES compatible software products resisted lawsuits from Nintendo, and to Color Dreams, who never got sued in the first place. See also <span style="font-style: italic">Sega v. Accolade</span>, 977 F2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1992); you can read the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.eff.org/Legal/Cases/sega_v_accolade_977f2d1510_decision.html" target="_blank">opinion</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
