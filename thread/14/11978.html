    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so i'm fairly decent when it comes to animating... I'm wanting to make gun/sword fight animation for the ds and i want it to play on the DS both in horizontal (book) mode and vertical (normal) mode like... certian scenes require you to turn the DS... even have two different prospectives of the same scene at certian points......... anyways...
<br/>
... the thing is how can i get a .avi or .swf or anything to play on 1 file on both screens..... thanks for the help, sorry if this sounds too noobish to answer i did look but couldn't seem to find anything on this particular subject..... I did however realize if i dissected a rom and looked through the source i could probrally just copy the source of an cutscene and place my file into there... 
<br/>
any suggestions on how to get this animation to run would be greatly appreciated
<br/>
PS: i have not started the animation yet, when i do finish or at least get a decent amount done i'll be sure to post it.
<br/>
thanks for reading this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If the SWF isn't just an FLV, you could recreate the SWF using the 3D engine and half the VRAM, and then display it using the capture trick. As for AVI across both screens, homebrew can't do that yet because we're still using "generic" codecs that haven't been heavily rewritten for the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Shall I assume the answer is those things?
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't say such a design was unfathomable. I still see it being mostly limited to esoteric things like minigame collections, as I understand those games are.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so how would i go about  using the 3d engine and halving the VRAM.... and what is the capture trick? i'll try google tomorrow on these suggestions.... i can save the animation (once finished) as basically any file type as I like.. you suggest .swf so that is most likely what i'll use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well i've been on vaction.... but i'm back and kinda got started on this... i got the screen dimensions (including a 96px padding) and i made a few concept images......
<br/>
but i'm not going to get into the animating untill i actually know how to get it to run..... still looking for an answer....
<br/>
i just want to get 1 video to play on both screens... and if that's not possible then 2 different videos to play at once... one on each screen... anyways if you have moonshell then you can check out what i mean.... just put this picture on your flash cart....
<br/>
<br/>
