<br/>
<br/>
I am restoring some GBA motherboards and I need to get the schematics because I need to buy new components that are not working anymore and It would be very helpful if I could know the specifications of each component.
<br/>
<br/>
If anybody can tell me where to get the schematics it would be appreciated, I got several AGB-CPU-10 and AGB-CPU-02 boards.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
