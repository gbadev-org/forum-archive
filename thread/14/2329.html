    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've looked around, and read a few FAQs, but still can't quite seem to get the info I want so here are some questions.
<br/>
<br/>
i would like to dabble a bit in GBA Development, maybe write some test patterns and some sprite demos in Assembly and then show my friends to gross them out.  No big Whoop.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so there is the MBV2 cable, which seems like a pretty good choice because there is a comms mode so you can send debug info back to the PC, also if i am not mistaken you should be able to send data to a running GBA program through the samesaid interface.  correct?  did I read the FAQ wrong?
<br/>
<br/>
That should be ok, but I would also like to be able to program a Flash cartridge so I can just bring my goo to work and show them without setting up something on a PC at work.
<br/>
<br/>
In this FAQ

<br/>
<br/>
It says "  Only Flash Advance, Flash Advance Turbo, and official Nintendo flash carts. EZF Advance, Flash2Advance, and game carts that you buy at your local game store are not supported."
<br/>
<br/>
So, which ones where those?

<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">With the MBV2 cable</span>
<br/>
Some people have reported successes programming F2A 256 Mbit carts (but not the smaller carts) with the MBV2 cable.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">With the F2A linker</span>
<br/>
If you buy an F2A cart, it'll usually come bundled with a linker similar to MBV2 except that it plugs into USB. The most recent F2A host program can transfer any .mb program to the GBA as well; you may not even need the MBV2 cable at all.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
