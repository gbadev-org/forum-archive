<br/>
i?m new to gba developement.
<br/>
i downloaded the HAM and a working c example of "brickout". for getting started i tried to just compile the textfile: i added the headers to the project, added the main prog to the project and compiled it... no errors at all. but when i trie to run it on the emulator it always hangs itselfe...
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for helping!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When you say "hangs itself", does the program just stop responding, or does the screen go blank, or what? Does the program run for a little while then stop, or does it never really start?
<br/>
<br/>
Did you write the code yourself, or are you trying to compile someone else's project?
<br/>
<br/>
In general, start simple. Try commenting out large blocks of code to get something minimally working, then add back in functionality until you figure out where the problem lies.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sure, i wanted to start simple. but bevore getting started with my code, i wanted the compiler to be surely running.
<br/>
visual boy advance starts, but the programm does not, indeed, i have to quit the visualboy via taskmanager, cause otherwhise it?s unquitable.
<br/>
<br/>
the code from an open source rom. the rom itself is running, so i thought, trying to compile the source files on my own would show if the compiler works.

thanks for your quick response!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
