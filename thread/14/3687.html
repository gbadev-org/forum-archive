    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I was just wondering. I have a few large image arrats. Rather than #include them, i compiled them as .o files, and was goin to link them in at the end, to save compile time, which currently takes ages. How do i link them in with the final code file that draws these images to the screen. Every time i try it i get errors because the main file complains that the images havent been declared yet etc....
<br/>
Thanks guys
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Create a .h file that declares references to your external data, eg.
<br/>
<br/>
extern const u16 mySpriteData[];
<br/>
<br/>
Essentially just take the declaration lines for your data objects from their respective .c files, add an "extern" at the beginning and a semicolon at the end.
<br/>
<br/>
Then #include this header file in any C program that needs to access your linked data.
<br/>
<br/>
(You can, obviously, break this into multiple header files if you prefer to have one for each sprite, for example.)
