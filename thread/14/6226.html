    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i have a basic understanding on gba development and i have made a good solid rom. It is basically a sprite that can only move around a given area, the boundary. It also uses a background and the user input, the user controlls the ball.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically i want to learn how to save. I want to save a value to a battery file and i want to recall it.
<br/>
<br/>
That is all i want to do for now and i will build on that and learn later. If anyone has any code they could paste or any links that they could paste, I would greatly appreciate. Or even better, if ther is a tutorial on saving, that would be a great help. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!!!<br/>_________________<br/>#solarwind</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Head towards <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=6777#6777" target="_blank">tepples' GBA Dev FAQ</a>, he's got a routine and info in there that'll be of great use to you!
<br/>
<br/>
For my game, all the save data is placed into a large struct, which is then copied bytewise into the 0xE000000 area by a variation on tepples'/sgeos bytecpy() function. For loading, an empty struct is created and is filled with it's SRAM counterpart by the bytecpy().
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you only access the SRAM with variables of u8 size!<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
