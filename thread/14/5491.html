    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I remember when I didn't understand how video games were made. What I did when I didn't understand something was look it up in a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">search engine</a>. I usually found my answers if I knew what to search for. The best idea is to read more than you ask, I know for a fact that I used to spend more time pondering what question I should ask instead of finding the actual answer myself.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are the answers to your specific questions you asked:
<br/>
<ol type="1">
<br/>
<li>Tutorials can be found using a search engine. There are simply too many aspects of programming and game creation to be covered in a single tutorial.)
<br/>
</li><li>The programming language 'C', which is like words (code), is sent through a program called a compiler and then is translated into a binary file. To give you an example of how programming and games relate: In a game an enemy spots you, how does that work? Well you can do it something like this: if the enemy is 5 squares away from the player then they can see him and will start to move closer to him and then attack him if he is within 1 square otherwise he won't do anything. 
<br/>
</li><li>Role-playing games are not in the least bit simple. It is best to start out by creating a Tetris or Breakout clone.
<br/>
</li></ol>
<br/>
There are many resources available on the net. Here is one you should look at: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamedev.net/reference/start_here/" target="_blank">http://www.gamedev.net/reference/start_here/</a> Also on that same website there is a wonderful programming specific community that you can join and they would be able to point you in the right direction, far more helpful than a GBA/DS development message board like this one.

<br/>
<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com" target="_blank">http://www.gamasutra.com</a> is pretty good
<br/>
<br/>
I agree that RPGs are definitely not simple even in a simple RPG.. try a snake clone in a DOS terminal .. should be pretty easy to set up..<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
