It may be slightly easier to use, but as far as I know, it's rather out of date.  And it's not all <span style="font-weight: bold">that</span> much easier to use.  Your best bet is to learn how the stuff actually works, and use devkitArm like most everyone else.
<br/>
<br/>
But like those two posts above will tell you:  if you don't know how to code reasonably well in C or C++, go away and learn on your PC for awhile, then come back when you do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Read TONC. The best GBA programming tutorial one could ask for.

Well... if by "easiest to use" you mean HIGHLY inefficient code, but that is a bit like the OpenGL drivers (glLoadBitmap, or whatever), then yeah, it is the most.. um... familiar one. But if you want to have efficient code and learn good programming ethics, read TONC. Saves you a lot of headaches later on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Your code only needs to be efficient enough.  Often times programmer efficiency is more important that processor efficiency.

What I was referring to was how slow HAM was. For example, in one of the examples, they had a function like this:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">u8 ix, iy;
<br/>
for(ix=0;ix&lt;240;ix++) {
<br/>
 for(iy=0;iy&lt;160;iy++) ham_plotm4(ix, iy, 0);
<br/>
}</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
And supposedly, that code was faster than HAM's code for filling. There are at least 4 optimizations I see there (using int's instead of u8's, making ix=240, then use a while(ix--), same with iy, and plotting using the registers). These are just minor issues but still worth considering. Probably the worst part of HAM is how it handles V-Blank. It installs an interrupt, but instead of using "swi 5", it uses a code similar to this (since it doesn't acknowledge the BIOS interrupt flags):
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">bool vblank = false;
<br/>
<br/>
void main(void) {
<br/>
 ham_installInterrupt(vbl, VBL_INTR);
<br/>
 
<br/>
 while(1) {
<br/>
  while(!vblank);
<br/>
  //code
<br/>
  vblank = false;
<br/>
 }
<br/>
}
<br/>
<br/>
void vbl(void) {
<br/>
 vblank = true;
<br/>
}</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

This is a very considerate way of thinking.  I'm sure there are plenty of commercial shops out there who could care less about battery life when they are trying to get something out the door.
<br/>
<br/>
My point is that, sometimes things just need to work.  There are probably better ways to go about any given task, but there are other things to do too.  My two favorite quotes from Knuth are "premature optimization is the root of all evil", and "you can rewrite forever if you want to" (actually, he quoted someone else on the second one, but my copy of AOCP was lost in a flood).
<br/>
<br/>
As far as optimizations go, often times just writing code that works, without worrying about what will be faster, actually makes things easier for the compiler to optimize your code.  For this very reason, ints should be used instead of u8 because there is no reason to use u8.  (If two bytes push you over the limit, you have more important things to worry about. )
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to make really nice programs, you probably want to write your own custom libs.  The cost performance (in time) is too high for someone who just wants to get their feet wet.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another benefit of optimization is that it makes programs more responsive if your PC is old. If your program drains the battery less, then it will generally run faster in emulation on slow PCs, and vice versa. You'll need less frameskip to keep the audio going smoothly. But then my perspective is colored by using a 7.5 year old PC with an 0.86 GHz Pentium III CPU as my primary PC.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

For what it's worth, not using the appropriate battery saving functions *will* result in a commercial GBA or NDS game failing lot check &amp; never getting out the door.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

would hope it was right, but I doubt much less people would buy, let's say the latest final fantasy tactics, if they were not taking care of the battery... for customers it's more like an added feature if the game is good...
<br/>
<br/>
that said I'm quite surprised that the moto about "premature optimization"  and "root of all evil" wasn't mentioned yet :)
<br/>
but in my mind, using interupt to catch Vblank is not a better way to do it, nor an optimisation, it is the <span style="text-decoration: underline">only</span> way to do it...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Then I wonder why <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/tod/" target="_blank">TOD</a>, which uses a mode 7* projection similar to that of Mario Kart, uses significantly less battery than most cinema scenes and microgames of WarioWare Inc.: Mega Microgame$, which are 2D. My tests on NO$GBA, VisualBoyAdvance, and GBA hardware bear this out. I guess lot check for third-party games must be stricter than lot check for Nintendo's own games.
