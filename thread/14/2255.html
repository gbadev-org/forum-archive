    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't have any books to suggest (at least, any books I own are all dreadfully out of date - I've got my 1991 copy of Learn C on the Macintosh by Dave Mark on my shelf), but I will suggest that if you want to program for the GBA you might consider picking up a book on C, instead of just C++.
<br/>
<br/>
This is because I find that books on C++ focus more on learning the object-oriented elements of the language, rather than on learning the lower-level stuff that is important to understand GBA programming.
<br/>
<br/>
Your mileage may vary, of course; perhaps someone here can recommend a book that effectively teaches both. It also depends on what your intent is; if you want to work on your general programming skills then a book on C++ is just as good as a book on any other language.

It's just so hard to find good programming books that I can teach myself from.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
