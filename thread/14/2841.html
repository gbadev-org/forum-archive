Try the <a href="http://www.ngine.de" target="_blank">www.ngine.de</a> forums. And do not talk to them like you talked to us. You will get little if any help that way.

Anyway, back on topic: I know of two main ways to put a file in a ROM, either by converting it to an assembly language source code file (the "bin2s" method), or by including it in an archive appended to the ROM (the "GBFS" method).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could write something to convert the text file to a use-able format.  A use-able format is probably a bunch of const strings:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">const char q1[]   = "What color do you see?";
<br/>
const char a1_a[] = "Red"
<br/>
const char a1_b[] = "Yellow"
<br/>
const char a1_c[] = "Green"
<br/>
const char a1_d[] = "Blue"</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

NOTE: The variable names are pathetic and reflect zero effort.
