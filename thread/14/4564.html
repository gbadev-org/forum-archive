    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When I try to compile with this, it gives me the error "gcc: installation problem, cannot exec 'as': no such file or directory"
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using Windows, and my bat file is as follows:
<br/>
PATH=C:\GBAC\devkitadv\Bin\
<br/>
gcc -o C:\GBAC\test\test.elf C:\GBAC\test\test.cpp
<br/>
objcopy -O binary C:\GBAC\test\test.elf C:\GBAC\test\test.bin
<br/>
<br/>
What am I doing wrong?<br/>_________________<br/>...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's nothing wrong with the batch file, it must be your installation. Did you download all the packages? My best guess would be that you didn't get all the files; you're running a half assed install! Besides, "as.exe" is the assembler compiler thingy, so I don't know why it's complaining about that.
<br/>
<br/>
No doubt someone much wiser than I will reply below and give you the full details!

GCC generates assembly language code and then passes it on to your machine's assembler. At the time GCC was written, some architectures didn't have support in the GNU assembler, so GCC used the vendor's assembler. Nowadays, many distributions of GCC (such as DJGPP, MinGW, Cygwin, devkitARM, and all Linux distros) come with as.exe and the rest of GNU Binutils.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
