    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The subject really says it all, but to elaborate - I've found a lot of gba demos which use a bit of inline assembly and I'd like to be able to (at some level) be able to read/comprehend what is being done and why assembly is used in those instances.
<br/>
<br/>
So where to start? recomended reading? online tutorials? especially in regard to gba.
