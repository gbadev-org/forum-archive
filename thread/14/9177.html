    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I assume you mean "OAM".  You do not store animation frames in OAM, though -- you store them in sprite VRAM.  Also, sprite VRAM does not point to files -- it contains whole sprite frames.  You can overwrite any part of sprite VRAM at any time and that is one way to do animation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It sounds like you're either (1) setting the pallete wrong, or (2) not pointing to the right area of VRAM.
<br/>
<br/>
Remember that in the bitmap modes, you can only use VRAM that starts with 512, so check for that. (that would be modes 3,4,and 5)
<br/>
<br/>
Also remember that if you're re-writing VRAM every frame, you do not have to change the pointer in the sprite itself, it will simply be "drawn" that frame with the updated data. (aka, your "animation" only needs to be touching VRAM.)<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

There's your problem. You need to copy to 0x06014000, as modes 3 through 5 reserve 0x06010000 through 0x06013FFF for the end of the frame buffer. Here's a macro that calculates the correct destination address in sprite cel VRAM for a given tile index:

<br/>
Another thing: I think your animation code would be a lot more manageable if you would make a separate function loadCel() that loads a sprite cel into VRAM.
<br/>
<br/>

This here is a problem, regardless of mode. Sprite attribute 2 is a number representing tiles, starting at memory address 0x06010000. If you tell it 512, you're telling it to look 512 tiles <span style="font-style: italic">past</span> that. You need to copy your sprite to tile 512, not tile 0. Otherwise, change to a different mode (few games actually use modes 3-5, so learn tiles and deal with it) and use the sprite at location 0.
<br/>
<br/>
Try this: Go into VBA and look in the tile viewer. Click on 0x06010000 at the left. Notice that the tiles for your sprite appear at the top? (you may have to change to 256 to see them properly.) 
<br/>
<br/>
Now notice this: The top half of this window <span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span> I repeat <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">cannot</span></span> be used in mode 4. Thus, you must use the bottom half. You already have your sprite pointing to the bottom half, you just have to get the data there to. With the sprite pointing to all of that non-data, there's your black box.

This version of CopyOAM is just over 5.6 times faster by using struct copies instead of u16 copies. The fact that the loopcount is much lower saves a factor 4, the rest is of the speed is due to special ARM instructions that can copy blocks of words in one go, which is usually used for struct copies.

Well, let's take a few examples at random.
<br/>
<br/>
The tutorial uses a toolchain that was a couple of years out of date even when the page was put together.

It uses .bat files to build projects. These are evil and should be avoided.

This looks perfectly innocuous at first glance however it is rather easily broken and can introduce all sorts of odd side effects in your code. Take a case where you might want to build a GBA palette entry from an average of other values.

As Cearn already explained, this macro is just broken. It will only work if you happen to hit line 160 of the display when you decide to wait. This is quite rare.

I could go on much further but there are so many things wrong with that particular tutorial I'd be typing this over several days. Suffice to say it should be avoided.

One of the unfortunate things about GBA development is that all the crap tutorials with dodgy code and poor practises are "easy to understand". In order to program this little beast effectively you need to put some work into learning the proper way to do things.

<br/>
Using a batch file to automate your build process generally means you will have to recompile every single unit of your program (.c files), as well as any art and other assets, every time you run the script.
<br/>
<br/>
Makefiles use the timestamp on the files to enable you to rebuild only the sections of the project that have changed since the last time you built. They can also track the dependencies of your files, so if you change a header file only the C files that #include it will be rebuilt.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a timesaver on small projects. On big projects, it's a lifesaver.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus, makefiles are designed for precisely the purpose you're attempting to accomplish with batch files. There are all sorts of features they possess that can be used to make your build process more efficient.
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing about makefiles is that they can be tricky to learn. But there's plenty of good documentation and tutorials out there (many linked to from this site). If you ever intend to do any industry-level programming - games or otherwise - you'll have to learn to deal with them sooner or later.

The problem isn't #including .h files, the problem is what's in the .h files.

In that case, recompiling everything (for example, gcc *.c -lthis -lthat -o game.elf) might be significantly faster than recompiling two or three files that have changed. This is the situation in the Java programming language, and I'm considering using the JDK to develop data conversion tools.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

gcc has been able to use pre-compiled headers for some time.

I don't just copy and paste code! I read some of your tutorial and thought it was confussing, thats all. Also, I think that I got a lot out of it for being 12 years old! most kids my age would be baflled (sp?) after reading the first line of anything related to GBA deving even the GBA CRASH course!
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry 'bout that, but I had to get it out. also after spending a little more time on your tutorial Cearn I realize that it's the best out there, maybe even better than the PERN project.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well you have to admit that your original did have a good deal of simularities with the crash course. It's still good advice, though: critical thinking is a Good Thing in any field. And if you're twelve I'd have to agree that, if you understand our points mentioned here, you're doing pretty well. I imagine most teens would run away screaming at what you're attempting here. Well, maybe not, but it might not be far off.

I know it's a little on the technical side and mostly aimed at people who have had at least some formal training in both math and programming. Just take your time, you'll be fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It was HTML but still.......I think that I do pretty well....the only problem with being young is my lack of money for some good hardware and my shorter attention span hehe.........Everything in GBA programing takes so long, but I'll hopefully get a playable Demo out this month......we'll just have to wait and see...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The nice thing is that, as long as you have a windows computer with internet access, you can do a lot in the way of gba programming.  Sure, proper hardware to test (and see your game on hardware, which is fun) can be expensive, but this is one area where you can do a lot with free tools and emulators....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Until you run into people such as Michel Iwaniec ("Bananmos" in the NES scene) who seem to think that a program tested only on multiple emulators isn't good enough to release to the public in any form and who have threatened assault and battery against those who do.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
