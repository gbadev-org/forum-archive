<br/>
<br/>
i have just added Collission Detection to my Programm. It is not open Source at this Moment, because I have to clean up the Code. I have no Idea how it works on Hardware, so perhaps someone is able to fix the header (and perhaps tell me how :p) and try it on Hardware.

<br/>
<br/>
The next thing I am going to fix is the time, that is needed to start (several seconds), and add a Text System.
<br/>
<br/>
Comments?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The collision detection is a little the moment, as the character stops even when there is nothing to collide with... I think this could be due to the boundary boxes around the sprite.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't had a chance to try it on hardware, but you can get the header tools from gbadev. 
<br/>
<br/>
I also notice that it takes it's time to load up, I believe this is because you are calculating the sin and cos values in real time.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are using gbajunkies files for the bg, then you may want to use precalculated tables instead. Go to my webpage and try them if you want to...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, thx! I wust just to lazy, to change the sin and cos stuff by myselfe :).
<br/>
The Collision ist a little bit buggie, because i am a using 16x32 for the Sprite size, but the charakter has only 16x24 pixels. There is a black line drawn, which represents the end of the Sprite.
<br/>
The only real bug, is, when you walk up and collide with the small wall (there is only one small wall :)). Sometimes you wont be able to go left or right.
<br/>
<br/>
The Problem is, that it is a realy unflexible Engine at this time (for example the 16x32//16x24 problem). But i think, that I will fix it within the next few days.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thx 4 your comment and the sin and cos file :). It will save me some work :p.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If you can make the collision boundary box to the size of the sprite, so the engine is checking the collision between the size of the box rather then the sprite.
<br/>
<br/>
This should fix most of the bugs, if you could share the source then that be great...<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It will go open source, if I have fixed the source, because if I would release it now, there is too much "dead-code" in it. 
<br/>
<br/>
I havnt made the collision detection with bounding boxes.
<br/>
<br/>
I read the coordinates from all the walls by myself (with MS-Paint.. it took nearly 10 Minutes *g*). So I have just 4 lines of code for the colision Detection (I think it should save some speed). I will write a map editor, so that I can create these lines of code autmoaticaly, but that is not my primary target atm (perhaps in only delphi, who knows (dont flame me, i hate delphi (normaly))).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
