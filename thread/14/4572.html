    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all.  I am not sure if this question should go in this part of the forum or not, but none of the other ones seem to fit the question any better than this one.  Anyway, here it goes.  I am trying to build an ARM assembler for Mac OS X because I cannot find one online.  I looked at the docs on gbadev.org and didn't find anything that told the exact file contents, byte by byte, of a gba rom.  Is there such a doc on this website?  I also looked online at other gba dev websites, and none of them seem to have one.  If no such doc exists, then would it be possible to get the source to the Goldroad ARM Assembler?  I tried contacting the maker, but the email wouldn't go through.

Wow, lots of questions!  Thank you in advance for any help you give me.

There is an ARM assembler included with any Binutils that targets ARM. A "devkit" pack will include GCC and Binutils and thus an assembler.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
