    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all, I'm relatively newbie in gba programming and I'd like to know your opinion on what's the best tutorial for learning gba programming. I've already read the FAQ, but i wan't to know general opinion. I would like to start with devkitadv running under wxp or linux, the OS doesn't mind.

The tutorials are also quite good, though, especially if you're not a stickler for spelling and language. Again :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To me, i though gbajunkie's tutorials were very good. All of the tutorials are available for download in .pdf form w/source too. Everything is clear for an absolute newbie to understand. 
<br/>
<br/>
Site: <a href="http://www.gbajunkie.co.uk/" target="_blank">www.gbajunkie.co.uk/</a> (also easy to remember)
<br/>
<br/>
The Pern Project tutorials aren't as in depth. Don't get me wrong, they are GOOD, however, the online tuts only give you snippets of code and might not use it (Day 4, alpha blending). Good site if you think you have some skill, sometimes its better to learn stuff the hard way, it sticks in your head better.
<br/>
<br/>
One last thing, if you ever run into a problem, always search for previous topics before creating a new one (some people get really annoyed when the same question like this is asked 3 times in 3 different ways). 
<br/>
<br/>
Heck, now that i think about it, maybe I SHOULD write a tutorial!<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you're getting a problem that it just opens and closes, then look in "The basics" section of the FAQ.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>

<br/>
Programming The Nintendo Game Boy Advance: The Unofficial Guide
<br/>
by Jonathan S. Harbour
<br/>
<br/>
It was supposed to be published, but due to legal problems with Nintendo, he can't.  So he made it available for FREE online.  He uses HAM, not devkit, however.  It's been HUGELY helpful to me.  You can download the first 7 chapters (the rest are coming soon), and you can also order the CD-ROM with source, etc. (which I plan to do to thank him for putting the book up for download for free).

In fairness it should be noted that while he uses HAM's toolchain and VHAM as his editor all the code outside of the very first 'hello world' program is done without hamLib and the ham includes.

Its just straight C. :)
