    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My MBV2 just came in today, which Flash Cart should I get?
<br/>
<br/>
I know in the MBV2 Faq they say you can use FLash Advance or Official Nintendo Carts.... However when I look on like linker4u or other sites they show Flash 2 Advance carts and EZ etc etc... are the Flash 2 Advance carts the same thing as the Flash Advance carts that are being referred to in the MBV2 Faq? (My guess is yes, but I wanna be sure before I plink down my $$$ and get the wrong thing) =)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A particular piece of flash writing software has to support both the ASIC and the flash chip. MBV2 supports the Visoly Flash Advance ASIC and the Visoly Flash Advance flash chip.
<br/>
<br/>
F2A uses the same ASIC (which is why PogoShell still works) but uses a different brand of flash chip. EZ, EZFA, and X-Rom use a different ASIC. EFA uses a different cable entirely.
<br/>
<br/>
But you still don't need a flash card to run multiboot programs.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the info Tepples on the F2A carts.. I know I don't need a cart to run MB programs (I've been running them with my ghetto Xboo for a while now), but I need one for the final version of my particular application for my remote carputer mp3 console controller. (no pun intented).  And the MBV2 was cheaper and more versitile than the USB linkers for like 120$ or what ever they charge.

Thanks,
