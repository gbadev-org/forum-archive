    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I used to do GBA coding quite a bit a few years back and have recently decided to try and get back into it. I have dug all my old kit out and have tried uploading a few of my old roms onto my flash cart using Little Writer. If I only upload one rom to the cart then it all works fine. However, if I try and upload several as a multi-rom then the cart will not long boot and the nintendo logo on the start up screen is all corrupt.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone help?
<br/>
<br/>
For the record I am using LittleWrite 1.0.8.3 and my equipment is an old parellel cable, a flash linker &amp; a flash advance card Xtreme</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
