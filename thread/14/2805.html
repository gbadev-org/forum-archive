    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, this is quite a basic question I'm sure, however looking through the tutorials over and over I cannot get this problem solved. Whenever I try to compile a program off of the make.bat program it simply doesn't work, the error I get is along the lines of "GCC is not regognized as an internal or external command" and from looking at a post on this forum I'm supposed to do as follows  - "To do this, type the following into a command prompt: set Path=C:\devkitadv\bin;%Path% "  However whenever I put this in the command prompt it doesn't seem to do anything for me. (All the files are in fact in the same folder, all installed and bin is right off devkitadv as it should be). I'm not exactly sure what else to do since this command obviously isn't working for me, or perhaps there is something I'm missing, I really don't know. Right now I'm running off of Windows 2000 and any help any can give me would be very appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
