    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it possible to port GBA games to Pocket PC? 
<br/>
<br/>
I don't mean playing them on an emulator on Pocket PC (like MorphGear), but actually converting them for use on that platform as if they were native PPC games.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone point me to resources on the subject if they exist?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can port just about anything if the hardware is sufficiently advanced, and you have access to the source code and assets like graphics and sound... since the PocketPC is apparently capable of emulating the GBA (which usually requires something like a factor-10 speed increase) you should be able to port most software to it as well.
<br/>
<br/>
The hard part is getting the original source from which to port, though.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you wanted to port an open-source GBA game to Pocket PC, you might start by emulating the GBA graphics hardware and tone generators, as the CPU and PCM audio are reportedly similar between platforms. Then translate interrupts and timers to their Windows CE equivalents. For best results, contribute a pair of patches back to the maintainer that 1. abstract the hardware specific stuff into a GBA front-end separated from the business logic and asset database, and 2. add a Pocket PC front-end.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
