HAM offers HAMlib which has less of a learning curve, but it is very limited in scope and can only be used to a point before you'll have to cast it aside and learn how to do things on your own anyway.

It could be argued that after using HAMlib you are ready to take the next step into coding your own Shadow OAM routines and whatnot.  At the very least you can jump in and get your feet wet very very quickly.
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, HAM is more than just HAMlib.  You can not use HAMlib at all and still be an avid HAM user.  Its more of a Click-To-Install GBA development Environment that provides one with a ready-made toolchain, a very extensive GBA header file, HAMlib if wanted, and a whole host of demo programs and various utilities.
<br/>
<br/>
The only downside to that route with HAM is that it is currently still using DevKitAdvance as it's toolchain.  But with HAM 3.0 coming out it is being switched over to  DevKitArm which will be much better.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't overlook HAM.  I know you are the uberleet gba coder poslundc and your ray-casting mode7 demo with crono is truly impressive but I wouldn't just dismiss it out of hand because of a general purpose library that comes with it. :)

I wasn't getting personal.  Your Crono demo is fantastic!  I was just trying to say that someone with your skills might see things differently than one starting out.

I really respect your work, you don't see any really cool things like that on my end of the table for all to see ;)

Your opinion on HAM is just as valid as mine. Your post seems to be preemptively defensive of your right to have one. Relax.

Moral: As long as we make sure to clarify what part of HAM we're talking about, such as "VisualHAM" (the editor) and "HAMlib" (the library), then we can actually make sense when discussing it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
As far as which way to start, It all comes down to how you like to program.  Plus if you don't like doing it one way,  you can always just try out the other way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just don't call the ham_init() function, and the logo won't appear.  I don't even use any of HAM's header files.  I use HAM as you would use DevkitARM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
