    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not nearly as many as you would think.  My opinion is that there are some really bright people out there (and here) doing a bunch of reverse-engineering for most of the stuff.  The methods for getting stuff done here are very divergent from the Nintendo way - but just as efficient in almost all cases.  Also, if Nintendo ever found out about a leak, that person would be begging for mercy.  Nintendo has an iron fist and likes to use it.  Just look at the cease and desist in the news section. I'm not at all suprised.  ALso, they jsut got a patent giving them rights to all emulators.  It won't stand in courts very long, but it goes to show their mentality.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've heard that the docs are pretty cryptic.  I'd be curious to compare the English docs to the Japanese originals and see how badly the translated was muffed up.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thats a good start.  A good J/E-E/J dictionary is a great way to artificially extend the vocabulary you can use.  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/wwwjdic.html" target="_blank">Jim Breen's WWWJIC</a> is an excellent online dictionary.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you know how to use a kanji dictionary?  I use and am satisfied with Arthur Rose-Innes "Beginners' Dictionary of Chinese-Japanese Characters".  It is a little dated though.  The WWWJIC has a multiradical lookup.  (I personally prefer a proper radical lookup.)  I have a <a class="postlink" href="http://granicus.if.org/~sgeos/kanji.html" target="_blank">list of the kanji</a> one is supposed to know by the time he is out of high school on my website.  It is split by grade level and lists the character, radical, stroke count, common readings and English meaning for each character.  I manually pulled the meanings from the WWWJIC and have not had time to compare most of them with other sources.  (The ??? in the English meaning means that I have not compared with other sources.)

this is true, but the fact is that once they are released (and all the docs and devkits were released years ago) the people who know what to do with it can get their hands on it. after gaining the knowledge, that information can be used, registers learned, etc. by the time it makes it to a tutorial it has been used and learned by enough people to not resemble any nintendo document.
<br/>
<br/>
its important that a dev scene doesnt rely on official SDKs but for many consoles they can often be the first step. of course, in the recent years (excluding xbox) it is only the first step. i'm not doubting the major role reverse engineering plays.. nintendo doesnt quite say everything i'm sure.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
