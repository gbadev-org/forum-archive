    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, because rtfm is implied as true for all cases. sometimes there are better things than the manual and sometimes they just want to be pointed out to the manual itself or one that people find best since there are always 'bad' manuals out there

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You just write the .gba file to your cart. For some carts, you may need to "fix" the header before it'll work correctly; if your flash cart's writing software doesn't do this automatically, use 'gbafix' that comes with devkitARM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
