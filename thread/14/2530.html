    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Which program from the book are you working on?  I'm up to chapter 6 and haven't had any problems with compiling the source code yet, except for mistakes of my own that I've had to fix (but there's one program that requires a file from the CD-ROM to compile unfortunately).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, my situation was I didn't have HAM or VHAM, so I downloaded those, installed HAM first, then VHAM, and it worked.  I *think* the book says to install HAM before VHAM, so that may be the problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As long as you have the right files and code, you should be okay with DevKitAdv. I actually just installed VHAM which should be 50 meg and it works fine.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">your problem with ham is probably related to an old version of cygwin.dll in your windows\system directory - search for it and either delete it or replace it with the cygwin.dll in your ham directory</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
