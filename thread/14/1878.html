    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Id love to use a GBA to control either a pc in the back, maybe with winamp and a plugin, or with the <a href="http://www.pjrc.com" target="_blank">www.pjrc.com</a> project.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any thoughts on this or maybe a application thats being worked on?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A bit of an old topic, but I've been doing something similar, I think.  Using Pogoshell and a headphone adapter, MODs and NSFs can be played on anything you can get an adapter for.  A car stereo can use one of the CD-to-Tape converters available, or a headphone-to-RCA audio jack to plug it into whatever strikes your fancy.
<br/>
<br/>
Granted, it wouldn't have much memory for MP3s, but it's doable.
