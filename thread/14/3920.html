<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">
<br/>
Mode 0: 
<br/>
1        All 4 available backgrounds
<br/>
2        No rotation or scaling
<br/>
3        16 or 256 colors
<br/>
4        Maximum 1024 tiles
<br/>
</span>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA has a maximum of 4 displayable backgrounds. Depending on the mode you use, the GBA hardware determines how these backgrounds are used and how many can be used.
<br/>
<br/>
You can mix different modes but you can only use one mode at a time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It says :
<br/>
You can display a maximum of 4 layers at a time (mode 0).
<br/>
You can switch from one mode to another whenever you want.
<br/>
You can have as much backgrounds available as you want, but you can only display 4 at a time (mode 0).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want to give the illusion of displaying more backgrounds, then build a layer out of sprites. In fact, many arcade platforms don't have tiled "backgrounds" at all; everything is a sprite.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You'd probably need 31 with scrolling unless you really enjoy updating VRAM every tic.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, you'd probably need to set aside rouhgly half of sprite VRAM as well as I don't believe there would be time to load OAM info and chars within - Oh wait you can buffer your load across 8 lines so never mind.  You only need 31 chars reserved.  Yeah, this would work fine.  You also have time to change the palette dynamically and good with other stuff as well.  Should work just fine.  I might have to try this sometime as it would allow so killer sorting/palette/misc. effects. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'd say use metatile-sized or larger sprites. To make a layer of clouds, use a sprite for each cloud. <span style="font-style: italic">WarioWare</span> is an excellent example; most of the microgame graphics are composed entirely of sprites so that 1. the transitions displayed between microgames can use the backgrounds, and 2. the graphics become easier to high-level-emulate on the GameCube port.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
