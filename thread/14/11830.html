    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all,
<br/>
<br/>
I am new to homebrew. I have a G4 running OSX (10.2.4). I installed Devkitarm and can locate it thru Terminal at /opt/local/devkitpro. I tried to find some info on setting up the environment, but everything seems to point to a couple tutorials that no longer exist.
<br/>
<br/>
I've scanned through these forums and it seems that the first step is to set the exports and paths. When I try to issue one of these commands like "export DEVKITPRO=/opt/local/devkitpro" Terminal tells me that it cannot find the export command. Is there an update I need to get or does it not work at my OS lvl?
<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I am completely new to GBA/DS development. If there is someone who has an environment set up in OSX who could provide me with some good instructions on the inital setup and any "gotchas" I should know about, it would be appreciated. While I am new to this, I do write software for IBM point of sale systems and handle the SCO aministration/shell scripting at my work so compilers, tool chains, vi editing and the sort are all familiar. If I can get some setup instruction I should be able to take it from there.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for the help.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!
<br/>

The export command works in shells designed to be mostly compatible with Bourne shell (ash, bash, ksh, zsh). C shells (csh, tcsh) act differently.
<br/>
<br/>
Bourne shell: export DEVKITPRO=/opt/local/devkitpro
<br/>
C shell: setenv DEVKITPRO /opt/local/devkitpro<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
