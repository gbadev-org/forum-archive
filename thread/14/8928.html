    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I've just got a couple of questions. I'm writing a 2D side scroller ala R-Type.  It's very basic. I'm just working on one level.  I'm not sure where to start regarding enemy placement.
<br/>
<br/>
Q1. How would I place and move enemies in a wave formation like so many other shooting games.
<br/>
<br/>
Q2. How would time when the enemies appear on screen?
<br/>
<br/>
And finally:
<br/>
Q3. What methods can I use to detect collision between
<br/>
      A) ship-enemy
<br/>
      B) enemy-bullet
<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind that there will probably be at most 4 or 5 enemies on screen at the one time.  I might code in bullets for them as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.

Study BulletML for a while and you may realize how to describe motions of enemies and their bullets.

For each enemy, store a starting position. When the right side of the playfield scroll position reaches the enemy's starting position, spawn the enemy.

Search for "bounding" on this forum for help.

Then you'll want to know the sorting method so that you don't make unnecessary comparisons.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.

If I wanted set formation is there some way I could use SINE wave array of values to determin relative postions from a starting point..
<br/>
e.g the cross represents the enemy moving a wave formation.
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
+      +
<br/>
  +  +  +
<br/>
    +     +
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
If I could how would I go about creating and using the array?
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding collision I was considering basic brute force bounding box checks for starters.  If I've time I would like to implement something like
<br/>
+ divide screen into four quadrants
<br/>
+ each quadrant points to a link list that enemies are dynamically added
<br/>
+ to check against certain enemies all I have to do is check which      quadrant the ship is in then check against that list.
<br/>
+ or is this overkill?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,

That's called the sector method.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
