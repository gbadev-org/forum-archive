    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I'm trying to get a compiler working under QNX, for GBA development, I've tried devkitadv, but when compiling from source it compiles for quite a while and then asks whether I want to apply some patches, whatever answer I give, the compiling fails.
<br/>
<br/>
I've also tried the devkit-ARM makefile, which can download the bits it needs and compile, it gets very far, but bombs out after not being able to find xgcc in it's build directory.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone point me at some older/newer versions of either, and see if I can try my luck?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also wanting to get it work on Solaris, but that's another story...
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, any help, tips, gratefully appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For a periphery OS like QNX, you're probably looking at a roll-your-own situation.  Start with vanilla GCC and try to build a cross-compiler.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
