    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i Just made my first game with Game Maker, and  i wanted to convert it to my DS. I use a R4 (if that means anything...) and i Don't know what i'm doing. i want to use the styles with this because its a mouse only game and i don't think i could make it to use the arrows... can any one help me with this 
<br/>
I'll post the files for people to look at and tell me what i should and shouldn't do, and please tell me what you think of the game. its really really pointless but, oh well.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can tell you right off the bat that you will *not* be able to simply "convert" a GameMaker exe to a DS binary. It cannot be done, the gamemaker interpreter cannot run on a DS. Or at least no one has bothered to try, I don't personally see how it's feasable.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to program for the DS, I highly recommend that you ignore that desire for a second and learn to program on the GBA. (The DS is a lot more confusing in a lot of areas, but the development process for both is basically the same.) You are going to need to become fluent in C or C++ if you want to do either, so I recommend playing with a C++ compiler before you do anything.
<br/>
<br/>
Programming for a handheld is no easy task, and requires a pretty good bit of effort. It's possible to make simple stuff relatively easy though, once you get the hang of things. I would point you to a tutorial, but the only one I ever got anything out of was TONC, and it's enough to scare away the bravest of all men on a first glance. Most of my knowledge was self-taught, with lots of help from the community here and from a friend who is into the same thing. I applaud you for your interest in the area, but be warned that to really program a game on a handheld will require some effort on your part.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll stress this again, of you do not know C or C++, you need to learn, as the compiler for the DS can currently only compile C code, and I don't see anything else being used. I would also recommend having a look at Visual HAM, as I hear it's a good beginners library for this sort of thing, although I can't really give you a good impression because I don't use it. Someone with more knowledge than me, please give this one a set of links, as I don't have any with me at the moment. ^_^

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Given proper documentation, you could generate a game for both Game Maker and the DS.  Admittedly, it would have to be reprogrammed, but you could probably recycle the in game assets (ie, graphics).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why don't you just program a game maker for the NDS. Then rebuild your game maker game from the ground up using game maker clone/mimic that is running on the NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
Game maker itself is a game engine already pre-made rather In terms of a dev tool you can use it to simulate your game for presentations.
