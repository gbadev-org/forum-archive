Edit: I found it! After Snooping around a bit, I found it at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040216115716/www.jm-basic.com/download/gallery/DBsetup.msi" target="_blank">http://web.archive.org/web/20040216115716/www.jm-basic.com/download/gallery/DBsetup.msi</a>
<br/>
Thanks for the idea!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I am (slowly) taking over the DragonBASIC project.  The web forums can be accessed at Zhilaware ENT forums at <a class="postlink" href="http://forums.zhilaware.starfusion.org/" target="_blank">http://forums.zhilaware.starfusion.org/</a> (as Cearn said) and the DragonBASIC Web Page will be available at <a class="postlink" href="http://db.zhilaware.starfusion.org/" target="_blank">http://db.zhilaware.starfusion.org/</a> (or more simply, <a class="postlink" href="http://dragonbasic.tk/" target="_blank">http://dragonbasic.tk/</a>).  The website is not in any way complete (it's barely started), if anyone is willing to help, it would be nice if someone were to send me a basic layout template to get started with.  Also, the DragonBASIC API (set of functions available in DragonBASIC) are now availabe as open source at SourceForge (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/dragonapi/" target="_blank">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/dragonapi/</a>) under the Giftware license.  Currently, no updates have been appended after the 1.4.5 release.<br/>_________________<br/>Current high scores on Super Mario 64 DS:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have put a mirror to the original jm-basic.com I had recieved from jma.  Unfortuantly, about half the site was based on his database, which I can't use, so some of the links are now dead.  Basic navigation is possible, until I can make a decent translation for the site.
