    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What considerations must be made when using sprites in the various modes? I do not believe there are any for the tile modes, is this correct? And the bitmap modes require you start at character 512, right? Does that mean I would begin loading my sprites into OAMPosition[512]? And what about if I switch modes while drawing?
<br/>
<br/>
For example, I draw my sprites in mode 3, but would like there to be a background image on the screen. If I switch to mode 4, should I have started in OAMPosition[512] in the first place (assuming that is what needs to be done)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are using any bitmap modes, it would be best to stick with starting at OAMPosition[512]. The bitmap modes cross over the Sprite VRAM (which you already know), and data written to the bitmap modes would overwrite the current data. Switching modes while keeping sprites at OAMPosition[0] could work, but you would have to continually rewrite the sprite in each frame, which probably isn't a good idea to do.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"OAMPosition" is a weird name, considering that it doesn't refer to a position in OAM.
<br/>
<br/>
Modes 3, 4, and 5 all use the first half of the sprite tiles, so clearly if you are switching between 3 and 4 you should only be using the second half of sprite tile RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're going to switch between a tile mode and a bitmap mode, and you'd like to have the first half of the sprite tiles available when you're in the tile mode, that's no problem either.  Just use them when you're in the tile mode, and don't when you're in the bitmap mode.
<br/>
<br/>
It's perfectly normal to load sprite cels each frame.  Check out some games in VBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
