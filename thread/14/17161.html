<br/>
I'm a noob when it comes to homebrew, patching, etc. and I'm also a noob on this forum, so I hope I posted this in the right section.
<br/>
I have Cyclo DS Evolution, and I want to run DSOrganize on it. I downloaded the 3.2 version and I did what the instructions said (Unzipped it into the root folder, put the dldi patch for cyclo evolution in the resources folder) but it doesn't work. It only gets to "Initializing DSOrganize, trying patched driver". 
<br/>
One forum suggested to rename the nds file to bootme.nds, but it doesn't change anyhing. And all 4 versions of dsorganize that were in the zip folder "work", but they get to the same spot and no further. 
<br/>
I googled it over and over, but all forums say that if you patch it with dldi, it should work fine, which it doesn't, or maybe I didn't patch it right? The readme file said that if I have problems, I should post them on this forum, so that's what I'm doing..
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone help me, please?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
