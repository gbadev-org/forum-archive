    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys! I've just downloaded HAM and VHAM, made a simple Hello World, put some gfx...well, followed the Aaron Rogers tutorial... But as you should know, that's not enough. I searched the whole web for some other HAM tutos, but everything I found talks about DevKitAdvance... Anyway, I got a question: Everybody here knows that animations are just various sprites being displayed in a fast speed, so that we think they're moving. But in order to do that in HAM... There are any functions that makes this proccess easier? Or I'll need to write my own function? If yes, maybe somebody can send me an example?
<br/>
<br/>
Thx a lot,
<br/>
GeeBeeHey !

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are two ways that I use. 
<br/>
<br/>
(1) Keep all frames in tilemem and then update the OAM pointers to animate. Usefull if you need to use a bunch of "characters" with the same frameset.
<br/>
<br/>
(2) Reserve an area of the tileset for the character, then update that area with the new frames of animation. It works well if you need to have lots of characters with lots of different frames. Plus, it's just as easy and fast as the other, provided you arent using huge sprites, and even then the speed tradeoff isn't that much.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
