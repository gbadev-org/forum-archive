    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I finally got myself a flash cart. I had never tested my stuff on real hardware before. My question is: Is there something I have to do in order to put my iwram code in iwram on the real gba? Or is it the same as when I was doing it for the emulator. Cause on the emulator, I know it was in iwram (I saw the code running in the 0x03000000 segment).
<br/>
<br/>
But judging from the performance I get on real hardware, I believe that it's not in iwram. I had that same down performance on the emu too when I didn't use iwram.
<br/>
<br/>
Did I miss something?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If the code was running in IWRAM on the emulator it'll be running in IWRAM on the hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
But speed on the emulator - and especially speed differences when you play around with different memory segments on the emulator - will not directly correspond to speed (and speed differences) on the hardware.
