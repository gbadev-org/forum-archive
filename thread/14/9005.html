    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using VisualHam 2.5A trying to open a .gba file.  The file loads but comes in as unreadable.  Is this correct or is the file supposed to convert upon loading?  If I have to convert the file can someone explain on how to do this using this program?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was working through the 3rd chapter of Programming the Nintendo Game Boy by JHarbour, the file is ShowPicture.gba.   I can open it through VBA so its not a big deal.  Appearantly he does so in the book (unless I'm reading it incorrectly) I was just wondering if its possible to open in VisualHam as I can not.  Is there a way to do this?
