<br/>
<br/>
This is a question about commercial ROM hacking, which I have a feeling is a bit off topic, but please be considerate. I own the ROM in question, and I don't know where else to find out about this sort of thing, so please bear with me.
<br/>
<br/>
I really like Boktai, but I really don't like the sitting in the sun aspect of it, it gets old quick. Thinking there was no way of playing without roasting my flesh, I shelved the game. Recently I found a patch for pirates that don't own the cart so I dumped the game, patched it and flashed it. Unfortunately, the patch is weak, you increase and decrease the sun's level by holding L+R and it really detracts from the 'live' feeling of the game.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to make my own patch, one that maps data from the real-time-clock to the solar sensor, so the amount of sun in the game gradually changes over the course of the day, without me having to set it. Unfortunatly I don't really know where to start. I know C++, but no assembly, and don't have any clue how to start hacking the ROM.
<br/>
<br/>
Any of the following would be appreciated:
<br/>
   -Links to tools
<br/>
   -Information on how the clock is polled and what format it's in
<br/>
   -Any hints, tips, or anything
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading my post, and thanks for any help you can give me.
<br/>
