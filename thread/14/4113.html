    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How closely does the VBA emulator actually emulate the GBA? I've heard that sometimes the graphics are slightly off, but how is it with regards to speed? If a program would cause slowdown on the actual machine, would this be noticable on the emulated rom?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">VBA doesn't accurately emulate the waitstates of the various memory areas. This means memory accesses to EWRAM and ROM take longer on hardware than they do in the emulator, which could potentially result in slowdown on hardware that isn't apparent in emulation.

Like NO$GBA or VGBA(if anyone actually owns a copy).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No$gba is supposed to be more accurate with respect to wait states, but like VBA, it still mistakenly estimates BIOS calls as taking 0 cycles unless you use a BIOS file dumped from your GBA.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
