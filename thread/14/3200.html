    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm planning on writing a simple game, whereby the player controls one sprite on a fixed background.  The background would not be very complex although it would be more than one screen in size.  I presume I'd use mode 0 for this?  I don't plan on doing any rotation etc...  
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'd like to have a menu for people to choose options etc...  What's the best mode for a menu?  It seems to be mode 4 looking on here?  I'd like the options to be some text in a box that highlights (flashes) when selected.  Which mode is easiest for this?
<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks,
<br/>
Cheech.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You should use Modes 3-5 when you want to display a fixed picture or complicated animation system (eg. that a custom 3D engine might use).
<br/>
<br/>
You should use Modes 0-2 when you want to do anything that requires a tiled background. You can also use it for some fixed/moving pictures as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Generally, Modes 0-2 offer more versatility and offer better use of the hardware features than Modes 3-5, so long as the nature of your application agrees with those features.
