    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What compiler are you using?  If you're using devkitARM, it has some example code (in the "devkitpro\examples" directory), which should help.  
<br/>
Or if you're new to programming in general, and are trying to program a GBA, you might want to look into Dragon BASIC, a compiler which allows you to write in BASIC.  
<br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking, when I am learning to write code for a new system (be it GBC, GBA, microprocessors, computers, etc.), I look at example source code first.  Then I start tweaking the code, and usually can get a pretty good feel for how the code works.

I do notice that this post is almost a year old, but hope that this helps.  Or that you've found the answer elsewhere.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
