    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is my first question here, so please be gentle.
<br/>
<br/>
I am working on a small little program and I am trying to make a stop sign, minus text.  I have two choices:
<br/>
I can make four different sprites, one for each quadrant and be done with that.
<br/>
I also might choose to just make the one quadrant and rotate it through all four quadrants using math.
<br/>
<br/>
To the layman (me), it would seem the first is faster (?) because it doesn't do any fancy stuff but it takes up 3 extra tiles (whoop-de-do).  The second would take up less space but would be slower because of the extra work.
<br/>
<br/>
So the question is, "Is the second method actually slower in the long run? (sans setup time on the sprites)"
<br/>
Anyone have previous experience to this sort of "trick"?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and I'll be back soon!<br/>_________________<br/>-h</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are talking a 16x16 pixel sprite, then it's probably not worth wasting the extra OAM entries to break it down into four separate sprites. Just have a single 16x16 OAM entry that points to 4 tiles of data, containing your entire image.
<br/>
<br/>
With 32K of sprite VRAM you've got enough for 1024 16-colour tiles, so using 1 instead of 4 in a single instance is unlikely to be your limiting factor. On the other hand, you only have 128 OAM entries, so if you use 4 of them to create four separate sprites to display your image, you are consuming more of a scarcer resource.
<br/>
<br/>
As for which method is "faster", I'm not sure what you mean. In terms of design time, the above strategy is definitely quickest, and you don't need a robust engine that supports breaking down high-level onscreen entities into individually stitched-together sprites. You just need the one sprite to associate with your onscreen entity.
<br/>
<br/>
In terms of execution speed on the GBA, well, you've got more data to copy into VRAM if you set up a single sprite with 4 tiles, or more complicated code to execute if you set up four sprites with a single, rotated tile, so it probably comes out in a wash. Neither will be very expensive, though.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, if you can set up a robust enough high-level sprite system to handle things such as the various transformations available to you, then it may pay off a thousand fold in the long run. What are your long-term goals? Is it more than this simple program? If so, then design for them.
<br/>
<br/>
(For the record, you don't need to use math to rotate the sprites, you can simply use the H/V flip bits in your OAM entries.)
