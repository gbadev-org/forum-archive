    <h4>#48681 - Glow - Thu Jul 21, 2005 7:15 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there, I'm currently coding my first thingies for the GBA in C (and a bit in asm) using devkitARM, and until now I've put all the code that should run as fast as possible in IWRAM. 
<br/>
<br/>
But I'd like to know if it's possible to get a list of how much bytes I've 'used' of the IWRAM? I thought I read somewhere that gcc is capable of generating such a list after linking...
<br/>
<br/>
I think I could append some magic value to all my code in IWRAM and then look it up in VBA's memory viewer, but hopefully there's an easier way of doing it.
<br/>
<br/>
- cheers, Glow.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can generate a map file if you pass the "-Map outputfilename.map" option to GCC at the linking stage.
<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, you can use the <span style="font-weight: bold">nm</span> command-line utility (its part of the binutils that come with GCC) on your .elf file to get a list of memory objects. Pass it the "-n" option to get them ordered numerically. I usually find this option to be quicker and easier than reading a map file.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you use makefiles, toss this in your makefile and then make your default target depend on, say, mario.map.txt:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, cool, that's exactly what I needed :) 
<br/>
<br/>
I think I'll use nm too, seems to give just the info that I need. Ohw, and I've also updated my makefile, as tepples suggested. Works great.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx for the help guys.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
