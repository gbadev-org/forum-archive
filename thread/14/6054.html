    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm just setting out on a project to write a game for the GBA (first real programming project :) ) and I am looking for information on what makefiles actually *do* and on how to write them.  AFAICT, a makefile is a batch file/script for automating a build from a source file?? Is that right?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I didn't see anything in the sticky thread and a quick search didn't turn up anything I could see was relevant directly but I apologise if I missed anything!
<br/>
<br/>
So, does anyone have any links or references to some good guides &amp; tutorials online for makefiles?  I guess it's too big a subject to cover here, but I want to learn as much as possible :)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A make file is <span style="font-weight: bold">like</span> a batch file, but a very special that's specificaly designed for creating other files and keeping them up to date..
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, you'd make a make file that says your game depends on modules A, B and C.   And then you'd also put that module A requires certain source files, B requires certain other source files, and C requires a bitmap or something.   Then you have the commands to make the files.  (Compiler commands, or image converting commands, etc.)    
<br/>
<br/>
 That way, if you change a single file in your project, you don't have to remember which files have to be remade.  You just run make, make checks all the timestamps, and re-builds only the parts of your project that need to be rebuilt.

I didn't explain this very well, But this link explains it pretty well : <a href="http://www.wlug.org.nz/MakefileHowto" target="_blank">http://www.wlug.org.nz/MakefileHowto</a><br/>_________________<br/>-Andy L
