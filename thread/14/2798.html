<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to make a small game with a friend but we cannot choose which library to use....
<br/>
We had started with a small lib called BGBA, and Devkit Advance, but now we wonder if HAMlib (or another lib) shouldn't be better.
<br/>
<br/>
What do you think about that? 
<br/>
Which lib do you advice us?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
You can e-mail me about Ham, I use it for months and it works fine for me at my low level.
<br/>
<br/>
Great and experienced dev friend of mine and me want to create a RPG using HaM.
<br/>
I started to code an engine 3 months ago, but stopped for some personnal problem. Anyway I manage to do cool things during this time ^^
<br/>
He just discovers the library, and I'm waiting he tell me it's satisfying, an d we'll go ^^<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As long as you know what you are doing in HAMlib (like a general idea of how it works internally), feel free to use it.
<br/>
<br/>
However, knowing that you wrote everything in your own library makes it easier to use functions because you designed it. What may take 4 functions in HAMlib may be 1 function in your library.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess it just depends on the quality of your library.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
