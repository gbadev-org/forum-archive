    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello!
<br/>
<br/>
At the first i will say sorry for my bad english.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ok, a professor of mine told me, that its possible to run java programms on a gba.
<br/>
java is not my programming language at the moment and so i decided to try it in C.
<br/>
<br/>
but its really hard to find german documentations or really good newbie faqs with step to step instructions.
<br/>
<br/>
so i will aks the people here for help
<br/>
i have a pc, and a gba sp.
<br/>
now i will buy me a flash kit, cause this is really hard to get in austria.
<br/>
<br/>
so i will ask, where can i get the hardware and documentations and
<br/>
how should i start at this point.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

good german site with some nice tutorials. But the site is closed at the moment and there will be no new content because there are not enough people to go on. but you can take a look at the tuts already releasd.

<br/>
Anything is "possible", but you won't run Java programs on a GBA unless you first write a Java interpreter for the GBA, which to my knowledge does not exist. So you're correct that you're much better off using C instead.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Programs must be smaller than 256K, however, will run a bit slower, and can't be taken everywhere like a flash cart can.
<br/>
<br/>
So if you're just doing a small program for a university course or are just looking to make simple games, then the MBV2 cable is probably sufficient. If you want to do any serious heavy-duty GBA programming, however, you should invest in a flash cart and linker.

<br/>
<br/>
what do you think about HAM?
<br/>
<br/>
Is it good oder not, i tried it, but I am not able too compile a project.
<br/>
Is it better to work with devkitadv oder ham?
<br/>

    <h4>#15579 - dagamer34 - Sun Jan 25, 2004 5:06 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, just use the compiler that came with the HAM SDK. Its a lot better that way. Besides it comes with an IDE. You really don't want to use notepad, now do you?
<br/>
<br/>
And when using that IDE, you don't HAVE to use HAMlib or HAM at all. In fact, I changed the master makefile to take out all that stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
One BIG thing that should make you use this IDE is that it comes with the Insight debugger. Let's not say how long it takes to set it up with DevKit.
<br/>
<br/>
You can still compile the code that you would have run with DevKit. To me, there is no difference. It gives out the same errors, you will have the same problems, etc...<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

ConTEXT is my saving grace when I'm on Windows machines. I remember when I first came across it while looking for a text editor. Everything was either expensive or crap... then I found ConTEXT. Free and almost everything a programmer would want in a text editor.
