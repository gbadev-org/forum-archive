I do not think it really matters.  In my opinion, and it's only my opinion, go with C.  I can't back that with anything other than 'I use C and it works for me.'

C++ can be useful in many situations but unless your very experienced with the language I wouldn't suggest using it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The syntax is pretty much the same.
<br/>
<br/>
C++ has some differents libraries. The major changes between the two is that c++ introduced Object orited programming and function overloading (having X functions with the same name, but differrents parameters).

Someone with more knowledge on the matter would have to fillup the blanks I left out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Another thing to avoid (unrelated to C++ specific) is the use of float variables, unless it's for limited testing purpose. It'll bring your GBA to a crawl because the CPU doesn't support floating math arithmetic.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Virtual functions, allright. I can imagine that accessing the vtable takes some time (I doubt whether it's a big impact, but I can't confirm or deny it as I never ran tests on this)
<br/>
<br/>
Templates slow? Not possible! Simply because templates only exist in compile-time. When compiling, it will build all the necessary functions for the different used types. It will slow down compiletime and make a bigger ELF, but at runtime it is already known what function to run. So there is no reason why templates should slow down at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
To achieve good performance in C++: don't overuse virtual methods or exceptions, turn off support for RTTI (run-time type identification; if you think you need it, your polymorphism may be poorly designed), and use template types only sparingly. This will make C++ almost as fast as C. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">I don't why this is, but it's what i've read. Tepple or Jason would be better suited to anwser this one.

<br/>
As for other optimisation, avoid multiplication or worst, division when you can. They are slow operation. Instead you might use bitshift which are really fast. So instead of doing : 
<br/>
x * 256 --&gt; x&lt;&lt;8
<br/>
x * 24 --&gt; x&lt;&lt;4 + x&lt;&lt;3 explanation 24 = 2^4 + 2^3</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Division is slow on any ARM processor, but multiplication is fast on any ARM core with the fast multiplier such as the GBA's ARM7TDMI. If the second number is small, multiplication may take only three cycles; adding, shifting, and adding may take more, especially from slow instruction memory.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

How would you divide using bitshift? bitshift right?<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right.  
<br/>
<br/>
x &gt;&gt; 1;   // x / 2;
<br/>
x &gt;&gt; 2;   // x / 4;
<br/>
x &gt;&gt; 3;   // x / 8;
<br/>
<br/>
and so on...  But I don't know any trick to divide by something else than a power of 2.  Is it possible?<br/>_________________<br/>Visit SR-388 now and get a 40% discount!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
