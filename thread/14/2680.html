    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all! I'm going to start learn C programming for GBA and i have a question... I remember, that i had on my hdd good tutorial, but I lost it. Searching for it in net haven't bring any results, so can someone of you give me link to it? I remember, that on the beginnig were written words: "It isn't hard to learn. It is hard to remember", or something... Know where it is?
