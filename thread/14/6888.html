    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I use a EZF Advance 256M rom for development, but is there anything available that is cheap and only holds a small percentage of this? Something suitable for distrubution (however limited) that is more analogous to the roms distributed by games companies with their product on?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the reply tepples, i'm not really looking at pitching my product to anyone though, just giving out a couple of roms of a game i'm making to a couple of friends, i was just wondering if there was anything out there that was cheap and a small quantity could be bought of fairly easily?<br/>_________________<br/>You lost today, kid.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks simon. 
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't realise it wasn't that easy to get hold of single write roms. 
<br/>
<br/>
Because I haven't even got a quarter of the way through the thing I am producing at the moment I think I will give this opportunity a miss. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help though.<br/>_________________<br/>You lost today, kid. But that doesn't mean you have to like it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
