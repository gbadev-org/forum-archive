<br/>
<br/>
I am really thinking about learning programming. I have a couple ideas for some games I would like to try, but I need to learn the basics first.
<br/>
<br/>
Where is the best place to start?
<br/>
<br/>
I have extremely limited computer knowledge. I am an old hack from the atari / commodore days, and I have done some minor board and memory chip rearranging in the 386/486 days, but I have no real programming knowledge. 
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of starting with C++. 
<br/>
<br/>
Is there somewhere better to start? What's a good free compiler to start with. I there a good free tutorial to start with? 
<br/>
<br/>
I need some good advice where to start, step by step. I would prefer free stuff at least <span style="text-decoration: underline">until</span> I get my feet wet, then I will consider purchasing, books, compilers, ect..  I may even go back to School!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Right now I have a good carreer and education, so this will be a hobby to start, but I am also considering it as a possible carreer change for the future.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
