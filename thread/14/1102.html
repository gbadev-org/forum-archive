    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to find out how to get fast visual source level debugging with devkitadv. Have read through the posts about GDB/Insight. I've managed to get it working (I think), although it's fairly slow and seems to freeze up on occasions. Is this what most people use? I've read a bit about using pipe to speed GDB up, but haven't had any success. Is it possible to do this under Windows or will it only work under Linux?
<br/>
<br/>
What are the other free alternatives? I've tried HAM and it's not what I'm after. I've had a quick look at Dev-C++, does anyone use this for GBA development?
<br/>

Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

so I don't think many people use it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not as handy, but since i couldn't setup Insight&amp;Gdb, i kept using it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I got the output working, but using Insight is great, straight into the code to see what everything is doing... it's just soooo slow.
<br/>
<br/>
HAM is great in that everything is integrated, but I don't really want to use their library or have their splash screen at the start of my game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For me Insight/GDB works fine and is not slow.
<br/>
Just use HAM and do like me... remove parameter -lham in the makefile so you will not link anymore with HAMLib. And if you do not call HAM_Init, then you won't have the splash screen !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Up till now I've just written my own debugfunctions, and I'll probably keep on expanding its functionality. Basically it activates debugmode when you press start+select, and contains information about whatever you like. (It pauses the game, keeping track of what was on screen before you entered the debugmode)
<br/>
<br/>
Not great, but I haven't felt the urge of using a real debugger yet. (And secondly, I don't know how to get that working *easily and fast* anyway... Maybe I'll check out how to get some info from VisualBoy someday...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I do the same kind of thing - just hijack one of the backgrounds for some text output (although that technique changes depending on the background usage of the game and the precise nature of the debugging) - for one thing it's helped me out a few times when debugging on hardware, for problems that didn't occur when using emulators.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
