    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been programming in c/c++ for almost a decade and have made a few pc games and I think my current project would be more suited to a handheld device. I would really like to develop for the ds but I've come to the conclusion that it is quite a bit more painful then the gba. The reason I say this is because the current emulators fail to run for me (dualis, no$gba) however visualboyadvance works great. I do own a ds lite so I could test that way but loading to sd card then booting it up on the hardware seems like it would be time consuming and frustrating.
<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I have a few questions.
<br/>
<br/>
How do you guys test your code?
<br/>
<br/>
Is the ds really that much more powerful then the gba for 2d games?
<br/>
<br/>
Can gba games be ported to the ds with minimal effort if I do go the gba route?
<br/>
<br/>
Is there some reason that I only get a white screen when I try to run homebrew on an emulator? (specifically I've been trying to get the code from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.patatersoft.info/manual.php" target="_blank">here</a> to run). Some of the examples that come with devkitpro do work however none of them can display a bitmap.
<br/>
<br/>
Any input would be great, thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There are homebrew programs that receive a .nds file, write it to the SD card, and then run it.

<br/>
The DS 2D hardware is almost the same as that of the GBA, except with more VRAM. But a lot of games use the 3D hardware to draw 2D graphics on one of the screens by drawing each sprite as a quad.

Can you point me in the right direction for these?

What is the advantage of this on the ds? In the pc world using 3d for 2d is a lot faster however I thought the ds already has a very powerful 2d mode. The only other possible advantage I can see over 2d is that you don't have to worry about memory banks for images but rather just load them through opengl.
<br/>
<br/>
I also have another question on why some things can't compile but I'll post them in a separate thread in the appropriate forum.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

2D: 128 sprites, 32 different rotation matrices, and about 32 KiB of VRAM (GBA) or 128 KiB of VRAM (DS) for sprite cels.
<br/>
3D: 1,500 sprites, 1,500 different rotation matrices, and 512 KiB of VRAM for sprite cels. But it works only on the main screen.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
