    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Whenever I run GIT on a PNG is doesn't put a "." in the resulting file names.  In other words when I run git on "logo.png" I get "logos" and "logosh" as the output instead of "logo.s" and "logo.h".  Similiarly the definitions within the H file have "s" appended: logosBitmap, etc.  The linker still looks for logo.s and can't find it so I have to go and manually change the file name and re-link.
<br/>
<br/>
This is the code in my makefile:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
%.s %.h   : %.png %.git
<br/>
   git $&lt; -o$*</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I had to upgrade GIT from the version that was distributed with DevKitPro because that version caused a fatal error whenever it was run.  I have "v0.7b2, 20070331".  I tried with and without "-fts" and the results were the same.  Coronac's page doesn't mention anything about it nor do any of the readmes or help files.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else run across this or have any ideas?

Actually, this is a work-around, not a solution. The function that handles extension (re)placement was indeed flawed. Thank you for pointing it out. A fixed version is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/projects.php#grit" target="_blank">up now</a>,  but as it's a minor fix (details <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/#p10" target="_blank">here</a>) I'm not sure it's worth the trouble to redownload. 
<br/>
<br/>
Another so^H^Hwork-around would be to leave out the -o option altogether. In that case it'd grab the extension from the input file.

About the fatal error with the git in DKP r20: I get that too, but I really don't know what could cause that. Possibly an incompatible version of FreeImage.dll ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
