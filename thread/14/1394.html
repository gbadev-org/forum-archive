Anyone ever try this?? I want to be cheap and use a modded orgional cart with this cable so i dont have to spent 150$+ on a flash advance.? I am wondering if i can use 5.1v Zenner diaodes instead of 3.3v ones.? I can't find 3.3v ones at radio shack, and on the link cable ports on my GBA SP it says 5.5v.
<br/>
<br/>
And how do i make a orgional GBA cart writeable?? I know you have to move a resistor to the empty slot, but which one needs to be moved?? I opened golen sun and i see the empty slot, but theres 4 resistors to choose from to move there.
<br/>
<br/>
I know i can use small roms with out using a cart but i want to be able to use pocket NES and not have to boot it up with the PC every time.  i'de like to take it on the road ya know!
<br/>
<br/>

You'd actually have to replace the mask ROM chip with a flash chip and an address-control ASIC.

You're thinking of the flash carts that come with the official Nintendo devkit, not the Game Paks sold at retail.

Then I'd suggest buying the F2A linker and cart at success-hk.com.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
No. To make Nintendo flash carts (only available to licensed developers
<br/>
 from Nintendo) writeable in the GBA, resistor R7 has to be moved to the empty resistor position R8. If you'd rather not do the modification yourself then I'd be glad to do it for US$20 + $5 shipping.

thats regarding the MBV2 cable (same thing as the multiboot cable pretty much).  i guess dident read it very carefully...  i thought Nintendo flash cart ment store bought game...
<br/>
<br/>
