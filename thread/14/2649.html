    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been programming for a few years now. Unluckily for me, i decided to start programming in Qbasic. *shudders* I am now somewhat of an expert of qbasic, and i feel i have unleashed its full potential. IM READY TO MOVE ON! and gbadev seems like a great next step. I have no prior C experience, and no idea where to begin. Help would be greatly appreciated!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First learn C. You can find a plethora of tutorials if you search google. Or you can <a class="postlink" href="http://www.strath.ac.uk/IT/Docs/Ccourse/" target="_blank">start with this one</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't skimp on this step. You should not attempt to move onto GBA programming until you are very comfortable with bitwise operations, pointers and dereferencing, structs, and linked lists. (Linked lists themselves aren't so important, but the concepts encapsulated by them are very relevant to the kinds of things you do in GBA programming.)
<br/>
<br/>
GBA programming involves a lot of low-level stuff where you are often concerned more with looking at the values stored in specific addresses in memory (which is where pointers come in) and adjusting the ones and zeros there (which is where teh bitwise operations come in). It's a lot closer to the hardware, and you need to do things like pay close attention to whether a variable uses 8, 16, or 32 bits of memory.
<br/>
<br/>
Once you've got a handle on C programming, work your way through some GBA tutorials, such as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.thepernproject.com" target="_blank">The Pern Project</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbajunkie.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.gbajunkie.co.uk</a>.

<br/>
Good luck,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't <span style="font-weight: bold">just</span> rely on tutorials, get all the hardware documents you can find and read them, several times. The aim is to get some idea where to lookup things so don't worry if you don't understand much or need to skip parts at first.
<br/>
<br/>
Tutorials show you how to use the hardware specs, they are invariably short on detail, frequently misleading (despite working) or confusing. Cross reference them with the hardware docs while tinkering and you'll get a better idea of how the hardware really works, blindly following tutorials will stab you in the back later.
<br/>
<br/>
Think of tutorials as working examples you can experiment with and the hardware specs as a list of changes to try.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Really sorry to be so useless...but there are ALOT of files there. have mercy apon me and my ignorance! which one? again-really sry about this

ive been looking over some C code and the syntax looks slightly like QB. i can read it somewhat well.

that is the one good thing about QB. it has an IDE\COMPILER built into one handy exe! type the 7000 lines of code, push a button, and its done!

Do you require an IDE (that is, a specialized source code editor with a makefile builder and a built-in source-level debugger)? If so, get <a class="postlink" href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dev-cpp/devcpp4980.exe" target="_blank">this distribution of Dev-C++ with MinGW</a>.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Edit: tepp beat me to it. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Here's one thing that might make everything sound a little simpler:  all the compilers discussed so far are really just distributions of the same one: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).  GCC was originally developed for Unix-like systems, but MinGW is -- well, Minimal GNU for Windows.
<br/>
<br/>
So if you want to start simple, start with MinGW.
<br/>
<br/>
The MinGW site has a single file download that requires minimal configuration (just a change in your PATH I think).  Get the one that just says MinGW (it's about 14MB), and follow the instructions.
<br/>
<br/>
For simple projects, make your C file, and type 'gcc -o filename.exe filename.c' to compile it.
<br/>
<br/>
If you avoid using an IDE now (like DevC++), you'll have a greater understanding of the command-line tools, which is helpful in the long run.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ready to learn. Let's move on to C++ directly. C++ extends the C language with object-oriented classes and some additional syntax rules that, in general, help programmers write more reliable code. C++ permits function-name overloading, meaning that two different functions may have the same name provided they differ in at least one parameter. This programming device is handy, but it poses a problem for common linkers.
<br/>
<br/>
This is C++:

I don't know what Dev-C++ is. If it's the GCC compiler, you only need to change the ending of the source code file to *.C
<br/>
<br/>
But you can use C with C++ too. So I suggest you to use the file ending: *.CPP
<br/>
<br/>
You can use both C and C++ at the same time:

Try opening a command prompt window and then running the program from within the command prompt window. If you don't know how to work a command prompt window, you should <a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=dos%20tutorial" target="_blank">learn</a> because you won't be able to do much in GBA-land without some basic knowledge of the command prompt.

C++ is a ridiculously complicated language, and if you insist on learning it before you are a C expert -- well, let's say that instead of understanding why the language is how it is, you'll only be able to spout out a bunch of buzzwords about what supposedly makes it so great.
<br/>
<br/>
"Thinking in C++" is downloadable for free (www.bruceeckel.com), but I would strongly suggest that you wait until you start feeling restricted by the limitations of C.  Then you will really know how to make good use of C++ features, without being sucked into the hype.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're like me, a year or two with C++ will make you feel restricted again, and you'll start looking for something more flexible. =)

You should check out <a class="postlink" href="http://www.haskell.org/" target="_blank">Haskell</a> if you're into functional programming. That's a language with a lot of promise. Good luck coding for the GBA with it, though. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
If you're ever looking for a good compromise between C++ and C, though, I highly recommend Objective C. You can find a short intro to it <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gnustep.org/resources/ObjCFun.html" target="_blank">here</a>. It's basically an object-oriented layer on top of regular C, so you aren't stuck with any of the stupid aspects of C++. And it's fully supported by gcc.

Reasons for learning C FIRST:
<br/>
1) Get more low-level

2) Basically REQUIRES that you learn the system before you can do anything (classes in C++ hide this)

3) For lazy people who throw around spagetthi code and don't optimize, it is somewhat faster.

Reasons for learning C++ FIRST:

1) More flexible in the syntax(to me at least)

2) Classes: they hide a lot of code from you

3) More easily structured

Choose one, then stay with it. Then learn the other. After that its a matter of preference. I picked C++ because you can mix straight C in there too.

<br/>
Lisp is, without a doubt, a great language. Macros and the syntax are its big advantages (since code is made of lists, creating code to eval is cake... for those here that don't know Lisp).
<br/>
<br/>
The advantage of Haskell (and other, similar functional languages) is lazy evaluation and pattern matching of functions. Like any other language, you don't appreciate what you don't know about, because you've lived without it (note: I'm not talking about you, personally, just in general).
<br/>
<br/>
I'll just assume you didn't get too far in Haskell to appreciate these two subtleties, but as an example:
<br/>
<br/>
[1..]
<br/>
<br/>
This returns an infinite list containing all numbers. There is no way to do this (that I know of) in any other language. This is prime, lazy-evaluation in action. How can this be made useful (for those still trying to grok)? 
<br/>
<br/>
Several times it may become necessary to compute values that are based on previous values, like a fibonacci value. With lazy evaluation, you can compute a list of <span style="font-style: italic">all</span> the fibonacci numbers -- each member based on the previous members. Now, when you need the 30th value, just check the array and it is calculated then, on the fly. Need the 4th now? No need for any calculations, it was already done and returns immediately.
<br/>
<br/>
Lazy evaluation also has another nice advantage, in that if a value isn't used that would normally break code, it doesn't affect anything. For example, You could write a function that takes a list of numbers, divides all members by 0 and return the new list. Unless you actually needed to access a member of this list, no 'div by 0' error occurs. Of course, I'll be first to admit that this has come back to bite me in the butt, too :)
<br/>
<br/>
Function pattern matching is another wonder of Haskell, but this is waaay too far off topic for a C/C++ "which is better?" thread. So, I'll leave it alone for possible email correspondence. As for my vote, C to start (vs. C++, but not vs. other languages). OOP, like anything else has its place. Use the tool that works the best for the problem at hand. 
<br/>
<br/>
As for what language(s) do I think it is better to begin with? My 3 votes are assembly (pick one, and learn how the machine works! Too many students learn C first and still never understand pointers...), Scheme and Forth. Each teaches invaluable skills that when you then learn C or any other language, they are simply become academic.
