I was given and idea by someone - being able to link up the Pokemon Gold/Silver and Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire to be able to trade with each other.  And I have a flash card of GBC (E-Merger) and GBA too, awesome to hear it's -technically- possible, I'll try to look into this a bit more later, any one else who can help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Pok?mon games are proprietary. They use different link cable protocols, and I'm not aware of any program that emulates the link cable protocol of one game in order to be able to trade with the other. It'd probably be easier to use save hacking to move your Pok?mon from one game to the next.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well there is an emulator that does allowed it, but only to the same hand held console. (You can link Gameboy and Gameboy, but not Gameboy and GBA.)  The reason I'm interested in this is because I thought it would be an interesting experiment to do, especially attempting to do something nobody has done before.
<br/>
<br/>
Well Pokemon games might be too hard to do, but maybe just say, making a  simple program where pushing the A button on the gameboy causes an action on Gameboy Advance, something simple like that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The games determine the actual protocol.

I'd sell a toe for the Pokemon Advance trade protocol.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
