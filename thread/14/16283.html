<br/>
i'm doing a demo that show up a maximum of 90 - 16x16 sprites that went scaled down ('till 0 and their deactivation) when hit by another sprite. when i test it on visual boy advance or boycott advance it all works properly but when i put it on real hardware it show almost all correctly but i see a white rectangle over the 9 sprites i have on the top of the screen.
<br/>
they all moves toward together in matrix large 9sprites x 9sprites. 
<br/>
i really don't know where i can find the problem... 
<br/>
have you got some ideas? 
<br/>
thanks a lot.
