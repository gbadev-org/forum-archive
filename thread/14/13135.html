That's the Crash Course's batchfile. The '-lm' and 'pause' give it away. While it's an easy to understand tutorial, there is some seriously bad code in that thing, a few of which are covered <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9177&amp;start=14" target="_blank">here</a>.

This is not a makefile, this is a batchfile. Makefiles look more like <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/first.htm" target="_blank">this</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/first.htm#ssec-2nd-make" target="_blank">this</a>. Yes, they look more complicated than a batchfile, but that's only because the project is still very simple. For bigger projects with multiple files you need an easy way of managing all the files you have and makefiles allow you to do that. Batchfiles don't.
<br/>
<br/>
Use the devkitPro templates and the structure in the examples there. Use a programmer's editor or an IDE to run the makefiles for you. In PN2, you can open the makefile and Alt+1 build the project.
<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, do not use paths with spaces in them (like My Documents). Unix tools can't deal with them because the space indicates the separation between options.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Keldon: yes you can escape spaces in Makefiles too. The problem lies in maintaining the escaped spaces through all the tools. Some tools can cope with argv elements which contain spaces, others split them when passing them on to other tools.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The MinGW mailing list has similar questions on a regular basis and I'm pretty sure that most gcc ports being used on windows have had this question at some point. Many people have tried to make spaces in paths not break their toolchains, all of them failed.

<br/>
Inside the directory that the Makefile is in generally.
<br/>
<br/>
First though, take a step back and look at what's actually going on. Yes, it's (too) long, but read it anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
This is generally how building a program works; not just for C, but any compiled language. You have a number of source-files with code in them. There are <span style="font-weight: bold">tools</span> (programs) that can convert that source into something that can actually execute. One such tool is <span style="font-weight: bold">arm-eabi-gcc</span>, which is the compiler that comes with devkitPro, but there are many others as well. 
<br/>
The way it usually works is that you run the tool and give it a number of parameters to work with. One of these parameters is the source file's name; other parameters can be options that control the behavior of the tool. For example, this line:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">arm-eabi-gcc -mthumb -c hello.c
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
calls the compiler and tells it to compile hello.c. It also tells it to compile to the Thumb instruction set (<span style="font-style: italic">-mthumb</span>) and to only compile hello.c into an object file named hello.o, but not to create an executable of it just yet (<span style="font-style: italic">-c</span>). Many other options exist as well, and different tools use different options.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that something very similar actually happens when you double-click on a file in Explorer or drag a file to an icon on the desktop. Windows looks up the extension and executes the associated program with the filename as a parameter. For example, if I double-click on file `c:/dir1/dir2/woot.doc', Windows will execute the command </span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">`"c:/Program Files/more directories/winword.exe" "c:/dir1/dir2/woot.doc'</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> The principle is the same; it's just that Windows hides what's really going on when you double-click on something. Check the properties of the icons on your desktop and see how each of them has a 'target' with the program's path and sometimes some options as well.
<br/>
<br/>
In principle, you can make Windows compile a source-file when you double-click on a C file as well, but this is a bad idea because not all C files are to be executed with the same tool, and the options can differ as well. Also, bigger projects can easily get up to 100 files, and you <span style="font-style: italic">really</span> don't want to have to double-click each and every one of them. That why you use things like makefiles: to automate the process.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, notice that in the .doc example Windows uses the whole path of the tool and file, but in the compiler's case there's only the basename. The <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29" target="_blank">shell</a> needs the whole path, but typing it all in manually is problematic in a number of ways, not in the least that different people have different directory structures and entering the whole path would break things. Enter the concept of <span style="font-weight: bold">PATH</span>. The shell will look in the current directory first for a given file, and if it can't find it there it'll look in the directories specified in the PATH. The devkitPro installation adds the msys/bin directory to the path, and creates an environment variable <span style="font-weight: bold">DEVKITARM</span> containing the path to the devkitARM directory. You can then use that variable to make the devkitARM/bin directory visible. by adding $(DEVKITARM)/bin to the path. This will work regardless of where the devkitARM directory actually is. That takes care of the tool's paths, now the source-file.
<br/>
<br/>
As said, while it's possible to tell Windows to compile a source-file by double-clicking, it's not a good idea. The standard procedure is to have a script call all the tools for you with the desired options. A <span style="font-weight: bold">batchfile</span> is such a script. So is a <span style="font-weight: bold">makefile</span>, only it has vastly superior options, although they are a little more complex at first. 
<br/>
The idea of makefiles is that you <span style="font-weight: bold">create rules for certain actions</span> (say, turning a C file into an object file). You can then create a list of C files and the makefile will take care of the rest.
<br/>
Okay, so it's a <span style="font-style: italic">little</span> more complicated than that, but you can write makefiles that act like that. In fact, the DKP Makefiles do just that and go one further: you only have to tell it the directories source files are in, and it will get collect all the source files in those directories automatically.
<br/>
<br/>
Now the question is how to run those makefiles (*sigh* <span style="font-style: italic">finally</span>!). The tool that can run makefiles is called '<span style="font-weight: bold">make</span>' and can be found in the msys/bin directory, which was added to the PATH by devkitPro. This means you can run it from anywhere. make is written in such a way that it'll try to execute the file called 'Makefile' in the current directory, which is why makefiles are generally called "<span style="font-weight: bold">Makefile</span>". 
<br/>
Again, it's possible to tell Windows to run make by double-clicking on a makefile (just like you would a batchfile), but it's better to it from inside a programmer's editor like <span style="font-weight: bold">Programmer's Notepad 2</span> (PN2), which comes with the DKP installation.
<br/>
<br/>
Most editors can be customized to run shell commands on the currently active file. However, these usually have to be configured manually. That said, the editors also have a native <span style="font-weight: bold">'project' file</span>, with which you can manage the files of the project, and sometimes the tools to build the project as well. Because makefiles are fairly universal, these project files may already be set-up to run make.
<br/>
This is the case for PN2. Its project files have the extension <span style="font-weight: bold">.pnproj</span>, and when you've opened one of those, <span style="font-weight: bold">Alt+1</span> will run make in the directory of the project file. If you look in the DKP examples or tonc's projects, you'll see that all of them have .pnproj files and makefiles in their directories, so all you have to do is open the project file in PN2 and hit Alt+1.
<br/>
<br/>
This is essentially how and why things are done the way they are. You mentioned you used java and flash already. There are analogous items there as well. In java, for example, there's also a java compiler that needs to go over all the .java files to create the byte code. I assume it you've been working with an IDE for that. Those also have project files to manage the source files and build rules. It's just that the IDE takes care of all that stuff automatically. But for GBA/NDS homebrew, you have to get your hands dirty a little.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>cearn wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Use the devkitPro templates and the structure in the examples there.

<br/>
Apparently this wasn't quite as true as I'd hoped. If you open the .pnproj file, you can use Alt+1 to run make in that directory. But just opening the makefile doesn't work. Sorry, my bad. 
<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to make it work, though. In the Tools-&gt;Options dialog, there are 'Files' and 'Tools' settings with which you can create rules to run make when a file called Makefile is open.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'd prefer to avoid doing this, it adds an extra layer of complexity to an otherwise simple operation. The way I set up PN2 means that ALT 1 or Tools-&gt;make *always* builds the project regardless of what file you're looking at, provided you opened the .pnproj file or created a project in the first place.
<br/>
<br/>
The devkitPro .pnproj files are actually set up so that it finds the source files automatically using the magic folders too. This keeps everything as simple as possible so beginners aren't overwhelmed by the whole experience.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's the theory anyway. In practice I need to get all this documented and put on devkitpro.org for reference so people can point to it instead of using their own particular flavour of howto.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
