    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">in devkitadvance, you have to literally "draw" the text to the screen with pixels and lots of annoying for loops. But in visualHAM there is a function to just print out to the emulator screen any text just like a "printf();" or a"cout" statement in c. Is there anyway to do that with devkitadv? or is there a place to download header/library files so that i can do that? any help is much appreciated

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, posprintf is just a GBA-oriented replacement for sprintf, which doesn't innately handle console printing (unless there's an output buffer, like stdout, for it to write to).

Such things are emulator-dependent. My guess is it's probably implemented through a SWI call. You might be able to find out more on VBA's homepage.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The general technique: <ol type="1"><li>Format your output using siprintf() or posprintf(). </li><li>Write the text to the screen using something that implements puts(). </li></ol>
<br/>
For step 2, you might want to try my <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#agbtty" target="_blank">AGBTTY</a> library, which implements putc(), puts(), and write() in a way that's familiar to people coming from C on a PC.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
