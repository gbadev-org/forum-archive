<br/>
<br/>
Total newbie with GBA programming...
<br/>
<br/>
Although C/C++/Assembler seems wisest solutions for writing GBA software, I'm still interested of Dragon Basic. Anyone heard of it or have used it ?
<br/>
The site seems to be down, I managed to find older version (1.38 or so),
<br/>
but haven't found any kind of manual. If anyone could help with this, sending manual and/or where to find the author of the program, it is shareware and if I'm going to use it I want also pay for it !
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for advance, have read stuff here, excellent place !
<br/>
<br/>
