    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Whats the best way to make a platform game? Right now, I've managed to make a single screen Platform movement with collision (without scrolling) in mode4, and a Platform level appear in Tile mode. The tile mode I know how to scroll, but in Mode4, I have no idea how to make a scrolling level.. In Mode4 I know how to work with the sprites, and have a nice character move around the screen following your input, but in TileModes, I dont.. Can you guys help me out? Again :D So far your help is very much appreciated.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you use tile mode 0, you can have access to twice the amount of memory for sprites. If you want to do background scrolling, I recommend using a tile mode rather than mode 4. Is there a specific reason why you want to use mode 4 for your demo? :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">no other reason than the fact that I started with the crashcourse for GBA dev. and thats Mode4 :) I'll use mode0 then! 1 thing though, Mode 0 dont support more than 256 colors right? Caus so far I've only managed to convert a 256-color .bmp to a .pcx, and that to a .h file. I never got a high-color image on the screen. And there's games out there that have high color GFX. Like that Sushi the Cat demo. I like that game :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tile modes only support 16 and 256 colour tiles/sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
Before you output your bitmap in your image editor, make sure you convert them to index colour mode (16 colours or 256 colours).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, when you get a bit more experienced, you can actually display more than 256 colors at a time, but it involves vcount trickery - ah nevermind, wrong place for this post...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
