    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using visual ham to interface with HAM lib. I'm using the latest versions of both (vham 2.6, ham 2.8) but everytime I try to make a build i get an error that says  </span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">'make.exe' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
i would have posted this question in the ham forums but they seem fairly inactive. can anyone help me or give me some insight to what I'm doing wrong? any help would greatly be appreciated. thanks,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First, type make at a command line to make sure your command line stuff is set correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
If it is, it looks like visual Ham is using a different environment than your standard windows one...look for path options within your ham compile settings.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Additional to the answers above, you may have luck and Peter read this question in here. He is also very helpfull and active in the ham forum! (But if nobody has a question, there is no need to answer one ;-) ) Some other HAM/HEL developers are also very helpfull at the HAM forum. You should try this out, because it is more specialized. AFAIK there are a config file for the HAM and VHam environment, but I do not have the name handy.
<br/>
Make also sure there is NO space inside the folder names!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Under the Advanced-&gt;Options-Environment have you defined the HAMDIR and PATH symbols correctly?  Are you using devKitPro or the tools with Ham?  I am using devKitPro so I have the following defined:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
HAMDIR - c:\devkitPro
<br/>
PATH - %HAMDIR%;%HAMDIR%\tools\win32;%VHAM_BIN%;%PATH%
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
My System PATH is:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
(stuff);c:\devkitPro\msys\bin;(more stuff)
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
The error you are getting is telling you that the make utility can not be found using your standard path.  Once that can be found then the make can add more things to the PATH during it's execution.
<br/>
<br/>
Note: Do <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> place the tools or your projects in folders that have spaces in them from the root of the drive.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks for all the help. i feel really stupid but it turns out i had the HAMDIR variable set incorrectly. I had it set for a different directory for a previous installation of ham. thanks again.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't worry about it ... things can happen.  I have a student in my class this month that can compile any code for the GBA but can not link any of it.  The collect2 utility is failing with an "unknown error".  I have been looking at the environment variables and everything and I still can't locate the issue.  The debugging of the type of problem you had is pretty straight forward once you recognize what the error message is trying to tell you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
