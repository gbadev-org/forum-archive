    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
    I'm trying to make a healthy meter bar using sprite, whenever the enemy ship hits it will narrow down, how to do this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So many ways.  Here's a subset of normal or more exotic ways:
<br/>
<br/>
You could:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Have 1 frame of animation per pixel of the sprite bar and show the frame the most closely matches the amount of health remaining.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Scale a sprite in the X direction if its uniform color or you don't mind the picture on it stretching.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Create a 9 frame sprite going from a blank 8xN rectangle to full and display that multiple times
<br/>
<br/>
4. Setup the bar in multiple palette ramps and change the palette over time to make the bar disappear (palette animation)
<br/>
<br/>
5. Make sure the background behind the bar is a uniform color and place 2 sprites - 1 being the HUD bar, the other on top of it and slide it back to reveal the bar (or hide it).
<br/>
<br/>
6. Use the hardware windowing registers to obscure sprites in that region of the screen to control visibility.
<br/>
<br/>
7. Align the bar vertically and use HBlank interrupts to turn the sprite on and off (or move it) depending on the scanline.  Reset in VBlank.
<br/>
<br/>
8. Create a sprite with multiple frames and have each frame change in 8 pixels in the X.  Have a second sprite under it that is an 8x8 sprite.  Slide the smaller sprite under the larger for animation.
<br/>
<br/>
9. Forego sprites completely and update the BG instead with most of the above methods.  With scroll registers and windowing, you can do a lot of tricks with BGs.
<br/>
<br/>
You get the idea.  I would strongly suggest looking at other people's code for in-game solutions to this very common task.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you read Tonc on the subject?  Read the following 2 pages and then let us know whether you understand (great!), have a few specific questions (great!) or don't understand at all (uh oh), so we know where to start helping.
