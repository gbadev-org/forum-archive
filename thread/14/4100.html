    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well you have to keep in mind that the GBA uses completely different hardware than the PC. I'm sure you would end up writing gamer maker from scratch for the GBA. I believe HAM and Catapult both work similar to <span style="font-style: italic">Game Maker</span> functions. The best idea is to design it without using GM.
<br/>
<br/>
With the computer you can just add as many sprites, graphics and music but with the GBA you are limited.
<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck if you are trying to make something to port GM files to the GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
