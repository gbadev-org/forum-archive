    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe Eclipse is an IDE for Java...you need c, c++ or ARM ASM to write game boy advance games.
<br/>
<br/>
I am currently working on a compiler in eclipse (javacc) and do not think it supports c, c++ or ARM asm.
<br/>
<br/>
My favorite IDE for game boy advance programming is HAM. You do not have to use their libraries, but thats an added bonus and a quick way to start coding if you wish to do so.
<br/>
<br/>
You can get it from the tools page of this site under compilers.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the cdt plugin is quite good in the new m7 version of eclipse 3.0 and the code completion is now finally working quite good but can get some improvements. Eclipse is my favorite ide since i know it and i prefere it alot against Visual studio .net even in c++. i even pulled it of to get debbugin working within eclipse using gdb and vba-sdl.
