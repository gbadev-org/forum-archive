    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello gang, I'm just starting off with this developing, and I was wondering which do you guys recommend is better to use, HAM v2.8 or DevKitPro.  I currently have both installed, I just find with DevkitPro there is much more manual things that need to be done in order to go from source &gt; .gba file.
<br/>
<br/>
I also am not really sure why but I keep getting some errors with DevKitPro when I go to run make, i have a build.bat file that I got premade, and it still is giving me errors.  So my question, would it be easier to just stick with HAM, or will i be missing some of the flexibility of DevKitPro?
<br/>

Thanks again for all your help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

From that TONC website I have copied and pasted exactly what they had done for their first.c program, but all I get is a white screen on my GBA (i made sure to change -specs=gba_mb.specs to -specs=gba.mb) and it will output a .gba file and say "Rom Fixed!" like it is supposed to, but I load it up and it's just a white screen... here is the code:
<br/>
<br/>
first.c:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
// First demo. You are not expected to understand it 
<br/>
// (don't spend too much time trying and read on).
<br/>
// But if you do understand (as a newbie): wow!
<br/>
<br/>
int main()
<br/>
{
<br/>
    *(unsigned int*)0x04000000 = 0x0403;
<br/>
<br/>
    ((unsigned short*)0x06000000)[120+80*240] = 0x001F;
<br/>
    ((unsigned short*)0x06000000)[136+80*240] = 0x03E0;
<br/>
    ((unsigned short*)0x06000000)[120+96*240] = 0x7C00;
<br/>
<br/>
    while(1);
<br/>
<br/>
    return 0;
<br/>
}
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
and the makefile (first.mak):
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">

# first.mak
<br/>

# a minimal makefile (and I do mean minimal, look to the others
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I have it setup like on their website with Programmer's Notepad so all I have to do is hit F9 and it will use make automatically.
<br/>

Thanks again for bearing with me, like I said I am new and appreciate any help i can get!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You may have caught devkitPro in something of a transitional phase, where it was found that the linkscripts sometimes didn't work correctly. See <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=85977" target="_blank">here</a> for example. This should be fixed in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro r19a</a>, which came out just a few days ago.
<br/>
<br/>
Also (mostly for the rest I guess), the code posted is indeed the first example, quickly followed that this is not how one's supposed to write code (and why). Just to make that clear.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I installed the update and now everything is working.
<br/>
<br/>
(now only if i could find all the hair i ripped off the top of my head ~.^ )
<br/>
<br/>
by the way your last statement, i apologize but did i post code improperly? or was I just not supposed to post it at all?
<br/>
<br/>
in any case,... THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP!!!  I had devkitpro installed for 2 weeks, like you said in transition... I should check on the updates more often!

<br/>
Thanks again!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
