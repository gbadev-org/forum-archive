    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a project that uses the Ham/Hel libraries, but I would like to compile it using the DevKitArm tools..
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know how the libraries (EABI Elf Version 0?) can be modified for arm-eabi (EABI 4 DevKitArm toolchain)?
<br/>
<br/>
BTW anyone know if HAM/HEL development is discontinued?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't answer the first part of that question, but as for the latter, yes, I believe development on HAM has been discontinued.
<br/>
<br/>
It seems the lead developer has abandoned the use of HAM (specifically VisualHAM) in favor of Visual C++. 
<br/>
<br/>
This information sucks because I just printed out Jonathan Harbour's e-book on developing for the GBA using HAM!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not a good book to learn from (despite the author's credentials); start with a standard book on C++ on the PC, then the tonc tutorials (see the C++ thread for details).
<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would reiterate the main point of learning a C++ book on the PC; they teach you the basics you need to learn to at least be able to understand the tonc tutorials, and provide you with an easier environment to work on (with a great debugger, etc.).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow! Good to know that double-checking what I'm taught will go a long way in the end. I also read the follow-up by Tonc....WOW!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
