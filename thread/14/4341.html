    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can try insightgdb with VBA sdl but it isnt very user friendly to set up. Using it takes a little getting used to as well

The debugger itself is pretty standard and was very useful finding bugs during our project..<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've never been big on source-level debuggers; although the value is obvious they are always such a pain to set up and run, even once you have them properly configured.
<br/>
<br/>
VBA, meanwhile, offers a wealth of tools that are straightforward and easy to use that are good for most types of debugging, even if it requires code recompiles to track down the bug.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree with Dan, I find VBA to be fully sufficient for debugging GBA programs.

OAM viewer, tile viewer, map viewer, memory viewer, palette viewer.  If you can't find your answer in there, then I don't think an answer exists.  It can be tricky to get started but once you get the hang of it, you won't need a source-level debugger.

When I first started I tried all the avaliable debuggers because I figured I had to have one, but they were nothing but headaches.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No$gba has read/write to memory/register/whatever break points.  That by itself is why I use it almost exclusively (over my SN hardware even.)  I'm also very comfotable with its archaic format as I worked with the GBC version as well.  It also has some nice debug feratures that allow you to catch illegal writes to ROM areas, and other illegal acitivites that really help when debugging (it's becomes really obvious when dereferencing NULL when you have no$ exceptions to help!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
