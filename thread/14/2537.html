    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is no "inherent" way to display text on the GBA. Even if you can find someone else's library that has a version of printf() (such as the one in HAM), you'll still need to know a fair bit more about GBA programming to get it to work. You're better off starting with simple images and pictures (sprites), and working your way up to text.
<br/>
<br/>
Start with <a class="postlink" href="http://www.thepernproject.com" target="_blank">The Pern Project</a> tutorials or the tutorials at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbajunkie.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.gbajunkie.co.uk</a>. Once you've worked through all the tutorials you'll be in a much better position to start coming up with a way to display text.
