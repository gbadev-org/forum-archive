    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am new to GBA programming, and I just finished reading the FAQ.  I was wondering if there were any comprehensive Dragon BASIC tutorials that could teach me the basics and allow me to get a small game up and running.

Thanks in advance,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are a few tutorials on the Dragon BASIC website, along with a couple full game programs (complete with source). The Dragon BASIC forum is also a great place to chat with others that use it. But definitely stick around here, too... there is a wealth of knowledge and people willing to share it!
