    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm a GBA Newbie.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using gfx2gba to get a map into mode 0 bg 0. I'm using the code from Johnathan Harbour's book at <a href="http://www.jharbour.com/" target="_blank">http://www.jharbour.com/</a> (Thanks! Eagerly awaiting the rest of the chapters) (it's the Scrolling background example at the start of chapter 6).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I'm sure the code isn't the problem. (unless something to do with the map size).
<br/>
<br/>
Basically the map is 512x160 pixels. When I show it the rows are in the wrong order. I get a full 512 length row as 2 shorter rows so i get an interleaved effect. <a href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~beetle/Example.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Now I seem to remember something about the tilemap being divided into sectors but I can't find it again. How can I get gfx2gba to output the map in the right order?
<br/>
<br/>
Or if that isn't the problem what else is there to try?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are two ways to store a tile map: paged and linear. GBA text modes use paged maps; rot/scale modes use a linear map. It seems gfx2gba with the settings you give is storing it linearly. It's straightforward to convert a linear map to paged at run time: just copy only the first 32 bytes or the last 32 bytes of a line of map spaces. It's also a bit easier to scroll on a "big" map (&gt;64x64 tiles) if it's stored linearly.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for replying so fast. 
<br/>
<br/>
I've got it sorted now.
<br/>
<br/>
I used a nested loop to copy my whole map into the BG tile memory with the right layout.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I can move along finally :)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
