    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I am very new to gba development.  I have been playing with the emulators and the visual HAM ide for a while.  So I ordered this multiboot cable from lik-sang.com which connects to the parallel port of the pc and the multiplayer port on the gba.  The documentation that came with it (a couple of readme files and a faq on the diskette that the cable came with) are confusing and in some places contradictory.  I am using windows xp sp2 so if someone has any experience using this cable on win xp sp2 and they can let me know what I am doing wrong (so far I always get an error claiming that there is nothing attached to the parallel port) it would be greatly appreciated.  Also I appologize in advance if this issue has lready been addressed.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
you might want to search for a program called "userport" to open up I/O acces in windows xp for the parallel port.
<br/>
Because in windows xp, unlike windows 98, it's shielded of.
<br/>
<br/>
So give it a try and otherwise I wouldn't know.<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried out the userport stuff.  It simply didn't work.  I found out that in XP direct access to the parallel port is not allowed, and the userport program only works with certain motherboards.  But I have found that the linux port of the mb program works perfectly (I guess I should have known from years of development in windows and linux that if you want to do something, xp is no way to go).  Thanks for the reply though.  But I use visual ham in xp when i want to use the full ide, and then I copy the .gba file over to my linux machine and test it out on the actual game boy.  I'm told that doing stuff with serial and parallel ports was easier in the pre win2000 days.
