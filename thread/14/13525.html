    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone.
<br/>
I've decided on making at least a demo using an isometric viewpoint, but I think I might have some problems with the rendering of the isometric tiles with the square tile system on the GBA. The best solution I have been able to think up is to use one layer with all even isometric tiles and another underneath the first with all odd tiles. 
<br/>
<br/>
eg. (0 means bg0, 1 means bg1)
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
/ \ / \ / \
<br/>
 1   1   1
<br/>
\ / \ / \ /
<br/>
0  0   0  0
<br/>
/ \ / \ / \
<br/>
 1   1   1
<br/>
\ / \ / \ /
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
The problem comes when I need to use elevated isometric tiles. Is there any easy way to utilize elevated isometric tiles without making a sprite for each tile? I would much prefer it if there were some way to do it in hardware (or software) as opposed to having to draw height transition tiles.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in ADV, (lol @ ADV)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could store a basemap with all the groundtiles. Then with a elevationmap you iterate through the map (starting from the bottom) and manually elevate the tiles by changing the tile-indices accordingly. In this case you can have a lot of elevations. But the downsides are the elvations are always 8px and to make a change in the map you have to rebuild it (with the basemap).
<br/>
<br/>
If you have dynamic height elevations and just a few of them, use sprites!
<br/>
<br/>
I can't think of anything else.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Compare solstice for nes with Snake Rattle n Roll for nes.  Both are isometric.  The simple shadows of snake rattle n roll generally make it pretty easy to understand where things are.  Solstice is a nightmare (though a pretty cool game, nonetheless)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Fact: <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice_%28video_game%29" target="_blank">Solstice</a> was published by CSG Imagesoft, which became <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Imagesoft" target="_blank">Sony Imagesoft</a>, which became 989 Studios.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd never heard of Solstice before. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/solstice-the-quest-for-the-staff-of-demnos/screenshots/gameShotId,32484/" target="_blank">Looks</a> a lot like <a class="postlink" href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0002259" target="_blank">Head Over Heels</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cpczone.net/index.php?game=102" target="_blank">Batman</a>. Someone did a GBA remake of Batman a few years ago - they used sprites for the in-room objects. Using tile layers is probably too limiting, you can't have "over-under-over" layouts, where your character can walk behind an object while being partially obscured by another, without sprites. Otherwise you're stuck to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamecritics.com/review/tacticsogregba/screen01.jpg" target="_blank">Tactics Ogre</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.warmech.net/special/awards/sidequest-ffta.png" target="_blank">FFTA</a> style isometrics; low in one corner and high in the opposite one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It does look really similar.  Solstice was a really fun puzzle/adventure game, but the lack of shadows giving perspective really hurt the playability.
<br/>
<br/>
It never occurred to me to question technically how they made it.  On the nes, not having multiple background layers, I would guess that all the terrain stuff, blocks and whatnot, were all sprites, so, like you suggested, they could layer everything nicely.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another approach I'd forgotten about: Monster Max on the Game Boy (classic B&amp;W one) is by the same team responsible for the two 8-bit Spectrum games I mentioned earlier. It uses the tile mode as a bitmap and then implements its own isometric sprite and tile engine pixel by pixel. 
<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't emulated too well on any of the GB emulators I tried it on a couple of years ago. I don't know too much about the old-skool GB hardware, but I assume the problem was due to the timing required for the vram bank switching used in the game to get enough video for the "bitmap". The video glitching seen in emus certainly gave that impression. Perhaps Solstice does something similar within the tile modes? 
<br/>
<br/>
While spectacular on an 8-bit, I can't help but feel that the same approach on the DS or GBA would be a bit of a cop out, not using all the hardware available to you. The sprite idea seems more elegant, even if it limits the engine to an absolute best 128 blocks per room.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
