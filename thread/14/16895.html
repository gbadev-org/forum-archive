    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To my knoweldge, there is no way to "transform" a GBA game into an NDS game unless you have the source and assets for the game in particular, make the necessary adjustments of the code and assets because of the hardware differences, and compile it all as an NDS program.
<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean by "transform", and what game is it in particular? If it has anything to do with commercial games, then keep in mind, this is a homebrew website/forum, and we don't deal with or encourage piracy.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My guess is that he used NDStation, which confuses people by taking in a .gba file and outputting a .nds file.  However, it only works when a 3in1 expansion pack is inserted in slot-2.  This is because the .nds file is really just the GBA binary with a small loader program attached to the front.  When executed, it loads the GBA file into the 3in1's RAM and then launches it in GBA mode.  Without a 3in1, it will not work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
