<br/>
<br/>
Im about to make a "game" which can be used as a text editor. 
<br/>
The thing is, the docs are encrypted. I want to use my gba micro to save my passwords. I have a EZ Flash IV.
<br/>
<br/>
So Ive never programmed something in C, but its worth a try.
<br/>
I tried to learn the language some time ago, but the thing with the pointers is pretty hard to learn.
<br/>
I see the concept behind it, but the gba-tutorials dont go very deep into this topic.
<br/>
<br/>
I think Im going to use this code f?r the en- and decryption part: 
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The text will be unformatted, some KB big. I want to create more than one container.
<br/>
So maybe 4 containers (textfiles) which can be choosed to open and saved with a individual password. 
<br/>
<br/>
The EZ Flash has the function, to not loose the informations when its shut down.
<br/>
Well - this will be a secure problem for me, so I am looking for ideas how I can handle this.
<br/>
There should be no encrypted data on the modul when I shut it down.
<br/>
<br/>
Savegames are the crypted textfiles.
<br/>
<br/>
The encryption should be fast, thats the main point.
<br/>
I dont want a good looking design, when it slows down the encryptionengine.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
short: How do I start? Does something like this exists already?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
