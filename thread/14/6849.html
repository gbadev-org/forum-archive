    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Merely setting the video mode isn't enough; all the drawing functions will still think it's mode 4. OK, technically the screen will use mode 3, but you'll just end up with garbage.
<br/>
<br/>
It's may be possible to go from mode 4 to mode 3, but it largely depends on the code existing code. If you're relying on specific mode 4 things like palette animation, you can pretty much forget it. If you're merely drawing things, it may be possible.
<br/>
If you've used a sensible naming scheme for all the drawing functions (say "m3_xxx" for mode 3 functions, "m4_xxx" for mode 4 functions) you can do a global search and replace to change all the prefixes. 
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you'll also need to use the actual colors for the pixels, rather than palette indices, but if the code's still simple, that shouldn't be too hard.
<br/>
<br/>
And there's no flipping buffers, that'll have to be removed as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
