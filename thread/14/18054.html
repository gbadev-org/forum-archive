    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm sure this is the wrong place to ask, but I couldn't find anywhere else more appropriate. That said, I've been trying to read through some tutorials online and I'm still having trouble grasping the basics of GBA programming in C and would appreciate a tutor of some kind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am not sure you will get an offer to be your tutor but you can post questions here. I will say that if you do not have experience with C programming then you would be better off learning that first on a pc. Windows and Linux have better tools for debugging - single step debuggers etc. it is not impossible to learning by programming for the gba but it is definitely more difficult. 
<br/>
<br/>
That being said:
<br/>
Download the build environment devkitpro.org and set it up. 
<br/>
Build the examples
<br/>
run the examples
<br/>
Modify the examples
<br/>
<br/>
When you have specific questions come back here. Specific code examples identifying what you are trying are encouraged. And be sure to identify the expected output and how your output differs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right, I know C and have devkitpro, but I'm having trouble understanding the GBA specific bits like memory addresses and such.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have you read <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/" target="_blank">tonc</a>? It's really the best tutor for GBA-specific programming that there is.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure many of us here would do a better job of teaching you than it does, even if we tried.
<br/>
<br/>
But we'd be happy to answer questions that you have while reading tonc. If you need clarification about something you read there, we're happy to answer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So go on with your specific questions :)
<br/>
As for the memory: GBA accesses ROM (in the cartridge), Internal (fast!) RAM [IWRAM], External (slow) RAM [EWRAM] and Video RAM [VRAM].

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Go to <a href="http://www.coranac.com/projects/tonc/" target="_blank">http://www.coranac.com/projects/tonc/</a> and download the example code (20130324: example code (v1.4.2): tonc-code.zip)
<br/>
<br/>
Follow the tutorial to set things up and run and examine the example programs.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently working on a GBA game myself, and making extensive use of the libtonc library, which is included in the tonc-code.zip file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
