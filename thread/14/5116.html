    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've read perhaps four diagrams about which pins go where in the homemade XBOO cable made from the GBA to GBA cable and a parallel plug, and I've read conflicting data.  When you're looking at which pin goes where, do you start numbering looking at it from the outside or the inside?  I just went to the trouble of soldering everything together and I just now saw a diagram with the pins reversed, and I'm not sure which one is right.  The image shows number 1 in the upper right and 13 in the upper left ... and I may have soldered 13 to 1 and vice versa.  Thanks for the help!!  :-)<br/>_________________<br/>Brian Chambers

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hrm.  Been to many web sites since my first posting and I've found more contradictories than ever.  I think that what I need is for someone that's built a cable to confirm which color cables go to which pin numbers on the parallel connector.  I've seen diagrams with the numbering done three different ways, and my voltmeter is so large that when I touch the other end to the GBA cable port, it touches two wires at once, so I can't be sure which color matches which hole in the port.  As I said, I've looked in the FAQ and through tons of other places, but I thought since I've found contradictory information it would be best to post here and see what you have to say about it.

<br/>
<br/>
look in the downloads section for Xboo Communicator.
<br/>
<br/>
there are docs provided and a nice diagram.

In case of confusion, <a class="postlink" href="http://graga.tri-bit.biz/xboo.html" target="_blank">my xboo site</a> has a schematic that might be a little more clear.
