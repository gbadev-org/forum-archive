<br/>
<br/>
"Decompilation" normally means "to convert binary code back to the language it was compiled from". Most GBA games being written in C/C++, this is instantly deemed nigh impossible.
<br/>
<br/>
What you mean is "disassembling", which is "to convert binary code into the assembly language it's native platform uses". Right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Decompiling involves 1. disassembling the binary code (trivial), and 2. generating plausible C code that could be compiled into such assembly language code (the subject of PhD research). Decompilers exist, but you probably can't afford a good one.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
