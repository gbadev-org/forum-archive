    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I was searching today for informations about the Gameboy internals and I discovered the wonderful gbspec.txt file. I was wondering where do the informations it contains come from (reverse-engineering? Nintendo? (If so, are the original documents available?)). As I was unable to find the information on the web, I hope someone here will be able to tell me.
<br/>
Thanks a lot.
<br/>
Regards,
<br/>

Martin Korth is the guy behind nocash; and if you go to the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.work.de/nocash/gmb.htm#STUFF" target="_blank">nocash_gameboy</a> site there is an updated <a class="postlink" href="http://www.work.de/nocash/pandocs.htm" target="_blank">html version of the gameboy pandoc</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks keldon for your answer. But do you know where do the original informations gbspec.txt (or gbadev) contains come from? Mainly from developers who had access to the official documentation or from reverse-engineering?
<br/>
Thanks again</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Experimentation with hardware. Maybe some people believe there was a look at official documents; but undocumented features are listed - which leads me to believe that developers informed Martin Korth that features and information not documented by Nintendo featured in the pandoc.
<br/>
<br/>
Once the XBoo cable was created it was possible to run code on the gameboy without the need for a cartridge. Plus you have to remember that the processor is nothing special so code will always be created; it's just a case of finding the hardware!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was just pointing out that much more experimentation could take place with the XBoo cable without the need for any additional hardware. Trade secret documents are not needed to reach that state; a gameboy can boot from the serial cable! Once you have created the cable you can experiment using the information you know. If you dump data sent from another gameboy then you will also get code that alters VRAM and give you access to information on how to configure the gameboy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
But did it take trade secret documents to learn <span style="font-style: italic">how</span> to make the serial cable (and, in the case of 8-bit Game Boy systems, the cartridge that drives the client side of the serial cable)? How did reverse engineers get from 0 to serial cable?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would think that the xboo cable would fairly simple to figure out; the GB serial controller could still be carried out without knowing how the gameboy works.
<br/>
<br/>
What puzzles me is how other information was figured out, such as alternative opcodes; without documentation you run the risk of causing damage. Although if you sacrificed your gameboy you could probe its processor using additional hardware!
<br/>
<br/>
p.s. my mistake on names, xboo is the parallel cable for the gba</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My mistake; I was searching for documentation but I cannot remember much of how things were done on the GB in terms of getting it to run on hardware. I used to compile and run everything in nocash as I never had the money for hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
