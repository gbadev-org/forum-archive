    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am experiencing a problem similar to that of the OP. However, simply removing the #error line has not solved the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
elif __GNUC__ == 3
<br/>
	#define LONG_CALL __attribute__ ((long_call))
<br/>
<br/>
Still isn't defined, so I added it within the #else. 
<br/>
<br/>
While this solved the LONG_CALL error the compiler was throwing at me, I am still left with __attribute__ ((packed)) being ignored on the structures krawall define. I have no idea on wether this will cause adverse effects: I assume that changing the alignment of the data would break Krawall, but I've read somehwhere that this particula warning might be triggered if the packed attribute has no effects, IE, doens't really change the alignment.
<br/>
<br/>
So, to sum it up, I'm getting rpetty confused. Has anyone else made Krawall worked with the most recent release of DevKitARM (18), and if so, was a fix needed for the packing of the data?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.
<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: It seems that my converted data was the problem after all. Switching to another song fixed everything. I'd assume this means that the ignored attribute really isn't a concern.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
