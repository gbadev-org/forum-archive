    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For GBA stuff you should probably use C. I'm not saying that C is definately better or anything, but most tutorials you will find are written for C.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Of course, either C or C++ should work fine for most compilers. Most C and C++ code is interchangable, except for the new C++ features. However, learning one of them <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> kinda important...<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you have programmed in pascal and java before then it is likely that you are comfortable with 'programming'. The 'de-facto' dev environment for gba dev is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/index.php" target="_blank">DevKitPro</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Java has memory management built in whereas c++ does not so you will have to get used to handling it yourself - not to mention the fact that java principles encourages code which relies on dynamic data reallocation.
<br/>
<br/>
Well enough of the issues as you will encounter and conquer each. Next stop is the <a class="postlink" href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/tonc/" target="_blank">tonc tutorials</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Once you are through with them get started on clones of simple games - such as tetris and pong.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And read up on pointers.  That is the one area where the differences between C or C++ and Java will bite you with gba dev.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you do choose to use the Tonc tutorials, remember that you are bound to get heavily confused at some point, and it may be worth reading through a lesser guide beforehand, which explains the more basic ideas in much more detail.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
