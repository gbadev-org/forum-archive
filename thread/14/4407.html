    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
Could someone give some insight in newbie terms into why coding multiplayer is riddled with problems?  One thing I'm particularly interested in is how data packets would get lost or fail to transmit.  What is it that causes this to happen on a direct gba link?
<br/>
