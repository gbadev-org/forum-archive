poking around <a href="http://www.gbadev.org" target="_blank">www.gbadev.org</a> I saw that they said they might host your project site, so I wrote a site about gba dev and linux <a href="http://linux.gbadev.org" target="_blank">http://linux.gbadev.org</a> is where it is now, SimonB put it up today or last night. It has all of my findings so far (and I ported some other peoples demo code). there are instructions and links for a working compiler, you will have to compile it yourself though 8)
<br/>
good luck</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
