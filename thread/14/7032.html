    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, you can extract a commercial ROM with the right hardware, and as long as you own the ROM and don't distribute it on the web, it's perfectly legal. I believe the Flash Advance Linker can do it, but I've never used it, so I'm not sure.
<br/>
<br/>
For other illegal purposes, say opening a commercial ROM that you do not own there are sites, but I don't believe I'm allowed to post them, where you can download them for free. This is totally illegal, and nintendo even has a documant on their website concerning the issue. ROM sites generally claim that you CAN do this if and only if you wish to test the game out and promise to delete it from your system within 24 hours. Of course, this doesn't apply to games you own.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, for the sake of benefit of the doubt in this discussion, I'll assume that the OP has used some sort of flash linker to copy a GBA Game Pak to a file on the PC. (This is thought in legitimate circles to be permitted under 17 USC sections 107 and 117.)
<br/>
<br/>
Extracting the resources then depends on what kind of resource it is and how it is compressed. You could try looking at the file in an audio editor that supports raw files (usually in 8-bit signed mode). You could try looking at the file in a tile editor that supports common GBA formats (1-bit, 2-bit Virtual Boy, 4-bit GBA, and 8-bit mode 7) such as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/pc/#ted" target="_blank">8TED</a>. You could try logging BIOS calls (especially BitUnPack, CpuFastSet, and anything with UnComp in the name) in a debugging emulator. ROM hacking sites will have a lot more information on the specifics of these procedures.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wrote a simple program a while back called gfxhunt which you can find on these forums somewhere. You attach a ROM to this binary and it allows you to decompress graphics using Visualboy Advance. If you locate the right addresses using Tepples idea of logging BIOS calls, you can then use gfxhunt to view them. It's probably just easier to rip out the graphics and write your own decompression routines though ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
