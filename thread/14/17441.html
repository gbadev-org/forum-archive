    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not only has devkitAdv been dead for years, but that particular link gave my Avast! Antivirus a nice Malware warning. If you didn't get such a warning with your anti-virus program, or don't have one, then I suggest you go get something. Avast! Antivirus is free for personal use, so there is an option.

Go to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org" target="_blank">devKitPro</a> to get what we use for GBA/DS programming.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The zip file works fine for me, no viruses found from Microsoft Security Essentials.
<br/>
Also devkitadv is old and not properly configured like a modern ARM gcc distribution.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
