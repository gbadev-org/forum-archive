    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, With Mode 4 we draw two pixels at a time, but if i want smooth scrolling like that of super mario etc, they move the screen in 1px increments, how is this possible, if we have to draw two pixels per time????
<br/>
<br/>
any help is appreciated.<br/>_________________<br/>Chris Davis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Read/write access to VRAM are 16 bits.  If you want to draw a single pixel, get the pixel you want and his neighhor (total of 16 bits).  Modify the pixel you want and keep the other pixel value.  Finally re-write the total 16 bits value to VRAM.

I've never done any scrolling in mode 4 but I guess that, depending of what you want to do, you should considered tiles mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
