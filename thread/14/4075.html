    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to get my stuff compiling under linux and hopefully able to use gdb/insight as well...
<br/>
However I allready got gdb/insight installed for x86 so how should I do?
<br/>
<br/>
also I downloaded the devkitARM and extracted it to a directory... been trying to use a Makefile I got from wntrmute for use in msys... however it doesn't seem to like being used with make under linux, getting the error:
<br/>
make: make: Command not found
<br/>
make: *** [build] Error 127
<br/>
So how do I make use of devkitARM under linux?<br/>_________________<br/>*Spam*

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">make should be in your path... it doesn't come with DKArm, you need a native gcc install, most linux already have it, or have it as an option on your install CD. if 'which make' doesn't tell you, then try 'locate make', it might be incorrectly installed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">which distro are you using?  usually, you should be able to install things like make using something like yum, apt-get, etc, etc.... for example, on my Fedora Core 2 box, I can do the following:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">yum install make</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
if you are using Fedora or RedHat, you can also install make by using the CD and doing the following in the directory where the make RPM is:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">rpm --install make-3.80-3.i386.rpm</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"><br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
