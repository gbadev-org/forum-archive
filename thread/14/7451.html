<br/>
<br/>
for example: i use VBA, and the velocity in some games (some of my games) is faster than in no$gba..why's this???<br/>_________________<br/>All human wisdom is summed up in these two words, - 'Wait and hope"

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, my percent is at 100 in VBA and in NO$GBA :D, but, is this the real velocity on hardware??? or the emulators changes his velocity depending on the computer...
<br/>
<br/>
i ask this because my games tested in VBA seems to run faster than games in NO$GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
i'd tested my games on another computers, and the velocity seems to be lower than mine...
<br/>
<br/>
i guess i found that out when i test my games on hardware :D<br/>_________________<br/>All human wisdom is summed up in these two words, - 'Wait and hope"

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In my experience, certain things run slightly slower on VBA than on hardware. I have no idea why. My computer is certainly beefy enough to run at 100% speed.

Want you know your "real speed," why not test on hardware?
