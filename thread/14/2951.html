And for scripting, Lua.

Then, as our pixel artist didn't start to work yet, I extract some graphics (and palettes) from GBA games with VBA 1.6a (the 1.7 version has bugs when saving palettes -_-) for tests.

Finally a little custom tool (TileQuantizer) to reindex 8*8 tiles from this graphics to the right palette they initially use.<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah.  There is that :)  Truth is though, the documentation available here is much better than supplied by Nintendo.  The only things I ever go to the docs on are stuff that Nintendo will fail you on lot check on or stuff that isn't public domain yet.  I will say that the sample code from Nintendo is a joke at best.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I wrote a little tool a while back to convert 8 or 24 bit bitmaps into paletted tiles. You can download it at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.angelfire.com/wizard/deku/program/quither/quither.zip" target="_blank">http://www.angelfire.com/wizard/deku/program/quither/quither.zip</a>. 
<br/>
It's mainly designed for 16x16 color mode, but you can tell it to do one 256 color palette too if you want. It outputs another bitmap, so you'll have to send that through another gfx converter, but with a batch file that shouldn't be a problem. Although now that I think about it an option to output raw gfx/map/pal files would be nice if I ever find time to add it.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

Then that coder needs a slap upside the head and then some code reviews for a month or so :)
<br/>
<br/>
But the samples I've seen (admittedly, only a few), were poor at best.  Every demo that does anyhting real assumes that it gets the whole CPU to do what it needs.  Their sound stuffand their Multiplayer (hahahaha) stuff are the ones that stand out.  Of course they were well commented and easy to read (nice), but the methods they use cannot be copied at all - which may be by design.  I'm still grumbling about the amount of effort needed to get multiplayer code working...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
