    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
first I want to say sprry for my bad English, becuse it is not my mother language. But I hope that everyone could understand what I am trying to say :).
<br/>
<br/>
I asked myselfe, if it would be possible to code a MP3 Player for the GBA(sp). Or would it take too much CPU power?
<br/>
<br/>
My other Question is: I have bought an GBAsp. Is it 100% compatible to the Flash Cards writers out there? I have bought it in Europe (Germany), so do I have to watch out for PAL-System, or something like that? Which tools for using my Programms on Hardware are the best? There are so many out there :).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cu,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know nothing about audio, but this question has been asked many time and apperently the Cpu power of the GBA isn't sufficient. You would need some external hardware to decode the audio.
<br/>
<br/>
But i wonder if it hold true to the lowest encoding rate.
<br/>
<br/>
As for you compaitiblity issue, as far as i'm aware, it's 100% compatible. Someone correct me if i'm wrong :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And which Flash Linker is good? Because I dont want to buy any low Quality Things :). There are so many Linkers out there (or Bridges), so taht I don't know which one is good. Should I buy a Flash linker, a Bridge or s.th. else?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Bridge allow you to connect your Pc to your Gba, and upload a game in it's Ram. Max Game size is 256k, and you lose it once the GBA is turnoff.

Usefull to debug some stuff in real time.

<br/>
Flash card allow you to store a game like if it was a regular Nintendo Cart. They come in different sizes. You can store multiple games/program on each cart. when they mention the flash cart size, it's in megaBITS, so a 256mbits cart is a 32megs cart. 
<br/>
<br/>
Most people seems to have a Flash2Advance cart. That's what i have, and i'm pretty happy with it. Pick parallel port over Usb, there seem to be lots of problem out there with USB drivers, and it doesn't give you a real increase in speed anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">[quote]Is it compatible with a GBA SP? (Just want to make sure).
<br/>
Yes 100% GBA SP compatible. All the new linkers are SP compatible. The only one that had problems with compatibility was the old Printer Port version of Flash2Adavnece F2A. [/quote
