    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I am new to the GBA scene. I decided to write an emulator for GBA to learn how to program it. I am posting to ask about the minum hardware that I need to emulate/learn to write small demos and or run freeware demos. Any feedback is welcome.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks
<br/>

Happy new year!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I may be wrong here, but I think that you should atempt to write an emulator after learning to actually make games for it, so you know what is needed. I'm sure someone else will give a better answer, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you haven't written an emulator before, then you could start off with a Chip 8 "virtual machine". That should pose enough problems for you to learn the basics of emulation and the GBA hardware. You could even write it in C and it'd be more or less fast enough.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I do have experience with emulation (wrote emus for NES and GB). 
<br/>
<br/>
I read some technical docs for GBA. All I need to start is the answer of this question: "what are the minimum feature that I need to emulate?". For example, do I need to emulate any video mode other than mode 0 &amp; 4? What are the most commonly used video mode among PD demo/games coders? Same thing goes for DMA and for sound.
<br/>
<br/>
Any input is appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you trying to emulate the GBA on the PC (hard), or are you trying to emulate something else on the GBA (easier)? "Chip 8" was an example of a platform you could emulate on the GBA.

To 'make' a GBA emulator, all you really have to do is download the VisualBoyAdvance source code and run 'make'.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, you should try to emulate a PC on the GBA :)
<br/>
<br/>
To be a bit more serious, demo/game coders usually try to use all GBA's GPU features, so emulating only modes 0 &amp; 4 is pointless.
<br/>
I contribute(d) to <a class="postlink" href="http://gpadvance.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">GPAdvance</a>, a GBA emu for GP32 that is based on the fact that a ARM9 is able to run ARM7 code (no need to emulate the processor itself). GP32 ARM9 proc can reach 200Mhz which seems much compared to GBA's 16Mhz.
<br/>
But even with all graphic modes emulated (with the help of VisualBoyAdvance source code), we're far from getting a good emulation. Some homebrew and even commercial games work, but the large majority of them don't.<br/>_________________<br/>GBA,GC,NGPC,GP32,FPGA,DS stuff at <a class="postlink" href="http://torlus.com/" target="_blank">http://torlus.com/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Very interesting indeed! How are you doing it? Are you just monitoring memory writes? If so, how are you doing it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
