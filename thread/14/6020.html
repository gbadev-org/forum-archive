    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are there any clever ways to get 64x8 sprites? I cant use 32x8 because then I need two sprites, which means I'll go over the sprite limit. At the moment I've got it with 32x8, and flip-flopping it, but it still doesn't look very good. Any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm making lasers. The thing is, they look really good as they are, with them being 32x8 and being flip flopped - except for the bit in the middle, it stands out like a sore thumb.
<br/>
<br/>
One thought I had was to record the Y location of the laser, then in Hblank when REG_VCOUNT is equal to that Y location + 4, move the laser below the screen. It didn't work - I think it was too slow =/
<br/>
<br/>
The reason I'm hitting the sprite limit is due to all the other sprites - enemies, players, shots, HUD parts, explosions etc.

Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you draw a 64x8 pixel sprite cel (say at tile locations 640-647 in sprite cel VRAM), you can display it using 2 sprites (each 32x8 pixels, set to 640 and 644).
<br/>
<br/>
If you're hitting the 128 sprite limit, now is the time to start multiplexing.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, is there any way you could use a BG for it? Maybe by drawing the lasers on one of the normal BGs, and swapping the char data between laser and transparent every frame.
<br/>
<br/>
Another possibiliy would be scaling your 32x8 sprite with double-size on. But if you have enough sprites to hit the limit, you'd most likely get dropout cause double-size scaled sprites burn GPU cycles like crazy.
<br/>
<br/>
Multiplexing probably would work best if you can't use a BG. Instead of dong it in HBlank, use the VCount interrupt so it only happens on lines where you actually need to do something.
<br/>
On each VCount, copy the OAM values for the next laser (sorted by Y coordinates) into whatever OAM entries to designate for lasers, and set up the next VCount.
<br/>
<br/>
VCount happens right at the START of a line, so you'll need to trigger it at least one line above where the sprites will actually appear. Safest to go several lines above, and have 2 sets of laser sprites. While laser A is being displayed, laser B is being moved. Then as soon as A is finished drawing, move it and wait until B finishes drawing. Keep flip-flopping until you've done all your lasers.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
