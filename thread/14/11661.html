    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a ez flash cart and usually I can load roms just fine, but I see some games on this site that are zipped and contain a bin, I put the bin on the cart and it doesnt run, I tried x-men vs sf, bejeweled and some other game. Any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all, my bejeweled game on the site doesn\'t contain a proper header, so you will need to use the EZloader to load it. This is likely the case with the other games. Also, I have found that with this cart it is often wise to burn <span style="font-style: italic">only</span> the game, and not use the loader at all. 
<br/>
<br/>
You shouldn\'t need to use the .gba extention, I believe it supports the .bin extention just fine. (Of course, try that anyway just to be sure.) When you boot just the game, does the nintendo logo show, or is it all garbled? If the logo is garbled, the game has a bad header (common among early homebrew) and you will need to fix it using the gbafix tool which I believe can be found on the site.
<br/>
<br/>
If the header (aka, logo) shows fine, and the game still doesn\'t run, you have more serious issues, likely with the cart itself. You might try running the RAM and ROM checks in the EZclient menu.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I really think the .BIN file extension should be avoided whenever a better alternative exists.

I agree, unless you're already using <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.shemes.com//viewtopic.php?t=1533&amp;highlight=gameboy" target="_blank">Grabit</a> (which <a class="postlink" href="http://filext.com/detaillist.php?extdetail=gba&amp;Search=Search" target="_blank">uses GBA</a>) or Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, or Nick-O-Matic Design Factory (which <a class="postlink" href="http://filext.com/detaillist.php?extdetail=nds&amp;Search=Search" target="_blank">use NDS</a>). But then BIN is taken if you're in the Sega Genesis scene.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
