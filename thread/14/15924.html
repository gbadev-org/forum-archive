<br/>
What are the best tools to use when you have no prior experience with programming/developing with the GBA - or anything for that matter? What should I move onto after that?
<br/>
<br/>
I apologize if this question might be a little vague, and I'll be glad to elaborate on any questions anyone might have for me about it's vagueness, but I'd like to know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you don't have much C development experience, get a book about learning C, and download a C compiler for your PC (Dev-cpp or one of the visual studio express editions are decent, easy-to-setup IDEs  with a compiler for windows), and learn C on your PC first.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

C++ is a superset of the vast majority of C. C++ is a bigger language that gives you more ways to shoot your problem, but it also gives you more ways to shoot yourself in the foot.

I've read <span style="font-style: italic">Effective C++</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">More Effective C++</span> by Scott Meyers on a tip from StoneCypher, and I recommend them. You can get them together on one CD. I've also read good things about <span style="font-style: italic">Effective STL</span> by Meyers, <span style="font-style: italic">Efficient C++</span> by Bulka and Mayhew, and possibly even some <span style="font-style: italic">C++ In-Depth</span> books if you can afford them. Just avoid anything with Herb Schildt in the byline; his books are so full of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/schildt.html" target="_blank">inaccuracies</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/bullschildt.html" target="_blank">bullschildt</a> that you'll likely be more confused after you read them.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Like Tepples said, C is a subset (for the most part) of C++, so learning C would help if you want to learn C++ down the road.  But with C++, it's quite easy to get in over your head if you aren't careful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Depending on how much time you have, you might want to pick up Java before C++.  It forces you to do things in a more or less proper object-oriented fashion and the syntax is a little cleaner depending on what you want to do.  The grammar is also much the same.
