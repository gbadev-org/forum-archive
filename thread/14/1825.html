    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA can handle mods and square roots. In order to do so in asm you make a software interrupt with swi. But you probably don't want to use assembler to do that. What you can do however is download Andrew P. Bilyk's SWI library from <a href="http://www.gbadev.org/download.php?section=demos&amp;filename=swi_libraries.zip" target="_blank">http://www.gbadev.org/download.php?section=demos&amp;filename=swi_libraries.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
One thing you might have to add to the file is at the start
<br/>
<br/>
#ifndef SWI_H
<br/>
#define SWI_H
<br/>
<br/>
and at the end
<br/>
<br/>
#endif
<br/>
<br/>
You may also need to add:
<br/>
extern "C"{
<br/>
just after #define SWI_H then a closing brace before #endif.
<br/>
You'll only need to do this if your trying to compile g++ AFAIK, though I havn't tried compiling with gcc.
<br/>
<br/>
You can look in the swi.h file to see what functions are avalible, also check out the GBATEK or COWBITE documents for more info about the SWI interrupts, I thought I'd looked at them properly but it took me a later look to understand some of the functions.
<br/>
When you include swi.h and providing you link the library with your project, you can make the simple calls:
<br/>
SWI_Mod(u32 numerator, u32 denominator);
<br/>
SWI_Sqrt(u32 number);
<br/>
You can check these out in swi.h ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Andrew for making this library for us =)
<br/>
hope that helps<br/>_________________<br/>[url="http://www.ice-d.com"]www.ice-d.com[/url]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
