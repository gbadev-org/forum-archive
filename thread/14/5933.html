I think that I'll start with the Harbour's book...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was going to recommend the Harbour book as well. I second your comment on needing more references (such as <a class="postlink" href="http://home.no/neogeo/HOVEDSIDE_INDEX/GBA_HOVEDSIDE_INDEX_ENGELSK/GBA%20HTML%20LEKSJONER%201-5/" target="_blank">these files</a>, which are useful for the bit layouts but are quite confusing as tutorials).
<br/>
<br/>
Take heed that you should check the earlier Harbour chapters for some important #define s and other concepts.

Really? Wow. I'm just starting, so I guess I wouldn't know better (yet). Why do you feel so strongly about that? Tell me about your childhood. &gt;;) [j/k]
<br/>
<br/>
But the Pern Project didn't seem to have what I was looking for. Guess I'll check the TONC reference better (which, as I see now, looks like just what I need). Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Harbour book is badly written and just does not go into enough detail.  He just presents code and expects you to understand it.  It just makes you wonder if he knows what he's talking about.  For example, he didn't even explain what the different flags mean in his DMA fast copy function do.  He also has some mistakes.  The most glaring mistake is his vblank function.  His coding standards are horrible: he includes C source code from gfx2gba at the beginning of his code.  His assembly chapter is a joke.
<br/>
Is this why Nintendo didn't let Harbour publish his book?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
