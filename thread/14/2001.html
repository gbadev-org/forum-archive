On a simmilar note I've had a bit of a problem understanding One type of error message. This type creates it's own file in the temp folder in my hard drive for semmingly no reason and then accounts that file for the error.
<br/>
This is the line.
<br/>
<br/>
C:\DOCUME~1\KIM\LOCALS~1\TEMP/ccicbaaa.o(.data+0*4): first defined here
<br/>
<br/>
It then repeats the file name on the line below followed by.
<br/>
<br/>
multiple definition of 'OAMmem'
<br/>
<br/>
This done a number of times for different definitions of the GBA memory.
<br/>
I found these files and opened them using note pad to find a repeating of the above error statements as if it was keeping a log of it. Why, and why start now I've been only truely writting games for the gba for a month or so. Why highlight it now.
<br/>
The only thing I could think of was that I added another C++ file in with the other in that make file and this may have in some way messed it up but then I take it out and delete the files try it again and it still comes up with the errors.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Lose the attitude. Use the right tools for the job (an IDE or programmers editor) or stop bothering us with self inflicted problems.

Sorry we seem to have gotten of on the wrong foot. I ment it as a joke. Unfunny I know just something to lighten the air a little. And if humors a crime then hang me here. (Sorry, another joke.)(Attitude noted.)
<br/>
<br/>
Looking through what you said I think I've come to the conclusion that you must be correct and I'll look up the answer in some of the other threads as you surggest.
<br/>
Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: That was what was wrong I went back over the header files and found a number of variables that should have been made Global using "# define" before them. So if I see this kind of error message again I know what to do. Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
