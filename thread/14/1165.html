    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there,
<br/>
as stated in the title I'm not a programmer, but a 2D artist. I'm currently involved in a GBA-project, as BG-artist, and would need some kind of easy to use picture-viewer/slideshow-thingie to view my tiles on the actual screen, to check for brightness/gamma/contrast etc. For the transfer I would use the MBV2-cable, though I don't have a flashcard at the moment. So only small programs, that fit in the internal ram would work. I will get a flashcard soon, but at the moment, I need to work out a way to keep the program small. Any advice? ( I hope this is the right forum to ask though)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm soon to release a program that runs on Windows that takes any picture format and convert them to a SlideShow on the gba. It show your pictures in 32000 colors and FullSize/Resize mode. It also create thumbails of all your pics that you can quickly browse and display text for each picture.
<br/>
<br/>
So, you could use it for what you want, before your picture are converted to Tiles. And even though Tiles only use 16/256 colors, it would be no problem since i'm only displaying the palette value directly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Or you can download the tool called "Converter of Graphics" in the gbadev tool section.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure it can make ROM files directly from an image you give it.  If CoG doesn't do it, I know one of the tools does it.<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
