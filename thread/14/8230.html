    <h4>#68124 - LaserFrog - Sun Jan 22, 2006 7:14 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey I'm new to the development of GBA apps and things. I've read a few tutorials on using HAM. But people on these forums seems to go towards using devkit Pro I was just wondering which is the best route to take? I am new to programming in general but have dabbled in java, php and a tiny bit of C. Is there any good books/guides you can recommend for learning C/C++ and the whole GBA development system? 
<br/>
Thanks, and the community seems great!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd also be interested in this information. You can do searches to find out what people are doing, but many of the threads that have people excited about one library or another are dated back to 2004, so it's hard to say what is the newest current thing that people are using and what is maybe not being supported anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, it would be good to know what projects and programs are still being used and which are the best.
<br/>
<br/>
Which tutorials are still relevant to GBA programming practices today?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok I followed <a class="postlink" href="http://www.webbesen.dk/gba/" target="_blank">GBA programing Crash Course</a> and it got me off on the right foot. I started maybe 2 weeks ago and am already working on my own project after the Crash Course. I suggest using it.it has instructins in there on how to set up DevKitAdv. Also there's a lot of tutorials here where they have dead links in them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the general approach is to use DevKitPro. There is also the gba tonc turorials, which is quite good. It all depends on what kind of learner you are</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That course is OK, but not the best. It teaches bad habits, and sets you up for only 1 possible type of game really : puzzle. This is because you aren't taught how to scroll, or do any special effects. It's a nice little course to make a tiny, simple, game, but not that good to let you go on to other projects of a different sort.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What I was saying was that it only gives you scope for Mode 4, which is generally only useful for menus and some types of puzzle games..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok I see you're point. you're right mode four isn't used for a lot but.....at least it also teaches you about sprites and headers and stuff</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
