    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi i've been programming for gba for 2 months now and i was really wondering about the legal aspect of this sort of dev.
<br/>
<br/>
Lets say for example : I have just finished my brilliant new game ...can i just sell it to anyone on the street (is this legal?) or must i get a publisher to publish my game?
<br/>
<br/>
with regards
