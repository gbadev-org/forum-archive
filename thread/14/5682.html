    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since nobody have made one for MSX and C64 yet... 
<br/>
And it seems nobody will, strangely.
<br/>
<br/>
If I had the know-how I would go at it with fists and feet.
<br/>
<br/>
What do I need to do to get the information and knowledge enough to make a working C64 emulator or a MSX-emulator. I am probably more interested in the MSX emu, sincethat is my childhood love.
<br/>
<br/>
I do believe that there is some kid of Z80 processor in it so it should be possible to  use work allready done by others.
<br/>
<br/>
Could you help me out? Please do not mock me for being a newbie. I really want to do this. I am no good at C or C++. I used to do Basic 15 years ago.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not trying to be too harsh or to put you off but you're not going to find a book/tutorial about "learn to code an emulator on GBA in 7 days".
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to code an emulator for such a limited platform as the GBA you'd need at least little knowledge of asm and the hardware in general on both the GBA and the emulated platform.
<br/>
There are 2 Spectrum (which use the Z80)  and one SMS emulator for the GBA, I think the source to Foon is available at least. There is (was?) a MSX emulator in the works.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to studie some emulator code, I have source to all my emulators on my <a class="postlink" href="http://hem.passagen.se/flubba/gba.html" target="_blank">my homepage</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
And I may as well at the mean time thank you so much for you
<br/>
wonderful work. It was one of the main reasons that I bought a GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
