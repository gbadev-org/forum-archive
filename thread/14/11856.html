    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have set up Visual Studio with devKitPro and use the makefile provided with the samples there (also the make commands). Sometimes, really randomly, the compiler doesn't want to compile... it just quickly says "build succeeded" and nothing happens... any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The makefile should only compile something if one of its non-compiled parts has been modified since the last compile. The no-make state you are describing is caused by me most often by forgetting to save my file before running the make command. If you cant get it to compile even then, try running a clean command, which should force it to re-compile everything the next time you make.

PS: This is done in programmers notepad, but I believe the process should be the same in visual studio.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
