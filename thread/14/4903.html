    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok. I've now completed my first platform movement code. I now want my character sprite to be animated when I walk and jump. How do I do this? And if it matters, I'm using Mode 4..
<br/>
<br/>
Help would be much appreciated!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You've already setup a sprite?
<br/>
By using the gba's sprite system (faster, use tilepointer 512 and above) or by just plotting it to screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Animating a sprite is done by chaning the tilepointer from the sprite. So your first picture is in position 512 and your second picture maybe in position 520, your third picture another 8 further and so on. When you've reached your last picture of the animation, make sure you set the position to 512 in orde to get the first picture again and start the animation over.
<br/>
(in this case position 512, is the first picture of your animation)
<br/>
<br/>
To do this you've to set up your own animation system, most of them a time based, that will say, after x seconds change the picture to the next picture.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to make the difference between left and right, use variable which tells you what position the character is facing.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps you a litte...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Rather than changing the tile index, you could DMACopy the next frame of sprite data overtop of current sprite that you're using for your character. This will save on sprite/tile space and you won't have to change the tile index for your sprite.

What Celeryface is meaning, is that you can load a new image with DMA.
<br/>
What i do is i already have all of my images loaded.

Yes, you can use the DMACopy method as well in Mode 4. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
