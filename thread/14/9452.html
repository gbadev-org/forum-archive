    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's been a while since I last worked on my GBA projects, but right now, I've run into a set up problem when getting all the toolchains and software back up and running. Because of clutter and Windows problems, I had to reformat my computer, and now I am in the process of installing all the necessary software, including my GBA development. I've been running VS.Net for my projects, and at the time, I was running r11 of devkitARM (yes, I know it's old, but it was working). I had editted the BG_SimpleScroll project's Make file to accommedate my own needs, and everything was working. Now, I can't get past this single problem....
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">Performing Makefile project actions
<br/>
'make' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
<br/>
operable program or batch file.
<br/>
Project : error PRJ0019: A tool returned an error code from "Performing Makefile project actions"</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I don't understand what the problem is. I tried both installation methods, manual and automatic, along with making sure the Environmental Variables were placed, and yet my projects still don't work. I even went and made a copy of the "SimpleBGScroll" project included with the current auto-installer from the website, had VS.Net convert it, and tried building it, and I got the exact same error as said above.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what to do. I even had the thought that it may not be devkitARM, but VS.Net itself. Is it possible that it might be the installation of VS.Net that could be the problem?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PS: I feel kinda funny posting this in the Beginner's section, especially with how long I've been around GBADev.org, but I feel that if I can't even get these tools working, I can't get anywhere at all.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Your OS does not found your "make.exe". You can e.g try it on the CMD prompt to find your make binary. In my case (DevkitPro installed) msys environment is used and the make. exe is placed in "devkitpro\msys\bin" folder. Probably you have to extend your OS path and/or the search path for VisualStudio. I work with VS too and it works well. ;-)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thx, it was VS.Net with the problem. I went in and added in the msys folder as part of the "executable files" in the VC++ Directories under Options/Projects. The SimpleBGScroll project now compiles flawlessly, but now I'm getting other errors in relation to commands and such in my Make file. Not a problem though. I can probably just edit your included Make template for GBA projects to fit my needs. Now I need to figure out why double clicking the error lines of the output aren't going directly to the line itself instead of just opening up the problematic file.
<br/>
<br/>
thx again.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The error messages need translated slightly, I use some sed fu in the make command.
<br/>
<br/>
I've never used VS.net but one of these should point you in the right direction.
