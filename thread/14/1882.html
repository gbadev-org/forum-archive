If you have trouble setting up command-line applications such as GCC, then you might want to use the GCC included with HAM until you become more familiar with the command line.  If you use HAM, you don't have to use HAMlib.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, you unzipped everything in a directory, then you'll find an directory named "bin", there you could find all the gcc executables. You better look at an example rom and try to compile it using your gcc installation.
<br/>
<br/>
If you've unzipped everything in the same dir you already have gcc installed, there's nothing more to do then this.
<br/>
<br/>
You could try an code sample I sent to gbadev, it has an batch file wich will compile the code and it also has an Visual Studio workspace:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Assuming you've installed DevKit Advance properly, there should be a file called <span style="font-weight: bold">C:\devkitadv\bin\gcc.exe</span>. It's not something to be double-clicked; you'll have to use the command prompt. If you have never used a command prompt, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=learn%20dos" target="_blank">learn DOS</a>; the Windows command prompt is copied nearly wholesale from DOS's.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll have to add the path of the folder containing gcc.exe to your <span style="font-weight: bold">Path</span> environment variable. To do this, type the following into a command prompt:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">set Path=C:\devkitadv\bin;%Path%</span>
<br/>
<br/>
This may be easier if you set up a shell script. Most experienced users of GCC know what a shell script is; users of GCC on Microsoft platforms call shell scripts "batch files." If you don't know what a batch file is, please learn <a class="postlink" href="http://computerhope.com/batch.htm" target="_blank">what a batch file is and how to make one</a> before you start using GCC.
