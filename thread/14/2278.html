    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I saw this logo at the beginning of Rick's X-Mas and a couple other homebrew games. I did a search on google for it but the main web page was down and all similar pages had something to do with GBA development. Sooooo... what is it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's a sound system. The main page at <a href="http://maso.r0x.free.fr/" target="_blank">http://maso.r0x.free.fr/</a> seems to be working fine for me. Not all that technically impressive compared to Apex Audio System, or as polished as Krawall, but still pretty nice. Kind of reminds me of my own efforts at creating a sound system, except he doesn't scrap every attempt just cause it's not the fastest ever made^^' I finally gave up on beating AAS and decided to do a quick and easy mixer that takes about 25% CPU to mix 16 fully pannable channels. Designed and wrote the whole thing in 4 days after about a month of messing with other ideas... Experience helps, I guess. And I might be able to cut a few percent off of that with a partial rewrite of it. Still working on the music player though, so I'll get that done first.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try <a class="postlink" href="http://maso.r0x.free.fr/" target="_blank">http://maso.r0x.free.fr/</a>. It's free for non-commercial use if you display the logo on startup and inform the creator of your using it. It also has some sort of 'cancerware' license for commercial games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
