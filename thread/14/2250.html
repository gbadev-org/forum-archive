    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can either get a header tool from the tools section on the main site, or edit your Crt0.S. If you use a header tool it's easy to do, but you'll have to change it every time you recompile. If you do it in Crt0, it's a little trickier, but it will be permanent. If you're using Jeff's Crt0, just go down ~1/4 of the way through it, and look for this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
    @ Game Title (80000A0h)
<br/>
        .byte   0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00
<br/>
        .byte   0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
That's the title, you'll have to get the ASCII values of the letters you want to use and type them in there. You may be able to use letters in single quotes like 'A', 'B', 'C' to make it a lot easier, not sure if it will let you do that.
<br/>
I've only ever used Jeff's Crt0 though, so I don't know how to do it in DevKit's default one or anything, sorry.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks guys for the replies. I found the GBARM to work however I couldn't find the FATv8. Maybe I'm not looking hard enough. I've downloaded the GBAFix too, thanks. It's great to have so much support online.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the Crt0.o and Crt0.s, I really don't understand them too well since my ASM knowledge isn't all that great. I did take a look as to where you said you could change the title and I think I'll do that for future projects because it seems to be really useful. If i'm correct these Crt.o/s files are basically only for fixing the header and have nothing to do with the rest of the project.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, I really appreciate it, now I'm not stuck with seeing all those "untitled game" roms on my cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This should help. It's mainly used to put patchs on roms but it has a nice header editor.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you can do this sort of thing, which is a damn sight easier than working out single ASCII values!

Well thats easy to do, is there any info on how to link the Crt0 in with you code and what exactly you can do with it. Sorry I'm new with the whole GBA scene, make files, and haven't coded too much other than in windows. I did make some pictures and sprites on the GBA however i'm still clueless on the Crt0.

Thanks for all the replies!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
