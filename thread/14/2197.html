    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, i think you get the picture.
<br/>
<br/>
I am not new to programming in general (about 1 1/2 years C++) or graphics (1 month DirectDraw v7 (why did i waste that month, i don't know) and 7 months Direct3D v8/9)
<br/>
<br/>
Made some sub-par demos (like loading a heightmap and an .md2 model) but never made a full game. Decided instead about 3 days to go to the GBA!!! (yeah!) I figured i wouldn't mess with registers (i know no ASM, good lord who codes in that?) so i decided to download HAM. It works, and i kinda understand what's happening just that maybe if the docs were in the CHTML format, it would be a lot easier.
<br/>
<br/>
i am wondering where to go next? Should i make the next crappy game for the GBA or what? I don't see many HAM tuts (though the 90+ demos can handle that) but i guess what is stopping me from making a game on any platform is purpose and drive. Anybody got a simple game idea i can code that can be done in 2 weeks?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, total noob looking for direction of where to take HAM.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Code tetris.  That was my first game.  Simple and well-defined rules, no AI, no need to worry about multiplayer, and it all takes place on just one screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Then again, maybe you were looking for a unique idea?  But for a start, I'd go with this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You dont have to know ASM to code for the GBA. It is possible just to use c/c++. look at the pern project and gbajunkie 's tutorials for more details<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, Tetris, hmm.... i guess i will have to. Had to make a game sometime. Does anybody have HAM docs besides the one at <a href="http://www.ngine.de" target="_blank">www.ngine.de</a> and <a href="http://www.aaronrogers.com?" target="_blank">www.aaronrogers.com?</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">looking at the mygba file helps me a lot to understand some tricks about registers and how Ham works with it.
<br/>
<br/>
But I find that the doc, wich is the same online and with install, is poor...
<br/>
There's many macro and functions that are not explained.
<br/>
<br/>
You must try them in simple projects and notice their action in a text file.
<br/>
Or look in the mygba file for more details about only the macros ^^<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">4 days into coding the GBA with HAM and HAMlib and i have already done alpha-trasparency, maps, and input, That took mw 2 months to do in DirectX. Man, the GBA is great!!
<br/>
<br/>
But, one thing that troubles me is the fact of getting the sound files. What program(s) can convert say a .wav file into an .s3m file (since i am using krawall as my sound library)?
<br/>
