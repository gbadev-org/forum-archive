<br/>
<br/>
I'm interested in developing for the GBA and I'd like some more information. I bet you know where to find it... At the moment I'm using devkitPro (devkitARM release 20) and wonder if there is any place where to find more examples than those (10) which come with it.
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment I'm trying to get a hold on mode 4. I've used it before with devkitadv-r5-beta-3. What I did before: write to VRAM (0x06000000) or the back buffer 0x600A000 and flip it using REG_DISPCNT (0x4000000). Does the devkitARM have some predefined function/variable to work with this? E.g. some pointer which switches between VRAM (0x06000000) and 0x600A000. And a function which makes the switch and (un)set REG_DISPCNT(0x4000000). Of course there is enough information about how to make this function, but I can't imagine it already exists in devkitARM.
<br/>
<br/>
Where can I find information like this? There must be a place with documentation about devkitARM, but I can't find it anywhere.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!
<br/>

Ps. I checked the FAQ/forum/google and couldn't find the info, but in case I should have be able to find it there I'm sorry to have bothered you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">check the libga\include folder in devkitarm. That's where the libgba header files are. 'gba.h' is the one that includes all of them. Reading through them should give you an idea what they are for. i haven't found any good documentation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
