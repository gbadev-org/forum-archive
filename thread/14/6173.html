    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a way for me to take current existing .gba rom files and make them into an even bigger gba rom file? what I basically want to do is make a multi-cart gba file. Would really appreciate the help. trying to put several games into one because the gba emulator for the psp can only take one gba cart at a time currently. :-X</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Depends: <ul><li>You can make a .gba ROM with multiple .mb programs (see <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#mbmenu" target="_blank">Multiboot Menu</a>). </li><li>If the emulator emulates the bankswitching feature of the F2A flash cart, you can use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.obsession.se/pocket/" target="_blank">PogoShell</a> to build an F2A image with multiple .gba ROMs. </li><li>If you have the source or object code and the link script for each ROM, you can manually relocate each ROM after the first to a different starting address and then concatenate them. A lot of Asian GBA pirate carts have one GBA game and a PocketNES compilation by using this method. If you don't have the source code or object code for a homebrew ROM, you can ask the author for it. </li><li>Otherwise, no. If you're trying to discuss "backups" of commercial GBA games, please take it to <a class="postlink" href="http://boards.pocketheaven.com/" target="_blank">Pocket Heaven</a>. </li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
