    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Apologies for the pooly-worded explanation here.  I'm confused about using the REG_BGxHOFS and REG_BGxVOFS registers.  Obviously there's no way to apply a "negative" offset - it's only a positive offset to the origin (???)
<br/>
<br/>
My map implementation is the typical 256x256/leading-edge based system and works well if I originate the map at 0,0 (scrolls nicely in all directions).  My game needs to start at the "bottom" of the map and scroll up.  Now I'm guessing that I can't dump the first screen of map tiles at map ram locations 0 and set the scroll registers to 0, because that would mean I could only scroll down.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I'm unsure of how to setup the screenblocks and scroll registers for  a map starting point other than absolute zero.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can treat the registers as s16's and put regular two's-complement negative numbers in them.  The hardware doesn't need to differentiate between positive and negative numbers because the backgrounds wrap, so a small negative number may as well be a big positive number.  Recall that -1 as an s16 is 0xFFFF.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In case you have trouble wrapping your head around that, you can look to Wikipedia for an explanation of <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement" target="_blank">two's complement</a>.
