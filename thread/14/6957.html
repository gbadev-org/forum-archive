    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I am currently reading up on how to program a GBA.
<br/>
What I am trying to do is setup a GBA as a display for a formula SAE car(www.fsae.com), like engine rpm, oil pressure etc. The GBA needs to read in serial data from a motec ecu(www.motec.com.au) 
<br/>
<br/>
I am having trouble understanding how to write the software to read in the data from the motec. Could someone point me in the direction of someone that has done a similar project?
<br/>
Some sample code examples would be great.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cardiagnostic.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.cardiagnostic.co.uk/</a> might help. Also, there is a commercial product in the same vein called the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.turboxs.com/more_info.php?ID=131" target="_blank">Turbo XS DTEC</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Information on GBA UART is all over the web, however <a class="postlink" href="http://www.work.de/nocash/gbatek.htm" target="_blank">GBATEK</a> is probably a good starting point. DarkFader did have some useful UART to RS-232 schematics, but it looks like his site is down. It used a MAX3232 to convert voltages.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: <a class="postlink" href="http://frotz.net/gbadev/cable.html" target="_blank">http://frotz.net/gbadev/cable.html</a> has DarkFader's schematics.<br/>_________________<br/>My world is black and white, but if I blink fast enough, I see it in grayscale.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i had a look at cardiagnostic.co.uk, its pretty much exactly what i want to do. Except that the information coming from the motec isnt OBD protocol, its a special motec protocol.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to decompile GBA files? I wanna have a look at cardiagnostics.co.uk UART code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok i searched and found out it is pretty much impossible to convert .gba into .c, that was a silly question.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody have some sample C code for a program they used for UART/RS232 control?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the guy running cardiagnostic.co.uk seems pretty approachable. You might try mailing him (or posting to <a class="postlink" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/opendiag/" target="_blank">his Y! group</a>) for his source code, or at least assistance.
<br/>
<br/>
If nothing else, his links section points to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.robmeerman.co.uk/project/gba" target="_blank">a site</a> that looks like it has good code. <a class="postlink" href="http://frotz.net/gbadev/" target="_blank">http://frotz.net/gbadev/</a> also has a simple, open-source UART program. And if you haven't tried yet, please search these forums for similar posts.

I think this is my hundredth post. It took me two years, but I finally made it. Cheers!<br/>_________________<br/>My world is black and white, but if I blink fast enough, I see it in grayscale.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
