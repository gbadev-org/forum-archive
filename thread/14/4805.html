    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What do you mean by "interface"? If you're not completely comfortable with working at a command line, you can try Dev-C++, an IDE designed for GCC under Windows. You might find <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=1736" target="_blank">this thread</a> informative.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Or, perhaps, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ngine.de" target="_blank">Visual Ham</a> might be useful to you. It is a visually nice version of Ham, with compiler and everything in a single package. Also, as with most IDEs, you can change the compiler it uses to DevKitArm/Adv. It has quite a few built-in functions which might be useful to you, but then you have to display (well, it does itm for you0 the hame sign at the beginning of your demo. 
<br/>
I used to use it, and it was very helpful for a beginner, as I was. Now, however, I just use a text editor of my choice, DevkitArm and a simple make file. I don't really think that you have to get in with the command line if you want to use DevKitArm/Adv, because once you have written your make file, you can just replace the file names, and either double click the make file, or run make in the command prompt. 
<br/>
But, I think you'll find VHam to be good for you.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT : If you do choose to use DevKitAdv afterall, instead of having to  download the 5 files and put them together, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.webbesen.dk/gba/" target="_blank">Webbesen's Tutorial</a> has a all-in-one download of it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
