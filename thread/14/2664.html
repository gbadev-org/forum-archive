    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One of the topics on this board says where do I begin but I would like to know how to begin with concept to completion step by step. I know the development of a game starts with an idea etc but where do you start with that idea. I would like to know everything! Example would be:
<br/>
<br/>
1. create an idea
<br/>
2. map out the game play
<br/>
3. develop a game engine that would work for said game? etc
<br/>
<br/>
but I don't want it to be this cut and dry..I have no idea about how to program so I want to know about compiling etc...what utitlities I need and what order I should use them. when I should start making sprites and tiles so I can see what my game is looking like. What would I use to connect to a gba so I can see my progress etc...any help would be great.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you would want to look for postmortems. Team members going through what went well and bad throughout the project

Stop right there!
<br/>
<br/>
This is the first issue you should deal with, before worrying about compilers or design documents or flash carts or attempting to develop anything for the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Go immerse yourself in a couple of good C tutorials (search Google and you'll find plenty). Then go program a few very simple games for whatever kind of computer/OS you use (you're pretty much guaranteed to be able to find tutorials on that as well). Start with simple text-driven stuff (or point-and-click stuff if you're using a "visual" language/OS). Then learn how to construct a basic game event loop for a simple action game. Then come back and read the tutorials on GBA programming here.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not just throwing a canned response to you here (although I've said stuff very similar to this frequently to other newbies); you asked what the process would be to create a game and the best way to learn it is to apprentice yourself to the process by working your way through the entire thing on a small scale.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The worst mistake you can make it to start jamming away with ideas until things start clicking.  I'm pretty new to GBA programming (but not really new to C) so I grabbed Dev Kit Advanced, downloaded and read every tutorial and sample I could find, and slowly started making sense of things.  Right now I'm still very very shallow in my knowledge, but I am working on creating Tetris for the GBA to learn and practice.  
<br/>
<br/>
The things from gbajunkie, dovotos, Pern Project, here, etc mentioned above are for code samples, full game source, tutorials, etc for GBA information, but until you learn C (get cracking on Hello World), you won't be able to make sense of any of it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the replies guys. so I should first learn the basics of c+ eh? How long would it take to learn c+ language. When I begin learning will it be fairly easy to grasp or are there gunna be tutorials which assume I know a little already. For example make a simple calculator or something...will it explain why I put a certain code in? I remember programming when I was younger for this computer called a tandy very simple stuff...but it was so long ago and it explained everything step by step...its programming language was your basic "if this = this then this will happen and then goto this" bad example but is this what the C+ language is like?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

for c/c++ tutorials you can look at <a href="http://www.gametutorials.com" target="_blank">www.gametutorials.com</a> for source.
<br/>
<br/>
As for how much experience you need before starting to program for the GBA...I can only say that I started programming for the GBA before I fully understood the C language so I didnt understand half the code I was writing. After a while I started looking a bit deeper and found out a lot more about the basics and why/how it came together as a program (with a lot of help from here :).<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah sorry, I am sorta lazy sometimes cuz I figure if I spend all my time searching for the right topics I won't have enough time learning. Maybe learning programming isn't my thing. I am also a video game artist and I would like to make a game for the gba but I tend to want to do everything on my own..mainly because I find that sometimes when you start working with a team on something you can work so hard and it fails because someone doesn't live up to there end..but if I have to learn programming as well as being the game artist etc..that may get tedious.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, where are some good tutorials etc on how to make sprites and tile sets for the gba? I can make good sprite art I just don't know how to make it for a game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
