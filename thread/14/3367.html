    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to the GBA development scene, and was previously pointed to the Velvetfr gcc tools as an option for development on the Mac.
<br/>
<br/>
To test out the tools, I grabbed the complete source from the tutorial at <a href="http://www.webbesen.dk/gba/default.asp" target="_blank">http://www.webbesen.dk/gba/default.asp</a> so that I could test the compiler and make sure I could at least compile a working program.
<br/>
<br/>
Running the straight compiler files (replacing gcc with arm-elf-gcc/bin/arm-elf-gcc, since it appeared that no compiling was needed) I received compile errors regarding assembly directives (didn't recognize instructions, or .globl, etc. A specific example is pong.c:80701:Invalid mnemonic 'mvn'). 
<br/>
<br/>
What do I need to set up in order to get started compiling GBA programs on OS X? I understand I need to get the ctrl0 file from another source, but I was told that was in the linker step, and this is during the compile to object code.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
