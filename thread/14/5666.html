    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As I don't currently use tUME, I hear it is a wonderful editor, but I am spoiled and perfer Windows based editors, I can only guess where as some people probably have extensive experience with this.  
<br/>
<br/>
From what I have read from the Demo and the HAM Docs it seems there are numerous known bugs with tUME Map Support in HAMLib, you could have inaverdantly stumbled upon one (or more) of those bugs.  
<br/>
<br/>
Also I noticed a few limitations of the tUME support in HAMLib: 1) Your map must be loaded unto a Non-Rotation BG, and 2) "only" 65,535 tUME rooms are supported in the HAM tUME support system.
<br/>
<br/>
Check to make sure that you are not over the room limit and make sure you are loading the map unto a Non-Rotation BG.  If that does not work, I would suspect even more the experienced developers are going to need you to specify more information then you have so far.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps...
