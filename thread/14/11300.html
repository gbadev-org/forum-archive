    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi 
<br/>
<br/>
 I recently purchased a MBV2 cable to use with the Xcomm ver 1.24 software but I am have major problems with communication between the gba and my pc (a dell with winxp). Ihave the userport driver up and running my port settings are all set to 378 in the driver,software ,and pc. I have MBV2 selected in the tool section of xcomm but I get nothing at all.
<br/>
I know my MBV2 cable works at least with the software that came with it. Is ther something that I am missing here?
<br/>
Can somebody give me a clue what I am doing wrong?
<br/>
Any help will be greatly appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am having the same problem, so I only use the MBV2 software
<br/>
with it (mb.exe). I suppose the cause are the waitstates: with the mb.exe,
<br/>
I have to add minimum about 100 waitstates (mb -w 100), but in
<br/>
the Xcomm, I could only specify (if i remember it right) about 10 waitstates.
<br/>
<br/>
So give the mb.exe a try. The newest  version you can find here:

Ok, now I see your problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I've kind of ported the SendSave code for using the MBV2 cable just
<br/>
to see and learn. The problem is, that the API of MBV2 is missing
<br/>
fseek, fread, fwrite, so I had to introduce a header for determining
<br/>
the file size of a save (so the written saves are not compatible with
<br/>
the XBOO cable version), and also the keyboard polling on pc side didn't
<br/>
work.
<br/>
<br/>
Its no problem for me to share this with you, I'm not sure how to publish this, perhaps chism can give us a hint.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Good to see someone ported it to work with the MBV2. If you want, I can put it on my site along side the Xboo version, with full credit going to you of course.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
