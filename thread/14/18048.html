    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone, I'm looking for a map building tool that can take a bmp/png with a tileset and let me stamp it into a map and export using grit. I've messed around with PernTools and Spritely, but Pern seems slow and buggy, and Spritely has like zero documentation and appears to be a learning tool for kids. I'm not even sure that it can import bitmaps and use them as tilesets. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated! Also, this is for DS development.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cool thanks. I've been using Tiled and have been pleased with it. The only issue I have with it is image exporting to PNG goofs up the palette and saves it with 32 bit color depth but it's nothing I can't work around. Gonna check out Mappy as well just haven't gotten around to it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wait, are you trying to output a static image in the end, or build an actual tiled map? (or is the exporting to PNG just a secondary artifact?)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm outputting a static image which i convert with grit, which outputs a tiled map array. I'm developing a vertical shooter for the DS. I'm revisiting this post because I'm coming back around to a point in my development where I need to generate bg assets. I'm struggling with palette normalization most of all. There don't seem to be any good tools which can swap color index entries, and most image editing software seems to reorganize the palette when saving or exporting an image. It's getting to be very frustrating so any advice for a noob is greatly appreciated.

I'm using usenti 1.7.10 and tiled 0.12.3 to build the tiled map, then exporting as image to a .png file. Then I open the image with usenti and swap the first entry with an unused index, then give the first entry a value of 255 0 255 to signify transparency. Only problem is that sometimes usenti inexplicably moves the palette around when I save, in effect obliterating the palette swaps.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Usenti is the best tool for it, so if it's not doing what you want, I don't know what to suggest.

Hmm, I haven't had it rearrange the palette while saving.

I don't know of a built-in tool that Tiled has for doing this, but it should be pretty easy to write a scirpt to do it yourself. If you save the tiled maps in non-compressed xml format, for example, it would e pretty simple text manipulation to translate it into an asm array.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
