    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I need help finding a set of instructions that help me set this up.  I have found many sites that have directions but because of the new version of devkitpro none of the files are the same and since I have only ever worked with HAM.  I don't know what any of the files in the devkitpro download do.
<br/>
<br/>
I have downloaded all the files necessary.  emulator, devkit pro, set some system environment variables which could be the reason that it didn't work because the Path led to a file that wasn't in the devkitpro folder.  In any case when I would open a template file in Visual Studio 2003 I get makefile errors.  I have been looking and looking at forums but I can't piece everthing together.  
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully there is a site with accurate directions already made but help in any way will be helpful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
