    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, that just logged all the successful stuff, but not the errors, which is what i actually wanted to log. But it's ok, i'm just going to get myself into the habit of using programmers notepad for compiling, which is even better. problem i was having is that i would accidentally hit a key or something which would close the command line window while i was trying to track down errors, and manually marking and copying is tedious. programmers notepad kicks buttocks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
