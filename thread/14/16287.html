    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi! I'm new!
<br/>
<br/>
For the past week I have been reading everything I can find about running homebrew on my gba, and I need some advice on how to proceed with the xboo cable.
<br/>
<br/>
here are the resources I have available
<br/>
1. a gba link cable made by pelican
<br/>
2. a gbc and older universal link cable (no idea who made it)
<br/>
3. a male printer connector
<br/>
4. a pc that runs Ubuntu Linux 8.04
<br/>
5. a laptop that runs FreeDOS
<br/>
<br/>
So whats the best way to go about this? I originally bought the gba cable to do this but then I heard that some 3rd party cables don't work. Will this cable work? If not will the gbc cable work instead? And which OS has the best xboo software Linux, or FreeDOS?<br/>_________________<br/>Yes I know my user name is misspelled.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
