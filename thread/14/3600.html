    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for a way to synchronize my game-in-progress (animations, events and all this stuff).  I solved my problem with multiple vBlanks counters, one resetting every 2 vBlanks, another every 4 vBlanks, 10th, 20th and so on.  I wanted to avoid doing many modulos with only one counter.  Is that the good way to do stuff or there is a more professionnal method?  
<br/>
<br/>

Timing everything based on dividers of vblank is how the pros do it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Counting VBlanks is the way to go. For any "entity" you need to keep track of, use two fixed-point variables. One variable keeps track of the progress from frame-to-frame, and the other variable says how much to increment each frame.
<br/>
<br/>
So for example, if I have an animation that I want to advance to the next frame every 4 VBlanks, I could use a 24.8 counter and increment it by 64 each VBlank. I then just shift right by 8 to determine what frame I am on.
