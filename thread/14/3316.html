    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm making a tile based game with some shooting. The player shoots by holding the right button to select a target and then pressing A to fire. The target will be selected based on hostility, line of sight and distance.
<br/>
<br/>
What I need to know is the best way to determine if the player character (fixed to the centre of the screen) has a clear line of sight to an enemy. LOS is blocked by tiles with a collision bit and not blocked by other tiles without the bit set.  Non-hostile characters also need to block LOS.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, which is the best sort to use for small sets (maybe ten targets)?
<br/>
<br/>
If this has been answered before then could someone link me to it?

<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If your collision tiles are a constant size, then just trace a vector line throuhg them all and check each point till you hit the end.  
<br/>
<br/>
For a set of 10, I'd not use anything fancy - perhaps just an insertion or perhaps a shell sort.  Not bubble sort - nothing ever needs bubble sort :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
