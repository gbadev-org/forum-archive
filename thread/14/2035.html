    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">HI, Im new to developng Games for GBA, is there any program that I can use to start off by making mini games? 
<br/>
<br/>
Also I am getting the Flash 2 Advance 64m Cart set, when I use the program for it, say I put two 4mb games, do i also have to put their .sav files with them, if so wont that take more room up any force me to take one game off? or is there a way to get around that. and for my last question is there any other software i should use anything better than the software that comes with it, like little writer. And if anybody can teach me how to change .gb game to .gba games that would be great thanks alot and i apologize for asking to many questions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you want to play gb/gbc games with your flash cart, you have to buy gb bridge. It's something to do with an extra pin that gb/gbc uses and gba doesnt. Or you can use an emulator for gb. <a href="http://www.gbaemu.com" target="_blank">http://www.gbaemu.com</a>

use fatv8 to trim your roms down a bit to make them fit.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">By progams I think you mean sothing along the lines of click and play. The kind of program that generates the code for you. That doesn't exist for the gba you have to write the code yourself. If you have never programmed before this may be a big problem as their will be alot of theory you will need to get your head around aswell as actual code. Try the FAQs for the free C download and start programming for the PC by search the net for C tutorials. I carn't garentee success though some of them are a little ropey on explinations.

If however you do know C or C++ or even basic then just dive right in.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
