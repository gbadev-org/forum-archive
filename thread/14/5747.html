    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Then how did DJ Bouche make that Badger Badger Badger ROM I have?
<br/>
<br/>
Rhetorical question, two converters. One from SWF to AVI, one from AVI to GBA rom. Don't ask me for names.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Even so, it would have been more efficient to remake "Badgers" using GBA backgrounds and sprite scaling for the video and GSM Player for the audio.

I love efficiency almost much as Ï€.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I do not believe that there really are any "Game Makers" for the GBA.  There are several Libraries such as HAM that help in the creation of GBA Games as well as tools such as Dragon Basic (which right now doesn't seem to be available) that hide GBA specifics behind the easy to use BASIC language.  Other than that there aren't really any short-cuts to GBA development.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not in general. There exist disassemblers, but if you have to ask how much <a class="postlink" href="http://www.datarescue.com/idabase/" target="_blank">the good one</a> costs, you can't afford it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
