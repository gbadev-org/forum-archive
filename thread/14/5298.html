I'm trying to fiddle with one of joat's examples.
<br/>
<br/>
It uses balldata.bin and ballpallette.bin to store the sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
My incredibly noobish question is how you generate these .bin files?
<br/>
I've tried really hard to find some instructions on this and have had no luck.

Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
