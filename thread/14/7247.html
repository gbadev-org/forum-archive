    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">BL is branch with link. It copies the program counter (r15) to the link register (r14), and then does a normal pc-relative branch. Handy for function calls, although you can do the same thing by manually copying pc to lr and branching.
<br/>
<br/>
BX is branch with exchange, which means it can switch between the ARM and THUMB instruction sets. It takes a register with the destination address in it, and treats bit0 of the address as the instruction set flag (0=ARM, 1=THUMB). 
<br/>
Since you can never execute from an odd address, bit0 would normally always be 0, so it's convenient to use as a flag.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I forgot to mention, that A in "A BX rn" shouldn't be there, it's just "BX rn". BX is the instruction, and rn can be any register r0-r15.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
