    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The sprites on the gba, only has 4 (0,1,2 and 3) priorities,
<br/>
is that right? Or i am missing something.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a snake of 10 blocks long (in iso) and in some directions,
<br/>
i need to have the last block above the first block, so i tried
<br/>
to switch all priorities, but that didn't came far, since there are
<br/>
only 4 allowed (i experienced, with vboy, didn't test it on hardware yet).
<br/>
<br/>
So the only other option i see, is swapping the positions of the blocks
<br/>
and lower priorities of the ones that don't need to be on top.
<br/>
<br/>
Or do you have any other suggestion, that does the same?<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sprites have 2 priorities you can use. 
<br/>
<br/>
The first one is the one you mentionned, you pick between 0-3 and that set on top of what background &amp; sprites it'll be showed. 
<br/>
<br/>
The second one is when 2 sprites have the same background priority and overlap. The sprite having the highter(i think, might be opposite) OAM number will be showed on top of the other one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The sprite's "priority" value is used only for which backgrounds cover the sprite. If you want to put sprites in front of sprites, put the front sprites first in OAM. This applies to at least NES and GBA. (On GB/GBC, the sprite on the left would always be in front.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
