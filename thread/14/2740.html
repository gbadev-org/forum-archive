Not to sound rude, but this really isn't the forum for that kind of stuff. We handle more of the technical side of the GBA: vblank, hblank, DMA, pixel routines, etc..

Don't rush yourself. And when you do get around to this fourm again, please name your topic something meaningful. There are too many "I need help!"s and that's why newbies don't bother to search the forums before creating a new topic. Your question probably has been answered before.

Well, good luck to your coding.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
