    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i remember reading somewhere (don't recall where at the moment, possibly in these forums) that on the DS, an int would be better than a boolean because the boolean would clog things up a bit and possibly even take up more memory than an int. Is this true? if so, what about a bitset? or a bool vector?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Use bool when you mean bool.  If you've got an array of booleans, you could use a bitset if you want -- there are tradeoffs to that, of course.  (If you have to ask what they are, they probably don't matter for you right now.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
