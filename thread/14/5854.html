    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi.  I got myself a flash cart for the GBA a while back and I've been trying to get my own ROMs to work on it.  I'm using a header program called GameBoy Advance ROM Manipulator 1.0 (GBARM).  So far I've only been able to append the necessary data (logo for the BIOS check, etc) to files I've compiled with Visual HAM without breaking the ROM.  I would like to compile with Dev Kit ARM since the ROMs are smaller, but GBARM keeps on breaking the ROMs I make with it.  Does anyone know of a header appending program I could use with Dev Kit ARM?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
