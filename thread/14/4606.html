    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Basically I run MB... with the provided MB version of GLIB.MB to test it.... the program just hangs... can't even control + C it in the dos window....
<br/>
<br/>
I have user port installed, and running properly as I can copy files to my GBA via an XBOO cable.... 
<br/>
<br/>
I've changed the Wait states several times...
<br/>
The command line I'm using is mb -s glib.mb -w 500
<br/>
<br/>
No errors no nothing... Any idea's?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm quite aware that they use two different programs, what I"m saying is that xcomms works with my Xboo cable, so I know userport.sys is running.... But mb.exe just hangs whe nI try and use my MBV2 cable...... So the problem is that the MB.exe software is not working as intended, or something is causing it to hang, and not even spit out error messages or allow it to be terminated gracefully or even ungracefully from within the Dos window.... The command line I am using is per the MBV2 Faq. My assumption is that if my xboo parallel cable is working than my LPT1 port is properly configured.... So what could be the deal with mb.exe and my MBV2? 
<br/>
<br/>
I run Windows XP SP2 with the config.nt and autoexec.nt and command.com files reinstalled (as mb.exe and other 16bit dos apps will not run with out them) Also I do have Anti-Virus software running, but was disabled at the time of testing MB.  Other 16bit software does work fine. Though I don't have another program handy that sends stuff over the LPT port via dos. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else with a similar setup run in to this problem and if so have you found a way around it? 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to try the linux version here shortly when I get an install of it on an old machine. Buf I'd prefer to use it via Windows for convienience..
<br/>

Thanks,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have the same issues here.  I never could get the MBV2 cable to work with MB.exe reliably.  The xboo cable with xboo communicator works just fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Now if I could only get WntrMute's console commands to compile from within HAM.

The only way I've found to get it working is to make a pure dos boot cd and or disk with mb + a DPMI driver on it and do it that way, or you can run vmware or virtual pc.... I'm thinking Bochs x86 emu would work too, but I'm not certain if it allows port I/O to real hardware ports like vmware and virtual pc do. I've tried it with M$ Virtual PC and it does seem to work well.  
<br/>
<br/>
Another valid way could be if you have a nic who's manufacturer still provides dos NDIS drivers (ie for ghosting) or just an old 10base NE2000 compatible will probably have one.. You could create a boot cd with a ram drive, dpmi driver, and the M$ TCP/IP and networking stack for DOS to allow sharing via a mapped drive from your windows Box to another computer running this Boot disk.   I will probably go with this route if virtual PC doesn't stop hanging on a vitrual partition creation with fdisk on a dos boot cd. I would recommend that if you do use the Dos IP stack that you set it  a static IP because it takes for fucking ever to obtain one from a dhcp server.  I plan on testing this method of using the MBV2 cable if it works I will make an ISO image available to everyone.  It should provide a good environment for an extra pc or running in VMWARE or Vitrual PC or even Bochs (pending the real hw I/O support).
