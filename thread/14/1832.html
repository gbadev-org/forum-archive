    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ANy map editors out there that will export a collision map along with the map/tile data? Alternately I could look at the map data and create a collision map on the fly, but in that case I would hope for a way to have the editor define a classification per tile, wall, walkable, water, etc.

Make sure your map editor won't reorder your tiles behind your back, then use a GBA-side lookup table that states which tiles have what properties.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tile Studio will do all of that. You can assign a collision value for each side of a map entry. Moreever, you can give a special value to each entry in the map, doing what you want with it in your program.

Look it up on google, latest version is on Sourceforge.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For now I think I just need something really basic - which editor has the smallest learning curve?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just modify the export file to output it in c format. It's quite easy, read the doc how the output format, and modify the already created gba file. I did this myself some time ago with no major hurdle. Just lost the export file :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
