<br/>
<br/>
Doing some GBA work again and porting some of my code from Win32 to GBA and I have a .txt file with some model data I load in with fstream.h and was wondering how the easiest way of parsing that data with the GBA would be.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: gray">The lone Wolf howls, driven by pride he presses on. Knowing not where he goes, but only where he wants to be.

get libfat, follow these instructions/tutorial: <a href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/libfat/" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/libfat/</a>
<br/>
use the dldi tool to edit the .gba to use your device or it won't run

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the reply I'll have to look into it. I've not done a lot of File I/O with the GBA. I was hoping I could just include it with a .S or .O and let the linker/assembler handle the rest.

<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: gray">The lone Wolf howls, driven by pride he presses on. Knowing not where he goes, but only where he wants to be.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A more light-weight file-system solution for the GBA is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#gbfs" target="_blank">GBFS</a>. If you want it to work with the standard IO functions (at the cost of a bit more memory usage), have a look <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=13288" target="_blank">here</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">^_^ Thank you!

<br/>
GBFS Looks like it will do the trick quite nicely.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll let you know how it goes.
