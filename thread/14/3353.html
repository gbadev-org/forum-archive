    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm looking into getting a linker but I have a few questions. First off, can someone suggest a good one? I've been to <a href="http://www.gameboy-advance.net" target="_blank">www.gameboy-advance.net</a> which was fairly informative, but they all seem pretty much the same to me. Also, I saw one today that didn't come with an external writer, just a cart and the usb plugs (<a class="postlink" href="http://e2city.com/product_details.php?p=4&amp;cur=USD" target="_blank">http://e2city.com/product_details.php?p=4&amp;cur=USD</a>). Is this a complete set? Does it just use the gba to write the game to the cart?
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything else I should look for? I figure I'll get a usb linker (seems like the standard). Alot of them advertise a cart size (64, 128, 256). I'll assume bigger is better and just kind of make the decision on price. Am I correct in assuming that a 256 linker also works with a 128 cart?
<br/>
<br/>
So what's everyone's favorite linker and cart? Can you also give an approximate price? The vendors all seem to vary in the prices for their products so it would be nice to know I'm not grossly overpaying or something. Also, what's everyone's favorite vendor? Alot of them seem kind of shady to me. Maybe I'm just being silly.

I suggest using an 64 Mbit because it's enouqh for development in most cases. But i think 128 are not much more expensive so u can bye this one too.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">oh wow, I didn't even know there <span style="font-style: italic">was</span> a flash section. I'll check it out.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd also like to take a moment to kind of justify my post (which, as it seems, is one that's been asked before). I, prior to posting, did indeed do a forum search on the words forum and cart and only got a handful of returns. I did then take note of the "retailer feedback" forum, but did not notice the flash. So there's that.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">When you find yourself in the company of a halfling and an ill-tempered Dragon, remember, you do not have to outrun the Dragon... </span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
