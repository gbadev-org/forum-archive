    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been trying to get the Linux version of DevKitARM working for hours now but with little avail and i am just about to give up hope.
<br/>
<br/>
There is no setup interface and i cannot find any useful documentation on the project site or within the compressed files themselves how you properly make use of the compiler i haven't a clue. I also don't want this to interfere with the normal opperation of my gcc installation. 
<br/>
<br/>
Do i need to associate this with a development application such as e-macs in order to make this work or are these libraries that need to be copied to my current gcc installations directory.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows of any good installation and configuration tutorials for linux version of this ARM compiler any help would be greatly appreciated. Even if it can't be used with a development environment i would be happy with even command line usage.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
