    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have some troubles starting with GRIT. I can't compile my project or any example project using grit. I always have this message :

It seams that makefile can't find where is the "grit.exe". Even if I copy the "grit.exe" file in the directory of the makefile, It doesn't work. 
<br/>
<br/>
What should I do ? Help please ! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had a problem once where I had an old installation of devkitArm, then tried updating on top of it....the examples all were set to use grit, but for some reason, grit itself was never added to my /bin folder.  I had to remove devkitArm and reinstall, and that fixed it.

If you are still having trouble, that might be worth trying.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for your help tepples. As Grit has changed his name, I had a previous version of the tool installed named "GIT.exe". I just copy "grit.exe" file into the bin directory and everything works fine now.

Thanks :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
