Could someone give me an example of what mode to use for different types of games?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most 2D games will use modes 0, 1, or 2 because of the hardware-supported tiled backgrounds. Whether you use modes 1 or 2 instead of 0 just depends on if you want the ability to use rotate/scale backgrounds (at the expense of the total number of backgrounds available).
<br/>
<br/>
The bitmap modes (3, 4, and 5) are used far less frequently for games, although they might be used for things like displaying still pictures. Modes 3-5 are also typically used by 3D games that don't use Mode 7 (which are few and far between because of the computational cost of doing 3D on the GBA).
<br/>
<br/>
So for most games you will be using Mode 0-2, and whichever you choose just depends on the visual style you are going for (ie. whether you would have more backgrounds or the ability to rotate/scale them).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also be aware that a few scaling and distortion effects, as seen in games such as <span style="font-style: italic">Pole Position</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Rad Racer</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Street Fighter II</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic">NBA Jam</span>, do not require the extra capabilities of modes 1 and 2.
<br/>
<br/>
Rule of thumb: If you've seen an effect done on the NES or Sega Genesis, use mode 0.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright I'm understanding it a bit more but I have a few more questions. 
<br/>
<br/>
For Mode 0 you said Genesis or the NES use it. I did see some mosaic in some games is that possible to do in mode zero without scaling rotation? I'm still a bit new to the mosaic effect. 
<br/>
<br/>
From my understanding the difference between mode 1 and mode 2 is that mode 2 has only 2 layers but can both be scaled and rotated. Mode 1 has an aditional background however only one layer can be scaled and rotated. Is it helpful to have 2 scalable and rotatable backgrounds or does it really not matter too much?
<br/>
<br/>
Between the 3 modes Mode 0 looks like it has a lot of offer but what about mode's 1 and 2. How useful is scaling and rotation in a game?
<br/>
<br/>
Also about mode 3 and 4, are there any examples you can find of them used in commercial games?
<br/>
<br/>
Also my game I would like to make involves a top down view and needs alpha blending and other effect.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the replies they are really helpful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This depends entirely on the game. As tepples noted, you can pull off some nifty visual effects (with some creativity) using Mode 0 with straight text backgrounds. Mode 7 requires at least one scale/rot background, however. Other than that, it depends on what visual effect you're trying to create. If you want a background to, for example, scale or rotate, it would be a good idea to use a rot/scale background.

This is like asking how useful is an ultrasound when someone is sick. It's not enough information about the problem to provide a useful answer. Rot/scale backgrounds are tools; first you need an idea of what you want, then you choose the appropriate tools to implement it.

Do you know if you want any parts of the top-down view to rotate or scale? If so, you've answered your own question.

Mosaic works in all modes. I just said "mode 0" because there seems to be a widespread misconception that the warping floor backgrounds in <span style="font-style: italic">Pole Position</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Street Fighter II</span> require a rot/scale layer.

<br/>
Many times, you'll have a HUD (heads-up display) layer showing score, health, etc. You may find it more convenient to display it with a spare "text" background than with sprites.

Two words: <span style="font-style: italic">Mario Kart</span>. In addition, <span style="font-style: italic">Super Castlevania IV</span> for Super NES did some interesting things with background rotation.

<span style="font-style: italic">Doom</span> and several other 3D games use mode 4.

Sprite-to-background alpha blending works in any mode; background-to-background alpha blending works modes 0, 1, and 2.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
