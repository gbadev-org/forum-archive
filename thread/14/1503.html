<br/>
<br/>
I "was" using C, but seeing as I know more about C++, I decided to rewrite it in C++. Everything is fine, and I havent experienced any problems as of yet, or any performance issues.
<br/>
<br/>
I would also be interested to know any pros and cons of each though, in case Im about to run into problems the more advanced my game gets.<br/>_________________<br/>---

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Exactly my thoughts,
<br/>
<br/>
When Im coding, I *think* in C++, therefore it was an easy choice to rewrite in C++, instead of writing C poorly. If you're a C coder, then you're not going to go the C++ route. 
<br/>
<br/>
So is there no known issues with using C++ over C?<br/>_________________<br/>---
