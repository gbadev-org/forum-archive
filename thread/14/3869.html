    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi! I just went through a.v. ebbesen's tutorial on making pong.  I decided to try out making a game on my own and i was thinking of making an arkanoid clone.  Since arkanoid has many of the same blocks i was wondering if you could just load in a sprite once but draw it multiple times each frame? ie. instead of having 
<br/>
OAMEntry sprites[128]
<br/>
sprites[0], sprites[1], sprites[2].... etc. for each block could i just use one slot in the array to draw the same picutre of a block many times in different positions on the screen? i hope this makes sense....any help would be greatly appreciated! thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You have to use seperate OAMEntrys but you can let them use the same Image Cell Data. So you will need less video memory for it. There are ways to increase the number of sprites displayed but they are not worth doing in most situations since 128 is normaly enough.
