    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hello I was just trying out some random code just to move a sprite around on screen, eventually it worked, but since i originally followed the Pong Demo I used a lot of the header files that were created for that, instead of the header files made for DevkitARM.
<br/>
<br/>
For example when I would use some code for sprites or to see if a key is pressed, the original header files from DevKitPro would say "undeclared" for things like "keyDown", while only the custom header files I made with the Pong demo would work... 
<br/>
<br/>
This concerns me because I was just thinking to use the standardized functions/commands rather than have a bunch of different sprites, input, etc... files, just use the main ones that came with DevkitARM (also by using standard header files it will be easier to trouble shoot with other people as they will know where exactly I got some commands from).
<br/>
<br/>
For example, the following snippets of code:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
   sprites[0].attribute0 = COLOR_256 | SQUARE | 108;
<br/>
   sprites[0].attribute1 = SIZE_32 | 40;
<br/>
   sprites[0].attribute2 = 512;
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
as well as:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
if(keyDown(KEY_LEFT) &amp;&amp; xmain_01 &gt; xMin)
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
will only work on the custom header files made along with the Pong tutorial, they won't work with the standard header files from DevkitARM.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried reading the header files to understand what exactly the comands are changed to but there really isn't an example commented out in those header files (unlike the Pong example, which is much easier to follow, but again not standard so if i get stuck somewhere, i can't compare with another person as to what exactly went wrong).
<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated, thank you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
