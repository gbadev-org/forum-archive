    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heya,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for a guide on how to use Visual Studio.net's IDE to write my GBA programs.  I looked in the sticky FAQ and in the Visual Studio section it pointed to a dead link.  Does anyone have a working mirror, or can anyone help me to set up VS.net so that I can link it to DevKitARM?  BTW, I don't have VS version 6, so I can't use the GBA App Wizard.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!
<br/>

I took and altered the Makefile from a tutorial called SimpleBGScroll.  I believe the tutorial tells which lines to alter.

<br/>
The above tutorial did most of the work for me.  After altering the Makefile, and setting the correct paths, I created an "External Command" from the Tools window, and set the path to my GBA emulator.  Finally, I took the SimpleBGScroll Visual Studio 6 file and converted it to a Visual Studio.net project.  I deleted all of the code, put in a basic function with proper headers, and renamed all of the files.  I keep the empty project in its own directory, and when I make a new game, I just copy the project and rename.  Finally, open the gba.h in the Solution Viewer (it has to be in the correct directory for the Makefile to use it), then finally #include the header with double quotes.  Hope that helps a little!
<br/>
<br/>
Note: If this doesn't work, feel free to ask more specific questions.  I'm thinking of going back and starting over, and documenting what needs to be done, so it can be semi-standardized.  :)<br/>_________________<br/>Brian Chambers

Sure!

Now, for some reason, you can't use this in a directory with spaces; it's probably because of the Makefile, but I haven't had time to troubleshoot yet.  I'm posting my skeleton file here [zipped]:

If you have any problems with it, post it here or e-mail me.  :)  It works fine on my computer, 0 errors and 0 warnings, and the ROM tests fine.  As soon as I finish typing it up, I'll post how to test the ROM within VS.net as well using an External Command.<br/>_________________<br/>Brian Chambers

If this was posted in anything other than the beginner?s forum I may tend to agree with you on keeping the headers from a single source. The fact is that the information I requested from Vylrath was a big help on helping me setup a good programming environment with my .net IDE. I haven?t seen any single source that details how to achieve the results that he and I are looking for with the .net IDE, so on the same token if you have any idea on how we can successfully setup a functional GBA programming environment with the .net IDE, your comments will be gratefully received.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

that's precisely why the headers shouldn't be included as part of a skeleton project. A decent set of headers for a particular platform should be in only one place in any developer's setup. This is done as a matter of course by experienced programmers and is one of the major sources of problems for beginners.

Hmm ... I included the headers because I always include gba.h, so I put all the necessary headers in the project directory.  I'm always eager to learn from my mistakes ... what was it I did wrong?  Thankee!<br/>_________________<br/>Brian Chambers

This is after the fact; I?m sure there must be hundreds of documents in the dark recesses of the internet that may have helped. The point is that he posted it here in this thread solidified the knowledge he has gained in the last few weeks.
<br/>
<br/>
Setting up the complier to work with .net IDE, although a big part, is only one step in the process of setting up a functional environment to develop code for the GBA (inside the .net IDE). For example Vylrath explained how to add the emulator as a tool option to run complied roms straight from the IDE.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess the real point I?m trying to make here is this:  If you take the effort to come to the beginner?s forum to point out errors in development doctrine you should also take the effort to leave a small piece of advice on what we should be doing to achieve our goal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
