    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone, I've just got my hands on the MB v2 cable to start programming for the GBA, and I'm wondering the best place to start. I've been programming a while now, completed several games in <a class="postlink" href="http://java-game-lib.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Java</a> and been programming in C++ for almost a year now. A few questions:
<br/>
<br/>
I did C programming for a course at uni, but havn't touched it since. Is it worth coding in C for the gba, or should I be fine with C++? Is there any particular gotchas with using C++ other than avoiding fancy polymorphic code?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty familiar with Visual Studio, is there any way to setup a gba project so i can get single click compile? I assume I'd need some sort of custom makefiles, but beyond that i'm not sure. Edit: I see theres something linked in the FAQ, i'm heading there now..
<br/>
<br/>
Since i'll be using a link cable, not a flash cart, is there any differences i should be aware of? (other than 256kb limit and the different memory start position). I did see metioned that WRAM performed best with one type of code, but can't remember whether it was ARM or Thumb - do i need to worry about this? In a similar way, will the fact that i'll be testing on a GBA SP change anything? (i'd guess not, but you never know..)
<br/>
<br/>
Whats currently the best emulator out there for development? Still VisualBoyAdvance?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks![/url]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Go to <a href="http://www.gbadev.org" target="_blank">www.gbadev.org</a> and go to tool -&gt; emulators -&gt; devkitadv and after you downloaded that go to tools -&gt; misc -&gt; gba apwizard. Then you get to choose GBA project from MS Visual C++ 6.0. Just make sure that the Devdir in the make file is ok. Otherwise it wont compile. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also select build instead of compile :), somehting else to look out for (if your not too experiened with makefiles). Go to the O_FILES bit in the makefile and put there the C file (if) you want to add and add filename.o instead of C.
<br/>
<br/>
Then put this line in the main C file. 
<br/>
extern const u16 SilohData[]; (this is an example for a array, something similair would be neccecary for functions. This helps keep the code tidy).<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
