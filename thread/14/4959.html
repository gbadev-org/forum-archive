    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everyone,
<br/>
Kinda new at this, I'm actually not developing a game of any sort.   It's rather a information program for a company that i'm working for.  Well here's my problem.  I've created the program and made the gba file.  that's all good. However, I've also created an mpeg which i converted to a gba file (via an online free trial version converter).  but now i'm trying to append the program file to the end of the mpeg gba file. any idea how to do this? or a better way to accomplish it? 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, 
<br/>
