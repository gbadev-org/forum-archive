    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, I'm really new to the GBA universe, having only bought my GBA SP a few weeks ago, though I've had my try at programming in C/C++ for more conventional platforms...
<br/>
I'm not really interested in developing games for the GBA, but being very fond of my SP (and wanting to carry it everywhere) I was wondering if anyone had developed or started developing some kind of PDA app for GameBoy Advance (very basic stuff, with something like a scheduler, and such...)
<br/>
Having surfed around the forums and GBA sites a bit, it seems
<br/>
1. that either gba developers don't find the project sexy/appropriate enough, or
<br/>
2. that the whole thing is very difficult.
<br/>
I'd love to be proven wrong.
<br/>
So if anyone knows of PDA dev projects out there, or want to start one, please lemme know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Secondly, as there is no keyboard input it is not really easy to use. It doesn't have a auto switch-on capabilities or a realtime clock. So basically, it is not really convenient to use as a PDA...
<br/>
<br/>
Atleast that's my opinion about it...!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Right, I checked that out, and it seems awesome. Wished I hadn't alreday bought my Flash2Advance kit before!!!
<br/>
<br/>
More pragmatically, what I had in mind (since I thought realtime clock and built-in calendar were not to be thought of) was something like a "planner"/"scheduler"/"notebook" (more paper-like, rather than PDA), with colour codes for example (for meetings, appointments, birthdays and what not). I've seen something a bit in that spirit, called Keeper, at:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://snow.prohosting.com/~fearware/keeper/keeper.htm" target="_blank">http://snow.prohosting.com/~fearware/keeper/keeper.htm</a>
<br/>
but it's way too unorganized for an organizer...
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of similar apps, that could maybe provide a starting-point for development?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A way to track time, would be to export it when you create you Rom with your editor, on a Pc. Then you just keep track of the last date you were on.

if you use a flash card with a battery you can create a time clock.

and data can then be saved from pc to pda (GB) trough de flash link.

so you have to make actual two programs i think.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There are a couple of issues that should be discussed (like, should the GBA app be synced with a PC-based program, and what about real time clocks, and so on...)
<br/>
<br/>
I think I'd better start setting up a web page for the project, in order to gather people interested in the challenge (Ideas for a cool name, anyone?).
<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, the forum is a cool place to discuss these issues, I think. The big question is: what exactly do we want the app to DO?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yeah, I think you're perfectly right.
<br/>
Personally, I don't care about a clock.
<br/>
I want a colour-coded interactive time-table, to know for example that today is my mother's birthday, and I'm having dinner with her at 8 p.m. and should not forget to bring some flowers.
<br/>
I think I'm going to work on colour-coded categories (such as: to-do; birthday; appointment; meeting; lunch/dinner... and what have you.)
<br/>
<br/>
The most challenging part is, in my opinion, the formatting and space alloting for data (in the SRAM)...
<br/>
<br/>
And also, the calendar part... I've been reading about Conway's Doomsday algorithm. That sounds a pretty cool thing to code. Check it out:

I've heard that you can write to flashcartridges from your GBA so you wouldn't have to fit everything in SRAM, you practially have the whole cartridge to store stuff in. Apparently it's extremely slow but I wouldn't know, I don't own a flashcart.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I have a GBA and a GBA SP.  I would love to have a PDA utility to my GBA SP so that I can justify having it with me at work.  ;)
<br/>
<br/>
To me that most important tools would be Calenday, ToDo List, Notes &amp; Contacts.  It would also take some clever UI design to accomodate the lack of touchscreen and/or keyboard.
<br/>
<br/>
Support for an external keboard might be possible, but it would need to work without one also.  There is a tutorial on adding an Ericsson Chatboard (small keyboard) to a GBA with sample test code at:  <a href="http://www.hh.se/stud/d99tibr/index5.html" target="_blank">http://www.hh.se/stud/d99tibr/index5.html</a> . 
<br/>
<br/>
I recently purchased Innovations GBA Personal Organizer that was mentioned above.  I will report on what it is like as soon as it arrives.
<br/>
<br/>
While I am not a Software developer I have skills that could assist in the development of the project.  I will help anyway that I can.

Sweex, you are perfectly right. Those two things are exactly what I was considering: mobile phone approach for text input is a great idea; and a list of keywords is definitely a plus, like "dinner with", "call", "bring", etc.

It would be interesting to compile a little dictionary of such "commonly-used organizer expressions".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The GBA has a sleep mode, so let's use it. Instead of powering off, we could put it on sleep mode, having only the vsync interupt enabled. The vsync would be used as our timer.  So, when we re-activate it, it would still have the right time. Plus, when the time of an appointement come, it could beep. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how long a GBA can last on sleep mode, with some minimal processing, but this could be interesting. I'm thinking that having the screen off would save most of the batteries.

This way you can leave your GBA on for weeks! As I don't have a SP or charging pack I am not going to try this but if anyone did I would like to know how long it will last in "sleep mode"!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not a bad idea, but you won't be able to use your GBA for anything else!  (Like playing games)  What y'all are proposing would completetly take over the GBA, otherwise, when you wanted to play a game you would have to reset the time on the PDA app when you were done.
<br/>
So you are paying almost $400 for a pda with very few buttons - GBA, Flash card, etc; when a true PDA can be had for much less.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a pocketwatch that I paid $10 for - it does all those things and has a stylus keyboard. (not to mention its less than one quarter the size of the GBA) I doubt this project could possibly beat that.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying this project is sensless - just that a different approach might be better - though I don't have any suggestions at this time.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://lorrd.fearware.net" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/vzep3wth/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/lorrdbanner.gif">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
