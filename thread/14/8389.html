    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was just wondering, when is the best time to release a game?
<br/>
I'm working on a game at the moment, its about half done, the gfx need a little work, and there is no sound yet. 
<br/>
Do people prefer to hear about a game that is in development, and perhaps give support and encouragment, or only find out about it when it is finished?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't talk about any game until it is finished - or I know I will definately finish it. The worst thing you can do is to advertise a game you later decide to discontinue before it is worth playing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
