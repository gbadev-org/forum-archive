    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've just got a new laptop - one which runs VBA a bit better. However, the GFX2GBA frontend doesn't work on it - it gives me the following error:
<br/>
<br/>
Unable to start the application--the Java Virtual Machine cannot be loaded.
<br/>
<br/>
Class not registered
<br/>
<br/>
I've installed the Java Vitrual Machine, and Sun's JRE (the latest one) but the program still doesn't work. Having a look around on google never turned anything useful up, so I've come to you guys.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You could try restarting your laptop if you didn't already.  Sometimes it's just required, though you probably did already (just checking!).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
