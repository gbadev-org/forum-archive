The arm-elf-g++ command has changed; couldn't tell you off the top of my head, but go to the site and it will tell you. Also the devkit has a makefile that you can use as a template somewhere.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How new are you to programming? How much experience have you had? You might want to look into the beginners FAQ and start doing a bit of coding in windows, or whatever OS you are using first.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If they are there but the tools are complaining that it can't find them then the problem is in the way you are using the tools not the files.
<br/>
<br/>
If the problem is in the compiler not finding a header file then you need to add -I/folder/where/the/headers/are to the compiler command or to the CFLAGS definition in your make file. This option -I adds additional locations to search for header files.
<br/>
<br/>
If the problem is that the linking command can't find a library you need to add a -L/folder/where/the/library/is to your linking command prior to the -lnameWithoutLibPrefix portion of the command string or add it to the LDFLAGS definition in your make file.  This option -L adds a additional location for the link phase to LOOK for library files.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
