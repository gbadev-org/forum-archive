    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all. I'm new to GBA Development and have looked at several options for developing a GBA game. VisualHAM caught my eye so far, but I don't want to get deep into just one kit without some input from other developers.
<br/>
<br/>
Just to give some background, my intent it to create a futuristic RPG with a tile-based map system. 
<br/>
<br/>
Any input is welcome.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Visual HAM consists of both the development environment and the HAM SDK. As far as development environments go, there's nothing wrong with Visual HAM; it's only real contender is DevKit Advance and either one is just fine - it should also be easy enough to switch your code from using one to the other if you want to. I think the majority of people in this forum use DKA, however, which doesn't include its own editor and I suppose is less disposed to using a predetermined set of tools (which many of us like). The upshot, though, is that it doesn't really matter. :P
<br/>
<br/>
Using the HAM SDK is another matter; there are a number of similar SDKs around and my general advice is that while they will make your initial foray into GBA development much easier (since they basically provide "wrapper" routines for most of the basic things you would want to do), they really only delay the inevitable if you want to develop something more complicated (like an RPG), and you will probably find yourself eventually shedding the SDK altogether in favour of coding straight C/C++/assembly, and quite possibly trying to unlearn a lot of bad habits you may have picked up along the way. So my advice is to skip the SDK and invest in learning how to code for the GBA directly with any of the tutorials linked to on this site and in the FAQ.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,
<br/>

Still, if you've had prior experience of using an SDK to program but are new to GBA coding it might not be such a bad idea to adopt one for a while. Without knowing whether you've handled a console before, or if you're even comfy with C/C++ or not, it's hard to offer decent advice.
<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, the most straightforward way to get a tile-based RPG (that's a big project if you're just starting out... have you done one before?) up and running would be to use Dragon BASIC*. You could always port it to a lower level language once the infrastructure was working... and even then pretty much everything you might want to do would fall well within the remit of, say, HAM. It's not like you're planning on implementing a speed-dependent raycaster here -- identify what you <span style="font-style: italic">need </span>from a development environment and then go for the one that fulfills those needs while giving you the most help if you're new.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck anyway!
<br/>

<br/>
I am, however, a complete newb when it comes to GBA dev. Hence my request for advice here. I'll give DragonBasic a look as well.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In your case then, I definately go for DevKitAdv.  You don't need the hand holding of the other libraries.  You'll be up and coding in hours :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#16589 - Sledge - Fri Feb 20, 2004 1:25 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dragon BASIC is good for getting yourself familiar with Mode 0, palette assignments and sprite manipulation -- it's expedient because adding assets is relatively straightforward in comparison to C so tinkering with the hardware is a painless affair. If you're familiar with C/C++ however, then you might find it just as easy (ie the process of converting images etc to .c files has become second nature) to use an SDK.
<br/>
<br/>
Poslundc is right in saying that higher level interaction can make for problems too, though. For example characterblock 0 and screenblock 0 both reference the beginning of a singular block of memory -- you'd never make the mistake of using the same area of that memory for two different purposes if you were coding in pure C or ASM because you'd immediately notice that the numbers you were tapping in are equal. However this fact is obfuscated in Dragon BASIC (and quite possibly in HAM too, but I've stuck with Mode 4 in HAM so far thus can't say) by the fact that they have different names and, hence, it's not unheard of for beginners to start out with a corrupted display. And yes, I mean me.
<br/>
<br/>
Regardless though, the GBA is just a fun machine to mess around with and there's plenty of help however you go about mastering the thing. It would just be a shame to let the "Not Built Here!" syndrome spoil your enjoyment, so be mindful of that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I would make a simple game like Pong or Tic-Tac-Toe. Chances are you won't finish a large game and since you're a newbie, you will still be learning the hardware. It is a nice piece of hardware.
