    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a F2A USB writer &amp; 64M flash cart that I used a few years ago.  I've dug it out of storage and wanted to get it running again, but it appears that Linux USB has moved on since then, so f2a and if2a don't work for me.
<br/>
<br/>
Are there more recent versions somewhere (that I'm not able to find among all the linkfarms, dammit!) or some other good way to get things working again?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm running Ubuntu-9.04 (which is at EOL and I'll have to upgrade some more soon!)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, nice!  I didn't know anyone made Slot-1 homebrew adapters, but a quick google turns up one for $12, free shipping.  Not worth spending any time screwing around with the old F2A &amp; USB at all.
