    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey All,
<br/>
<br/>
Well I've been looking into doing GBA programming for a while now and have downloaded DevKitARM. Its all working and i'm using the Programmers Notpad for coding. I've also read up on making makefiles.
<br/>
<br/>
As for coding. I'm intermeidate at C and Java and alittle C++ so coding isnt new to me. What is new to me is the DevkitARM.
<br/>
<br/>
I've looked everywhere for a simple beginners tutorial for GBA programming that uses devkitARM and as far as i can see there isnt one. The closest is TONC's and he/she uses their own freaken headers!! Sorry got a bit carried away there.. no offense to TONC .. but its really frustrating to have this kit and not know how to uses it.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any tutorial out there that uses devkitARM and uses the devkitARM headers files. ie gba_base.h, gba_video.h, gba_type.h (with out completely rewriting them)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance to anyones response. 
<br/>

(PS there seems to be a lot of out dated tutorials using dkadv, which as far as i can see isnt updated anymore or for a long time)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Tonc's <span style="font-style: italic">does</span> use devkitARM. Strictly speaking, devkitARM != libgba. Apart from crt0.S and a linkscript, devkitARM (or the much older dkadv) have little to no GBA-specific code in them. The main purpose of devkitARM is to take your code and turn C code into ARM machine code.
<br/>
<br/>
All the headers you may find (whether it's pern, sgade, ham/hel, tonc, libgba) do mostly the same thing: defining some basic types, the memory map (all those REG_ things) and bit-defines for those registers; with the possible exception of the names, these are the same for each library, so the one you use is pretty much irrelevant. vid_mem, VideoBuffer, MODE3_FB -- they're all pointers to 0x0600:0000 so it doesn't matter which name you use. It's not the names that are important, it's what they stand for.
<br/>
<br/>
Just run with any tutorials that you can find to learn what you can and cannot do with the GBA, learn a bit about how to deal with the different memory sections, and then feel free to throw away the headers you find there and piece together your own set.
<br/>

Correct. The standard is devkitARM now, but in <span style="font-style: italic">principle</span> the toolchain you use to build your code is irrelevant. Of course in <span style="font-style: italic">practice</span>, devkitARM will do better job. But valid C code can be compiled with either toolchain, you only have to change the toolnames and compiler flags just a little bit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are some gba examples distributed with the devkitPro installer which use the libgba headers. Documentation is being worked on as we speak and I hope to get that into the installer once it matures a bit.
<br/>
<br/>
The doxygen files are hosted here atm -&gt; <a href="http://devkitpro.sourceforge.net/onlinedocs/libgba/files.html" target="_blank">http://devkitpro.sourceforge.net/onlinedocs/libgba/files.html</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cheers, thank you both, for the link and the info.
<br/>
<br/>
I've started using the tutorial by gbajunkie. It seems really good. I also been poking round inside the headers and trying to match up the names/defines with the same ones that gbaJunkie uses (they are basicly the same anyway).
<br/>
<br/>
You are right Cearn its the princples behind whats going on that matters.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you both again, i'm sure you'll see me poking my head in now and then over the next couple of months :-)
