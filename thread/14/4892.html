    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys! I want to use Linux to develop for GBA. I have downloaded HAM from <a class="postlink" href="http://ngine.de/" target="_blank">http://ngine.de/</a> and ran runme_once.sh shell script but I am still unfamiliar with what I am doin!?
<br/>
<br/>
I am a linux noob, sorry guys!
<br/>
<br/>
I am willing to follow the directions on <a class="postlink" href="http://linux.gbadev.org/" target="_blank">http://linux.gbadev.org/</a> but I would like to get some more feedback on it, and if possible information about what IDE you guys use, I was hoping to use VisualHAM but I guess the interface is Windows only. I don't want to resort to normal text editors if I can help it. Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My suggestion is Eclipse with the CDT-Plugin (C/C++ IDE). It's a decent IDE and I use it in windows and linux.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks, I use Eclipse for Java right now, my hope was that I could write and compile in the same environment, a la VisualHAM. But I'm guessing you cant do that in Linux :/
<br/>

Windows and VisualHAM have spoiled me!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
