    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been coding C/C++ for about 9 years now and have just recently decided I want to make my own NintendoDS game.  However, before I start, there are some questions I have and I am not sure where to find the answers.

1.  Can I write a game and play it on my physical DS (not an emulator)?
<br/>
2.  What hardware is required to do such?
<br/>
3.  What software is required to do such?
<br/>
4.  Where can I find tutorials on how to program a game for my DS?

Thank you in advance for the help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you familiarized yourself with the GBA hardware first? The DS 2D video architecture is a direct descendant of the (slightly less complex) GBA video architecture.

A NoPass card and a SLOT-2 flash card. For details, see the sticky topics in the DS Flash Equipment forum.

Many DS 2D tutorials tend to assume familiarity with GBA mode, and most GBA-native homebrew programs have not been ported to the DS. For these reasons, I would recommend against having no interest in GBA mode and would therefore recommend against owning only a SLOT-1 device. To approximate the memory restrictions of SLOT-1 if you only have a SLOT-2 card and a NoPass, use .nds files and don't use GBFS or similar appended datafile systems.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
