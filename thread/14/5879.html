<br/>
Make/batch files or

IDE integrationy type stuff

Ive been fiddling with a few things here and there using batch files so far because i havent had much luck setting up Dev C++.
<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to flexability what is the best choice (if theres much of a difference) when taking into consideration changing external picture objects etc.

In terms of flexibility, I don't think there's anything out there that surpasses the power of makefiles.
<br/>
<br/>
In terms of convenience, they are a real pain to learn and understand, and even harder to understand <span style="font-style: italic">well</span>, and are usually avoidable enough that even programmers who use them regularly (myself included) never get very far with them.
<br/>
<br/>
If I could do things over again, though, I would dedicate more time early on to figuring out makefiles. As a project grows, your knowledge of not only how to write them but how to write them <span style="font-style: italic">well</span> will prove invaluable.
<br/>
<br/>
I think most modern IDEs have options to invoke external make scripts. If yours does, then go for it... I couldn't give you a list of which ones do, but I'll note that even if yours doesn't it's usually a matter of pressing "up" in a console window to bring back the last command (usually "make" or "make something"). I would favour this option over setting up a complicated integration process with my IDE... one technique is portable and the other isn't.
<br/>
<br/>
Batch files are a DOS workaround for a tool that doesn't exist in DOS. By the time your project grows beyond five or six files, you'll be clamouring for a makefile. (By the time it grows to several hundred/thousand, you may have several.) Learn to use makefiles instead; batch files are only delaying the inevitable.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I could go back, I wonder if I'd learn something like SCons instead.  Having a real language to back it up is appealing -- I've often wondered why on earth we need this complicated pseudo-language behind make, rather than just using a real language and adding build rules as a library.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In a *NIX environment - where most software packages come in source format and often only compiled to target binaries on the end user's machine - having a universal tool for managing that process is pretty mandatory.
<br/>
<br/>
Building it on as an extension to another language would probably weaken it from serving that fundamental purpose.
<br/>
<br/>
Not that I like make... I don't; but I understand its existence.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm pretty sure I understand its existence as well.  It started out as a minimal build automation tool, and as builds got more complex, it started evolving programming-language-like features one at a time, never actually developing a linguistic foundation.
<br/>
<br/>
I can count the special things that make does on one hand.  Adding those features to a real language should not be unreasonable, as long as that language is light on scaffolding and capable of cleanly abstracting over the concepts involved.  Python fits the bill.
<br/>
<br/>
The worst that could happen is that you have too many features that don't matter for a typical build.  (Well, that and you'd have to learn a new tool that isn't the established standard.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
