<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, I assume this is a batch file yes? And you installed devkitadv to the default directory, and restarted the computer afterwords?
<br/>
<br/>
Odds are, you simply need to set the environment variables manually, which can be a pain depending on your version of windows. You also might want to check your path command for things like capitalization and such. (Not quite sure what the default is there) But it all boils down to a windows path issue in the end, everything else looks good.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Quick tip to get you going in devkitARM: If you're building a GBA program on a PC, use <span style="font-weight: bold">arm-eabi-gcc</span> not <span style="font-weight: bold">gcc</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">arm-eabi-objcopy</span> not <span style="font-weight: bold">objcopy</span>. The newer tools follow a standard that <span style="font-weight: bold">gcc</span> without a prefix refers to a toolchain that compiles for the same platform that it runs on.

OK, so it\'s not really that bad, but be prepared to un-learn a lot of stuff very fastly. They use a lot of older and outdated methods (like using a for loop to copy image data) that has been severely improved upon. The document is very old. It will give you a very basic rundown of framebuffer modes and sprites, but that\'s about it. I recommend using anything else in the world except that tutorial, and my fellow gbadev community members should agree, as well as be able to point out the better beginner demos. (Im a TONC fan myself, but thats not very beginner oriented...)
