    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody.
<br/>
Being a newb, I was following the Pern Project to find my footing in the world of GBA development. Unfortunately, the tools Dovoto recommends for .o files are outdated. Whenever I use them with devkitARM r19b, I get an error about the eabi version being 1, instead of 4. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have managed to find a replacment for bin2o, but a working pcx2sprite still eludes me. Can someone point me to some equivilant tools, or an alternate way of loading sprites I can use to finish the series?
<br/>
<br/>
Thankyou for your time,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ye olde <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ohnehirn.de/tools/" target="_blank">gfx2gba</a> should be able to do the pcx conversions , my olde <a class="postlink" href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/downloads.htm" target="_blank">tools</a> should do the trick as well. Slightly newer versions should be available Real Soon Now.

None of these convert directly into object files, but using c/asm/binary intermediates works just as well in the end.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is what he means: <ul><li>If you can output to assembly language (.s) files, you can use arm-eabi-gcc to turn .s files into .o files. </li><li>If you can output to binary (.chr), you can use bin2s to turn .chr files into .s files. </li><li>If you can output to binary, you can use GBFS to turn all your project's .chr files into a .gbfs file, which can in turn be converted to a .s file or simply appended to your .gba file. </li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the advice everyone, but I have ran into a problem. I was trying to use the method tepples suggested first, (namely use an .s file to make the object) but when I try to compile, I get the following error.

The .s file was made using Usenti, which I already had on my harddrive. I'm not sure if it is outdated. Anyway, I am awaiting your knowledge inspiring answers :P.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thankyou! It worked like a charm. I have one question, though. Is there any reason Dovoto uses un-decoded pcx files for the background in Lesson 2? Wouldn't having things already in the right format speed up the code and make it easier to understand and use?

I'm guessing that he thought that having a known-good GBA-side decoder was worth not having to translate the bitmaps on the PC and deal with 4-bit vs. 8-bit tiled vs. 8-bit linear vs. 16-bit linear.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
