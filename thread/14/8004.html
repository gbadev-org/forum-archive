    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Howdy folks, I'm new to all this, and have some questions on a lot of stuff. I've only read the first 1/3 or so of the FAQ, so if something has already been answered, just kick my ass and tell me to RTFM. XD
<br/>
<br/>
First, a bit of background, so you know where I'm coming from.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm starting with GBA programming, even though I will be leading into DS development, because it's an obvious path, and the GBA has better documentation right now.
<br/>
<br/>
My current learning plan:
<br/>
Right now, I'm reading <a class="postlink" href="http://www.jharbour.com/gameboy/default.aspx" target="_blank">Programming the Gameboy Advance</a>'s online version
<br/>
I plan to follow that up with the TONC tutorials and then follow the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.webbesen.dk/gba/" target="_blank">Crash Course</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, this should get me off to a good start with GBA programming. 
<br/>
(I've done C++ for a few years now, so I am fairly comfortable with it)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm doing the development primarily for my Red DS, and I know all abouth the firmware problems, but I'm not worried.
<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, on to the questions.
<br/>
1. Which Flash Cart currently supports GBA Development best?
<br/>
2. Which Flash Cart currently supports DS Development best? ( I know about the passkey and whatnot, so ou can skip the info on it)
<br/>
3. VBA can be used to run my GBA code well, but which DS emulator can run test code best?
<br/>
4. How big of a jump will going from GBA 2d programming, to the DS's 3d modes?
<br/>
Finally, what are some examples of the best programs the dev. scene has to offer?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure I have more questions, but I can't think of them now...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Any NOR card. Flash2Advance and EFA-Linker are popular. You could also use a SuperCard if you want access to the CF card.

Currently, SuperCard CF. It's the only one where you can pak-swap the NAND memory card without removing the adapter.

<br/>
There does not exist an emulator that's even as accurate at emulating the Nintendo DS as Nesticle is at the NES. You'll probably have to move a CF card back and forth between your PC and your Supercard.

Nintendo DS 3D is a subset of OpenGL.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's best to get to TONC as soon as you can. When you hit TONC, everything else makes much more sense. If your C-fu is good, then you don't have to do this, but <a class="postlink" href="http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/" target="_blank">Allegro</a> is loads of fun to chuck around if you're a little rusty on some aspects of C.

I like EZFA carts, but that's only because it's the only type I've used and it does the job 110%.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a bit partial to a bit of Another World on the GBA... (but I guess that doesn't help if you're looking for examples of background and sprite uses)

You wouldn't be willing to post that file somewhere would you? It looks like the main site is down (don't know for how long or since when though).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They come in CF and SD versions. The software/firmware is updated frequently and you can also remove the SD card without removing the cartridge.  The CF cartridge must still be removed.
<br/>
<br/>
If you get any removable media flash kit, be sure to get the fastest (50X and above) that you can afford.
<br/>
<br/>
It makes a difference.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
