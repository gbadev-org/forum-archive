    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well...i really hope that you understand my question
<br/>
<br/>
well..im doing a hanoi tower for the gba...but not a simulation but a game...so you can move the discs and try to acomplish the game
<br/>
<br/>
if anybody has done this already...not matter the platform please tell me...i'm going nuts with this...
<br/>
<br/>
my principal problem is that i do not know how to keep track of the discs in the diferents towers... coz i need to know which sprite is in which tower on all times...
<br/>
<br/>
maybe you can tell me a way of how to approach the problem from differents angles...
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, you've numbered all your discs, right?  Then you can keep arrays of numbers for each tower, representing the discs that are on that tower from bottom to top.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
