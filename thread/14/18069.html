    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
While I was following a tutorial I got a little problem becouse the tutorial is a little bit out dated. I added the devkit to my path but I still can't compile the first code to a gba file.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Need to put the "bin" directory into your path, then put the right prefix on the programs.
<br/>
<br/>
I think for the current version of devkitpro, you put "arm-none-eabi-" at the beginning of each program, so you have arm-none-eabi-gcc, and arm-none-eabi-objcopy.
<br/>
<br/>
Then start using the provided makefiles, since they're easier.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's not in the code, it's in the build commands.
<br/>
<br/>
So I suggest you go to devkitpro\examples and start from one of those projects.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
