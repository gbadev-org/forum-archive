    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've recently come across a piece of hardware that plugs into the gameboy advance called the X-Board. I've got a C compiler to use with it that will allow me to make functions that use hex commands, but it doesn't have anything for the MIDI synthesizer on the gba. I can do tones and frequencies, but would like to use more advanced music. Anybody know how to help me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
