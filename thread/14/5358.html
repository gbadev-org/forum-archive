    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all. I am extremely new at the whole Rom thing, and I have been wanting to make an original game for quite some time. I don't know anything about making roms (I am a senior in High School applying to DigiPen University) and I was wondering if anyone wanted to have a fun time and make a game. My AIM is d unit will rule, my Yahoo Messenger is dakotagb, and my E-Mail is <a href="mailto:dakotagb@yahoo.com">dakotagb@yahoo.com</a>. Thank you all</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i don't mean to be rude but it's best that you go to your nearest book store and buy a book on c or c++. once you're comfortable with c or c++, get devkitarm and read the <a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm/" target="_blank">gbatek</a> i don't think no one here would like to "make" a game with someone who doesn't know anything about "making roms". the above suggestion is what worked for most people here. making games doesn't take a day to master, it may takes months and even years.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://mrkotfw.ribrdb.com/" target="_blank">http://mrkotfw.ribrdb.com/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
