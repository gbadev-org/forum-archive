    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thank you all for your support. Today I recieved my own Flash Linker (a 256 wise card), and finally I could test my games on real hardware...it feels so nice!!! is wonderful!!!
<br/>
<br/>
So, I wanna thank you all for your help, your answers, your tutorials. You're really such a nice group.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, now that I'd tested my games, I noticed two or three things...
<br/>
<br/>
* My algorithm for changing the map on real-time it sucks :P:P:P (it works, though)
<br/>
* My blendings times are a little high
<br/>
* My algorithm to show maps biggers than 32 tiles, is not working (in the emulator does).
<br/>
* The sound channels seems to be right, except when my lenght is very short (for example, the typewritting sound) I can't hear nothing (in VBA, I do)
<br/>
* The colours of the GBA are soooo dark. Does the micro, or SP fixed this????
<br/>
* My GBA is very old :'(, the KEY_LEFT is not working right 
<br/>
<br/>
Besides that, all my games are running perfectly :D:D:D
<br/>
<br/>
wait for my posts on all that questions...
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again :D 
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As for the GBA/Micro/SP colors:
<br/>
<br/>
I found the Micro's colors to be bright, yet the chroma levels seem to be slightly low (ie: reds look a lightish red...almost pink) while the SP's colors (also brighter than the GBA) seem to have the chroma levels set way too high (red is almost bleeding..if you know what I mean).
<br/>
<br/>
So, the answer that question, yes, the colors on both systems are definitely brighter than the original GBA. I own all three, and know them pretty well by now :) The brightness of the colors probably has alot to do with the backlit screen however, but the chroma levels are definitely different across all three systems. I would say none are correct (in my eyes) but the Micro comes the closest to being correct.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
