    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, 
<br/>
<br/>
i was just wondering what is needed to go about performing a emulator or something, i have no coding experience but i guess going ahead and having a go is the best way to learn,
<br/>
<br/>
so could u please leave a few pointers :-) 
<br/>
<br/>
thanks,

I learned everything from that site, it has really good tutorials and easy to understand code (even though there are some odd descriptions in the tuts...)
<br/>
<br/>
gbadev.org itself has some very good code examples itself, just look under "source" and you'll find some nice stuff. Just take an look, explore, change and see what happens ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would say...., know the ins and outs of your host hardware, and then  know the ins and out of your target hardware. this will let you know if it is realistically possible to emulate the target, Learn C, possibly ASM and maybe C++ but start from C it is easier to grasp and the other languagues biuld up from it. OOOO yeah...., read a lot of tutorials like Lupin said Thepernproject is a good source. gbadev has quite a lot of good ones
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps<br/>_________________<br/>Keep it real, keep it Free, Keep it GNU</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Programming an emulator is no easy task (especially from stratch). Personally I would start a bit lower then work you way up. <a href="http://www.gametutorials.com" target="_blank">http://www.gametutorials.com</a> is a good place to learn C++ though.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
