    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm thinking in makin' a documentation about the GBA sound, but I need to know the more usual problems involved. Things like the lack of info, the registers, problems mixing channels, and all that stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
so, in your opinnion what are the most usual problems involving sound you can find when programming for the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you can help me, as is for a school project.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>_________________<br/>All human wisdom is summed up in these two words, - 'Wait and hope"
