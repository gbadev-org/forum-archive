For compiling, I still use DevKitAdvance, but I hear DevKitARM is much better (and still being updated). For running games, I like VBA most of the time, and a flash cart or multiboot cable to test on hardware for timing-critical things and tweaking the feel of everything.
<br/>
For getting down and dirty with code, MSVC++ 6 is my favorite. I've written quite a bit of code in good old notepad in the past though, it just doesn't have as many handy editing features and ease of switching around through bunches of files.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Others on the forum may disagree, but depending on your level of experience of coding/understanding of the gba hardware, you'd probably be as well using some libraries to add a layer of abstraction while you're learning.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, people new to programming find Visual Basic easier to understand than C, because the syntax is easier and the language does most of the work for you.
<br/>
<br/>
I've many years experience of programming but came to the gba scene only a few months ago. I found VisualHAM and the HEL libraries invaluable - provided you understand how to write a program, you can have something up and running on your console in a few hours!
<br/>
<br/>
If you've never written a computer program before, learning C might be a bit tough - try starting out with a simpler language such as VB which provides excellent debugging tools to help you learn all the quicker.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And that's a dream you have to live with for a few more years. What game do you want to produce anyway?
<br/>
The GBA is best for tile based games such as puzzle and platform scrolling games. Both of these needs special math to give you the result you want.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

is a very nice mode 4 tutorial on making a pong game.
<br/>
However, as many people have suggested, you really can't just dive straight in without any experience, unlessof course you simply copy-and-paste the tutorial code and don't get creative! I'll have to admit that I jumped straight from console programming to GBA, but that was for two reasons :
<br/>
A) I had done a lot of JavaScript and many, many other languages(seriously, many)
<br/>
and
<br/>
B) This websit was far too helpful to be good!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Guess that's the answer you were waiting for ;-)
<br/>
Good luck with your games programming - but don't forget that it's easier for people to help you, once you can prove you understand the basics. 
<br/>
<br/>
(e.g. I spent a whole evening with a guy on PM explaining why I'd used a linked list over an array; after about three hours he asked me what an array was!)
<br/>
<br/>
Don't skimp on the "boring" stuff - it really does prove worthwhile in the long run. There's no substitute for well-thought-out code - in whatever language you're using - and the suggestions for using these "easier" languages were to help you do just that; to get a feel for writing code.
<br/>
<br/>
There's plenty of help on these boards for GBA stuff and it may be helpful to find and join a C/C++ specific forum too, while you're learning the language.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by blinky465 on Tue Jan 18, 2005 9:32 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Google "C tutorial". Or buy a book on learning C. Get a C compiler installed on your computer (refer to the tutorial, or most books come with a CD nowadays) and start creating example programs.
<br/>
<br/>
Once you've mastered the content of the tutorial/book, you will be in a much better position to start branching into whatever areas that interest you, be it GBA programming, Windows programming, or something else.
<br/>
<br/>
(C++ is a valid alternative to C, but I would recommend starting with C as you are likely to get an approach that will teach you more universal skills than a C++ tutorial is apt to provide.)
<br/>
<br/>
Touchstone has suggested diving headfirst into GBA programming... I would strongly caution against doing that, as you will end up wasting a <span style="font-style: italic">lot</span> more time struggling with the basics than if you give yourself a solid foundation in C programming first. Plus, everyone in the forums will be much more reluctant to help you out if you are constantly missing out on what is assumed knowledge for even beginner game programmers.

I second this as this is what I did although a had a grasp of the basics, I still struggled to understand that basics fully when I create my GBA programs... copying and pasting is one thing, understanding is another..

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would even say going as far as to learn Windows and DirectX programming is a good idea. It gives you a good idea about how API (application programming interface) work, and sooner or later, you are going to want to right your own library, you can use other libraries basic design (like the way they store data and function setup) as a base.
<br/>
<br/>
But really, it's your decision, your path. I would still strongly recommend that you kind of stay away from GBA development at first, especially until you have learned how to use pointers, as any GBA program will use them heavily  up from, if not behind the scenes.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can't just wake up one day and decide to be a painter, you have to learn about brush sizes and strokes, mixing paint colors, artistic styles, and the same goes for programming, you're not going to create a boss-fight pattern on your first time out, you gotta learn randomizers and OOP and all that stuff first.  Good luck though, I just got started myself.  I wanted to take an existing SNES game and port it to the GBA with some gameplay extras as my first project.  As you can probably guess, I had to learn how to make 2600-style games first before I added a whole new playable character to my favorite SNES game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
