    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey everyone, i gave gba dev'ing a try back with the first flash linker came out, but haven't given it any attention since then. since finishing my last project, i've been wanting to do something much smaller and so the idea of creating a game for the gba came to mind (that and my linker had just been collecting dust for years). this site and especially the forums have been a HUGE help in getting this new project rolling. because of this, i haven't needed to ask any technical questions, but i do have some questions about gba developing in general:
<br/>
<br/>
1) roughly how many people are still coding for the gba? has the nds taken away the vast majority of the gba dev community?
<br/>
<br/>
2) i see there is a list of projects being worked on for the nds. is there a similar list anywhere for the gba?
<br/>
<br/>
3) in your opinion, is there any point in coding for the gba (at least for learning) or should one just jump into dev'ing for the nds?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At this point it's probably extremely useful to get up to speed with gba hardware first. The nds libraries are still being worked on and the toolchain is slowly evolving. Jumping into NDS development can be an extremely frustrating experience at this point.
