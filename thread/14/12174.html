    <h4>#115458 - FinalFanOfTacticsAdvance - Tue Jan 16, 2007 6:12 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone.  I've decided to clear the bad name of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance.  I know the story line sucks, the characters act like children (actually they are but thats lame), and there are limited choices for you to make.  The script writers didn't realize that a tactical game would be played by people who wore boxers instead of diapers, but the programmers did.  They created an awesome battle system, and I'm here to clean up FFTA's mess they call a story.
<br/>
<br/>
My current needs are simple.  I have read the important parts of the Sticky topic, so I know I need some C++.  I know a little bit about C++, I can read most of it but can't really write it.  I'm not really doing anything drastic as of yet, just changing some numbers around.
<br/>
<br/>
What do I do first?  I'm going to want to add some equipment / monsters / missions / etc., so I'll have to expand the rom right?  Move data, make sure the pointers repoint to the same thing right?  (This is what I've gathered from things I've read)  Okay, so is there a program for this or will I have to do it on my own?  If I do do it on my own, how will I know which ones are pointers and where they point?  A tutorial would be nice, I'm going to search right now.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also going to modify the preview's text and possibly the characters movements in the preiews, if I prove compentent enough.  This is mostly an experiment to keep me entertained, but I have enough patience to stick it through if people show me where to go.
<br/>
Thank you all.<br/>_________________<br/>Current Project:  Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Hack (Name Pending)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by FinalFanOfTacticsAdvance on Tue Jan 16, 2007 7:53 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Even if you could easily change the text, your not really changing the story, as the progression within the game would still be the same.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So far we've almost got how to edit the text, and once we've got that figured out we can locate a lot of other stuff.  I'm hoping to figure out where the maps are nubmered so I can start editing them very soon.  This is going to be a long project indeed, but I seem to have quite a few 'bolts' in my possesion.  Hehehe, he just cracked the text for me!

PS I changed the way the main guy looked but his class changed and now he can't walk.  Then I hacked over his class change and it didn't work.  hmmm...

To a guy who admits not being able to write C++ code, and in the context of the Beginners-forum, I'd say it's quite damn close to impossible to do major changes to the storyline of a game. Especially when he wants to relocate some data and code, to make room for more monsters etc.

What someone said about the main storyline progression, I'm going to edit the quests so you get them in a different order by changing what quests your required to have taken before you can start one and what location you get as a reward.  Then I'll swap out the characters in the fight, and I think they'll switch in preview.  Doesn't seem that hard really.  They still move around the same in the preview but I can work with that.  Probably change it later.<br/>_________________<br/>Current Project:  Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Hack (Name Pending)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
