Thank you oh "god of forums", just making sure I didn't have to pad the values.

<br/>
A topic name like this always gets quick attention, without being vulgar, and a quick answer....that is why it is a quick question :)
<br/>

This comment was as good as the "check you spelling" topic in the DS forum.   :P<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://ethos.oddigytitanium.com" target="_blank">Ethos' Homepage (Demos/NDS 3D Tutorial)</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And a topic name like "Quick question about tile size" results in something that's easier to search for and a useful contribution to the knowledge base in the community, so you are helping others instead of just yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
Not to pick on you specifically, Ethos, but for what's generally a good group, sometimes the etiquette in this forum really gets me down. There are lots of people who want to help others and it's unfortunate when people bite back at attempts to streamline the process.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Edited to add:</span> I happen to know that a lot of the people in here with the most experience on the GBA (certainly not just myself) are feeling more and more reluctant to respond at all to queries because of the attitudes people are likely to cop as of late. Graga gave you a fair and constructive criticism; if you want to dispute it that's okay, but is the temperment really necessary?
