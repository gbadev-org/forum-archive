Look, How possible (read, legal)is to marketing your own homebrew games??
<br/>
<br/>
I know I have to get a license from Nintendo and everything. Does Nintendo charges you a fee to obtain a license??
<br/>
<br/>
But for example...you have your compos...you sold all that games, right?? How difficult is to do that???
<br/>
<br/>
Look, here in Mexico there's any conpany marketing games from any kind...but for some reason the Goberment wants to support this area. meybe I can make my move there!! :D
<br/>
<br/>
my school is another story, whenever I can make a game for a school project I do it. My teachers are very amazed with the result, because making games is very uncommon here (picture its face when I show them the games running on the GBA!!!), so, maybe I can get some support from school, but I want to know HOW FAR can I go before this can be considered illegal...
<br/>
<br/>
I think I can obtain a residence project with this, and maybe even my thesis :P:P:P (my teachers say that)
<br/>
<br/>
ps...how much does it cost the official compiler and library for the Nintendo DS???
<br/>
<br/>
ps2...Im finishing my tutorial :D:D in spanish, for those who can't speak english...maybe my crew grow up with this :D...as soon as i finish I will upload it to the net<br/>_________________<br/>All human wisdom is summed up in these two words, - 'Wait and hope"

On the GBA, it's thought to be almost perfectly legal given the result of <span style="font-style: italic">Sega v. Accolade</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Lexmark v. Static Control</span>, although you might want to have a lawyer handy should Nintendo harass you in court.

If you want to go the "Official Nintendo Seal" route, you don't work directly with Nintendo. Instead, you pitch your work to all the licensed publishers hoping that one of them takes your game and gives you a royalty.

If you want to go the unlicensed route like Color Dreams did back in the NES days with its "Wisdom Tree" line, you may have to ask SimonB through a private message how the compo carts were replicated.

For a non-commercial school project you can probably go all the way, as Nintendo isn't likely to want the bad press of attacking a school project.

Ask a licensed publisher. At this point, you'll definitely want to have a finished GBA title or two under your belt before you branch out to the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
