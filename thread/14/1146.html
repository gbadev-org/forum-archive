    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well if you make a game good enough and they haven't got their games catalogue already full you might make a chance.

But thing is, don;t just send a demo rom to them without saying that it needs a header modification to run on hardware, otherwise you're doing something illigal.
<br/>
<br/>
But you don't need a european publisher, I'm from The Netherlands (Holland) and I vaguely know a guy (Collin van Ginkel, who co-made Toki Tori on GBC) and he got his game published by the japanese publisher Capcom. (and in every review of that game they were lyrical of that game so Capcom definatly had a reason to publish it, if it werent for the GBA getting rid ofd all the GBC titles we might have actually seen it in this country :)).<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
