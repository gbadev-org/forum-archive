    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am basically new to the scene.  Got to the point where I can make a simple non-scrolling game so huzzah!
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I use hamlib + vham for my gba development.  I came across MapEd and really love the interface and want to use it for my map editing.
<br/>
<br/>
My problem is that I have no idea how to integrate the exported header files into my projects (not talking about the #include'ing, but the actual function calls to make the maps display and work and such).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any experience in getting maped generated maps up and running in HAM?  I know how to do it with gfx2gba, just no idea where to even start for maped's version.
<br/>
<br/>
ANY help would be appreciated as I'm pretty stuck.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
