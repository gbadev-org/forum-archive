    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I have simple pong program in mode 4 that works fine on emulators, but on hardware my ball 8x8 sprite doesn't show up.  all of my graphics are declaired const  and the ball is in the middle of my sprite array.  the sprite uses tile 528.

i am using an EFA linker 256 cart and have tested it on the gba and ds both with and without using the loader.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any ideas why this might happen, I am stumped.   for now i just used a diffrent graphic but would like to get it working as intended.  Any help/advice would make this noobie very happy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have tried in no$gba and VBA and both worked fine.  The VBA tools have allowed me to confirm that things should be working as i intended them to.
<br/>
I would post my code online, but i cant ftp into my school webspace because im not enrolled in summer classes.
<br/>
<br/>
is there a chance there could be something wrong with my cart?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The const arrays for all of my graphics for some reason was what actually the problem...could anyone tell me why though?  I thought you had more memory to work with if you used const??
<br/>
<br/>
if anyone could explain this one to me that would be awesome.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
