    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If your program's main loop is set up to cycle once every VBlank (as it should be), the main loop will cycle approximately every 1/60th of a second.
<br/>
<br/>
So if you use a variable to count the number of times your main loop has cycled, you can tell how much time has transpired. 60 cycles = 1 second, and 600 cycles = 10 seconds.
