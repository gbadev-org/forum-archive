I'm working on a tileset for an RPG, and before I go ahead and make a billion tiles (and make an <span style="color: red">@$$</span> out of myself) I'd like to know if there's a maximum number there can be in a tileset, just so I know if I have to cut any out if need be.  My tiles are 8x8 if that helps. Thanks in advance, and I hope I dont already have too many..<br/>_________________<br/>"Two wolves are fighting.
