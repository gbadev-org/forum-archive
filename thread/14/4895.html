<br/>
I really would apriciate if some one tells me wich one is the BEST Game Boy Advance Compiler.
<br/>
Oh and if this is needed : I'm using Dragon BASIC.
<br/>
Thanks ^_^

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would say VisualHAM man! I liked it, it was real easy to learn! If you dont plan on selling your game, that lil HAM intro doesnt make a difference, and if you do plan on selling the game, buy it and you wont have that problem! I dont use Dragon BASIC, I never have so i can't tell you what to use, but I am just replying and letting you know that you can get rid of the Ham logo by buying the IDE</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I got Dragon BASIC,Devkit Advance,DevkitARM,DevkitHAM and some other crap I got here on my Hard Drive XD
<br/>
But anyways,I haven't Intsalled DevkitHAM yet,Should I use this one?
<br/>
Or is there another compiler that doesnt put the ham logo n your games?

Well, that all depends on your perspective of what you think would be the Best Compiler, which we don't know what you want with it. Do you want pre-made libraries so you don't have to mess with the memory-mapped registers, you want to write code in Basic/C/C++, etc. etc. etc.?

From what I understand of what you said, you seem set on using something related to HAM (like VisualHAM, or DevKitHAM, whatever). I've never used those, so I can't answer that.
<br/>
We're just giving you options, nothing more.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to program an Adventure Game (A type of Kirby or DragonBall Advance Adventure Game) On Dragon BASIC and then compile it and play it on my Emulator to test it out.
<br/>
Thats what I really want to do,Create a game that my friends could have fun and enjoy playing with.
<br/>
That's All I want to do,But if one day on the future it gets to be a type of game that people would describe as "awesome" then there I'll decide of Selling it or not.
<br/>
But since its about of not selling it for now,Then I think I Will use HAM.
<br/>
I have devkitARM on my computer,I have a Visual Studio 6.0 CD with Visual C++ in it,I've gathered a few ammount of tools to get started but just dont know with wich tool to start.
<br/>
But I think I'll start with devkitHAM and Dragon Basic,If not i have devkitARM and Visual C++.
<br/>
But as for now,Devkit HAM Is the one I should really use for now? A friend of mine says it is pretty good,But not that HAM logo at the boot of your GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm pretty sure you can use the VisualHAM IDE without using the HAMLib library.
<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever programmed a game on any other platform, such as on the PC using the Allegro library? If not, I'd suggest starting on the PC first. And before you program an adventure game, try cloning a non-adventure game such as Pong or Tetris or Pac-Man to get you acquainted with the basics of game programming before you go into more ambitious projects.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

A Gameboy Advance compiler is any compiler that targets the ARM7TDMI chip. This alone is insufficient to make GBA games, because there are specific details of the GBA's hardware and memory layout that compiler needs in order to properly assemble the compiled code into something that is executable on the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Because of this, people have put together Dev Kits that contain the necessary specs and code to make the compiler generate GBA programs. Devkit Advance, Devkit ARM, and HAM all use GCC - the free GNU C compiler - as their underlying compiler, so as far as they go you are getting a similar compiler in each case. As far as which is best, to my knowledge DevkitARM and HAM are the only ones still being maintained/updated.

<br/>
That info has been useful to me,And also,I Program on Visual Basic,Right now I'm trying to make a little RPG Game on it (I know VB is not the one for these stuff,But Direct 3D can be useful,Although VB is not that good on these kind of stuff).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're coding in any dialect of BASIC right now, you're going to want to learn C first, and it's easiest to learn C with a compiler that produces native executables.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well Y'See,I kinda get a bit lazy of Installing Visual C++....I get the lazyness of getting a bit scared of getting my computer get messed up. It usually gets messed up easy.
<br/>
I installed Dragon Basic IDE and After Rebooting the system it started to Recover Registries from the day before,So this was caused by Dragon Basic,So the registry got back to normal and everything having to do with Dragon Basic got deleted.
<br/>
So I'll try to install Dragon Basic again and Visual C++ and see what happens. But before I must back up my registry in case It really messes up. And Tepples,What the heck is MinGW? o_O I really got no idea of what that is (Logically to me a Programming Language).
<br/>
Really,Never heard of MinGW.
<br/>
Thanks.
