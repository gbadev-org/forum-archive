    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, so I'm pretty much completely new to GBA development (hence, why I'm posting here ;))...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to get a build environment set up at home. I don't want to use HAM because I want to do everything from scratch (this is more a learning project than just getting stuff out the door).
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using Windows XP and either Visual Studio .NET or Notepad++ as my editor (haven't completely decided which one to go with yet). I have Cygwin installed as well.
<br/>
<br/>
My first question is: Will Cygwin's native gcc and g++ compile for the GBA? I don't know too much about the ARM7 specs, so is the instruction set the same as Intel (I'm assuming prolly not but I just want to make sure..)? If not, are there pre-built Cygwin binaries out there that I can use for ARM instead of having to build the gnu ARM version?
<br/>
<br/>
I also want to confirm that I'm understanding this correctly:
<br/>
<br/>
To build a valid .gba file I must: gcc (or g++) all source files into .o's, link 'em all with ld into an .elf and then use objcopy to create the .gba file. Right? Wrong? Way off?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
