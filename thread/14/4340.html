    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, this is my first time posting on the boards. I have been programming for the GBA using ARM for a total of two full days. I am quite familiar with the ARM language, and have gone through the gbaguy's ARM Tutorial for the most part. I am at the point though were I feel the tutorial is too basic, and I feel I can figure out most of the stuff myself. What I need however is a suggestion for a good tutorial or FAQ that goes into details about the GBA and GBA Game Dev. For example, if I wanted to display a full screen animation using various frames... which mode is best (mode 4 obviously), what is the best method of throwing it on the screen, which way of going about it is the most efficient, etc. etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank You
<br/>

edit: oh, I don't have a problem with C tutorials since I can convert no problem.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://people.umass.edu/ozahid" target="_blank">http://people.umass.edu/ozahid</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The FAQ has links to GBA documentation.  I suggest experimenting with different techniques, and deferring optimization until you've found the methods you like and you encounter speed problems.
<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of guys here who love to help with optimization problems, so when you get some code that isn't giving the performance you need then feel free to ask around. ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
