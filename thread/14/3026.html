    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm working with a simple 3 colored sprite in mode 3.  The three colors are green, black, and a hot pink I want to be transparent. I use the program pcx2gba to convert the picture into palette data and sprite data.  However, after changing the first entry in the palette to the hot pink and  recompiling, the black area of the sprite is still transparent.
<br/>
<br/>
If it helps, I am editting the palette by hand, so I don't think its an error in the code, just in my method.  Could anyone give me any suggestions?  THis has been bothering me for a while now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The color for transparency must always be index 0 in the palette. (And as it will be transparent it doesn't matter whether it is bright purple or white or whatever color.)
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>_________________<br/>If everything fails, read the manual: If even that fails, post on forum!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
