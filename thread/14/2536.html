    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm sorry for asking that, I know that this is not the place, but I've been looking around the forum and haven't found an appropiate place yet. Well, my problem is that when I try to download anything from this web page, an error message appears, the one that asks you to download the stuff being connected directly to gbadev.org, but I'm already in.
