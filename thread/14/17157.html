    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm looking into making a side scroller for the gba, and I have a few questions.
<br/>
<br/>
Are C / C++ based gba roms able to run at full speed on the actual hardware, or should I stick with asm?
<br/>
Furthermore, which of the 3 languages works best as a developer, and which compiler is reccomended?
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the data (tiles, maps and music), which utilities are suggested for these? There are a lot of tools on this site, and it's hard to tell which ones work best.

Thank you for your time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For most of the development, C or C++.  Whichever you are more familiar or comfortable with.   
<br/>
<br/>
It's possible that you might eventually want to dip in to assembly for a critical section, but you can do most development without ever having to touch it.

GCC.  Get devkitArm and libgba from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">DevkitPro</a> and it will have the full toolchain of everything you need.

DevkitArm comes with Grit, which is a graphics utility that you'll want to use (converts images to formats usable by gba, etc).  Cearn's <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/projects/usenti/" target="_blank">Usenti</a> is highly recommended for graphics editing.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure that there is a standard recommendation for tiles/maps/music.  I used Usenti for laying out tile sets, and <a class="postlink" href="http://tilemap.co.uk/mappy.php" target="_blank">Mappy</a> for map design. 
<br/>
I haven't looked recently at libgba to see what audio libraries/etc are available, but a few years ago I used Kusma's <a class="postlink" href="http://github.com/kusma/pimpmobile" target="_blank">Pimpmobile</a> for playing audio and was quite happy with it.  For editing audio files, I used modPlug.
<br/>
<br/>
It's likely that there's better tools than what I used, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's MaxMod also for GBA. You can download it with devKitPro package.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
