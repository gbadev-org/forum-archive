But the real problem is that the MS-DOS box doesn't stay on the screen long enough for me to see my errors!!!!!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">tepples is right about the batch file.
<br/>
<br/>
you can also run from the command line. go to start-&gt;run and type cmd.
<br/>
then you need to set the path for devkitadv. then go to the dir with your project then you can should be able to compile and it will keep the info on screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I do it this way over the batch file, i find it easier to debug because all you have to do is hit the up arrow and enter to run the same command after making changes to your code.

... there's actually a shortcut that does this already included.
<br/>
Just edit cmd-rc.bat to have the correct path to the devkit. The shortcut is called DevKit-Advance-R5-Beta-3.lnk and launches a persistent cmd window with the path set up automatically. Depending on your windows installation you may also have to correct the path to cmd.exe in the shortcut's properties.<br/>_________________<br/>"Only two things are infinite: the universe, and human stupidity.
