    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello!
<br/>
<br/>
I am following <a class="postlink" href="http://www.loirak.com/gameboy/gbatutor.php" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>. I tried to set up my toolchan, trying both <a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitadv/files/Windows/Release%204/" target="_blank">devkitadv release 4</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitadv/files/Windows/Release%205%20%28Beta%203%29/" target="_blank">devkitadv release 5 beta 3</a>, and following the steps in the tutorial. As in the tutorial, I use gcc and objcopy. Everything works as expected, until I run the .gba file using Visual Boy Advance. I get a white screen instead of a blue screen with 'HI'. Since I don't see any error messages during compilation or execution, so I don't really know what's going wrong...
<br/>
<br/>
Any help or tips would be greatly appreciated! :)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using VBA v1.8.0-beta-3 and windows 8, if that's of any help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yep! It took some time and delving in the makefiles, but I got it working with devkitpro. I made a sublime text build system so I can build roms from my text editor :)

Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
