    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi.  I was looking through the examples that came with DevKit and I wanted to try and make my own Hello World, but I've hit a snag.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how to print text to both screens.  I can print it to the top screen or to the bottom but not both.
<br/>
<br/>
So I was wondering if some kind soul out there could post a well documented project (preferably in Programmers Notpad that comes with DevKit) that has Hello World printed on the top screen and hellow world printed on the bottom.  Nothing else fancy to clog the code... just "Hello World"
<br/>
<br/>
Or if you know of a good one already on the net, please post the link.  :-)

There is only one console in libnds and it is on only one screen. If you want the console to span both screens, you must code your own text output routines. Lucky for you, it is not that hard.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
