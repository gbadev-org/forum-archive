    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am using HAM and I am having trouble with deleting a background and displaying a new one. It says "Out of bounds, something is wrong with your deallocation, make sure allocation was correct". I know I probably sound like an idiot, I am a n00b even to code. Please help, thank you in advance!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
