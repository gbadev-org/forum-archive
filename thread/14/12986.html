    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm new to GBA programming and this forum, but I do have some experience in game design. I was looking through some articles and found a program called DragonBasic, and since I'm not a pro in C, I thought that would be a good program to start with. There's only one problem, I can't find DragonBasic anywhere. All of their websites are not available anymore, and I feel bad because I thought it would be a good program. If anyone know where I might still be able to find this program, please reply.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You're welcome.  You actually got me interested in the whole thing anyway, since I too have little programming experience.  I was able to create a few working binaries based off the "Hello, World!" tutorial, but for some reason my Supercard refuses to play them.  They always freeze right after opening.  My Flash2Advance Ultra will play the files, but the audio does not come out (even though it works in VBA perfectly).  It's probably a mistake on my part, but it's still annoying.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  oddly enough, even the sample tutorials don't work correctly on my F2AU cart, always mute for everything except for the "coin.wav" sample provided by tutorial 8.  Tutorial 7 works, but that's noise-generating, not wav-playing</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
