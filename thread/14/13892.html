    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you can use visual studio only for editing your .cpp file.
<br/>
<br/>
for compiling .cpp into .gba you need the devkitpro available at drunkencoders page.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, In addition to devkitpro.  Take note that you would benefit from using makefiles in the examples when you start out. 
<br/>
<br/>
That is, unless you have much MAKE experience.  Anyhow, this is also what establishes your target binary (.gba file), which I think is what you are getting at (with your question).  
<br/>
<br/>
If not, you are asking how to compile cpp files, which is much more general.  In your case, get devkitpro to see some examples, and type <span style="font-weight: bold">make</span> in the root/target directory of the source tree to make a gba file.  You understand that on a PC platform, one also does not save a cpp file as a exe/binary etc. The compiler performs this task by parsing and translating to architecture specific op code.  If none of this makes sense, read up on make and cpp and ask away! :)
<br/>
<br/>
I am guessing as to your questions meaning, sorry I don't understand what you are asking, really.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
