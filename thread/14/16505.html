    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd advise you to split your goals into 2: Learn C++ then learn coding for the DS.  It'll be a lot easier to learn to code on a regular platform with regular debugging tools and then apply that knowledge to coding for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I've got years of experience coding and yet taking up coding for the DS I felt like a fish out of water at the start.  I can't imagine how hard it would be for someone who isn't a competent coder to take up doing stuff for the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>It's not an illusion, it just looks like one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well I chose home economics instead of computer siences...

<br/>
But sounding fun and being fun to you are two separate things. If you do enjoy it, then that's good.
<br/>
<br/>
It is better to learn one step at a time. There are plenty of c/c++ tutorials online, especially for beginners who have never done any programming before. Google is your friend. There is much trial and error when dealing with programming in general, because while the code you write may look like it works, something somewhere may have altered a single variable that affects the entire thing. Patience is a virtue, and programming requires a lot of patience. Always start with something small, and build upon it.
<br/>
<br/>
Once you've gotten a good grasp at the language, then you can start with GBA/DS programming (but always start with something small).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'd recommend learning Java, and programming with it until you are comfortable with object oriented concepts.  After that you can learn C++; the theory is all the same.  It is very easy to shoot yourself in the foot with C++.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A teacher can only help you to learn; you still have to do the learning. Just take any beginners C/C++ book and learn <span style="font-weight: bold">program flow</span> and eventually <span style="font-weight: bold">algorithms</span>, it is a pre-requisite to even thinking about doing games.
<br/>
<br/>
Once you've learned those then you can start thinking about simple games, but get the basics done first otherwise you will get nowhere, fast ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
