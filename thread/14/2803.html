<br/>
<br/>
I build an engine controller based on an 'HC11.  I designd our first version in '91, and it's still not laptop programmable, so we are losing whatever market share we had.  For our next version, I need to write a Windows app that lets users configure the system from their pc.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there an off the shelf application that will do this, or do I need to reinvent the wheel?  I guess I'll have a better idea after I learn C++.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a Mac guy, but I picked up a Dell laptop a few months ago.  Sheesh, I got it all virused up in a week, and had to take it back and get it erased.
<br/>
<br/>
I've had the Sam's "Teach Yourself C++ in 24 Hours" sitting in my bookcase for a couple years.  I finally cracked it last night and popped in the CD.
<br/>
<br/>
The "hello world" program in the first lesson just flashes on the screen.  I googled on "hello world disappears" and found this:

<br/>
<br/>
That worked for me.  Wonder why they didn't put that in the lesson?
<br/>
<br/>
I was lurking here the other night, and saw someone else had the same problem on the GBA.  That's what gave me the clue to start googling.
<br/>
<br/>
The main reson I'm here is to learn how to write a data collection program and make an A/D system, like educatingmario.com.
<br/>
<br/>
It looks like TurboXS is using it:

Because it's MS-Windows specific, and has nothing to do with C++ the language.  What you should really be doing is running your app from the command line, since you wrote a command-line app.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
