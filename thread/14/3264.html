    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I was wondering if you could use Game Maker to make games for the GBA.  If there is a way, please informe me and tell me how, i.e. what software to use for it. If you don't know what Game Maker is, heres the Address: <a href="http://www.gamemaker.nl/" target="_blank">http://www.gamemaker.nl/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just to clarify why: Gamemaker uses I believe DirectX and the GBA has no support for DirectX. The way you access memory on the GBA is entirely different compared to how you would access it on the computer. They both have different processors and various other specifics that you need to figure out.
<br/>
<br/>
The tutorials on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.thepernproject.com/" target="_blank">http://www.thepernproject.com/</a> are really easy and I would suggest that you try them if you know a lot of C/P++. To make any really good game you eventually will need to know C or C++ (C++ is just an extension of C which includes object oriented programming)
<br/>
<br/>
The closest thing to Gamemaker on the GBA is either 
<br/>
Dragon Basic  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.jm-basic.com/dragon/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.jm-basic.com/dragon/index.php</a>
<br/>
or HAM <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ngine.de/ham.html" target="_blank">http://www.ngine.de/ham.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't tried either but I know they are ment to be easier than coding with C/C++. Good luck, if you have any more questions please check some FAQs and research using the search function on the forums. If you don't find your answer post your question.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this is a clear enough answer as to why you can't use Gamemaker.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all, thank you, I didn't actually think it would work but hey it was worth a try. Umm I'm not a programmer yet, in fact I'm still in high school. But game design and programming (all surrounding professions) are what I am looking into. Is there something, preforably not just text, that could give me a good start on C/C++ programming. I can't take the courses for another two years.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Never stopped me - or many others on this forum, I imagine - from being a programmer.

Try <a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com?q=c+tutorial" target="_blank">googling c tutorial</a> and seeing what's out there. The best way to learn is by doing, so find tutorials that walk you through the process with examples, and code those examples yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
But I will warn you that GBA programming can be daunting even for experienced C/C++ programmers. Don't expect to be programming GBA games overnight.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually! It is sort-a possible, a user by the name of Cooleo at G-Java was wokring on a GM6 2 GBA converter, but develpment stopped because some jerk stole his GBA cart (which he also used for DS, so GM6 2 DS is stopped too).

You can look at his topic at G-Java <a class="postlink" href="http://www.g-java.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=1412" target="_blank">here</a>.
