<br/>
is very easy to use!! the quality of the sound os fair good
<br/>
<br/>
my only complain is about the output sound...is just to low! (the volume)..I own a GameBoyAdvance (first version, dot ds or sp or micro) so maybe the quality of the sound is better on newer systems, or has to do something with the format (the song is a .gsm file)???
<br/>
<br/>
ah...for the maker..you should change the button for lock/unlock buttons :P...the select button keeps pressing when the GBA is in my pocket :P
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ps..do you know how many time my batteries will last??? (im using two AA duracell ultra digital batteries)<br/>_________________<br/>All human wisdom is summed up in these two words, - 'Wait and hope"

Thank you. My goal was to made it simple enough that over 80 percent of people who post to Pocket Heaven in a given day could figure it out, yet I still get repeated requests for direct support for the patented MP3 format in the conversion tool.

<br/>
On par with a 32 kbps MP3, right?

<br/>
The volume is the maximum that the GBA can output without distorting. Try applying a limiter (volume compression) to the .wav files, using Audacity or another audio editor, before converting them. If you're willing to accept some distortion, press the up button to activate boost mode.

<br/>
I own an original GBA, a Game Boy Player, and a Nintendo DS. The GBA and the Nintendo DS play music at roughly the same volume. (The Game Boy Player, obviously, is louder.)

<br/>
Rotate the GBA by 180 degrees so that the select button is facing the other way. Or don't wear such tight clothing; now might be the time to start wearing a long shirt like the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/donate/progress/1.html" target="_blank">handsome fellow on the left</a> or like <a class="postlink" href="http://templeimages.free.fr/images/images6/Alvin-et-les-Chipmunks-0.jpg" target="_blank">these guys</a>. PM me if you want to know where to buy one.

Battery life depends primarily on your flash cart make and model. If you're planning on using GSM Player for GBA to replace an actual MP3 player, I'd suggest using a GBA SP or a Nintendo DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
