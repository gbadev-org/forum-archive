    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, there's 4 fixed formats :
<br/>
-256x256
<br/>
-256x512
<br/>
-512x256
<br/>
-512x512
<br/>
<br/>
When being of size superior to 256, it need to be stored in a different map, so for a 512x512 you woudl have :
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">

You're limited to 256 tiles for rot/scale backgrounds or 1024 for "text mode" backgrounds. If you're using text mode backgrounds, it's best to use 16-color tiles, like most commercial games do; this way, you can fit about 1800 tiles to split among your backgrounds.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

For text backgrounds, each tile entry is 16 bits.  The lower 10 bits of that represents the tile number; hence, 1024 addressable tiles per background.  A tile number greater than 1023 won't fit.

<br/>
In a manner of speaking, yes.  Since you can only use 1024 tiles per background, if you want to use more than 1024 total tiles, you'll have to specify a different Character Base Block for each background.
<br/>
<br/>
You may not have to rearrange the way you have the tiles placed in VRAM, but you'll have to change the tile numbers to represent the correct offset from the new Base Blocks you set.
<br/>
<br/>
If, by chance, you want to use more than 1024 tiles in a single background, your only option is to dynamically move tiles into VRAM as needed.  Hopefully that's not the case, cause it sounds like a bit of a headache.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, it's possible to use more than 1024 tiles in a background. Set a vcount interrupt to change the character base block. Lots of games did this on the NES, which had only 256 tiles in a pattern table (eqv of GBA's character base block).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i already know that about the bits and stuff, what i'm saying is that i think pcx2sprites (to to split the tiles into 8x8 ones, you know) doesn't make the values the right way for me to use more than 256 different tiles.  i'm getting stuff like 0xff, but i think i should be getting something like 0x00ff

im still a |23147iv3 //00|3, so i'm not sure.<br/>_________________<br/>"Two wolves are fighting.
