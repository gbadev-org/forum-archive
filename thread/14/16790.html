    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys,
<br/>
<br/>
I have a program that generates gba game files. I have developed this program on Windows XP ServicePack 2 and it works very fine with this operating system. But when I install higher operating systems (such as Windows XP SP3 or Windows Vista) to my computer, the output gba file has some problems.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that I want to move a background image but it moves very SLOWLY when I try this program on Vista or XP SP3.
<br/>
<br/>
This is a sample gba file that is generated by the program on Vista operating system: <a class="postlink" href="http://rapidshare.com/files/260797193/GameRevolution.gba" target="_blank">http://rapidshare.com/files/260797193/GameRevolution.gba</a>
<br/>
This gba file moves very SLOWLY but normally it shouldn't.
<br/>
<br/>
Why my output gba file moves very slowly although I didn't change even one line of code in the program? Do u have any idea?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, the problem is that Visual Boy Advance emulator does not get along well with Vista operating system. I used BatGBA emulator and the output gba file runs faster now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">windows changed some stuff causing your program to function differently?
<br/>
<br/>
also, I doubt anybody can see the problem with just one gba file. I suggest you look at the generated source files and see what is different. then look at the part of the program that generated that piece of code and see what kind of windows stuff you're using. then try to work around it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You need to clarify.  Does the same GBA file run at different speeds on the different operating systems, or is it just the same code compiled under different operating systems?  In other words, is it the emulator that's causing the problem or is it the compiler?  Posting the code you're using might help.

<br/>
Are you sure you've got the same version of the devkit on both computers?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Some time ago, when I'd use No$GBA, I ended up having some major slowdown, and the audio was crackly. It wasn't happening with other emulators, so I went through different settings to fix the problem, and the only one that seemed to work was disabling audio on the emulator entirely. Not happy with having no audio made me dig deeper into my computer, particularly with Windows settings. I ended up finding out that my on-board audio somehow got turned when I shouldn't have been, since I had an SBLive Value card plugged in. I turned off the on-board audio, and No$GBA didn't have the problem anymore.

<br/>
My experience would suggest that you check if you have any conflicting components in your system , both hardware and software.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
