    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, guys I did look first, but I confused.
<br/>
Can anyone recommend a good , free, simple compiler that is easy to use and not too complicated to set up. I did check out MinGW but i don't get it. 
<br/>
Maybe I'm just not patient enough to read through what I'm supposed to do.
<br/>
I just want something that is stupidly easy to download and setup, so that I can learn some programming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">MinGW really is good, it's not that hard to set up, and it'll teach you how to use a compiler from the command line which is useful.
<br/>
<br/>
But if you don't have the time to set it up, you could try Dev C++ which is preconfigured with a GUI.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you're open to learning languages other than C and C++, visit <a href="http://www.drscheme.org" target="_blank">www.drscheme.org</a> which is the home of an extremely easy-to-use Scheme implementation.  Scheme is a great language for beginners because it has so few elements to it, and yet you won't outgrow it until you are a far greater programmer than I am.  It's my favorite language.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I will have a look at Scheme. Can I eventually use Scheme to program for the gba or would I have to switch to C or C++.
<br/>
<br/>
This was my main reason for picking C to start with. Maybe my aspirations are too high.
<br/>
<br/>
I've downloaded Miracle C to try as a compiler. It looks real easy to use, but I will have to switch if I ever decide to go pro.
<br/>
I will have a look at DevC++ as well.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There does exist the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/" target="_blank">CHICKEN compiler</a> for the Scheme language, which has an ARM back-end, but because none of us have tried it, none of us can help you get it to output GBA binaries.
<br/>
<br/>
Dev-C++ is a graphical interface that wraps around GCC. Both MinGW and devkitARM are distributions of GCC. If you're just starting out with C, try it!<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Thanks! I noticed that in the description when I looked at it last night, so I think I might give it a try. I have a Graphics background, so (good or bad) I tend to lean towards the GUI interface. 
<br/>
<br/>
I tried Miracle C but am not having much success. However, to be fair, I tend to work on the computer at night, after work, during the week, and really don't have enough time to fool with stuff then. Hopefully I will have more time on the weekend.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unfortunately, the combination of Chicken's very large generated code and it's substantial runtime library makes it unsuitable for GBA development.
<br/>
<br/>
I looked around a lot for a compact, fast implementation, but I eventually decided I'd have to implement it myself.
<br/>
<br/>
And to repeat my eternal mantra: get the C Primer Plus.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the great advice guys! I just quickly tried Dev-C++ with a simple hello program and finally some success!! I feel like I've gotten over the first hurdle. Now a can start to learn some programming and test my result as I go.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure I will have a plethera of questions in the very near future!
<br/>
<br/>
At least I have a starting point to work from now!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Again! - This is a great forum!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
