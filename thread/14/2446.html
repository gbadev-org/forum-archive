<br/>
Do you have any programming experience?
<br/>
If not, don't worry about games first, learn the language. C or C++ would be the easiset out all that you listed. (ASM is too abstract for me, I will learn it some day) 
<br/>
<br/>
The words shouldn't be too hard but the chinese alphabet is huge, you may need to find a way to compress it as such...

<br/>
Programs. You need a graphics program, Paint shop pro(not free), paint(free) gimp(free) etc.
<br/>
A coding environment such as Microsoft visual studio(not free) or Dev Cpp by Bloodshed(free). and the devkitadv compliar.
<br/>
<br/>
There are full development suites avaiable such as HAM, Dragon Basic and Catapult.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, you are not asking too much but the question has been asked many times and these questions are covered in the FAQ at the top of the beginners forum.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh the irony... C is an abstraction of assembly language!  If you have a PC and DOS or Windows, use debug.com and a tutorial to experiment.  You'll start to notice that the CPU is more like a machine than anything, and it takes all the mystery out of things.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">debug.com is not a web site. Before there was a World Wide Web and before there was Microsoft Windows, '.com' was the extension used for some old "tiny model" DOS programs less than about 32 KB in size. To start Debug, pull up a command prompt, type <span style="font-weight: bold">debug</span>, and press Enter. Then follow the instructions in a Debug tutorial such as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.datainstitute.com/debug1.htm" target="_blank">this</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
