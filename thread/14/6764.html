    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all, 
<br/>
<br/>
I made an attempt a while ago to start gba programming but I didn't make much progress and work/life kinda pulled me away for a while.  Now I have some free time and I'd like to give it another go.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, while I know how to program, I have no experience whatsoever setting up libraries, compilers, etc.  Basically all my programming experience has been in college on machines set up for us, and .NET stuff.  Can someone step me through exactly how I can start programming GBA games w/VS.NET?  
<br/>
<br/>
To put it another way, I've downloaded devkitARM, but I have no idea what the hell to do with it :)  Can anyone help?  None of the tutorials/posts I've read have gotten me off the ground.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Apparently someone never used libraries other than those installed by the installer that came with the IDE that came with the compiler. Even I was once in that boat.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, that's pretty much it.  I understand how libraries WORK and what they're for, but all I see is posts/tuts telling me to get gbalib or whatever and I have no idea what its for.
<br/>
<br/>
I did get the compiler working, but I haven't had any luck actually getting a unix style makefile to run in visual studio, so i'm stuck recompiling everything every time with a .bat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
