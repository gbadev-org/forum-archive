    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">GBA Development with Eclipse IDE HOWTO</span></span> - <span style="color: red">Last Update: 18/07/2006</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, to get a nice GBA development environment only using free tools we'll need to setup a few things manually. 
<br/>
<br/>
So I prepared this small how-to to help beginners like I was, to get programming the GBA more fast without spending hours (like I did) trying to figure out what to do. 
<br/>
<br/>
The tools chosen here were: <span style="font-weight: bold">Eclipse Development IDE, DevkitARM as gcc toolchain, MSYS to provide us a full POSIX environment with rm and make commands, Visual Boy Advance SDL as GBA emulator and ARM targeted GDB as debug tool</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
So let's start, follow these steps carefully:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">1)</span> First, go to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_blank">www.eclipse.org</a> and download latest stable version (in the moment of writing this tutorial, the version was 3.01)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">2)</span> Now we need a Eclipse plugin to be able to work with C/C++ on it. The plugin name is CDT and can be obtained here: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt" target="_blank">www.eclipse.org/cdt</a>. check the downloads page and get the update URL there, open Eclipse, go to <span style="font-weight: bold">Help-&gt;Software Updates-&gt;Find and Install</span> and in the next screen, choose '<span style="font-style: italic">Search for new features to install</span>'. click '<span style="font-style: italic">New Remote site...</span>" and put the CDT Update URL you've got on CDT download site. Check the modules to install and click next until it download and install automatically. After CDT is installed, lets open the C/C++ perspective in Eclipse. This way, Eclipse will be C/C++ friendly providing us with all options we need like debug, build, make targets, ...Go to <span style="font-weight: bold">Window-&gt;Open Perspective-&gt;Other...</span> and find C/C++ in the list. Select it and click OK. If you did correctly, the IDE windows will change position and you'll be able to see C/C++ Projects tab to your left side.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">3)</span> We need a compiler. Not just an ordinary GCC, but one targeted to ARM plataform. There is some cool distributions around but I think <span style="font-weight: bold">DevKitARM </span>is the best since it's being regularly updated. Go to the DevKitARM site on Sourceforge to grab the latest one. 
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.sf.net/projects/devkitpro" target="_blank">http://www.sf.net/projects/devkitpro</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Unzip it to a directory (i use c:\devkitarm) and put its <span style="font-weight: bold">c:\devkitarm\bin</span> path to the <span style="font-weight: bold">PATH </span>variable. The compiler executable is <span style="font-style: italic">arm-elf-gcc.exe</span> <span style="color: red">[note] devkitARM r19+ is arm-eabi-gcc.exe</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">4)</span> Now that we did a basic setup of the environment, let's download the emulator.  We chose <span style="font-weight: bold">Visual Boy Advance</span> because it has nice debug features which will greatly help us later. Go to Visual Boy Advance site on Sourceforge (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.sf.net/projects/vba" target="_blank">www.sf.net/projects/vba</a>) and download the VBA 1.7 SDL version. <span style="font-weight: bold">ATTENTION! DO NOT DOWNLOAD NEWER VERSIONS THAN 1.7</span>, they're all <span style="font-weight: bold">BROKEN </span>and will not debug correctly. For emulation purposes, they are ok, though. devkitPro.org also provides a suitable windows build of VBA SDL 1.7.1 at <a href="http://www.devkitpro.org/downloads.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.devkitpro.org/downloads.shtml</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">5)</span> Unzip the emulator somewhere on your hard disk (i did it in c:\vba, just change for the folder you like). Now open Eclipse and let's set it as <span style="font-style: italic">External Tool</span> we'll be using to test our ROMs. Open <span style="font-weight: bold">Run-&gt;External Tools-&gt;External Tools...</span> In the left list box click on '<span style="font-style: italic">Program</span>' and on the '<span style="font-style: italic">New</span>' button at the list bottom. In the Main tab, go to the <span style="font-style: italic">Name</span> input box at top of the screen and write "Visual Boy Advance Run". Now go to the <span style="font-style: italic">Location</span> option, browse to the folder you unzipped VBA and choose the VBA executable. On <span style="font-style: italic">Arguments </span> option, put '${project_loc}\${project_name}.gba' (without the quotes). This way we are telling VBA to start the GBA ROM we generated informing it using Eclipse internal variables ${project_loc} (project location) and ${project_name} (project name). Switch to Common tab and unmark '<span style="font-style: italic">Launch in background</span>' checkbox. Next, go to <span style="font-weight: bold">Run-&gt;External Tools-&gt;Organize Favorites...</span> Click <span style="font-style: italic">Add..</span> and select the program you just added. Now it will appear on the Eclipse toolbar, under the green play icon with a red lock.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">6)</span> We need a POSIX environment to be able to clean our compiled objects (delete .o files with rm command) and to make our makefile. We are luck since there is a nice project called <span style="font-weight: bold">MSYS</span> which provides a full POSIX environment for <span style="font-weight: bold">WIN32</span>. It can be obtained at
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.10.exe?download" target="_blank">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.10.exe?download</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Download the executable file and install it. If you did the default installation you will have it installed at <span style="font-weight: bold">c:\msys\1.0</span>. Just put in your PATH variable the <span style="font-weight: bold">c:\msys\1.0\bin</span> folder. <span style="font-weight: bold">DON'T FORGET THIS STEP</span>.  Without it we will not be able to make our project.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">7)</span>Now that we have the basics to program, let's start a new project and import a makefile into it. Go to <span style="font-weight: bold">File-&gt;New-&gt;Project...</span>, select <span style="font-style: italic">C++/Standard Makefile C++ Project</span>. Type a name for it and press '<span style="font-style: italic">Finish</span>'. A new folder under the Eclipse workspace will be created. Now go to <span style="font-weight: bold">File-&gt;New-&gt;File</span>. Type <span style="font-weight: bold">makefile</span> for its name. As the objective of this how-to is not teach makefiles, just copy-paste the makefile below, which is a very simple one. Just replace the PROJ name in Project Details section and put your project name.
<br/>

Notice the ARM specific settings in link parameters. They are a must. Also some people complained of errors like "missing separator" when they cut and paste this makefile from the post. Makefiles have some restrict rules like having a <span style="font-weight: bold">TAB</span> at the beginning of an indented line. Just put it there and you're done. 
<br/>
<br/>
We need to change the default make executable to the one provided with <span style="font-weight: bold">MSYS</span>distribution. Open <span style="font-weight: bold">Project-&gt;Properties</span>, select  <span style="font-style: italic">C/C++ Make Project</span> on the list and unmark '<span style="font-style: italic">Use Default</span>' on Build Command group. Type there: <span style="font-weight: bold">make -f makefile</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Now we need to create a CPP file which will hold our simple GBA example.
<br/>
Go to <span style="font-weight: bold">File-&gt;New-&gt;Source File</span> and type 'main.cpp'. Now cut and paste the code below (a simple example that draws a pixel on middle of GBA screen)
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">int main(void)

<br/>
<br/>
    // switch to video mode 3 (240x160 16-bit)
<br/>
    // by setting a memory register to a specific value
<br/>
    *(unsigned long*)0x4000000 = (0x3 | 0x400);
<br/>
<br/>
    // draw a white pixels (16 bits) directly to video memory
<br/>
    // pixel location is centered on the screen (120,80)
<br/>
    videoBuffer[80 * 240 + 120] = 0xFFFF;

    return 0;
<br/>
}</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
Now it's time to build it and test the resulting stuff on VBA. 
<br/>
We need to create some 'make targets' to be able to build it. Open the <span style="font-style: italic">make targets</span> view (<span style="font-weight: bold">Window-&gt;Show View-&gt;Make targets</span>) and right-click your project name. Click on '<span style="font-style: italic">Add Make Target</span>'. We will be creating three make targets for our little project.  In next screen type 'build' on both <span style="font-style: italic">Target Name</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Make Target</span>. Repeat the process but type 'clean' and 'clean build' The last one is like a rebuild target, so you can put 'rebuild' in <span style="font-style: italic">Target Name</span> if you wish (i do that). So, let's finally build our project. Double click the make target name you want to build.  If things went ok, you should now have a ELF file and a GBA ROM file. 
<br/>
<br/>
Let's test it on VBA. Click on 'Visual Boy Advance Run' option under the toolbar '<span style="font-style: italic">Run External Tools</span>' icon (the one with a green play and a red lock icon)
<br/>
<br/>
VBA should now pop-up with our ROM already running. We finished compiling and running our first ROM!!! It's a day to be remembered :)
<br/>
<br/>
If you need to <span style="font-style: italic">Clean</span> your project or <span style="font-style: italic">Rebuild</span> it, just double-click these targets on the <span style="font-style: italic">'Make Target'</span> view.
<br/>
<br/>
As a final note, you can import your existing projects with the <span style="font-weight: bold">File-&gt;Import...</span> option.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">8)</span> At this point you may asking yourselves "How the hell I'll debug it ?". Right, we can't do a development project without debugging it. Remember VBA ? Yes, it has debug capabilities. Nice huhn? Together with GDB we will be able to debug our game as we play it ! Awesome! Let's set it as a <span style="font-style: italic">External Tool</span>. We'll be using it to <span style="font-weight: bold">debug </span> together with GDB.  Open <span style="font-weight: bold">Run-&gt;External Tools-&gt;External Tools...</span> In the left list box click on '<span style="font-style: italic">Program</span>' and on the '<span style="font-style: italic">New</span>' button at the list bottom. In the Main tab, go to the <span style="font-style: italic">Name</span> input box at top of the screen and write "Visual Boy Advance Debug". Now go to the <span style="font-style: italic">Location</span> option, browse to the folder you unzipped VBA and choose the VB executable. On <span style="font-style: italic">Arguments </span>option, put '-Gtcp ${project_loc}\${project_name}.elf' (without the quotes). This way we are telling VBA to run in TCP mode (to connect to the debugger) and we are passing the project path and name as parameter, so the emulator loads the ELF file to be debugged. Why use ELF file instead of GBA ROM ? Because GBA rom does not have the debugging information we need.
<br/>
<br/>
Now let's setup the GDB part. First change to Debug Perspective. (<span style="font-weight: bold">Window-&gt;Open Perspective-&gt;Debug</span>). Open <span style="font-weight: bold">Run-&gt;Debug...</span> Under <span style="font-style: italic">C/C++ Local Application</span> create a new configuration pressing the '<span style="font-style: italic">Add</span>' button.  Give a name to this configuration and in Main tab put the name of the project and select the ELF file in <span style="font-style: italic">C/C++ Application</span> input (test.elf for example). witch to the Debugger tab and change the combobox to <span style="font-style: italic">GDB Server</span>. It is very important since we will be doing remote debug between GDB and VBA. Change the connection to TCP and port to 55555 ( the port that VBA uses). In the GDB debugger and GDB command line inputs we need to specify an ARM targeted GDB. When i was writing this tutorial, i couldn't find one since VBA official site was down and that was the only place i knew where existed a Windows compiled version targeted to ARM plataform. So I was directed to insight Debugger. This package contains arm-eabi-gdb 
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&amp;package_id=146412" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&amp;package_id=146412</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Uncompress it to a folder, and put the full path to arm-eabi-gdb.exe in the two inputs on Debugger tab. All ready, let's debug.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">9)</span> To debug the ROM, first run the VBA Debug, the external tool. Nothing should happen but a open process will appear in the debug view on upperleft corner of the IDE. Then you should run the debug configuration you created, under the 'bug' icon on the toolbar. If things go well, the debug configuration will connect through TCP with VBA and stop at the main() function. Now you can set your breakpoints, add expressions, watch variables and so on. Note that you global variables do not appear on the variables window, you must <span style="font-style: italic">add a expression</span> to see them. F5 and F6 steps through your code and will be your best friend from here on :)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br/>
IMPORTANT NOTICE</span>: While debugging stop all downloads, p2p programs and the like. As the debugging process is done by TCP protocol, these things will slow down the process. You have been warned. 
<br/>
<br/>
Well I think that I explained in details all the process needed to setup Eclipse to make it a <span style="font-weight: bold">full GBA development Environment</span>. Comments will be welcome and if it is needed I'll do any corrections that may follow as people start to use this how-to and discover any missing step :P
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy using Eclipse as I enjoyed, cya in the forums !

Well this package i made works great too. I ripped insight from my package since its not necessary and would make no difference for Eclipse use. I would love to get rid of the cygwin dlls too, if your Insight build does not have it would be great. I will download and test it and if it's okay, change the tutorial.

I believe this can be fixed in the Properties, Right click the project and go to Properties, and there should be something under Builders tab.  Don't deselect the Makefile one, just the other one.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">NOTE: I haven't tested this yet, it's late and I'm tired, but i've got arm-elf-gdb and it executes (whether it works as it should is TBC); any <span style="text-decoration: underline">constructive</span> criticism, comments, mistakes pointed out will be noted.
<br/>
<br/>
...just 'cause I had a helluva time finding anything useful.
<br/>
<br/>
Yep, just about every here is available precompiled from the same places but there are a few acute differences such as adding the arm-elf-gcc path and the lack of a precompiled version of gdb suited to cross-compiling for the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, if you ever hope to do development for your Linux platform, you'll need to keep everything seperate and some of the development tools may rely on later versions of certain tools (like <b style="color:#FFA34F">Eclipse</b>) than your distribution provides so keeping everything in a directory within your home directory is a good plan.
<br/>
<br/>
So, in short (all command line from hereon in):
<br/>
<br/>
The instructions for <b style="color:#FFA34F">Eclipse</b> are the same, just
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">unzip exclipse-SDK-x.x.x-linux-gtk.zip</span>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">cd <b style="color:#FFA34F">eclipse</b></span>
<br/>
and
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">./<b style="color:#FFA34F">eclipse</b></span>
<br/>
to run and then you can get updates from the URL on the website.
<br/>
<br/>
Downloading devkitATM is the same, drop it in your GBA development directory and
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">tar jxvf devkitARM_r11-linux.tar.bz2</span>
<br/>
to extract.
<br/>
<br/>
Set the path everytime you log in by editing .profile in your home directory, I use vim to do this but kate will be more friendly for those not initiated in the ways of vi or vim so
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">kate ~/.profile</span>
<br/>
and add the line
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">export PATH=$PATH:/home/&lt;yourloginnamehere&gt;/&lt;GBAdevdirectory&gt;/devkitARM_r11/bin</span>
<br/>
<br/>
This won't actually take effect until you next log in. This means exiting you login session in X windows and re-logging in then as XTerm/konsole sessions don't count.
<br/>
<br/>
VisualBoy advance can also be downloaded for Linux (lucky us :o) ) from <a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=63889&amp;package_id=64814&amp;release_id=203133" target="_blank">here</a> which should run on any modern Linux distro. You will, however have to make a new directory for this or it'll extract where everything else is so
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">mkdir vba</span>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">cd vba</span>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">tar zxvf ../VisualBoyAdvance-1.7-SDL-linux-glibc22.tar.gz</span>
<br/>
<br/>
OK, now we can entirely skip the POSIX environment bit as we already have one of those so onto GDB which is a tad trickier but not overly cumbersome.
<br/>
<br/>
So... get the latest version of the gdb source from <a class="postlink" href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/" target="_blank">http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/</a>. Note that there is no ARM specific version as the source code is for all platforms including for cross-compiling and won't be specific until we compile it.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you don't have them already installed (and you should do if you're going to compile anything) you'll be needing -- as a bare minimum -- gcc, gcc-g++, libgcc, binutils, make, automake and if I've missed anything off this list could someone let me know.
<br/>
<br/>
You will also probably need insight to be installed (there should be one with your distribution). As it is, I had no problems compiling gdk but then I tend to install absolutely everything so no wonder there.
<br/>
<br/>
For this compile, we'll be wanting to install this version of gdb somewhere other than where the version of gdb for standard debugging resides, a good place to put this would be in the devkitARM directory.
<br/>
<br/>
So
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">./configure --target=arm-elf --prefix=/home/&lt;yourloginnamehere&gt;/&lt;GBAdevdirectory&gt;/devkitARM_r11/ </span>
<br/>
(all one line)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">make install</span>
<br/>
<br/>
After all the text scrolls past (ignore warnings, some are normal, it's errors that are the problem) everything should be nicely set up.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1), the arguments line for VisualBoy Advance should be
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">${project_loc}/${project_name}.gba</span>
<br/>
and not
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">${project_loc}\${project_name}.gba</span>
<br/>
(see if you can spot the difference :op ).
<br/>
<br/>
2) The --build= option is not actually necessary when configuring gdb for the platform you plan to run it on as, unlike some configure scripts, it checks this itself. This will be updated.
<br/>
<br/>
3) <b style="color:#FFA34F">Eclipse</b> does not necessarily auto-save all files when a build is called (although a rebuild does call up a dialog); if you're getting errors you think you've fixed, check all files are saved/unmodified.
<br/>
<br/>
4) This now all works on my system, any problems you have are therefore not because I've done something wrong but either because my instructions are unclear (in which case I apologise) or because you've done something wrong (in which case I don't). If you have any problems (errors, dependencies, whatever). Search the forums and the internet properly before asking anby questions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But I haven't been happy with any of the combos as a long term solution.  I finally came to the conclusion that <b style="color:#FFA34F">Eclipse</b> and DevKitARM is the non-compromise way to go, and this thread helped me to get it set up very quickly.  And I'm starting to really dig it!

He can't find your compiler arm-elf-gcc. 
<br/>
The createprocess tells you that make tries to start something, in this case arm-elf-gcc, but it doesn't succeded. If some of the sourcefiles are missing you would get an error from your compiler.

<br/>
You may check the path environment variable. It should include the bin folder of your dev kit.

I got everything running pretty much except for the debugging part (thanks to brucesinner for that great howto)

I can get VBA running waiting for a connection however when I try to use eclipse to connect to it, it just kills the VBA process and comes to an end for seemingly no reason...I checked over the settings and everything appears to be exactly as it should both with regards to the information posted here and my own logical conclusions....I know that using the insight GUI works ok if I connect to the VBA process with that but I would like to try and get this eclipse debugger working...it's a very nice suite.

I don't think that the newest VBA Version is the problem. I already used the newest version of VBA without any trouble. 
<br/>
Unfortunatly I have no idea whats going wrong there. VBA disconnects as soon as he got a connection. Does the eclipse workspace report any errors from the debugger. 
<br/>
You should check the debuggers console output and the eclipse problems view.

I'm new to all of this and I know I've got lots of reading to do on everything... but I have a question...
<br/>
<br/>
Your link to your gdb.rar file, brucesinner, is not showing the file?  are you still hosting it?  I'm trying to find a host for the HAM kit but the site for that is returning a 404 too...  so, I tried the InsightGDB kit and installed that but I notice that the exe is arm-gdb and not arm-elf-gdb... is this going to matter?

I don't know yet if that's related?

Also, if I may be frank, your instructions would be a LOT easier to read if you put them as bullet points, in a list.  I know I'm new to all of this but it took a long time to carefully read through it all and pick out the mistakes I made.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm brand new to homebrew programming, but I thought I'd give GBA development a try.  I've set up my development environment in Eclipse, and everything seems to work properly, except for using the GDB for debugging.  I run VBA SDL 1.7 and connect to it properly with the GDB program, as far as I can tell (I've tried the ones included with the <a class="postlink" href="http://ngine.de/index.jsp?pageid=3504" target="_blank">HAM 2.8</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&amp;package_id=146412" target="_blank">Insight 5.2.1</a> with similar results), but when either GDB program runs the "info threads" command I either get "No frame." as the response or "warning: RMT ERROR : failed to get remote thread list," depending on which GDB program I use.
<br/>
<br/>
It seems similar to what <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=39437#39437" target="_blank">yaustar</a> describes, but no one directly addresses his problem or he never says if he corrects it somehow.

For the gdb files i was hosting, they are not there any longer. Just use this url instead:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&amp;package_id=146412" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&amp;package_id=146412</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Download Insight Debugger and use the -nw option to avoid entering the GUI. Works the same as the one I was providing.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For those who are interested - this is an updated guide as of 30/08/2006
<br/>
by me - originally taken from the first post by brucesinner and only edited to reflect changes. Many steps are not needed anymore for example setup msys, download insight debugger, manually add cdt update url etc.. also alot of eclipse labels / steps are now different. I hope this updated guide helps people - i exactly did as described below using eclipse 3.2 and devkitPro Updater 1.3.5.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">1)</span> First, go to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_blank">www.eclipse.org</a> and download latest stable version (in the moment of writing this tutorial, the version was 3.2)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">2)</span> Now we need a Eclipse plugin to be able to work with C/C++ on it. The plugin name is CDT. Open Eclipse, go to <span style="font-weight: bold">Help-&gt;Software Updates-&gt;Find and Install</span> and in the next screen, choose '<span style="font-style: italic">Search for new features to install</span>'. Select the "Calisto Discovery Site" and hit Finish.  Select one mirror (doesnt matter which) - for example "Calisto Discovery Site". Check the C/C++ modules to install and click next until it download and install automatically. After CDT is installed, lets open the C/C++ perspective in Eclipse. This way, Eclipse will be C/C++ friendly providing us with all options we need like debug, build, make targets, ...Go to <span style="font-weight: bold">Window-&gt;Open Perspective-&gt;Other...</span> and find C/C++ in the list. Select it and click OK. If you did correctly, the IDE windows will change position and you'll be able to see C/C++ Projects tab to your left side.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">3)</span> We need a compiler. Not just an ordinary GCC, but one targeted to ARM plataform. There is some cool distributions around but I think <span style="font-weight: bold">DevKitARM </span>is the best since it's being regularly updated. Go to the DevKitPro site to grab the latest devkitPro Updater - it not only includes DevKitARM and a remote debugger (insight) but also the POSIX environment MSYS which you will need to make (build) your projects. 
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">http://www.devkitpro.org/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Install it to a directory (i use c:\devkitPro and put its <span style="font-weight: bold">c:\devkitPro\devkitarm\bin</span> path to the <span style="font-weight: bold">PATH </span>variable. The compiler executable is <span style="font-style: italic">arm-eabi-gcc.exe</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">4)</span> Now that we did a basic setup of the environment, let's download the emulator.  We chose <span style="font-weight: bold">Visual Boy Advance</span> because it has nice debug features which will greatly help us later. Go to Visual Boy Advance site on Sourceforge (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.sf.net/projects/vba" target="_blank">www.sf.net/projects/vba</a>) and download the VBA 1.7 SDL version. <span style="font-weight: bold">ATTENTION! DO NOT DOWNLOAD NEWER VERSIONS THAN 1.7</span>, they're all <span style="font-weight: bold">BROKEN </span>and will not debug correctly. For emulation purposes, they are ok, though. devkitPro.org also provides a suitable windows build of VBA SDL 1.7.1 at <a href="http://www.devkitpro.org/downloads.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.devkitpro.org/downloads.shtml</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">5)</span> Unzip the emulator somewhere on your hard disk (i did it in c:\vba, just change for the folder you like). Now open Eclipse and let's set it as <span style="font-style: italic">External Tool</span> we'll be using to test our ROMs. Open <span style="font-weight: bold">Run-&gt;External Tools-&gt;External Tools...</span> In the left list box click on '<span style="font-style: italic">Program</span>' and right click on it to select the '<span style="font-style: italic">New</span>' Option In the Main tab, go to the <span style="font-style: italic">Name</span> input box at top of the screen and write "Visual Boy Advance Run". Now go to the <span style="font-style: italic">Location</span> option, browse to the folder you unzipped VBA and choose the VBA executable. On <span style="font-style: italic">Arguments </span> option, put '${project_loc}\${project_name}.gba' (without the quotes). This way we are telling VBA to start the GBA ROM we generated informing it using Eclipse internal variables ${project_loc} (project location) and ${project_name} (project name). Switch to Common tab and unmark '<span style="font-style: italic">Launch in background</span>' checkbox. Click "Apply" and "Close" to close this window. 
<br/>
<br/>
Next, go to the Menu <span style="font-weight: bold">Run-&gt;External Tools-&gt;Organize Favorites...</span> Click <span style="font-style: italic">Add..</span> and select the program you just added. Now it will appear on the Eclipse toolbar, under the green play icon with a red lock.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">6)</span>Now that we have the basics to program, let's start a new project and import a makefile into it. Go to <span style="font-weight: bold">File-&gt;New-&gt;Project...</span>, select <span style="font-style: italic">C++/Standard Makefile C++ Project</span>. Type a name for it (for example 'NDSHelloWorld') and press '<span style="font-style: italic">Finish</span>'. A new folder under the Eclipse workspace will be created. Right click this folder and select <span style="font-weight: bold">New-&gt;File</span>. Type <span style="font-weight: bold">makefile</span> for its name. As the objective of this how-to is not teach makefiles, just copy-paste the makefile below, which is a very simple one. Just replace the PROJ name in Project Details section and put your project name.

Notice the ARM specific settings in link parameters. They are a must. Also some people complained of errors like "missing separator" when they cut and paste this makefile from the post. Makefiles have some restrict rules like having a <span style="font-weight: bold">TAB</span> at the beginning of an indented line. Just put it there and you're done. 
<br/>
<br/>
We need to change the default make executable to the one provided with  <span style="font-weight: bold">MSYS</span>distribution (which is included in the DevKitPro Updater - NOTE: it should automatically set itself as a PATH member - if not do it manually). Right click your Project Folder, select <span style="font-weight: bold">Properties</span>, select  <span style="font-style: italic">C/C++ Make Project</span> on the list and unmark '<span style="font-style: italic">Use Default</span>' on Build Command group. Type there: <span style="font-weight: bold">make -f makefile</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Now we need to create a CPP file which will hold our simple GBA example.
<br/>
Right click your Project folder, select  <span style="font-weight: bold">New-&gt;Source File</span> and type 'main.cpp' without the quotes. Now cut and paste the code below (a simple example that draws a pixel on middle of GBA screen)
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">int main(void)

<br/>
<br/>
    // switch to video mode 3 (240x160 16-bit)
<br/>
    // by setting a memory register to a specific value
<br/>
    *(unsigned long*)0x4000000 = (0x3 | 0x400);
<br/>
<br/>
    // draw a white pixels (16 bits) directly to video memory
<br/>
    // pixel location is centered on the screen (120,80)
<br/>
    videoBuffer[80 * 240 + 120] = 0xFFFF;
<br/>
    
<br/>
    // continuous loop
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
    }
<br/>

    // end program
<br/>
    return 0;
<br/>
<br/>
}
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Now it's time to build it and test the resulting stuff on VBA. 
<br/>
We need to create some 'make targets' to be able to build it. Open the <span style="font-style: italic">make targets</span> view (<span style="font-weight: bold">Window-&gt;Show View-&gt;Make targets</span>) and right-click your project name. Click on '<span style="font-style: italic">Add Make Target</span>'. We will be creating three make targets for our little project.  
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">First make (build) target</span>
<br/>
<br/>
In screen type 'build' (without the quotes) on both <span style="font-style: italic">Target Name</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Make Target</span> instead of 'all'. 
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Second make (clean) target</span>
<br/>
<br/>
In screen type 'build' (without the quotes) type 'clean' for <span style="font-style: italic">Target Name</span> and 'clean build' for <span style="font-style: italic">Make Target</span> instead of 'all'. 
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Third make (rebuild) target</span>
<br/>
<br/>
In screen type 'build' (without the quotes) type 'rebuild' for <span style="font-style: italic">Target Name</span> and 'rebuild' for <span style="font-style: italic">Make Target</span> instead of 'all'. 
<br/>
<br/>
So, let's finally build our project. Expand your Project Folder in the 'Make Targets' View. Double click the make target name you want to build.  If things went ok, you should now have a ELF file and a GBA ROM file. 
<br/>
<br/>
The output should like this :
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">make -f makefile build 
<br/>
arm-eabi-gcc -I./ -mthumb-interwork -mthumb -O2 -Wall -g -c main.cpp -o main.o
<br/>
copy from `NDSHelloWorld.elf' [elf32-littlearm] to `NDSHelloWorld.gba' [binary]
<br/>
ROM fixed!
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's test it on VBA. Select your created gba File within your project, Click on 'Visual Boy Advance Run' option under the toolbar '<span style="font-style: italic">Run External Tools</span>' icon (the one with a green play and a red lock icon).
<br/>
<br/>
VBA should now pop-up with our ROM already running. We finished compiling and running our first ROM!!! It's a day to be remembered :)
<br/>
<br/>
If you need to <span style="font-style: italic">Clean</span> your project or <span style="font-style: italic">Rebuild</span> it, just double-click these targets on the <span style="font-style: italic">'Make Target'</span> view.
<br/>
<br/>
As a final note, you can import your existing projects with the <span style="font-weight: bold">File-&gt;Import...</span> option.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">7)</span> At this point you may asking yourselves "How the hell I'll debug it ?". Right, we can't do a development project without debugging it. Remember VBA ? Yes, it has debug capabilities. Nice huhn? Together with GDB we will be able to debug our game as we play it ! Awesome! Let's set it as a <span style="font-style: italic">External Tool</span>. We'll be using it to <span style="font-weight: bold">debug </span> together with GDB.  Open <span style="font-weight: bold">Run-&gt;External Tools-&gt;External Tools...</span> In the left list box click on '<span style="font-style: italic">Program</span>' , right click on it and select  '<span style="font-style: italic">New</span>' . In the Main tab, go to the <span style="font-style: italic">Name</span> input box at top of the screen and write "Visual Boy Advance Debug". Now go to the <span style="font-style: italic">Location</span> option, browse to the folder you unzipped VBA and choose the VB executable. On <span style="font-style: italic">Arguments </span>option, put '-Gtcp ${project_loc}\${project_name}.elf' (without the quotes) and click Apply and then Close. This way we are telling VBA to run in TCP mode (to connect to the debugger) and we are passing the project path and name as parameter, so the emulator loads the ELF file to be debugged. Why use ELF file instead of GBA ROM ? Because GBA rom does not have the debugging information we need.
<br/>
<br/>
Now let's setup the GDB part. First change to Debug Perspective. (<span style="font-weight: bold">Window-&gt;Open Perspective-&gt;Debug</span>). Open <span style="font-weight: bold">Run-&gt;Debug...</span> Under <span style="font-style: italic">C/C++ Local Application</span> create a new configuration by right clicking on it an selecting '<span style="font-style: italic">New</span>'.  Give a name to this configuration and in Main tab put the name of the project and select the ELF file in <span style="font-style: italic">C/C++ Application</span> input (test.elf for example) using "Search Project".
<br/>
<br/>
Switch to the Debugger tab and change the combobox to <span style="font-style: italic">gdbserver Debugger</span>. In the GDB debugger and GDB command line inputs we need to specify an ARM targeted GDB. The "insight Debugger" is included within the devkitPro Updater. Put the full path to arm-eabi-gdb.exe in the GDB Debuger field (Example : c:\devkitPro\insight\bin\arm-eabi-gdb.exe.)
<br/>
<br/>
Finally it is very important since we will be doing remote debug between GDB and VBA to setup the connection. Click on the Connection Tab and select TCP as Type and enter 55555 as Port( the port that VBA uses). 
<br/>
<br/>
Click Apply and then Close...
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, everything is ready, let's debug.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">8)</span>Add the VBA Debug you just created as a favorite.
<br/>
Go to the Menu <span style="font-weight: bold">Run-&gt;External Tools-&gt;Organize Favorites...</span> Click <span style="font-style: italic">Add..</span> and select the program you just added. Now it will appear on the Eclipse toolbar, under the green play icon with a red lock.
<br/>
<br/>
To debug the ROM, first run the VBA Debug, the external tool. Nothing should happen but a open process will appear in the debug view on upperleft corner of the IDE. (Note if you have a firewall be sure to grant access to the process!). Then you should run the debug configuration you created, under the 'bug' icon on the toolbar. Select the bug icon - click on "Organize Favorites" and click on add - select your debug configuration. It should now appear in the list under the bug icon.
<br/>
<br/>
If things go well, the debug configuration will connect through TCP with VBA and stop at the main() function. Now you can set your breakpoints, add expressions, watch variables and so on. Note that you global variables do not appear on the variables window, you must <span style="font-style: italic">add a expression</span> to see them. F5 and F6 steps through your code and will be your best friend from here on :)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br/>
IMPORTANT NOTICE</span>: While debugging stop all downloads, p2p programs and the like. As the debugging process is done by TCP protocol, these things will slow down the process. You have been warned.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

) Now that we did a basic setup of the environment, let's download the emulator. We chose Visual Boy Advance because it has nice debug features which will greatly help us later. Go to Visual Boy Advance site on Sourceforge (www.sf.net/projects/vba) and download the VBA 1.7 SDL version. ATTENTION! DO NOT DOWNLOAD NEWER VERSIONS THAN 1.7, they're all BROKEN and will not debug correctly. For emulation purposes, they are ok, though. devkitPro.org also provides a suitable windows build of VBA SDL 1.7.1 at <a href="http://www.devkitpro.org/downloads.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.devkitpro.org/downloads.shtml</a>

Just for a FYI I have fixed the 1.8 version so it works with the debugger.  Should you want the fixed version for windows or the sourcecode I can post a URL.  On windows I compiled it with Visual Studio 2005 so there are some runtime DLL's that are need but are in a separate install from Microsoft.  Let me know ...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's great you have Eclipse working with the gba dev chain. However I'd like to air on the side of caution. I've used it before for gba development but I am in the process of finding another IDE. My main problem with Eclipse for gba development is that the CDT C++ plugin is no way near mature enough to be usefull. Half the time code complete will just refuse to work for valid code that I'm typing. But it has no other usefull functions like the Eclipse Java engine has such as automatic import resolution. It's  main plus point are the debugger interface and the makefile generation. Well the debugger interface is good, when it works. But the makefile generation which is the feather in the CDT cap dosn't really work for the gba dev toolchain.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a linux user myself and most of the IDEs support standard makefiles so I'm going to see if theres something out there that is more mature than eclipse. Even something with a window that lists the header of the object I'm currently working with would be so much more usefull.<br/>_________________<br/>John Noon</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I would like to hear if you found anything more useful than eclipse, Madmax (esp. debugging and makefile would be great).
<br/>
Until then ill try eclipse. So far things are pretty cool, but I too have problems with the debug feature. i use vba 1.7.1 and eclipse 3.1 and i get everything to compile and even debug. When i debug i can step through the code (like i would in jave), and its a little jumpier than in java, but pretty usable nevertheless. I can also press the resume button whereupon i can see my prog running in vba.
<br/>
BUT while i step through the code vba is frozen (meaning i cant look at the gameboy), and after i pressed resume and look at vba the breakpoints seem to be getting ignored (i.e. i had a breakpoint in the function that gets called when i move player left, but it never breaks even when it does move left).
<br/>
Does anybody have ideas what might be wrong (or am i dealing with "features")?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all i wish to say hello to all the members of gbadev.org
<br/>
Second a big thanks to brucesinner for this excellent guide for setting-up gba development environment. I was wondering through a countless sites for a whole week to find a decent IDE to start experimenting (i'm using MS Visual Studio in my day job, so guess how spoiled i am).
<br/>
To the point... i stuck for about some time on a little problem caused by the Eclipse - "source not found". Finally it turns out that the directory mappings in the editor were wrong (or missing to be more precise). I'm using WinXP so there is a slight difference between cygwin paths and windows paths.
<br/>
To solve the problem : open <span style="font-weight: bold">Window</span> -&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold">Preferences...</span>; expand <span style="font-weight: bold">C/C++</span>, than expand <span style="font-weight: bold">Debug</span> and select <span style="font-weight: bold">Common Source Lookup Path</span>. Than add a mapping to your projects directory according to this <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cse.unr.edu/forums/viewtopic.php?p=97&amp;sid=fa52012d36c6fcbd2195610ff772fcd5" target="_blank">thread</a>.
<br/>
Just skip the "/cygdrive/c/" part. So for example my mapping is :
<br/>
Compilation path: \Software
<br/>
Local file system path: D:\Software
<br/>
Remember - NO "/cygdrive/" in the path.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I'm using Eclipse 3.2.1 on Windows XP.<br/>_________________<br/>[shtruc]</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by supudo on Sat Nov 25, 2006 3:14 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I gave up on eclipse because of the component conflict issues.  If you have Visual Studio 2005 (any edition) then the make file projects can be set up to work with the devKitARM toolchain.  VS 2003 has broken makefile project support so I would not use that.  Since I no longer use eclipse there is little I can do to address those issues.  I hope someone can help you there.
<br/>
<br/>
The VS 2005 along with the sed utility is all you need to get a working makefile environment using the MS IDE.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">[quote]8)Add the VBA Debug you just created as a favorite.
<br/>
Go to the Menu Run-&gt;External Tools-&gt;Organize Favorites... Click Add.. and select the program you just added. Now it will appear on the Eclipse toolbar, under the green play icon with a red lock.
<br/>
<br/>
To debug the ROM, first run the VBA Debug, the external tool. Nothing should happen but a open process will appear in the debug view on upperleft corner of the IDE. (Note if you have a firewall be sure to grant access to the process!). Then you should run the debug configuration you created, under the 'bug' icon on the toolbar. Select the bug icon - click on "Organize Favorites" and click on add - select your debug configuration. It should now appear in the list under the bug icon.
<br/>
<br/>
If things go well, the debug configuration will connect through TCP with VBA and stop at the main() function. Now you can set your breakpoints, add expressions, watch variables and so on. Note that you global variables do not appear on the variables window, you must add a expression to see them. F5 and F6 steps through your code and will be your best friend from here on :)
<br/>
<br/>
IMPORTANT NOTICE: While debugging stop all downloads, p2p programs and the like. As the debugging process is done by TCP protocol, these things will slow down the process. You have been warned.[/quote]
<br/>
<br/>
I start the VBA external tool process.  I then start the GDB debugger and get the following error:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The startup of VBA shows that it is waiting for a connection and then go a connect so your emulator is getting connected to from the debugger.  The bad packet message is the emulator complaining about the data the debugger sent.  
<br/>
<br/>
The first part of the debugger packet dialog loads the elf file over the socket and then the debugger reads the debug information (which is embedded in the elf file with the "-g" switch on the compile and link) to set  the debugger up to monitor your code.  Just remember this is a two part debug process.  One part is the VBA SDL code listening ready to accept commands over the socket.  The other is the debugger (insight/gdb or a debugger that can send/receive gdb codes packets) which talks to VBA using gdb formatted socket messages.  
<br/>
<br/>
The debugging (gdb) interface in VBA was not implemented very well so you will find some issues here.  I got so frustrated with it that I finally fixed the implementation of the debugger and some other issues in VBA.  I have not found a home for the code yet so there is no public place to put it.  There are still problems with the interrupt implementation (ignoring REG_IE bit settings for some interrupts and key press interrupts happening multiple times) which I am going to look at when I get time.  I could post the source and executable somewhere for public use if anyone can suggest a location.  I took the 1.8.? implementation and fixed all of the debug problems I could find and it works well (I have been testing it for 3 to 4 months about 25 different people each month).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
