    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm new to the gba development community and I'm having quite a problem compiling in VisualHam.
<br/>
Anytime I try to build code, nothing happens. The emulator screen doesnt pop up or anything. 
<br/>
I think it might be where I'm placing my code. I have made a folder in the HAM root directory called 'vhamworkspace'. The path looks like this..
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">C:\HAM\vhamworkspace\</span>
<br/>
Please help! I'm extremely eager to get my code to compile. Thank you. 
<br/>
(Also I have windows 10, but I have changed the compatibility setting of VisualHam to windows xp so I dont think that is the problem)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Oggi. Welcome to the forums.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the few of us that hang out here nowadays might not be much help -- we don't tend to use visualHam, and the folks that do haven't been here in awhile.
<br/>
<br/>
(And in general, asking the same question on multiple threads isn't helpful, just ask it once, anyone that actually comes here will see it)
<br/>
<br/>
That being said, are there any error messages or anything that you can find?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
