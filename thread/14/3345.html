<br/>
In 16 color mode the color indices only need half the space becase 4 bit can have 16 possibilities. 
<br/>
So the images only need half the space in VRAM and you can have more tiles loaded.
<br/>
You can still have 256 colors onscreen cause every tile can have one of 16 16-color palettes.

space surely is a sufficient reason - on a commercial project,  the difference between using a 64mbit cart and a 128mbit cart could be the difference between making a profit or a loss !!

<br/>
The image quality issue is debatable - colour reproduction on the gba is pretty poor, so the difference there is not very noticable. On the other hand, if you use 4 bit colour backgrounds, you have the option of having more unique tiles on show at one time, giving you a greater detail level and potentially a more immersive experience.

<br/>
<br/>
yes.
<br/>
Another potentially significant reason why 4bit colour backgrounds are a good thing is speed. If you are using any kind of dynamic tile management system, it will go a LOT faster with 4bit tiles :)

You missed the logic.  "Because it's smaller" is an incomplete answer -- monochrome would be smaller still.  A real answer is "the benefit of reduced size exceeds the cost of having fewer colors per tile."

No, that doesn't really make any sense.  When you copy a tile to VRAM, it doesn't stuff a copy of the palette in its suitcase for safekeeping.  ;-)  You choose the palette number in the map cell.  See the usual docs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another reason is tradition. The Super NES and the Sega Genesis used 16-color tiles. Heck, <span style="font-style: italic">Sonic Advance</span> uses only four of the GBA's 16 different 16-color palettes for backgrounds, possibly because Sonic Team's graphics tools were originally designed for a Sega Genesis platform that had only four 16-color palettes shared between backgrounds and sprites.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

"Because it's smaller" is an incomplete answer - but I didn't say  "Because it's smaller" ;)
<br/>
I did qualify this POV later in my post by suggesting that any difference in quality between 4bit and 8bit on gba hardware is very slight.
<br/>
Maybe I should have said that keeping memory usage down is a 'valid motivation' for using 4bit tiles...

139 more?
<br/>
<br/>
my (possibly very wrong ?) calculations suggest theoretically you can get 896 more !
<br/>
<br/>
mode 0; 4 32x32 tile maps - 1 per layer - leaves 57344 bytes of bg vram for tile data so 1792 4bit tiles or 896 8bit tiles.
<br/>
Each layer can only address 1024 tiles at a time however, each layer can address a different section of the tile data, so it is theortically possible to display all the 4bit tiles at one time in the visible screen area.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, in practice, at any one time, many of the tiles will be partially or totally covered by tiles in other layers, but if you are using an alpha layer, and tiles with a lot of holes in them, combined with parallax scrolling, it can still make a big difference to whats possible...

We both forgot that there are 4 layers, so with holes and alpha and all that the figure is 2604.  As col mentioned, there's space for 1792 4-bit tiles after using 4 screen base blocks.
<br/>
<br/>
col, I see your 1792 tiles and raise you 64 more!  If you only use 3 backgrounds, that leaves screen space for 1953 tiles, which still exceeds the number of tiles we can fit in VRAM, which is now 1856.
<br/>
<br/>
Using 8 bit tiles, we can drop one more background and settle for 1302 tiles of screen space, and fill the 3.75 char base blocks with 960 tiles.
<br/>
<br/>
And the final difference comes to... 896??  :o</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
