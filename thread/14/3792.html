    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, thanks for coming.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a newbie, just like many people coming to visit this section of the forums, and I have a proposition to make.
<br/>
<br/>
I am not looking for people to do my "dirty work" for me, nor am I looking to do anybody else's work.  I am here to look for a partner or two.
<br/>
<br/>
I have very slowly been learning to program for the GBA, and have become frustrated on several occasions, often staring blankly at code having nowhere to take it.
<br/>
<br/>
The end to this little story is this:  It is much easier to learn when you have someone else to chew the fat with.  So I want someone who is <span style="font-style: italic">as new</span> to programming C++ for the GBA as I am.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's where I'm at:
<br/>
<br/>
- First time ever programming in C++, I have never used it for any platform other than GBA.  I have been programming for about 6 months, using this forum, several websites, and a How-To book on Turbo C++ for reference.  I have never taken classes on programming except for Turbo Pascal for DOS for a year, and Delphi for Windows for half a year in highschool.
<br/>
- My knowledge of GBA programming is such:
<br/>
-- Graphics, mostly mode0 (tile/text), but I have used tile/rot BKG's and bitmapped modes (mostly mode4)
<br/>
-- I can zoom a rot BK
<br/>
-- I can create an infinitely large text BK (I have a demo I can send that shows the entire first level of SMB1 with smooth scrolling using only a single 32x32 tile background)
<br/>
-- User input (key handling)
<br/>
-- Very limited understanding of DMA
<br/>
-- Almost no idea how to use sound directly
<br/>
-- I can use Apex's AAS to play MODs and SFX, including volume control and stereo pan (pan for SFX only so far)
<br/>
<br/>
I always have to look at charts to see which register does what, and I often forget how to use some of them.  I'm just warning everyone interested because if you're smarter than I'm making myself out to be, you're going to be stuck waiting for me to catch up to you.
<br/>
<br/>
My objective:
<br/>
To learn side-by-side via the internet how to more better program for the GBA (but learning how to properly speak english is optional) for two purposes:
<br/>
1) To be able to make actual games (instead of just these lame demos I've made)
<br/>
2) To get  better grasp on programming in order to prepare for dev'ing for the Nintendo DS
<br/>
<br/>
And if anyone wants to know, I am a 23 year old male, I have a 3/4 full time job, and if my roommate goes to bed early enough (he's kinda distracting 'cause he plays video games instead of making them) then I like to get about 2 hours of programming or programming related R&amp;D done.  More if I don't work the next day.
<br/>
<br/>
I do not care how old you are, as long as you are somewhat mature (no name calling or crying like a baby because you've decided you don't like me), fairly responsible (do you constantly neglect your pet dog/cat?  Does he/she die of starvation because you forget?  Can you hold a job for more than a week?  Can you... nah, NOBODY can keep to a diet...).  I am not racist or prejudice, I do not care if you are african-american, spanish, puerto rican, japanese (the japanese rule), hindu, muslum, pagan, christian, catholic, protestant, latter-day saint/mormon, ANYthing, but it will help a lot if you have a GOOD grasp of english (as I cannot speak other languages).  Males or females are fine by me either way.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are <span style="text-decoration: underline">seriously</span> new, and are actually interested in learning to program better, please reply to this post.  I'm usually on the computer between 8 PM and 2 AM (GMT -08:00 - observing Daylight Savings, so add an hour for now -- GMT -07:00).  I will be using Hotmail and/or MSN, no IRC, and I doubt that any forum is going to want to host hundreds (thousands?) of posts every month for just 2 or 3 people.  So e-mail or instant message via MSN to communicate, and you must be willing to share information.  I do not like greedy people who leech information without giving something in return.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, that is all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I would like to help you, however I don't exactly meet the criteria. I'm umm... not really a n00b. :) However, as you can see in the main page, I've never made a demo... I have one ready, but the control of the main character does disgrace to the series I am trying to "clone". Mainly the jumping.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
That's a good point.  It is kinda help wanted, but more so, I'm not just looking for help.  I'm looking for a help-and-be-helped-for-newbies-and-by-newbies, so I guess it could go either way.
<br/>
<br/>
Moderators, can I leave this one up to you?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">seems like you're learning to code the gba just great!
<br/>
hope you'll find someone to share your thoughts/ideas with..
<br/>
<br/>
keep on using the tile-based modes since they're (in my opinion) a key to the real strength of the gba! (look at all commercial jap-made games)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
