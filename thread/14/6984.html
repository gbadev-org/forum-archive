    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As a student who is taking a gap year before entering a degree in computer networking with an interest to properly get into coding and maybe contribute in some way to the scene I was looking around for an area which I could focus my coding interest on. gbadev seems like a nice community, though coding 3D engines and the like is a little beyond me, I am more interested in designing the network code for games. 
<br/>
<br/>
I already have some Perl experience and am familar with the basic concepts of programming such as variables and loops etc. I am looking to refine my abilities with a language that I could utilize for designing the multiplayer programming aspect of video games. Like the kind of thing  steve <a class="postlink" href="http://www.akkit.org/dswifi/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.akkit.org/dswifi/index.html</a> is doing.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on what language would be most apt or some online tutorials would be a great help, as I don't really know where to begin. If anybody here is interested in the networking aspect as well please feel free to reply with how you got into it, if you really enjoy it etc.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you asking if you should do multiplayer code for the GBA?  Or just multiplayer code in general?  Either way, you've chosen one of the most difficult areas in game coding to be your sandbox.  I'd personally play elsewhere as this sandbox is full of quicksand and sand sharks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I spent many, many, many hours banging my head against the GBA multiplayer stuff before I got anything to work. I agree with Mike... if you want to do multiplayer for GBA, start by getting some simpler games to work first. You'll have more fun and experience a lower chance of burn-out. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you just want to do multiplayer, PERL/Database-driven web games, that's a whole different story, and one that doesn't really fit the expertise on this forum. (Though if you post specific question to the Off Topic forum, there are a lot of web nerds like me on this board who'd be happy to chat.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, thanks guys. I will try and pick up more C++ and general knowledge about the various aspects of game coding before I choose what I will specialize in. Since I am already interested in the workings of TCP/IP and this is being utilized by the DS I just thought that may be a nice goal to reach. I wasn't talking about gba multiplayer in particular, it's just that this community seems very cool and helpful towards other people.
