    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am searching for a tutorial about using tiles and how to construct scrolling games with the GBA (or in general for that matter). 
<br/>
<br/>
Mode 0 is used for tiling right? Problem is I don't seem to find this tutorial you mentioned. Maybe someone could be so kind to post a link to Toncs tutorial or another tutorial that mentions how to use tiles.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you for the link. Though I still have some questions to how one can use tiles. 
<br/>
<br/>
What I'm mostly wondering is how do you tell the program wich tiles to use when a character moves forward in a simple sidescroller? I know that you have a set of tiles and then a tilemap. But how and when do you update what tiles that are to be displayed on the screen? And can you display parts of a tile so that the switching doesn't become too choppy? 
<br/>
<br/>
I checked the link to Toncs documentation but I didn't really find the answers to these questions when going through the tile part. But I'll keep looking.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Well I found the part that explains scrolling. I'm gonna give it a try =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
