    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">excellent thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried the ds tutorial, and couldnt compile it with devkitpro, so i used an example that comes with the software, and got that compiling and working. The only thing is, It runs correctly in an emulator (im using iDeaS). Then when i use my neoflash kit to try it on the actual ds, the screens are flipped :/ (i.e. the hello world appears on the bottom screen, when it should be on the top)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone got any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmmm, I haven't gotten into DS development big yet( still doing gba programming). Post in the DS Development forum and I'm sure someone there will be glad to help you(they mostly hangout there). I actually just set up a tutorial list etc. in that forum after rerading your post and wanting to setup a good starting point when I begin. There are more listings there and you should find some more useful stuff :). It is under "NDS Tutorials and Misc. Dev Links". Hope this helps. I do know that a lot of the nds emulators don't function very well(or so I've heard) so that could have something to do with it, but probably not if the original program was written like that.
