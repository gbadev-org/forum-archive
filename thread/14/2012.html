    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes I am as tried as a hibernating bear, I feel like Sh*t but I have been able to finish my long awaited fire routine. It runs a bit slow ( well a lot better than 3 days ago I can asure you). It feels great and I can't wait to get stoke into creating something else. I even got a chance to do some Optimization with inline assmbler. I know this isn't anything new but it was my first GBA project took me a disgraceful 2 weeks + 3 sleepless night and a lot of stupid questions. Well Just wanted to share my happy feels with the GBA community. Later guys/gals I am off to bed, I earned it.
