<br/>
<br/>
You're hopefully picturing some fairly large amount of work in your head and thinking "yeah, I can do that". Now increase it by 20 times.
<br/>
<br/>
You need to ask yourself how long the commercial equivalent of the game you want to create took to make, and how many people worked on it.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://aaiiee.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">http://aaiiee.wordpress.com/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know that, but I wanted to start with a demo app with wifime enabled. The first thing that I need is a driver app to download for the game. Then like some map makers, I would need at least 2 maps for the demo. Guns/People creaters to make guns and the people. That would include one vehicle which is the warthog. So if I can get help, I would really appreciatite. And if the demo app works, then I'll get the guys that worked with me on this game to make the full version. And does anyone know where I can get apps to start making games?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"not much of a game maker", and you want to make a game?
<br/>
<br/>
My advice: Make something small and simple, like a pong clone. Once you see how much work that is, you'll either be hungry for more, or very grouchy. Either way, you generally have to do most of the work yourself if you want a game made without large sums of money involved.
<br/>
<br/>
Most of the people here are the "hungry for more" type, and more than happy to help those willing to learn.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

GBA is pretty similar to DS on the 2D side though, so starting there wouldn't be a bad idea either.

Just try to get the examples that come with DevKitPro to compile. Once you've got that, just strip it down and start experimenting :)<br/>_________________<br/>___________

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To the original poster, I think you would benefit a bit from reading this post from John Carmack regarding "ideas": <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=25551&amp;cid=2775698" target="_blank">http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=25551&amp;cid=2775698</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The poster who said that ideas are worth nothing absolutely hit the nail on the head. You should ask yourself, why would someone with the skills required to implement my idea spend his time bringing my dream to fruition, when he's undoubtedly backlogged with plenty ideas of his own he'd like to implement? Unfortunately, game development isn't as simple as coming up with a design and finding people who will implement it for you (unless you're very wealthy and can afford to pay them out of pocket). You'll need to build up your own skill set one day at a time, until you can get to the point where you'll realize just how much work is involved with what you want to accomplish. If you need help along the way, this forum is great for it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can use some of the templates and/or demos in DevKitPro to start with, and if you want to make a simple game you could more easily make a module for Multigam (which I need more modules anyways), not like Halo DS, but something simpler such as Dr. Mario maybe. Then you can learn to use standard DevKitPro templates instead work on blank project, then maybe you can make Halo DS at least a little bit, then more. And you can't do DS Download Play without sign by Nintendo, because it won't work if it isn't signed.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Dualis has emulated the arm7 for quite a while now I believe. I'm too lazy to go look at the changelogs, but there is definately a point at which he added custom arm7 support when before it was just faked.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
