    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">32 MB, or 256 Mbit.
<br/>
<br/>
In practice, however, the largest GBA games in production today are half that.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">but there is nothing stopping me from using all that space? or would it not be worth it due to a bigger ROM and the finished game costing more to publish/produce and thus also costing more for the consumers</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Take $30, the suggested retail price of a GBA game. Subtract retail markup. Subtract wholesale markup. Subtract what you pay your programmers, artists, and composers (first run of carts only). Subtract what you pay for your movie license (first run of carts or each run of carts depending on the contract). What you have left better be enough to buy a cart, or your company loses money.
<br/>
<br/>
GBA Video titles are comparatively cheap (20 USD) for a 256 Mbit cart because Majesco has already paid the programmers once to create the codec and the conversion tools to turn a Nickelodeon video capture into a ROM image.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">we do intend to produce a game and want to get it published to get some credibility for larger projects
<br/>
<br/>
im not sure if ill be able to program it alone, im currently learning C and i realise there is still much ahead to be learnt, but i am confident that my business partner can do all the art work alone no problem and faster than i could program. but if we are working to 32MB / 256Bit then we can fit in twice as much as working to 16MB / 128Bit, and im assuming theres nothing stopping us from doing that then; but it means more than twice the work</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unless you think your game is much, much hotter than all of the biggest sellers out there at the moment - games like Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, Mega Man Battle Network &lt;x&gt;, Sword of Mana, etc. - you won't ever find a publisher who agrees to a 256 Mbit cart size for you. (All of those games are 128 Mbit.)
<br/>
<br/>
To my knowledge, there are no published games that use the full 256 Mbit cart size. (Not counting GBA-video, I suppose.)
