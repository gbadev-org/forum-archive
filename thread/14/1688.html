    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to install devkit advance on my machine, and every executable in the package dies with the error message
<br/>
<br/>
"The application failed to initialize properly: (0xc0000022). Click OK to terminate the application."
<br/>
<br/>
I'm running Windows XP, and I have a full version of cygwin installed, if that matters. I've tried both version 5b3 and version 4 of devkitadv, and they both seem to have this problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">weird. I reinstalled everything in the dev kit (for like the 4th time), and now it all seems to work.
<br/>
<br/>
Looks like the old "problem fixes itself after I ask for help" phenomenon...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
