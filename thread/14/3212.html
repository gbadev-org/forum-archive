    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. 
<br/>
    I have two interrupt routines. One, called by the HBlank interrupt is use to scale the screen vertically, the other, called by the timer 1 interrupt is used to refill the sound buffer. Both work perfectly independantly when i use the fast interrupts approach to call them. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using my own linkscript and crtO, but the interrupt code is ripped straight from the standard crt0.
<br/>
<br/>
I started off by enabling single interrupts, and everything runs, although obviously the sound is scratchy and the display wobbles quite a bit.
<br/>
<br/>
When i enabled multiple interrupts nothing worked. Defining __SwitchToUserStack gets it up and running, but the screen still wobbles a little bit, and much worse the game speed nosedives sharply. 
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone explain what's wrong?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
