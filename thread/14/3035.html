    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've already downloaded devkitadv and have it stored on my C drive.  How do I create a project for it in Microsoft Visual C++?  I already know a lot of C++, but I need to know what files I need to include, what directories should be accessed for include files and library files, and if there are any good tutorial sites for beginners.  Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you have to use a makefile, you just use the Visual Studio IDE, not its compiler, so the code stays the same when using VS.
<br/>
<br/>
Just google for some information about makefiles (there is also a VS plugin that will create makefiles for you)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not sure about devkitadv, But bomberman pointed me towards HAM, and there are some good tutorials for that, and it has it's own development environment.
<br/>
<br/>
And as far as HAM goes, mygba.h is the only file that needs to be included unless you are using external libraries like ximox and/or HEL.
<br/>
<br/>
Not only that, but Visual HAM comes with an array of tools for converting bitmaps, editing maps etc...
<br/>
<br/>
And if you don't have access to something like Photoshop, you can download a freeware program that is great called i.mage. There is one problem with it though, you have to create a 32bit bitmap and then use bmpto8bit.exe to convert it to 8 bit. The reason is that there seems to be some kind of problem creating 8bit bitmaps in i.mage, the file gets corrupted and the converter won't convert it to a C array, paint can't open it and neither can i.mage. But after converting a 32bit to an 8bit, everything works and i.mage can open, edit and save the image without corrupting it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nothing against devkitadv, the only reason I didn't use it, is that the tutorials that I found and liked, were targetting HAM, and it came with almost a complete set of the tools neccessary to get started.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'd look and see where mine is located, but I'm at work right now so can't check.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Perhaps you should take a look at the environment variables, either in Vham configuration options or in your Windows.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the Ham's path is not defined in your Path variable (a system variable).
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't have trouble with it when installing Ham, cause it does much configuration stuff for you, so I suppose the install wasn't able to write in environment path variable.
<br/>
<br/>
Check it ;)<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you found the fix for this???
<br/>
<br/>
I'm having the same problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried copying the make.exe from a previous version of HAM into the new directory.... There isn't even a make.exe in 2.5 A....
<br/>
<br/>
Also did a re-install/reboot
<br/>
<br/>
Any solutions?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">&lt;plug&gt;You can find out how to use VS makefile projects (and makefiles) at <a class="postlink" href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/tonc/setup.htm" target="_blank">http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/tonc/setup.htm</a>.&lt;/plug&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
If you're comfortable with VS's standard make-tool NMAKE, the only real thing you need to add (apart from the makefile itself, of course) is the `bin' directory of your devkit (to the executable directories list). It's probably better if you used devkitARM instead of devkitAdvance, btw. For portability's sake it might be nicer to use GNUmake instead of NMAKE. devkitAdv comes with its own make, for devkitARM you'd need something like MSYS. Either way, add directory where you can find `make' to the executable directories of VS as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
