    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want the demo on the site, e-mail news(shift+2)gbadev.org . They will upload it to the demos section for you, and usually make an announcement on the main page. Make sure you give them both a screenshot and whatever you want posted as the announcement, if you want one. Oh, and letting them know who you are is a nice touch.

Their address is being a little wierd at the moment and may send back a "not delivered" message, but it should go through.
