    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys,
<br/>
<br/>
Are there any web site showcases of the best homebrew GBA games? I haven't really seen the best examples of amateurs making software yet, I've only seen the updates every so often at gbadev.org.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of a good place to go and see the best that the homebrew community has to offer? Likewise, where would be good to advertise a finished game after it is completed?
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,
<br/>
<br/>

Tetanus on Drugs is already in my homebrew collection! Awesome game. That said, I only have 2 games in my homebrew collection at the moment, and one of them is mine... :/

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry, I hadn't played it.  If you can play the game and the rules are all there, then it's effectively equivalent to the many commercial implementations.  Tetris didn't have that much to it to begin with. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
After giving it a try, I'd say it's more focused on novelty value than actual playability, and that tends to make it more demo-like.  But technically speaking, the game is there in its entirety.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm so there's not much in the way of a showcase for GBA games as such?
<br/>
<br/>
To mods: How about a showcase board on this forum where people can post screenshots and links of their creations?
<br/>
<br/>
They do similar things on the forums at <a href="http://www.darkbasicpro.com..." target="_blank">www.darkbasicpro.com...</a> Works really well...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well take a look at last year's compo entries. That should give you a good idea. And there are a couple of demos around here that are quite good too.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
