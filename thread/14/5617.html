    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">basically I want the gameboy to calculat the speeds of a ball and a wheel and the momentum of the ball and when It will fall into the wheel and what area of the wheel it will fall into when it does fall.
<br/>
kinda like that big ass thing those guys made in the 70's for roulette.
<br/>
with a wireless game link and another game boy set up to play a sound or just say the numbers where it should land.
<br/>
I think I would have enought power to do it cause well a home built computer from the 70's did. But you guys would know better than me
<br/>
I have been wanting to learn C for a while maybe greed will be the motivation I needed :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Learn how to do it in C console first before even thinking about doing it for the GBA.. You have a lot less power on the GBA to calculate a simulation like that then on a PC, and if you cant do it on a PC, well......<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And if you need graphics to make the output of the simulation, use the Allegro library. That's what I started on before I learned the GBA.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
-- You know, the human.
