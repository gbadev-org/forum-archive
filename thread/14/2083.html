    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's weird going from OpenGL to GBADev.  I comprehend all of the simple stuff, like pallettes, buffers, etc.  What I am having a problem doing though, is deciding what Mode to work in.  The game is basically a more intensely graphical tetris.
<br/>
There are more going to be more sprites to render than standard tetris, so I'm worried that speed may become an issue.  I'm assuming that Modes0-2 are out, because this isnt really a tile-based-game, in the general sense of the term.  I'm thinking that Mode3 or Mode4 are the best choices.  It'd be nicer to run in Mode3, for higher detail, due to unpalletized color, but, I have no idea how well the GBA will be able to handle all that memory copying.  Any ideas on whether Mode3 is worth a chance, or should i just plan on Mode4 from the get-go?
<br/>
Other question: Is memory copying just as fast as actually loading a sprite into the designated sprite area in memory?  I'd rather retain control of everything, if I can do it without speed loss.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any information,
<br/>

If you don't have too many changing graphics you can do it in one of the bitmapped modes. Otherwise, do use a "text" background mode. You can use sprites for the blocks, and if the have fallen, draw the same sprite on a text background instead of keeping it all as sprites.<br/>_________________<br/>If everything fails, read the manual: If even that fails, post on forum!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm only a newbie to GBA developpement but I would go with mode 3 to do a tetris game.  Your background can be a full 16 bpp bitmap and you can use 256 colors sprites for your blocks.<br/>_________________<br/>Visit SR-388 now and get a 40% discount!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
