<br/>
<br/>
I am new in emulation, i wanted to write a GBA Emu,
<br/>
I can code the CPU, RAM etc..
<br/>
<br/>
But i dont know how to draw the sprites of a ROM Image when
<br/>
I load it. How is it possible to draw the sprites??
<br/>
<br/>
I use MSVC++6.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's easy enough.  ;)  Draw them via DirectDraw, SDL, OpenGL, Direct3D, or even the Windows GDI.  Same way you would normally draw a sprite.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your Reply!! :)
<br/>
<br/>
Could you give me some examples??
<br/>
If possible in Windows GDI and/or OpenGL.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe posting or looking on the web for some examples or forums specifically for WindowsGDI, OpenGL, or Direct3D would help you out more than on a GBA dev forum.  Obviously you are making a GBA emu but asking someone for examples of a PC API, like Direct3D, does not belong or fit on this forum.  Would resemble someone going to a bread shop and asking for information on the different kinds of donuts there are at a nearby donut shop.
<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To program an emulator, you must first know how to both program a game on the system you are emulating, and how to program a game on the system you are intending to write the emulator for.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a pretty basic question actually.  I would seriously rethink the idea of writing an emulator if you don't have that information.  An emulator is a difficult project, and it is not recommended for newer programmers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
