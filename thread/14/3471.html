    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, since I started coding for the gba, I was using devkitadv. I heard about another kit called devkitarm... Is one better than the other? Which one do you guys suggest?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I suggest using devkitarm cause it has a very new version of gcc while devkitadv wasn't updated for a while. 
<br/>
I'm just missing gdb.exe in the devkitarm package which i need to debug within eclipse. Thats the only reason why i'm still using devkitadv.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Insight is provided in the downloads section at devkit.tk. I left this as a separate package as there are 3 versions of the debugger for powerpc, ARM and x86 and I wanted to avoid 3 identical versions of the tcl/tk support code.
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions or requests for DevkitARM are probably best aired on the mailing list, I'll definitely see them there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
