    <h4>#27477 - Spektre - Wed Oct 13, 2004 8:19 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As a step to getting the Xinga sticks operational, I need to be able to console debug and send files to the PC from the gba.  WntrMute's xboo communicator routines appear to be a nice way to do this.  (I have also tried the MBV2 console routines.  They also do not work for me and I must give back my borrowed MBV2 cable soon.)
<br/>
<br/>
I have been unable to use the libgba functions yet.  I can run compiled code using them, and I am able to cleanly compile code including them, but the program hangs upon executing a libgba routine.
<br/>
<br/>
Could someone help me to get this library included into an application in HAM?  The rest of the project is in HAM and I would like to keep it there.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

Off topic: For DevKitARM + Visual Studio, was it easy to setup? When I tried it I couldn't get it to compile as it couldn't find the make.exe. I set the path, but it still didn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
How easy is it to set Visual Studio to clean the directory of object files in your project settings? Is there a template project file available?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Depends on how integrated you want them, how familiar you are with makefiles, and how familiar you are with Visual Studio.  If you only use Visual Studio as a replacement text editor for notepad, then it's trivial.  For a more complete integration, like I have, it's a tad tricky (at the moment) if you don't understand makefiles very well and are new to Visual Studio.
<br/>
<br/>
There's a GBA AppWizard for MSVC 6.0 up in the Tools-&gt;Misc section of the main gbadev.org site, that ..umm... *used to* make it easier, but it's a bit outdated and seems to have been abandoned.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason I said it's a tad tricky "at the moment" a few lines above, is that I'm currently working on a new GBA AppWizard that should make the combination of DevKitARM + Visual Studio *very* easy for anyone.  (Hopefully as easy as HAM, but I've never used HAM, so I don't really know) Right now I'm doing it for MSVC/Visual Studio 6.0, and I hope to have that in a releasable form within about a week (But given my track record for getting stuff finished, it could end up taking longer).  Once I get that out I'll work on a (much needed) version for Visual Studio .NET, I'm guesstimating about two weeks for that.
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which (and this is even further off-topic, I apologise), is there an installer anyone recommends? I plan to look into both InstallShield and Nullsoft's NSIS.

I haven't quite figured that out yet.  What I've been doing in the rare cases I need to do that is either run the makefile's clean from the command line, or just delete the object files manually.  I'm guessing that, as is usually the case, it would probably be easier to get Visual Studio .NET to do that than VS 6.0.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Visual Studio 6.0 is my main IDE. The reason I want to use it for GBA programming is for its support for Visual Assist. I'm not very experiences with makefiles, though.
<br/>
<br/>
A GBA Appwizard for DevKitARM would be really cool. I tried the older version that works with DevKitAdvance, but I'd like to use the updated DevKitARM, if possible. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
