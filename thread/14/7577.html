    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A multi-task program would be great in one of my concepts and one of my friend's already functional game of Bejeweled.  This would be great if there were one that was user-friendly, but if not, what should we do?

Would it be possible to make a multi-task program if there is not one?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What capabilities do you want out of a multi-task program? Do you want multiple programs to be able to share the CPU time and the display and the sound, sending input to the frontmost task's layer? Either way, you're going to have to write programs that are specifically aware of your multi-task system.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DoYouHowDo friend. I would recommend creating sort of a function that can, based on an array value, carry out a command. Then, your multitasking mask cound pass down the arrays of your programs and handle commands from them one at a time. The downside here is that you almost have to create your own language for this to work. You could set it up with a multidimentional array where dimension 1 handles the actual command and dimension 2+ and onward handles variables passed to the command. Your multitask function would do the work of decoding the crud and excecuting the commands, based on the array values.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, all you have to do is set up a compiler to write the arrays for you, using your own names for commands and such. 
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know, it's not easy my method, but at least it would work. It would also be rather slow...<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
