    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You need to at least have a grasp of programming in a language before diving into the gba. Most members would suggest to learn BASIC or PASCAL first then go into C/C++ although others may suggest otherwise.

You should as long as necessary learning the language of C/C++ as needed to get to an adept level enough to program on the GBA.. maybe a couple of solid months should do it...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you have no programming experience whatsoever and want to learn HOW to program (which is very different from what language you program in) I would recommend picking up an entry level CompSci textbook.
<br/>
<br/>
I can recommend "C: How To Program" by Deitel/Deitel.  You will learn the fundamentals of structured programming and the C language itself at the same time so you'll be killing two birds with one stone.  Towards the end of the book (the last 4-5 chapters or so) it delves into C++ as a 'better' C as well.  Very well written, lots of examples, covers the standard library and a whole bunch of other stuff.  Not all of it of course is directly applicable to the GBA but you can use all of it when you learn how to program on the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.

Four convicts are buried feet first up to thier necks and are all facing the wall and are wearing a black or white cap.
<br/>
<br/>
The warden says if they can guess correctly the colour of thier cap within a minute. 10 sec later a convict does.
<br/>
<br/>
Question: Who was it and how did the convict know?
<br/>
<br/>
They cannot see round, through, over etc the wall.
<br/>
They cannot see the colour of thier own cap.
<br/>
They cannot see behind them, only the convicts in front of them and the wall.
<br/>
They know that there are 2 black caps and 2 white caps.
<br/>
The convicts are not allowed to communicate with each other.

IT's a purely logical question and the answer isn't a stupid one (eg. One has X ray vision)

If the reply was instant, it would be 1 noting that 2 and 3 were wearing the same coloured cap, therefore he would be wearing the alternate colour.
<br/>
As the reply was delayed, I believe it was 2 noting that because 1 didn't answer, his (2) and 3's caps must be different colours. Therefore, if his (2) and 3's caps are different colours, then 2 can correctly identify the colour of his own cap as it is not the colour of 3's cap.

Some people on this board need a serious reality check. Not everyone thinks the same way you do, and if you happen to possess the natural ability to translate language into logic and use logic for deduction, you shouldn't take it for granted that everyone is able to do so.
<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of things out there that a lot of people find obvious that you will never be able to grasp, and I don't think you'd appreciate them calling you an idiot because you can't tell a complementary colour from a triad colour, or happen to know the difference between a comparison argument and a contrasting argument, or if you've strained a muscle or sprained a ligament.
<br/>
<br/>
(Incidentally, all three of those are things that are obvious to me just from looking at a colour, essay or injured person. Are they obvious to you? If not, I sure hope you're not mentally handicapped.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think there's a near-fundamental difference between Dan's examples and the crate problem.  The crate problem does not require knowledge of any special domain.  Besides the concept of weight (which any child can intuitively understand), it relies only on basic deduction.  Hell, you don't even have to know what "deduction" means.
<br/>
<br/>
To make the point more concrete: A person who grows up in isolation will definitely not be able to distinguish the things that Dan mentioned, but they will probably be able to solve the crate problem, even if you can't present the problem to them in English and they won't be able to respond verbally.  Put them in a situation that requires them to solve the problem and they will almost certainly do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As this involves to real world reference and just letters, many people would not "get it."  Members of my family cannot do algerbra because of the letters thing.  They cannot think of a letter as a number nor any other thing besides a letter.  This ability to manipulate abstract symbols and compare, analyze, and order them is the most basic skill that is needed for programming.

Can you harmonize with a melody? Can you pat your head, rub your stomach and hop on one foot simultaneously? Can you pick up a language just by hearing it spoken?

<br/>
All skills that some people are more naturally apt to than others. All skills that some people will use constantly in their every day life (maybe not so much the second one), and others will barely ever touch.
<br/>
<br/>
The human brain is not even capable of much in the way of deductive reasoning until it reaches what's known as its operational stage, around 8 to 10 years old for most people. Just because it's a skill that's been nurtured in you and that you've practiced since childhood, does not make it logical to expect the same in others.
<br/>
<br/>
Assuming that because that particular skill isn't sharp the person must lack intelligence, is to me the indicator of the kind of narrow-mindedness that often breeds itself well amongst bodies with a knack for logical technique. The irony is glaring... at least, it should be for most people.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Agreed that people have a harder time when problems are presented abstractly.
<br/>
<br/>
Musical talent and funny physical tricks don't tend to be applicable to a wide range of problems, and "intelligence" usually implies something a bit broader (if not well-defined).
<br/>
<br/>
Learning languages is an interesting example.  At no age can humans learn a natural language just by hearing it spoken, but normal children can effortlessly learn them by interacting with a native speaker of any language.  If they cannot do this, they are considered impaired.  Adults aren't considered impaired if they can't do it.
<br/>
<br/>
The example shows what I meant when I said a person might be impaired if they couldn't solve the crate problem.  It's about the capabilities that people are expected to have.
<br/>
<br/>
There is no logical error in expecting a child to be able to learn a language, even if there's no guarantee that they will.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: It might be unwise for me to expect most people to be able to solve the crate problem, but that's why I asked if I was overestimating people.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
