<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to build a home-made cart reader that will read GBA game and save information from an original cartridge? If so, where can I get the info?
<br/>
<br/>
There have been sources on the web with instruction, but they are not in English, and they require many electronic components, and babelfish cannot precisely translate the documents.
<br/>
<br/>
I checked on the web, and the Flash2Advance USB linker seems to me to be the best and, more importantly, the most affordable, solution.Can it be made at home for a low price? Does anyone know where I can obtain detailed instructions for making it? Are there complex electronics involved in making it? I ask this because it is smaller and looks simpler than the other cart readers (It <span style="font-style: italic">can</span> read game and save data from original carts, right?) - and, Pok?mon has only one save slot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You might find it easier to buy the MBV2 cable and dump carts and saves through that.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The F2A linker is $US9 cheaper than the MBV2. Can the MBV2 dump carts? I read the MBV2 FAQs, and it says (on lik-sang's page) that the MBV2 doesn't support the dumping of games, but I read (on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devrs.com/gba/files/gbadevfaqs.php" target="_blank">http://www.devrs.com/gba/files/gbadevfaqs.php</a> that game saves can be dumped from carts to PCs using the MBV2. Which is better/easier to use - the MBV2 or the F2A cable?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The MBV2 can dump carts, but slowly. The feature is undocumented in the mb.exe helpscreen, but it's still there:<ul><li>insert cart in GBA</li><li>turn on GBA while holding Start+Select</li><li>mb -1 pirates.gba -w 200</li></ul>
<br/>
The MBV2 can, of course, read a cart's SRAM and flash save and write SRAM save. (I'm not so sure about writing flash save or reading or writing serial EEPROM.)
<br/>
<br/>
I have never tried the F2A cable, but if you like GUI tools, it may be a better bet.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
