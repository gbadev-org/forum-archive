    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a tutorial on basic communications in normal mode, or some example code?
<br/>
<br/>
All I want to do is send a byte from the master to the slave GBA, and having tried the only normal mode code I can find (downtou's), the code doesn't work (the slave simply doesn't finish the transfer and sits there, apparently transferring, the master finishes).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

With multiplayer I can only get around 20 bytes/frame transferred, as far as I know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Normal mode over GBA cables is open-loop, meaning that there's no chance for GBAs 2-4 to request a retransmission if a packet's CRC is busted. And some people don't read the manual properly and thus expect normal mode to work bidirectionally over GBA cables.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
