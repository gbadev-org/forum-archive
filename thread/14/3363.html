<br/>
I'm a total rookie at Gameboy Dev it so I don't really know how I'm gonna start just yet. I got a webpage - <a href="http://www.runemappers.cjb.net" target="_blank">http://www.runemappers.cjb.net</a> but it isn't for GBA development of any kind, its just for UED and stuff like that, but I'm kinda tired of using UED, so I'm looking into making gameboy stuff.
