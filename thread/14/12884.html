    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So.. I have never touched  a code in my life &gt;.&lt;  Infact I am still unsure what flash to buy.
<br/>
<br/>
So I am positive at my skill level I can't do this.  But, Is it possible to put an mmorpg on gba? I'm not looking for Guildwars on the ds.. I know thats going to be a while before we see something like that on a hand held.. but, I am wondering if maybe maplestory could be available on the ds? heck I think it would be cool to see even maybe runescape..
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on the possibility of seeing those games on ds?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You speak about GBA and DS, but I assume you mean just the DS? Because the GBA has no networking hardware that would make an MMORPG possible.
<br/>
<br/>
For the DS, it is possible. However, it will probably be done by homebrewers, since Nintendo doesn't like anything else but Friendcodes. Think of all the poor kids who would somehow hear/read messages like "fuck! shit! penis!"<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It would take homebrew longer than September.  Not enough people hours.

I think they are more afraid of the consequences of creepy people asking things like this:
<br/>
"How old are you?"
<br/>
"Where are you?"
<br/>
"Do you like &lt;something&gt;?"
<br/>
"Can you meet me at the park on &lt;day:time&gt;?"

Nintendo doesn't want anything to do with those kinds of scenarios.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT:</span>  Yet it is possible with picto chat.  Not that anyone I know actually uses picto chat.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Penny Arcade made an amusing reference to that. If this pedophile is driving down the road with Pictochat open and he comes within range of your car and your kid is also using Pictochat*, he could manipulate them. Except with one hand holding the DS and one on the wheel, what the heck is he writing with? (You guessed it. &lt;_&lt;)

Exactly.  If Pokemon had an exposed chat feature I suppose it would be dangerous.

I think it depends on who they are related to.  If cool older brother/sister is playing something, sibling wants try it too.  Are they and good at it?  I don't know.

I could see some homebrewers doing it, but it's a long shot. MMOs combine all the complications of an RPG with the technical difficulties of an online game and add complications of their own. There have been homebrew MMOs for the PC, so it's possible, but not many projects have made it to compleation. Many more have been started than have ever been finished.

<br/>
<br/>
It's not so much a matter of what's doable, but a matter of the time and effort involved. MMOs are the big thing in gaming right now, so a lot of would be developers try to make one, often as their first real game, dispite having no idea how difficult it is. Then they never finish.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd say that if you had a team that had the time and dedication, it could be done. Such a complex game requires a lot of time and effort, but if you've got the manpower and/or time, it's not impossible. Having or aquiring some knowledge of network coding would be a requirement also.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd wager that a traditional RPG MMO would be doable also. It's simply a large complex project. But groups have made many homebrew programs that are also very complex, such as Linux, Apache, the Gimp, and many others.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is seriously considering such a project, I'd be interested in helping with the server side code. I've got a project of my own to write an MMORPG (for PCs), but it's been put on hold because of the effort involved. I'd like to work on something of the sort again, preferably with a team, rather than attempting it solo (which is very hard).
<br/>
<br/>
In the end, an MMO is simply a MUD with a prettier interface. Almost all MUDs are homebrews. The effort involved is much greater, but it is definetly possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
