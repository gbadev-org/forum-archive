    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks to Scott Lininger, I've got multiboot working, in multiplayer mode (1). But sending a 256 KB ROM in this mode is awfully slow. However - it works, which is of course a start.
<br/>
<br/>
But, I've seen a bit of info about the normal mode (0) being the best mode to use.. however, I can't get it to work. It seems to have a very small chance of a successful transaction happening, in which case it sends the ROM and boots perfectly, but about 95% of the time it doesn't even start the transfer, and crashes without even displaying the "nintendo" text on the slave GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
I am using Scott Lininger's code almost exactly, except for this:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">Multiboot(&amp;mp,1);
<br/>
   /*asm volatile(
<br/>
      "ldr r0,=mp\n"
<br/>
      "mov r1,#1\n"
<br/>
      "swi 0x25\n"
<br/>
      ::: "r0","r1","r2","r8","r9","r10","r11","r12"
<br/>
   );*/</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I commented out the asm volatile section because it gave me a "value too big" error for =mp. My Multiboot function is just as swi call, and works fine with mode 1. But as soon as I try Multiboot(&amp;mp,0); I get problems such as I've described before.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone help?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, regardless of mode, I occasionally get a crash upon what I think is completed transfer - the nintendo logo stops flashing and goes yellow, and nothing. This seems to have eased off for now, but I hate random stuff like this, 'cause you know it'll pop up and bite you in the ass later. Anyone seen this kind of thing before?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch =P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
