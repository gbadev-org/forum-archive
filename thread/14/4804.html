    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just brought a flash cart just so I can try out gba development.  Right now, though, I'm worry that I could mess up my gba or cart while debugging.  So, is there anything like memory leaks that I should be concern about that and test out completely before trying it out on the gba?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Generally no, you can't hurt your GBA through code. 
<br/>
The only danger I can think of is that I've heard you can blow out your speaker by fiddling with the sound bias register (basically causing a really loud click). I've never heard of it actually happening to anyone though, and normally there's no need to change it anyway.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The loud click of suddenly changing the bias register is no louder than each edge of a half-scale (-64..64) PCM square wave. Before the PCM FIFOs were reduced to a simple explanation, there were demos that played (unsigned 9-bit) audio through DMA to the bias register.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
