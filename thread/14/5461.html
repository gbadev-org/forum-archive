    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok..i have one problem...(yes i know, another one)
<br/>
<br/>
i can't add more data for new sprites!!!!
<br/>
<br/>
my data for the sprites is gettin' bigger, but now when i add (just add, i dont even use that data in my code) more data and compile my screen goes black, or the other sprites seems like garbage...
<br/>
<br/>
but i repeat..i dont even use that data in my code!!!!
<br/>
<br/>
my ROM size is 200 kb actually
<br/>
i have differents headers for diferents kind of sprites...(maybe ten at this time)..should i use just one big header???
<br/>
<br/>
ahhh...and just a few days ago I found a problem...when i compiled my code, the sprite for the food went all wrong and i solve this changing the data from one header to another...
<br/>
<br/>
really, why is this??? 
<br/>
thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
