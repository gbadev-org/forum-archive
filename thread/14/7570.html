    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A friend of mine had what I thought to be a pretty good idea. He wants to write a windows shell for the GBA that would basically replace the standard gameboy logo. He alread has some code down, and from the looks of things, at least in cart form, it is going to be good. My question is: is it even possible to create your own bios for the GBA? (that way, you would be able to change carts and things without making the GBA go mad.) Just a thought...<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So it's possible to read it, but not write to it? Darn. But wait! There might be another way. Is there some way to get the GBA to allow a cart change? Like possibly copying a piece of code to RAM and executing that untill the cart change was over?<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sure - you can get tge GBA to run code in RAM w/o a cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know this, but I will need it to do both. (or, rather, he will.) I want the one (1) gameboy to be able to basically switch between a multiboot mode and a cart mode without having to reset. Is it possible?<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
