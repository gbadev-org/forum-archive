either write things worth reading

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The answer is pretty simple:
<br/>
A) Your contents are legal and unthreatening. -&gt; Nothing happens
<br/>
B) Your contents are illegal and under the radar OR unthreatening. -&gt; Nothing happens
<br/>
C) Your contents are legal and threatening. -&gt; You'll probably receive a groundless cease and disist letter
<br/>
D) You contents are illegal and worth paying attention to. -&gt; You'll be shut down.
<br/>
<br/>
PDROMs falls under A (probably).  Starmen.net is a B.  Don't know of any Cs, as they probably fold.  Commercial ROM sites are Ds.
<br/>
<br/>
Even if you steal graphics (not a good idea) and make a free demo, chances are fair that you won't be bothered even though the copyright holders can shut you down.  As long as you know that there is a line in the sand, if you are careful you won't step over it.  (And if you do it won't be in a big way.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They care about anything they think they can make money from.  Nintendo certain isn't going to do anything if you pirate one of Capcom's games.  (Nor am I sure that they really can).
