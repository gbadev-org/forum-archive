    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi.  I've had a ton of pixel issues with the DS since I first purchased one last year.  I recently bought a Japanese graphite import from the Nintendo World Store in Manhattan, and I've got a bunch of stuck pixels on the top screen.  I asked around on a livejournal community, and someone commented the following:
<br/>
<br/>
"there is a color cycling application called LCD TESTER that was designed to fix dead pixels. I've used it once on my friends DS and it worked just as it should. I left it on overnight with the app running, and all 3 dead pixels were corrected when I woke up. grab it here: <a href="http://nintendo-ds.dcemu.co.uk/lcdtester.shtml" target="_blank">http://nintendo-ds.dcemu.co.uk/lcdtester.shtml</a>
<br/>
<br/>
(passme/flashme/wifime required)"
<br/>
<br/>
To use such an application, exactly which pieces would I need?  I'm not familiar with programming, but I've been trying to read up on the pass me, flash me, wifi me stuff.  Can anyone help me out and give me a shove in the easiest (and cheapest) direction?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think this account is wholly correct, as these things don't to my knowledge fix dead pixels, but stuck ones.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know on my DS, I have a single color on a pixel that is stuck on blue for the entire time that screen is on. I tried using this program and left my DS on for a number of hours, but it didn't seem to fix it.
<br/>
<br/>
As people are bouncing around "dead" and "stuck", which kind of pixels is this supposed to fix? The ones that "don't" light up, or the ones that "stay" lit, or perhaps both?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just out of curiousity (I'm not disputing that it may work), what is the physical basis for these fixes? How exactly do they fix the stuck pixels?
<br/>
<br/>
I know that pixels in a TFT LCD screen (like on the GBA &amp; NDS) have an individual transistor for each sub pixel. When a pixel is dead, the transistor never switches on. When it is stuck, the transistor is malfunctioning or there is an incorrect connection. So how does repeated voltage cycling through the transistor fix it?
<br/>
<br/>
... of course, I am talking out of my behind here, so correct me if I'm wrong.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, let's assume I don't have a flash cartridge. Is it possible to send the program over a wifi connection to the ds? (If it has to be a ds rom, is there one?)<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
