    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well i don't know about your error message, but a little detail is that when your GBA boot up, hold select-start key to boot it in multiboot mode, then try to transfer your Rom with your program. If it's something else then i don't know, i use the parallel version, not usb.<br/>_________________<br/>-Inside every large program is a small program struggling to get out.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've had a similar problem once but it happened not after I took it out of the box but after I had had it for a while. What it was was that the edge connector on it wasn't clean entirely it had a but of 'fluf' inside once I got rid of that it picked it up every time. Maybe you have a similar problem but if it hasen't worked at all since you bought it then it's probably fualty. I hope you kept/printed of the reciept.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
