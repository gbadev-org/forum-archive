    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Which compiler is everyone using (armsdk, gcc, DevKit Advance, etc)?
<br/>
Is one better suited for running apps on an actual gba (not emulator)?
<br/>
<br/>
Are they all just interchangable or is the compiler you choose dependent 
<br/>
on the sound library you use (directsound, Krawall, fras, maso)?
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of sound, Ive read about using (not using) Bios Calls what 
<br/>
does this mean? Whats  preferred?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!

<br/>
p.s. Is there a memory map for the GBA that shows where SRAM, 
<br/>
flash, etc?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Someone will correct me on this since I think DevKitAdvance can be used with other languages as well.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

...like nearly every compiler does.

bios calls are very usefull sometimes, but I don't believe that they are very fast, since bios sounds like an non-cpu-internal component to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Everything but EWRAM, cart ROM, and cart SRAM are inside the "CPU AGB" package, operating without wait states. IWRAM is 32-bit with no wait state, and so is the BIOS. Even the 16-bit VRAM is on the same die as the ARM core and has an average wait state of less than one cycle for CPU access. Yes, you heard right: VRAM is faster than EWRAM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
