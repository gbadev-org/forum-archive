    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I am just learning the ways of programming the GBA and am just getting onto maps.
<br/>
<br/>
I have been attempting to use a piece of software called GBAMapEditor by Warder1 however, i get this message:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">"Failed to load control 'CommonDialog' from COMDLG32.ocx. Your version of COMDLG32.OCX may be outdated make sure you are using the version of the control that was provided with your application."</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else had this problem? How did you solve it?
<br/>
<br/>
Or,
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone suggest a decent map editor to use?
<br/>
<br/>
Thankyou,
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Looks like it's a fairly common file to be "missing".
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that is helpful. :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks for the reply scott.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, it seems that i have the file, i use win98 but i also checked the program on WinXP to see if there were any differences between the two files and i still get the same error. 
<br/>
<br/>
Its stumped me a little because i thought replacing the file with another up to date one would solve the error but no joy i am afraid. Also d/l'd one through the google filesearch, it didn't work.

<br/>
Bit of a bugger really!<br/>_________________<br/>You lost today, kid. But that doesn't mean you have to like it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry Scott,
<br/>
<br/>
I tried that google search link and gave the first result a second whirl - this time i followed the instructions though! 
<br/>
<br/>
Yup, It worked - thanks for the help!!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks cearn! - there is some really useful stuff on that page - i've bookmarked your map editor and the nessie one in case i start having issues with the maps i create. BTW: your map editor looks like on of the best i've seen out of the ones i've been through. 
<br/>
<br/>
(Thanks to everyone that has helped btw - this looks like a really friendly forum and i am looking forward to using it more in future.)<br/>_________________<br/>You lost today, kid. But that doesn't mean you have to like it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well...well...you're talking about maps...
<br/>
<br/>
let me tell you..im using now the GBAMapEditor and everything's fine...at least when i use single tiles..when i use the 16*16 tiles the map screws everything!!! and when i try to use the block selection happens the same.
<br/>
so, i have to build my maps 1 tile at time...besides that is a excellent mapeditor and converter...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
well..but i don't want map editors right now..i want a tool who converts the map into tiles...this coz' im using a charbaseblock and it only let me use 256 tiles (coz im using a 256 palette) that's mean a map of 16*16 different tiles...but what if i have a map of 32*32 tiles or 1024 diferent tiles...in fact there's not 1024 different tiles but maybe 200...that's why i wanna a tool that given a map returns the differents 8*8 tiles..
<br/>
<br/>
i hope i made myself clear..if not..im sorry that's is the best i can do!
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ghost Leinad - as i am new to this and just learning about maps i am not sure if this does what you request, you might need to separate the data out of the header file it creates or something but in theory it creates tiles out of a map, or any bitmap. (i think!)

<br/>
<br/>
I have given that AGB convert a whirl now and it doesn't quite work for me. I think I may have the same problem as you...i'm trying to convert a fairly large bitmap into separate tiles but i can't find a way to do it.<br/>_________________<br/>You lost today, kid.
