    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone, this is my first post as I am new to nds development. Ive been messing with libnds and reading everything I can find, but I have a couple questions.
<br/>
Im writing a simple 2d space game to learn the nds, I want both screens to act as one big screen for both backgrounds and sprites and I want the bg to scroll. I was able to get a scrolling bg working but its 2 256x256 images, one on each screen. and its not perfect since the screen is 192 high instead of 256.
<br/>
Whats the proper way to do 1 lg screen, should I be using 1 or 2 images for the background?
<br/>
should I use mode 6 for lg bitmap? will my sprites be able to go from screen1 to screen2 seamlessly? thanks for answering my beginner questions, I did search the forum and couldnt find the answer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for reply, I managed to get a scrolling background on both screens with 2 images, but to scale to screen height(192) I did this: </span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">SUB_BG3_YDY = 340;</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> instead of </span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">SUB_BG3_YDY = 1 &lt;&lt; 8;</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> not sure why 340 works but it does.

Also I managed to get a sprite to show on both screens, but I want it to go from one to the other, is there a proper way to do this? do I need to make one sprite hidden when it shouldnt be shown? something like, if (sprite on main screen posY &gt; SCREEN_HEIGHT) hide main sprite and show sub sprite?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'll tell you why it works. To shrink 256x256 down to 256x192, every 4 lines of the image need to scale to 3 screen lines, and 4/3 = 1.333. The scale factor your program uses is 340/256 = 1.328, which is close enough.

Pretty much. To hide a sprite on the GBA or DS, mark it as unused by writing a special value 512 to attribute 0 of the OAM entry. This value is called ATTR0_DISABLED in libnds and libgba. (Technically, this value turns on the double-size bounding box for rot/scale without turning on rot/scale itself, and the 2D core recognizes this as a signal to just ignore the sprite.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
