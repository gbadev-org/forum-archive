    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using MapEd v0.99 to convert my maps and tileset into header files that I use in my GBA game. Its working fine if my tileset have at most 16 colors.
<br/>
<br/>
But when I use a tileset with more than 16 colors, then all the colors is wrong when using the maps and tiles in my game.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using text backgrounds with 16 color palettes. But can't MapEd convert so the tiles uses the correct palette for specific tiles? Or do I have to use 256 color mode?
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any other Map editor that can handle this correctly? I've also tried mirach but it seems to have the same problem. Or I'm not using it correctly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">IIRC, MapEd expects BMPs saved in 256 color format, <span style="font-weight: bold">however</span> you can only use 16 of those color.  Then again, I recall that it autodetects palettes tiles that are the same except for the palette.  Maybe those were different tile sets.  Try a 16 color image saved in 256 color format.  MapEd is a little fussy about certain things.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, it does work if I only use 16 colors. But I want to use up to 256 colors in the same map using 16 color mode. Shouldn't that be possible? Each tile have an setting to see which one of those 16 palettes to use. So the map editor have to choose which tiles that needs to use another palette.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a map editor that can do this?
<br/>
<br/>
I can probably do it manually, by using several maps that each have a set of tileset that uses a certain 16 color palette, then using the 'tile index offset' in MapEd for each map. After that I can merge all maps by manually using the copy/paste method. But this takes too much time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What I do in my current game:
<br/>
<br/>
In my source graphic, use 16 color mode.
<br/>
In the map editor, use a different copy of that source graphic that uses 256 colors, so I can see everything easily.
<br/>
<br/>
When I build, I have a step that automatically applies the correct palette to each tile, based on data about which tiles should have which palette.
<br/>
<br/>
This means that each tile can only have 1 palette, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've used MapEd extensively and it has some quirks you need to work with.  (Intermap copy paste doesn't work.  That caused problems.  The author wasn't expecting that.  =)
