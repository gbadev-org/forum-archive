    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I checked it, and it looks smooth. Try adjusting your emulator's frameskip. If you have at least a 1 GHz PC, you can set frameskip=0 and automatic=Off and it'll work. Sometimes you can get no$gba to work with less frameskip than VBA.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

my specs: 1,8 ghz, 1Gb RAM, Geforce 6200, no frameskip, no automatic, tho, it's not perfectly smooth....

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if your monitor's referesh rate is not 60hz (or an integer multiple of it), then whether you are using double buffering, double buffering with vsynch, triple buffering, no buffering, or satan magic, there's no way to get around studdering in an emulator.  For example, every other frame will be displayed for twice as long if your refresh rate is 90hz, and a 1 2 2 3 4 4 5 6 6... pattern will be percieved as studdering.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, something similar is used in the cinema-&gt;home dvd pulldown, and that stuff doesn't look too bad, right?  I didn't mean to exclude the possibility of somewhat overcoming the refresh rate issue with clever filtering; but I haven't seen anything of the like that pulled off in console emulators; most just have "normal", "blurry", and "uber blurry" post processing effects.
<br/>
<br/>
But it sounds like a really good idea.  I've put it at the bottom of the todo list for my GBA emulator.  ;)  I'm using opengl for output, so it would just be a question of holding two consecutive frames in different textures and then figuring an alpha between them based on the screen refresh rate, and letting the hardware do the work; doesn't sound too bad.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
