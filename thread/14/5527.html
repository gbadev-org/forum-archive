    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i have been an avid reader of the web comic 8-bit theatre for around two  years and i would lkill to somehow be able to read these on my gba flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps rip them to an e-book?
<br/>
<br/>
if there is anyway at all with my cart please tell me
<br/>
<br/>
thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There probably is a way. It's just a question of how difficult it would be... You could probably just make a gfx viewer and put them all on the flash cart or something... and then just use your program to view them. You might need to resize them or have the ability to move the image around with the touchpad or something though...
<br/>
<br/>
Actually being able to access the 8-bit theatre website from your DS is a good ways off still I think.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well your post brings me hope...
<br/>
<br/>
but if i could just put them on the cart as picture files, how many would i be able to fit with a 256mb cart?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

-- You know, the human.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a program called GBA Jpeg Viewer that builds a .gba binary out of selected .jpgs the same way PocketNES or Goomba builds them from multiple roms.  It has a few useful settings for altering the compression/quality and has pretty fast load times for images when viewed.

I fail to see why you posted this to the DS development board, however.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The link to it is on GBAdev.org, you just need to search for it. Anyways <a class="postlink" href="http://www.caimans.net/gba/" target="_blank">this</a> is the link I think you want. I use it for reading manga on the go and it works great.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
