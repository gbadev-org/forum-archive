    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've programmed for Gameboy, Gameboy color, and the TI83+. All of them, as you probably know, use z80. I want to learn ARM assembly, but the FAQ didn't mention the differences on asm for the DS. I know it has 2 processors, and that would take some getting used to. What should I know about the differences between asm for the DS and the GBA?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Both processors can use ARM7 instructions and ARM7 Thumb instructions. There are a few extra instructions on the ARM9, but as a beginner, you don't need to use them.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
