    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not sure if it was posted before, but I USED the search engine a few times before i posted this.
<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I'm a beginner and I've done:
<br/>
O Setting the environment (did I misspell it?)
<br/>
O Making some demos (different coloured bg, some sprite stuff etc.)
<br/>
O Messing with the demos (a lot!)
<br/>
<br/>
I came up with some quite good demos. I don't understand a few things in some of them. Mainly sprites. I made an almost complete Tron Clone (no second player, no AI. I know how to do it though) in Mode 3.
<br/>
<br/>
NOW to the question:
<br/>
<span style="color: green">Do you know any tutorial on how to make a platform game for GBA (from the Ground Up would be great)?</span>
<br/>
It would be good if it focused on the sprites, too.

This is the tonc tutorials; taking you through different hardware features and methods. I recommend looking at this to learn the gameboy; but for game programming there are various articles on that, and other areas.
<br/>
<br/>
Someone else will (hopefully) post you more information on what else you need to learn to get started; I have listed it a couple of times but am leaving my house soon.

<br/>
the crash course i have completed (you can say so), the TONC I have seen. Most of the tutorials listed there I saw.
<br/>
<br/>
OF COURSE, I'm gonna' read them again, because I'm gonna read it TONS of times 'till I understand everything :D

<br/>
Just wandered if I can get a tutorial focusing on making a platform game, not a pong.

You add this for the first sprite. but what to put in the question marks if it's 32x64 and I want to add another (forgot the formula)?

<br/>
<br/>
Another problem is: how to plot (write) pixels in mode4?

If those two are answered, I can wait 'till I read those tuts again (I mean those two are my main problem).

16-color or 32-color? In the tile numbering system used by OAM attribute 2, a 16-color sprite will use one sprite cel VRAM slot per 8x8 pixels; a 256-color sprite will use two slots per 8x8 pixels. Once you know which slot your sprite will start at, use this macro to convert the tile number to a destination address for your memcpy:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">#define SPR_VRAM(tn) ((u32 *)(0x06010000 | ((tn) &lt;&lt; 5)))</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Then confirm your choice by loading both sprite cels into VRAM and checking VBA's tile viewer.

You have to plot them two at a time. If you want to plot only one pixel, you have to use a read-modify-write on a single 16-bit word. I think most of the tutorials cover mode 4.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

OAM consists of 128 entries, each of which describes a sprite to be displayed. Sprite cel VRAM consists of 1024 entries, each 32 bytes in size. (Only entries 512-1023 are usable in modes 3, 4, and 5.) In order to give the best explanation of the macro, I need to know how much you know about OAM attribute 2 and what you didn't understand of the tutorials' explanations of OAM attribute 2.

Is there a specific reason that you want to start out with mode 4 and not one of the tiled modes?

I dunno' much about the difference, but I think that 256 is better than 16. And now I made some good graphics for the game and I certainly need many colors in it. Here's the sprite:

I would like to learn some tiled modes (I think metroid was made in one of them) because I think I could do a MR. Driller clone in them and that's what I want to do now (oh how quick I change my mind...). Just I learn better if I have a tutorial heading towards creating that kind of game (platform game). If you think that's too much for me I could use a space shooter tut too. I wanted to plot a pixel in mode 4 because I was learning M4 recently and made a menu in it.

You can do menus in mode 0 too: make each option 8 or 16 pixels tall, draw the options as 16-color tiles, and change the palette index for the selected option.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

As Tepples says 256 colors means you have a single pallette for all your sprites. With 16 color sprites you can swap 16 color sections as needed.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Easy. When you convert your artwork to indexed mode, most paint programs will let you specify the number of colors to use. Use 15 if your artwork has an alpha channel (actual transparent holes) or 16 if not. Save as .bmp or some other format that your image converter can use. Then, when you use the image converter, specify that images be converted in 16-color (or 4-bit) mode.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

First learn how the hardware works, then worry about how to apply it in a game. In principle, game design should be independent of the hardware. I'm not even sure if there are tutorials about creating a full platform game (but then I've never really searched for one)

Man, I've learned a lot about gba during the last few days and I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS INDEX 0(!!!!!).

Before posting things like this you could, for example, tell me how this Index 0 works. And I told it was probably a question for later. And I told i had some problems with sprites. And this guy just couldn't resist posting this...

There are various ways to rearrange the palette depending on the application you use for graphics. The normal way is to paint the transparent areas with a color that won't be used in your final palette - magenta is the usual choice for this.
<br/>
<br/>
Usenti has some simple functions which make swapping palette entries a breeze, you can find it in <a class="postlink" href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/index.htm" target="_blank">Cearn Space</a><br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

<br/>
<br/>
With the exception of mode 3 and 5, all GBA graphics use a palette. The pixels (the stuff you put in VRAM; address 0x06000000 and on) don't have color information in them themselves, but just an <span style="font-style: italic">index</span> to the palette. The palette (address 0x05000000 and onward) holds the actual colors; the value in the pixel tells the GBA which color to use. However, if that value is 0, then that pixel is transparent. Right now, it just so happens that palette[0] is black.

<br/>
This is part of what I meant by learning how the hardware works. Remember, you asked

<br/>
For consoles, the hardware is ground level. You need to know the basic things like programming with bitmaps, tiles, palettes, IO registers and how to access memory directly. If you don't, any advanced GBA programming subjects like a full game will be unintelligible anyway. All these things are covered in the tutorials.
<br/>
<br/>
It may be that your bitmap editor doesn't allow you to chose which color goes where (MS-Paint for example). In that case, use another editor.

<br/>
</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">I know tepples already covered this, but I'll add something on the subject. This is also something that falls under 'know the hardware'. Before you can understand what that memcpy-statement means, you need to know what address 0x06014000 is about (it's the address of tile 512; you can't start at tile 0 because it overlaps with part of the frame buffer in bitmap modes), and also know how pixel formats work (16 color=4bits per pixel= half a byte/pixel ; 256 color = 8bpp = 1 byte/pixel), and how to find the total size of a bitmap 32x64 at 8bpp = 32x64 = 2048= 0x800 bytes, so the second sprite data could go into 0x06014800. Of course, it'd be much easier if you just used a macro for that (like tepples showed), or have a memory map based on TILE structs.
<br/>
<br/>
This still wouldn't show the sprite on screen because you'd have to set sprite attributes in OAM and turn on sprites in REG_DISPCNT. This and more is all covered by the tutorials. That's what they're there for, and why I pointed to one.

But it does seem that you are getting ahead of yourself (making demos without understanding them falls in that category). Without a basic understanding of the platform you're working on, a tutorial on an advanced topic like making a full game will only be that much harder because it'll assume you already <span style="font-style: italic">know</span> the basics. And you learn about the basics by (yes, I know this must be getting tiresome) reading the tutorials. If there are specific things in those that you not understand we can help you with that, but a blanket question like "how do I make X work" when it's already covered in detail in tutorials will <span style="font-style: italic">and should</span> get you links to those, or maybe to the FAQ.

There are tutorials on the principles of GBA programming, and probably on platformers (if anyone knows where to find one on platformers, I'd love to know), but none that combine the two subjects.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">The problem started like this:
<br/>
<table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">memcpy( (u16 *)0x06014000, &amp;lchoiceData, sizeof(lchoiceData) );</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">You add this for the first sprite. but what to put in the question marks if it's 32x64 and I want to add another (forgot the formula)?

The size of a bitmap is its width * height * bpp/8. 32x64 at 8bpp is 32*64*8/8= 2048 bytes, so you'd want 0x06014000. It's preferable to use a macro for this so that you don't have to do these calculations manually though.
<br/>
It's also better to think in terms of tiles rather than pixels. 32x64 pixels is 4x8 tiles. But sprite tile-indexing occurs in terms of 4bpp tiles, so you'd have to multiply that value by 2 if you're using 8bpp tiles (<a class="postlink" href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/tonc/regobj.htm#tbl-obj-tids" target="_blank">link</a>). So the number you'd use in tepples' macro is 4x8x2= 64. (<span style="color: blue">FIX: 64+512, because you can't use tiles 0-511 in bitmap modes. Sorry.</span>)
<br/>
You can also map VRAM as tiles and take the addresses that way, like I do  <a class="postlink" href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/tonc/objbg.htm#ssec-img-cbb" target="_blank">here</a>.

Photoshop famously does its palettes backwards, so index 0 looks to be index 255. Because of this, unless you use a 256 colour sprite, you will not get a default index 0. However, this can be easily edited by hand.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks, guys. About that when I said I don't understand TONC:
<br/>
I understand the code for the first demo but I don't understand the description etc. It's just not for me. Dunno' why. "GBA DEV from the Ground-Up" (or something like that) was easier for me.
<br/>
<br/>
Are there any good programs to edit the palette?
<br/>
<br/>
About the tut stuff:
<br/>
I don't want a tutorial on how to make a FULL game in mode 0. Just a tut where I'll learn the basics of gba dev AND make a little map with a player on it. Then it would be soooooo much easier to make a full game.
<br/>
<br/>
Without those days that I was just asleep 24 hours, I program gba only for about 2! I have some time to learn the rest.
<br/>
<br/>
And I didn't say I don't understand my demos.
<br/>
I said I don't understand SOME parts of them.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, I wrote the Tron Clone all by myself and I understand it.
<br/>
<br/>
About what I don't understand in sprites:
<br/>
O I don't understand why attribute 2 is 512
<br/>
O I don't know where I'm copying with the memcpy procedure
<br/>
O Dunno' how the sprites show up on the screen
<br/>
<br/>
BUT I'm sure I'll learn that when the time comes.

There are 1,024 spaces in sprite cel VRAM. A sprite cel uses one or more spaces depending on how large it is. Attribute 2 of each sprite tells which space in sprite cel VRAM that said sprite should use. If you have loaded more than one sprite cel into sprite cel VRAM, you change attribute 2 to draw a different sprite cel.

<br/>
You are copying from ROM (or from EWRAM if you are building multiboot) to the sprite cel VRAM. 0x06014000 happens to be the address of space 512 of sprite cel VRAM. To load a sprite cel into a different space of sprite cel VRAM, use the SPR_VRAM macro that I posted to translate the number of the space of sprite cel VRAM into its address.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
