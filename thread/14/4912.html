    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes I'm seriousAnd I already got those tutorials,The tut_8.zip was useful.
<br/>
But it only has the ovements thing,If theres another with the fighting stuff,the jumping and adding some land instead of always walking on a ground i'd be thankful.
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is a tutorial for DragonBASIC for being able to jump around, however, it's currently coded in a format used with the old version 1.3, doesn't work with 1.4.  I'll be translating it sometime later today when I have time, then I'll load it to the jm-BASIC archives (the main site isn't quite ready yet).<br/>_________________<br/>Current high scores on Super Mario 64 DS:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just sent Tutorial 6 up, mostly deals with adding sound.  It has code for dealing with jumping.  Also, not exactly the best code example, but I only did porting work, not neatness work.  As for irregularity on the ground level, that shouldn't be too difficult to implement.  If I had time, I'd think about making a tutorial 10 which deals with this, but that will (maybe) be a latter time.<br/>_________________<br/>Current high scores on Super Mario 64 DS:

<br/>
But aobut the hitting your opponent and stuff like that?? -_-
<br/>
what about the thing marking your hp and power bars? XD
<br/>
I Think ill just make a fighting game,It'd be much easier instead of programming an Adventure game.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most of that comes down to you... think how a hp bar works and then design the system for it... at the moment you are bordering very close to copying and pasting bits of code together that you dont fully understand...
<br/>
<br/>
for the Hitting you be looking at collision detection
