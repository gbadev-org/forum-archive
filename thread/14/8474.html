It's a shoot it up (not a shoot em up, a shoot it up, because there's only one enemy). it's my first game, it sucks totally.
<br/>
the only thing i want to know:
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cool. Congragulations on finishing your fist demo. The gameplay is pretty smooth, but it is way to slow paced. Speed it up. Shouldn't be hard to do at all. When he turned dark green the demo stopped working. Is that just because it is unfinished or is it a glitch?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">when you manage to shoot the enemy 20 times, it stops.
<br/>
Also, it stops if the enemy touch your plane.
<br/>
It's strange, It doesn't look very smooth to me, althoug I really can't make it smoother, the plane is moving pixel by pixel, just like the other things on screen.
<br/>
The only thing that make them move at diffrents speed is that I "slow" every different moves (the missile move, the plane move, the enemy)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the bullets are not centered because, you know, they come from the left wing, not center.
<br/>
Also, I spell loose because, it's when you really "loose" that's not exactly like "lose"...
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, i'll fix it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
