    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everybody.
<br/>
I'm new to developing for the ds and I've been trying to get started by reading some tutorials.
<br/>
I'm running windows XP, so I have downloaded and installed the devkitPro stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
But I can't get the makefiles to run correctly. They complain about not finding "ds_rules" in my devkitARM dir. This is the line that fails:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">include $(DEVKITARM)/ds_rules</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Just like it says there is no such dir or file and I have no clue to what that's supposed to be. What is missing?
<br/>
<br/>
In another thread I read this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">This installer places files inside folders called 'bin', 'lib', 'include', etc. inside C:\devkitPro\devkitARM\. There should be a file called C:\devkitPro\devkitARM\bin\arm-eabi-gcc.exe.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
My folder structure starts with devkitPro as the root. In there are the "examples", "libgba", "libnds", "msys", etc folders. Not a single one of those mentioned by the quote.
<br/>
Both my DEVKITARM and DEVKITPRO environment variables point to that same devkitPro dir, as well as it being contained in my PATH variable along with the path to the "msys\bin" folder.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who can see something amiss? Thanks a lot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">your DEVKITPRO should point to the base folder of the devkitpro in stall and the DEVKITARM should point to the folder where the ARM code is installed.
<br/>
<br/>
On my machine:
<br/>
<br/>
DEVKITPRO - /c/devkitPro
<br/>
<br/>
DEVKITARM - /c/devkitPro/devkitARM</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">not sure if this is applicable to your situation, but I think devkitpro does not like to be installed to a path containing spaces.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Jeez, I had actually removed devkitARM by mistake! I feel really silly.
<br/>
It works just fine now. Thank you for your answers, without them it would have taken me longer to realize what was wrong.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
