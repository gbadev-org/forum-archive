If you don't like C/C++, you can try <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dslua.com" target="_blank">DSLua</a>.  You can start by using an emulator on your PC first to try it out. :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you've never programmed a game before, you probably need to start somewhere a little more simple than a DS. Programming for consoles is (arguably) much more difficult than say programming for a PC or something similar. 
<br/>
<br/>
I recommend starting by developing on the GBA first, if you want to go for a handheld. The concepts you learn whilst doing this will help tremendously when moving up to the DS. As an added bonus, the development body knows a lot more about the GBA than the DS at this point, allowing you to make fully capable GBA games, where I don't think this is possible with the DS yet. There is no suitable emulator for DS, there are many for GBA. You can (easliy) pot GBA games on an actual cartridge and play them on hardware. this is possible on the DS, but slightly more difficult.
<br/>
<br/>
In the long run, start by learning C. (I would say C++, but you don't really need to do the whole object oriented thing at this level.) Once you have a good grasp of data and can make simple, yet effective console based programs, take a look at the GBA tutorials on this site. (Avoid the Crash Corse (pong) tutorial at all costs. Bad.) 
<br/>
<br/>
Once you have a good grasp of GBA programming, (like can do good graphics in all of the modes and sound of some sort) then you should be ready to make the jump to programming for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
This is all coming from a rather novice programmer as well. If someone disagrees with me, that's fine. Regardless, make sure you know what you're jumping into here.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good advice, gamefreak.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me add that, because of the many similarities to the original SNES console, the GBA serves as a great platform for "console developer's 101".
<br/>
<br/>
In my career, I've gone from deving for Z80s, 6502s, and custon arcade hardware back in the early '80s, to later developing graphics tools at EA for SNES and Genesis titles, to developing PC and next-gen console titles.
<br/>
<br/>
So from the perspective of an experienced developer, I think the GBA is a fantastic platform that forces me to get away from thinking about the latest whiz-bang 3D fx, and get back to what's important: fun gameplay.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and noob, once you're up to speed in "C", try VisualHAM as a starting point.  You can later migrate to DevKitPRO when you're ready.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I disagree, but only a little. Game boy is an interesting point to start. Its not overly difficult, and you have good motivation to learn, because you can have simple things appear on screen and have it jump around or something (Woot!). I also strongly recommend going for gba first. get some nice wrapper library, like ham (?), and some c tutorial, or c book. read the stickies. there is a gba book and the tonc tutorials. good luck</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I disagree. For what he wants to do, C++ would give him a great knowledge of the different kinds of data structures and such. Plus, you end up having to use pointers a lot anyway, so he'll need to know about them if he wants to go with GBA, regardless. I find other languages are actually more difficult to use if you need this kind of control.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
