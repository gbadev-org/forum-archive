    <h4>#15355 - stranger - Wed Jan 21, 2004 11:19 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would it be possible to use a photo(jpg format), not a drawing picture to be a background that can be rotated, or even scrolling? From some tutorials, I only know it can be done for a drawing one. is it possible for a photo, and how?
<br/>
   Is there any website teaching about this or topic about this? please help me~
<br/>
   My English is poor, hope you can understand what my question is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can convert your picture to tile data, en use that on mode 1 or 2 on a rotational BG. A probably better solution is to use mode 3 or 5 to display the picture and rotate in this mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Mode 3 and 5 are graphics modes so you don't have to convert your piucture to tiles first and both modes don't have palletes (like mode 4), so there are more then enough colors that can be used.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also, keep in mind that there is no fundemental difference between a drawn image and a photograph, so anything you can do with a hand-drawn picture can also be done with a photo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's not a question of hand-drawn vs. photographic but rather cel shading vs. continuous shading. Hand-drawn images tend to have sharper edges and more truly flat shaded regions than photos have. Indexed color tends to work a bit better with cel shading.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It didn't sound to me like stranger's question was about that at all. ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you want to scroll a large continuous-tone image such as a photo smoothly, you'll need to convert it to indexed color and then to tiles. For simplicity's sake, use 256-color tile mode on your first demo. You'll need to make sure that all photos in the game use the same palette; for this, paste all the tiles into one big image. You'll have to learn to swap tiles in and out of VRAM as they scroll into or out of view.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
