Anyone know what I can do?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">EDIT:  I'm an idiot and didn't read the entire post.  GBA JPEG viewer probably won't work on your GBAMP since it doesn't appear to be multiboot-capable.  The other GBA JPEG viewer's I've got here don't seem to be multiboot-capable either.  Does the GBAMP itself contain a way to view images from your card?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 2:  If you have the tools to compile it, you can resize all your images to 240x160 and use Tepples's <a class="postlink" href="http://pineight.com/gba/#mirror" target="_blank">FreeMirror</a> program one at a time.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 3:  Alright, simply because I like doing things the hard way, here's a possibility for you, though it's highly unorthodox.  Basically I used DragonBASIC to load and display an image, but this requires that you format the image yourself.  As I don't know of any way to batch process pictures into 240x160 or 256x256 16-color bitmaps, my only suggestion is to use IrFanView with each individual picture.  Not the greatest solution I know, but it's all I can think of.
<br/>
<br/>
Getting 240x160 files to display was easy, but attempting to display larger pictures didn't work too well.  The best I could get was 256x256, which causes graphical corruption in the bottom 8 pixels, but oh well.  At least the batch files make it easy to create *.gba compilations once you've formatted the images correctly.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Double-post, sorry, but I felt it's a large enough update.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been working on and off with this for the past couple of days and managed to greatly expand upon my previous release.  New to this version:
<br/>
* More resolutions supported - 240x8 through 240x256 (multiples of 8), 248x256, 256x256, 256x512, and 256x768
<br/>
* Multiple images per file, as many as will fit comfortably in 256 KB (minus a few KB since I've heard the GBAMP has trouble loading files approaching 256 KB in size).  The third dimension in the folder name tells you how many images can be used for each resolution.
<br/>
* Diagonal scrolling
<br/>
* A Java file that will create most of the sourcecode files for you, so you can modify nearly every resolution by changing one Java file.
<br/>
* Graphical corruption is not gone, but it looks better now.  
<br/>
<br/>
Download the <a class="postlink" href="http://dannysied.googlepages.com/MultibootImageViewer2_nosample.zip" target="_blank">updated version</a> and run the "createFolders.bat" batch file to get started.  Some sample images you can compile for testing may be downloaded <a class="postlink" href="http://dannysied.googlepages.com/MultibootImageViewer2_samples.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
I highly suggest you read the ReadMe file as it contains additional info about the program.  I tried to make it as simple a process as possible, though it still requires ample work on your end pre-formatting the images one-by-one.
<br/>
<br/>
Again, I fully realize that this is a fairly useless program.  Still, I found it a good learning experience.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Just to practice the Java coding I'm learning this year, I made a Java program that greatly increases the usability of my program.  It basically uses the command-line options of IrFanView to automate the whole conversion process.  Browse for your images, let the program calculate the best target resolution, save the image_convert.bat batch file, run it to convert the images, then compile them into *.gba and *.mb.gba files as normal.  I tried to launch the batch file directly within my Java program but had issues doing it, so I left the feature out.
