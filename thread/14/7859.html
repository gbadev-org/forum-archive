    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I built a xboo cable for the main purpose of using sendsave to backup my savegames to my computer but I am having problems as some stuff works and some doesn't
<br/>
<br/>
I am using the dos xboo command as the only windows (98) version xcomms gives a "missing export SHELL32.DLL:SHGetFolderA" error then stops (this is a cheap old laptop so it can't handle newer windows versions)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can upload sendsave_mb.gba then the xboo program closes cleanly and I end up with a black screen I can get the program to go further by running the same command on the computer but it never actually backs my save up.
<br/>
<br/>
The only 2 other multiboot programs I found work perfect but once they upload they don't need the computer anymore
<br/>
<br/>
they only other test I could try was backing up the gba bios which fails after recieving bad data.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
For anyone else trying sendsave, it only works when run with Xboo Communicator (xcomms).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

Do you know what caused the error &amp; how you fixed it? It might be worth adding to the Xcomms docs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes I know how to fix it.
<br/>
<br/>
It turns out after googling the error message which came up with some hits for other programs with the same error plus thankfully a fix. My shell32.dll was to old of a version and to fix it I just had to upgrade it. The only way I found was a very invasive unoffical service pack called "Windows Revolutions Pack"
<br/>
Note this upgrades alot of stuff like icons title bars.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another thing that could be in the docs for xcomms that would of saved me lots of time (has been found to be common after searching the boards) is that to bypass the seg fault in the linux version do not use the open box just specify a file from the command line ex "xcomms_static SendSave_mb.gba" then it runs it fine. That is what I have to do on my main computer that has a Linux From Scratch install.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
