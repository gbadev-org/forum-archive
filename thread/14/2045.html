    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, it is possible.. but we are talking Kb rather then mb. This is reffered as trimming so that two 64mb games fit in a 128mb cart. (some games are slightly over) it's called FAT v8. You can download it at <a href="http://www.gbaemu.com" target="_blank">http://www.gbaemu.com</a><br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is also a small program called romtrunc.exe which truncates trash-data in a gba file.
<br/>
It's included in PogoShell 1.2h.1 afaik.
<br/>
But as said earlier, we're talking KB not MB.
<br/>
And in homebrew programs/games/movies, you're not likely to be able to truncate anything at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
