    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I've been testing a few things with GBA, and there is a big problem with smoothiness on the GBA emulator:
<br/>
watch this:
<br/>
<a href="http://superdeltree.free.fr/download/scroll.exe" target="_blank">http://superdeltree.free.fr/download/scroll.exe</a>
<br/>
it's a standard EXE file that show a simple scrolling sprite.
<br/>
framerate is fixed to 60 FPS
<br/>
<br/>
now, a GBA version for it:
<br/>
<a href="http://superdeltree.free.fr/download/scroll.gba" target="_blank">http://superdeltree.free.fr/download/scroll.gba</a>
<br/>
<br/>
watch the difference: same sprite size, same frame rate (about 60 FPS for each).
<br/>
same speed, same code.
<br/>
The result is much smoother with the EXE than the GBA version.
<br/>
what is the probleme with it ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
my specs:
<br/>
athlon 1800+
<br/>
geofrce 6200
<br/>
1GO ram
<br/>
<br/>
is that due to the emulator, can I expect something better on real hardware?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My first small project was something similar and it was much better on real device. 
<br/>
<br/>
Flash use antializing for making the things smoother. Don't expect the same. 
<br/>
<br/>
I can try this on real device when I go home (after 6-7) hours.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah I watch it. It's different on VBA (really a little choppy). But I tried it on Game Boy Micro, it's perfect believe me.
<br/>
<br/>
the GBA's LCD is not so fast (I don't know the english terms of this). It need more time for refreshting. The efect is pretty close to antializing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
When speaking specifically about LCDs, that's usually called response time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
@deltree:  If your monitor's refresh rate isn't near 60hz, there will be more jitteryness because one frame on the emulator doesn't correspond to one frame on the crt.  I see this a lot at 75hz.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
