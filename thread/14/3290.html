    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, I've been looking around alllll day for this. I am trying to create a tile set so I can play with my map editor. The problem is, all the tile conversion programs and all the map editors seem to require 4 or 8 bit bitmaps. However, I seem to only be able to create 16/24 bit bitmaps. Is there some conversion program out there? Even they seem to require 8 bit bitmaps. How does one obtain one of these fabled bitmaps? Photoshop even has an option when I save my bmp, it has 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32 bits as color depth options. Great, right? WRONG! 2, 4, and 8 are greyed out for some reason. Even though the color depth mode says it's 8 bit, it really isn't. It's 24 bit. Very frustrating. And so I employ you, kind gbadevers...how do I get nice 8 bit bitmaps so I can create maps to play with.

Thanks in advance (no pun intended)!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">When you find yourself in the company of a halfling and an ill-tempered Dragon, remember, you do not have to outrun the Dragon... </span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know that with PS 5.5, you could get an optimized 8-bit bitmap from a higher-bit bitmap by doing the following...
<br/>
-Load the bitmap
<br/>
-Goto File/Save for Web
<br/>
-Save as a Gif
<br/>
-Open up the Gif
<br/>
-Goto File/Save A Copy
<br/>
<br/>
Before saving the Gif, you can choose to have the image at 256 colors or less, and you are given different dithering options. I wish it would have allows direct BMP saving, but I don't necessarily mind. I do it this way so that I can have optimized 16 color (4-bit) bitmaps, and I use PaletteTool (which can be found on the main site) to align and fix the palettes in the bitmap.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">gbAmp can convert to raw format used on the GBA.  It can convert any depth image to 15-bit, 8-bit, or 4-bit, using your own custom palette.  I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for... it will output the raw data though, and you can do pretty much anything with that.  I.e., no compression or specific file format, just the pixel data.
