I downloaded a WI-FI thing onto my computer and i'm wondering how I could transfer it into my DS... do I have to, like, connect it somehow? I want to use it for Animal Crossing - A wild World, and I really need help! If you need more information, please reply! Thank you so much!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If that is what you're talking about...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="color: red"><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">LEKKER KNUFFELE MAATJE!</span></span></span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Spaceface on Wed Sep 06, 2006 1:50 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
