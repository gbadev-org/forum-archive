    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey! just wondering how one would go about animating sprites.  so far i know how to display sprites...to animate them would you just store each seperate frame as a different sprite in a sprites array and just draw the current frame on screen and all other frames off screen? or is there a more efficient way to animate sprites? any help would be great! thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I prefer to use DMA to write over the previous frame of the sprite I want to animate. It frees up the sprites which could be used for particles, a HUD etc. You don't really need more than one sprite per character unless you wanted to do some fancy things, which I'm sure you aren't at this stage. I have seen lots of people do it this way including commercial games. Use a <span style="font-style: italic">finite state machine</span> (FSM) to keep track of the frames and to know which one(s) to display in each state.

<br/>
Hope that explains it a bit. I'm still learning animation myself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It's up and running, along with a VB editor I use to piece it all together and generate the array declarations so I can confirm that the technique works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks guys...i read your thread/link and it helped... i was still wondering though, how do you guys store your sprites? do you have an individual picture/.c or .h file for each frame? or is it possible to load like an entire sprite sheet with all the frames and just display one portion/frame at a time?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well there are many ways in doing that. Including header files most would say is a bad way of doing it. Since you are still learning you might like to do it this way. To expand on that idea, try adding the data to one big array and just change the starting value for your blitting loops.
<br/>
<br/>
The most proper way I have read about is including it as binary data. I believe Tepples' <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/" target="_blank">GBAFS</a> is a good idea of what I am talking about. I've never done this as of yet but I plan to try it soon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Including it as binary data is much easier on the compiler and really saves you some time in the long run.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
