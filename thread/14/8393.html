    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">after reading a lot of spec on GBA hardware, I still have a few questions:
<br/>
<br/>
is it possible to have more than 256 colors in bgmode 0, 1 and 2 ?
<br/>
is it possible to have a sprite with more than 256 colors?
<br/>
<br/>
if I want to have nice backgrounds with 65000 colors, the only way is to be in mode 3,4 or 5?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is one trick that was used in 'Alone In The Dark' for the GBC. Each VBL you change the palette so that you have a different set of colours for each line (or so) in your images. This would not work well for sprites - however there is one way, but it is not very viable. It could only work if you did it for one sprite only, shifting between various versions of it for each 16 vertical pixels.
<br/>
<br/>
This also depends on whether you can DMA the palette data each VBL. However you may be able to it with 16 colours.

The GBC was able to have 64k colours using just 4 colour palettes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How can a display that is 160x144 pixels (23040 pixels in total) possibly show 64000 colors at the same time? :P<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It can't. I'm guessing from memory, 8 4-colour palettes x 144 lines =~ 4k colours.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
