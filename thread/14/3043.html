    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was looking through the faq, and I've been looking through the various dev kits, but almost everything appears to be for the x86 architecture.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if there are any dev kits that work on the Macintosh (OSX) and PowerPC architecture? Would the x86 compile fine if I just grabbed the source, since it compiles into a third architecture anyway?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The two main pre-compiled options for us Mac users seem to be the following:
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://gnufoo.org/gba/" target="_blank">GBASDK</a>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://velvetfr.ath.cx/tools/gba.html" target="_blank">Velvetfr</a>

The first one offers a complete package with Devkit Advance that is ready to compile out of the box, but has the disadvantages that it uses an older version of gcc (3.0.4) and also packages with the Socrates libraries (which most people don't want and it's a bit of work to disconnect them from your project).
<br/>
<br/>
The second one is just a straight gcc compiler for ARM/Thumb, so you need to acquire Devkit Advance's crt0.S and lnkscript from another source (not terribly hard to find). But you're getting gcc 3.3.2 with it, which is nice. Might be a bit more work to get everything up and running.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're serious about GBA programming, though, my advice to you is to get your hands on a cheap Windows box or laptop to work alongside the Mac. You can still do all of your editing, compiling, etc. on the Mac if you want (I do), but when it comes to debugging you will want the Windows tools. VisualBoy Advance for Windows has a ton of useful features that are absent on the Mac version.
<br/>
<br/>
I keep my Mac and a Windows laptop networked, with Windows filesharing and SSH running on the Mac. When I need to debug something I switch over to the laptop, and make any changes to the sources I have to using the filesharing and then recompile them remotely with SSH. It's a great system for me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm also running on Mac OSX and I've been really interested in GBA programming.  But I'm having some trouble setting up GBASDK.  I have Xcode installed and I downloaded the .dmg for GBASDK, but I still can't figure out how to work it.  Is it supposed to run in the Xcode environment, or do I compile from Terminal prompt?  Can someone please walk me through the steps involved in setting it up, so send me to a link that explains it?  Thanks.  :D

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm still running 10.2, so I don't have XCode. But the project files that come with any of those will be for Project Builder, so unless they can be imported into XCode you'll have to configure the IDE on your own.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I just compile from the terminal and use BBEdit as my source editor. You need to get the hang of makefiles, though, or you will go crazy trying to figure it all out.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok so I'll make my code from TextEdit.  What is the command line to get it to compile from Terminal, and in what directories do I need to put the files (and what files?)?  Sorry for the mountain of questions, hopefully I can get this figured out within a few days.  Thanks again for your help.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the command-line program is gcc, but if you have the Developer Kit installed then if you just call gcc on the command line you'll get the wrong version of gcc (the one targetted for Mac programs instead of GBA). So you need to call it from whatever directory it was installed into. This is part of the reason having a makefile is very useful.
<br/>
<br/>
If your distribution came with a makefile, just go into the makefile, change whatever parameters are applicable to your program, and call "make" in the same directory as your makefile.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can compile from XCode or ProjectBuilder by using custom build. You still need to write the makefile, although if you wanted to spend the time I'm sure you could figure out how to make XCode do it for you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unless you do like I do on devkitARM for Windows: put the native compiler in front of the cross-compiler in the PATH (yes, there's still a PATH on Darwin), and then use 'arm-elf-gcc' to compile and link programs. It's explained in my draft tutorial.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok I think I got it set up correctly.  Could someone please link me to a source file so I can try to compile?  That way I can test to make sure I set it up correctly.  Also, what do I need to type to invoke the Makefile?  I assume ./Makefile, but that could be wrong.  Thanks.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">:D :D :D YAY.  It worked perfectly.  So when I type "make", the makefile takes the source from the Source directory and spits it out in the SGADE directory?  That's what it looks like from what I can see.
