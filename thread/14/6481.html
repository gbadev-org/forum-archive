    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, what are HAM, devkitARM, and the other compilers/environments pro's and con's? I am currently using HAM, and it is MUCH easier than using a command line compiler with wordpad. I am currently doing some tutorials (as of August, 3rd, 2005). I want to know mostly what HAM has thats different, other than the library, and is dkARM better for me. Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, if you want easy stick with Visual Ham, its a nice IDE for GBA developement.  If you don't want to use HAM lib, then you dont have to, you can still do all the fun memory pointer jazz in the Visual Ham IDE / tool chain, or what ever you like to call it.
<br/>
<br/>
Now if you want to get super frustrated and want to break things, then go with devkitARM, and make all of your make files from scratch...  No but really, i think there is a Visual Studio plugin for devkitARM floating around on these forums somewhere.
<br/>
<br/>
My biggest troubles i had in getting things to work is that i do it all on a mac, there is more GBA support under linux and windows.  like the damn tools, gfx2gba, pcx2sprite.
