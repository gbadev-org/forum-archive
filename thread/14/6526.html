    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">*edit I fixed it! wootness I'm so happy right now! All I did was move the demo1 directory to c:\ added a few environtment variables from the devkitpro tutorial, and it worked.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am following <a class="postlink" href="http://www.double.co.nz/nintendo_ds/nds_develop1.html" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> on gettign set up to develop DS apps. In the tutorial I downloaded the demo1 app. Which comes with .nds .nda.gba Makefile and the sourcecode.
<br/>
<br/>
So I setup the environment variables <a class="postlink" href="http://www.christiangaming.org/graphics/users/stormtrooper/envirionment.jpg" target="_blank">[picture of variables]</a> ran mingw/minsys put in Makefile and I get this error...
