    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
So I want to get going and have a go at GBA development.  Problem was I had a look at available tools and find a whole bunch of them.  Now I'm confused.  Anyone some advice on the best tool to get started with?
<br/>
<br/>
thx

It is best that you know how to program beforehand, so learning c++ for te pc would be a good start. I don't know of any links for that, but we do have resources on our uni website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ham looks good to me.  I think 29 bucks is an ok price.  After all I paid more for crap games. Now for $29 I can create my own crap games, with noone else to blame but myself :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, there is no need to pay the $29 bucks when devkitPro is faster and free. I suggest starting with VisualHAM because of the ease of setup, but use it for free. Once you get some experience move to devkitPro which is in general a lot better. I.E. it is updated often(HAM's compiler hasn't been updated in years) and the code runs quicker.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the Tip.  I will do just that.  
<br/>
<br/>
I'll start of with some HAM as there is also a good book about GBA development from J. Harbour (sadly blocked for release by the big N.)using VisualHAM as the development platform.  Should get me up and running in no time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The registered version of HAM includes the following benefits:
<br/>
<br/>
    * Intro screen is not shown - nobody will note that you are using HAMlib
<br/>
    * In addition to a registered Debug library, you will also get a registered Release library
<br/>
    * <span style="font-weight: bold">Release library is ~20% smaller and ~10% faster (depends on functions used)</span>
<br/>
    * A good feeling of supporting a long-maintained community project ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
how much faster is devkit? I guess buying visualham could be still worth it if you cant be bothered to switch :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">These are good points.  And I also feel it's important to support smaller community projects. I see how I get on as I work though the book.  If everything works out ok $29 won't break the bank!  HAM looks good to use too!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sadly N didn't do a <span style="font-weight: bold">better</span> job blocking the release of that book. While it may be easy to understand it contains many errors and ill advised programming practices which will make your life awkward later. These include non volatile register definitions, data in headers and #include of .c files, all of which would get a professional developer a serious roasting at a code review.
<br/>
<br/>
Why should you care? You're not a professional developer.
<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of developer status these things introduce potentially subtle bugs which can be difficult to diagnose in more complex projects. If it's a hobby then why make life difficult for yourself?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks, these are really good tutorials.  I think I take this good advice and use the devkitARM development tool set instead.  Your right, it's best not to get any bad habits from the start.
