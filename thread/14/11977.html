    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey, please help me somebody. I'm new to programming, with some experience in html coding. I'm very interested in this subject, and want to learn about making gba games. The thing is, every tutorial i've looked at is so disorganized that I have trouble following them; will someone explain this stuff to me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Check out <a class="postlink" href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/tonc/" target="_blank">TONC</a>.  It's quite well organized, and explains the basics of gba programming as well as any of us would.  It assumes that you already are relatively handy at C programming.

<br/>
If you need help learning to program C in general, see the FAQ for places you can go to learn C programming.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have specific questions about what you've found in these places, then we can be of more help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
