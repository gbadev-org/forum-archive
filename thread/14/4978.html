    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there,
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering which AI techniques are used widely on the GBA? Is A* used in a lot of games? FSTNs are most likely used.
<br/>
<br/>
Are there any optimizations that have been made on AI algorithms for the GBA, or do they basically remain the same as used on other platforms?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's lots of different AI. A* happens to be pathfinding (I assume you already knew this). Based on your map size, A* requires a lot of RAM to execute, and while a speedy algorithm, may be too slow on the GBA to use in real-time.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, you haven't really stated what kind of game you are making: turn based strategy (A* should be fine), platform (why do you even need AI beyond walk left/right in a pattern and attack player?), shooter (AI is on a rail based on mob type), board game (alpha-beta), etc. It can make a huge difference.
<br/>
<br/>
You really need to be more specific as to your needs and requirements. Right now you've just tossed out a rather generic question and asked if it can work.  Well... yes, it can. :-)

Yeah, sorry -- I should have been more specific. :)
<br/>
<br/>
The first demo I want to do is of similar style to an overhead Bomberman-style game, where the AI would need pathfinding and be able to react to obsticles being added to the path in real-time (bombs, etc).
<br/>
<br/>
The second demo I want to do would be similar to an overhead adventure game like Zelda, and use finite state machines for the character behaviour and bosses. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Would the pathfinding need to be simplified in any way, or by just simply making the maps not too huge ( like 32 x 32 )?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, you could use it for a bomberman style game.  or you could use a pole navigation system instead.  Both will work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
What kind of enhancements did you need to do for A* on the GBA, if any? Are the RAM limitations based on the size of grid map for the nodes?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, does anyone know of a good algorithm I could use in C for sorting the open list in A*? I've done A* in C++ and used a heap sort (priority queue), but I'm not going to use C++ on the GBA for these demos. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Also, is a 32x32 node map a good size limit to use A* on for the GBA? Or can the node map size be larger (around 64x64) ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
