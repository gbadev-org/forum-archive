fcc id: kf7sfd7050A the usb version ...im not to sure what version it is but when i go to install the tweaked drivers for it it says the drivers contain no information on the device so im supposing its not the right version i think it said i needed version 2 or something... but i had it lying around and thought i would give it a try any info would be greatly appreciated...  thanks guys.. and
