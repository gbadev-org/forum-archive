    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there!
<br/>
I'm brand new to GBA development and I'm planning to do a gba game :)
<br/>
Right now I'm having troubles with debugging:
<br/>
I've installed devkitPro r19, I followed the tutorial for debugging using insight and the game loaded but afterwards it seems freezed, some posts here indicates r18 doesn't work with insight, so my question: Is r19 working with insight?
<br/>
If not I downloaded the r17 release, is it ok?. Also. What other packages I need to download for working with r17?
<br/>
<br/>
So much questions I know. Also I was following the crash course and the TONC, but I'd like to see a more complete example, a little mario game example would be fantastic. If you know of some code I can peek please share your link with me ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm confident with my C/C++ skills and have been working with actionScript and other engines. I have minimum assembler skills (for now)
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think "a little mario like example" does not exist, because a platform-game, especially on a limited device, is not really a trivial task. :)
<br/>
<br/>
I remember a platformer with complete source code and a java based map-editor. The framework was done in C++ if I remember correctly, but I'm not 100% certain about the name. I think it was called "tonci boy advance", but I couldn't find anything on google. Maybe someone else remembers the name?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The issues might be issues with the VBA version you are using and not the debugger at all.  There are a number of problems in the 1.7.2 version of Visual Boy advanced that can impact debugging.  I spent 3 months trying to find all of the issues and fix them in the 1.8.0 version (because I did not want to fix he 1.7.2 version) and cleaned most of them up.  Of course this is the SDL version of the emulator.  If you want the updated SDL executable for windows you can get them at:

This version was compiled with MS Visual Stdio 2005 so there is a runtime install for that included as well.  The source is in:
