    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all, let me first state that, quite frankly, I don't even know f this is the right FORUM to be posting this to, but I've run out of places to turn, so I thought I'd ask. Fell free to delete this post if noone can help me :)
<br/>
<br/>
- I want to know if anyone can help me, I'm trying to translate a GBA rom, but I don't know where to start, can I edit the palletes of the game in any way? - cause that would be an easy alternative.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to anyone who can help, and sorry if this is unawnswerable here :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Probably not, but here goes anyway:
<br/>
Firstly, palettes deal with the colors being displayed onscreen, not the actual characters of text stored in rom.  So that would be an easy no.
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, whatever original language you're looking at is never, ever going to translate directly into the target language letter-for-letter, word-for-word.  The japanese don't have a 26 character alphabet corresponding to english that would make this possible, and even if it were the grammar would come out horrible because the types of words wouldn't be arranged in the exact same way (instead of "I am walking the dog", you might get "dog walking I go" or whatever)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
