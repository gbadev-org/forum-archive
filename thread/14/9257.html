The MBV2 is a cheaper option that loads your code using multiboot and therefore needs no cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A ROM for a traditional GBA flash cart can be up to 32 MB (256 Mbit) and can save up to 64 KB (512 Mbit). GBA Movie Player, on the other hand, allows program+data+save to be up to the size of a CF card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
As tepples said, all you need is:

<br/>
1) Your PC
<br/>
2) CF reader ($10 USB @ OfficeMax)
<br/>
2) Your GBA
<br/>
3) GBAMP2
<br/>
4) CompactFlash card(s) (128K @ $10 each from OfficeMax)
<br/>
5) DevKitPRO (free download, easy to install)
<br/>
6) Other freeware libs and sw tools as needed

That's it.  You're ready to rock.

Work through the tutorials and some basic programs using just emulators (Download devkitarm and visual boy advance).  Most gba emulators are good enough for getting your feet wet.

<br/>
You'll soon decide whether you're having a blast and want nothing more than to see your creation running on hardware, or whether this whole nonsense is way over your head and not worth the effort. 
<br/>
<br/>
At that point, if you give up, you haven't wasted some $50-$100 on hardware that you won't use.

This is how I got started.  I actually "rarely" use my flash cart.  I do most testing using software emulators and use hardware for verification.  Flashing takes too long.

So what happens when you start getting into areas of the hardware that public emulators handle urine-poorly, such as the link cable or cycle timing or DS mode?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At that point, you start using actual hardware.  Neither one of us suggested that you never use hardware once you get into more serious or heavier development.... especially for situations like that...just that for MOST gba development (And especially entry-level development) emulation works fine.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not recommending brandonman to NEVER buy the hardware...I'm recommending to wait until he goes far enough with development that the expense would actually be worthwhile.
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;rant&gt;I know way too many people who decide they want to get into some new hobby (whether dev related, or mountain climbing, or photography, or whatever), so the first thing they do is rush out and buy all the expensive equipment related to the hobby.  Then, one month later, they decide they don't really love it after all, and have all this wasted junk sitting around.  I'm a strong advocate of using cheap or borrowed or free equipment until you know you really want to invest in your hobby.&lt;/rant&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
...of course, those people are nice to have as friends, because you can buy all their junk second hand from them at discount prices once they've got a new hobby ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And yes, for the majority of my GBA or DS dev work, I use emulation.
<br/>
<br/>
But when you DO want to see your stuff running on HW, if you already have a CompactFlash card and reader, a $15 GBA Movie Player isn't exactly breaking the bank.  ;)
<br/>
<br/>
As an added bonus, if even a beginner can see the simplest of his or her programs actually running on a real GBA or DS, that can be quite a motivational tool to keep going and improving.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I don't update my devkit environment that often, but when I do, if anything breaks in the DS emulator, I already have in place (or set up new) blocks like so:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">#ifdef USING_EMU
<br/>
... simplified/altered emu code
<br/>
#else
<br/>
... real hw code
<br/>
#endif</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
This way, I can continue with coding game logic, adding content, and other higher level tasks, and if I need to test on HW, I just comment out <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">#define USING_EMU</span></span> in my header, rebuild, and go.
<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, I don't know if anyone else is doing this, but I've abstracted external data access to a function that looks something like:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">extern void *MyFileGetData(char *filename, int *size);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
The actual code of the function first looks for the requested "file" in a linked main GBFS object.  If the function doesn't find the data there, it tries to find it using the gba_nds_fat library.
<br/>
<br/>
This abstraction allows me to use the same code for testing small chunks of GBFS content on the emulator, as well as when I'm testing larger chunks of dynamically loaded FAT data on HW.
<br/>
<br/>
I know Dualis is suppoed to support FAT emulation, but I haven't had any luck getting that to work.  Oh well...[/code]<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think there are some bugs in Dualis, so directory structures definitely gets a bit screwed up.
