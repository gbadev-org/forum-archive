Start going through the book trying to understand everything that you do... Once you hit something you dont understand have a little look around and then ask someone (or here if this forum isn't restricted to GBA only :P) 
<br/>
<br/>
Have you had any other programming experience?<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by yaustar on Mon Apr 18, 2005 7:44 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">in that case.. dont go into C++ just yet..get the hang of C (since it is a smaller language) which will be more then enough to start programming games once you get your head around the basics..

What are actually aiming to do at the moment? Making/Designing Games or learning how to program games? It hasn't been too clear of your intentions in your other topics...<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
