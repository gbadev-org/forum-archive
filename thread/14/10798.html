    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello... Im learning my way around coding the GBA and I have a question about which mode regarding backgrounds would be better for me.  The demo/s im working on now only need a still picture for the background so I think a bitmapped one would be best.  Is that correct?  What would I need a tiled background for? (i.e. genre of game...etc)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
