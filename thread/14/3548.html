I'm sorry if my first post was a bit confusing.  For the input of the game, I had a value increment every iteration.  Every 7th (or whatever) iteration, I run several commands, including my "getInput()" function.  The problem that I'm having is that sometimes the user can press a key between the calls, which is both unpleasant and unprofessional (unprofessional because I'm leaving bugs in the output of my program).  I tried implementing something earlier, but I scrapped it, b/c it didn't work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
