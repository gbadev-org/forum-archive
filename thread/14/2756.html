    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok this is a difficult one but I know you coders out there are up to the challenge.
<br/>
<br/>
I am sick of waiting and hopeing for trainers and I almost never can find a trainer that does me any good. not to mention that there seems to be a major lack in new ones lately... 
<br/>
<br/>
I realy want to make two things:
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;one, I want to make an IPS file that can be attached to ANY *.gba file and would escentially be the gameshark code stripped down and only programmed with codes for the game attached. the menu would have to be simple, on/off for each "cheat" and a brief discription for each line(actual code is hidden). inside the program each line actually would consist of up to 15 lines of cheat codes (or 15 gameshark hex codes for those cheaters out there) these cheats would not be editable inside the game. it would also be nice to add the gamesharks "cheat hack" ability (but this would be realy hard as there is no button to use and there fore not realy necessary)
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;two, a program or batch file used in windows to modify a raw version of the above file(program minus codes and descriptions) that "inserts" the codes from ither a simple text file OR a gui like interface where you type in the codes and descriptions...  then you could use a regulat IPS to add it to the target game. with this instead of hunting for ips files that dontexist, all people have to hunt fore are gameshark codes that are richly abundant and can even be home grown on visualboy advance!
<br/>
<br/>
I have decided to use two games as guinea pigs: tactics ogre: the knight of lodis, and the ledgend of zelda, a link to the past. mainly because I actually own leagle copies of these. 
<br/>
<br/>
I dont want to hear "then just get a gameshark!" that defeats my goal, I want to remove clutter from my GBA, it travels alot and I got the GBASP, the gameshark would only bulk up what I am working hard to streamline! plus you cant say it wouldnt be cool if it were as easy as typeing some 8 digit numbers into a gui and makeing your own Trainers with a simple click!
<br/>
<br/>
I can see what is needed to make this happen but I lack any programming ability or knowhow to actually do it... also I realy dont have any idea if this is even possible! if so please I realy want this to happen, if noone wants to actually make something like it, then help me, how do I do it, what do I need to know and how do I learn?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess all you'd really need to know for a project like that is ARM assembly and GBA hardware details -- but in reality, if you have no programming experience, you should start simpler.
<br/>
<br/>
My usual advice is to learn QBASIC, then assembler for your PC (or whatever you have), then C.  After that, you'll at least have the foundations you need to figure out the rest.
<br/>
<br/>
Or, if you don't want to do any real work, you can cross your fingers and hope somebody else does it for you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well give me SOME credit.
<br/>
<br/>
though time isincredibly tight, I am very serious about this. so lets start basic. first things first: simplify. I have A.D.D. and learning is hard for me but I am tired of being left in the lurch so... where should I start? something easy. something I can do fast. I  realy need a step by step plan. (not instructions, a plan) a path from beginning to end... any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
sorry but the above means nothing to me... mabey some reading material would help? any manuals I could get... or mabey a study guide online? link me baby!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Edit: OK really though, you can find material on QBASIC easily enough, and the language itself is not hard to learn.  I think it's a good place to start.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
ok here goes, I'll keep posting my progress for anyone who cares. any advice, codeing strategy or project ideas are welcome, Ill also post any source I comeup with here.
<br/>
<br/>
thank you sajiimori. I have a feeling you are the onlyone I am going to be able to rely on for advice here.
<br/>
Thanx everyone else in advanced!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Don't take it personally... most of us don't really have any useful advice to give you. I am a competent GBA programmer but I have never made a trainer, and I would have to learn a considerable amount in order to do so.
<br/>
<br/>
By your own admission you do not know how to program (let alone code for the GBA), and you want to make a general GBA game-trainer with a GUI and everything, and you want to have it finished relatively soon. The best advice I can give you is to wish you luck.
