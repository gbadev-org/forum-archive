In Visual Boy the corruption only appears when pushing sprites left and up. However when loaded on a GBA or on Mappy the corruption is a full time problem. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm wondering if any of you have had similar problems, and any suggestions  for a fix would be great. I've paused the corruption on screen and checked every sprite in OAM and they were all offscreen so thats not a problem, also I make sure all sprites not shown are always offscreen. My guess would be a loose pointer.  I'd post some code as well but right now nothing in the code looks very suspect and there is quite a lot to paste. I'd like to investigate all suggestions and maybe that could narrow the search down to a point where i could post offending code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wasn't using a shadow copy of OAM, but now I am, thanks a lot for the help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
