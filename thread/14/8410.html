    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well seeing as how I don't want to reinvent the wheel, and where I live, and book that is based on computers is immediately priced at the 75..120$CAD price level (so I cannot become what I've heard affectionately known as a "Andre LeMothe Kiddy"), I would like to ask what has been done as a 3d Rendering library. 
<br/>
<br/>
I would prefer to prerender it, rather than have it render during run time.
<br/>
<br/>
This mostly wanted after looking at a few classic Sonic games, and having my childhood memories raped. However, for atleast one of my projects, that effect may need to be desired. Yea ol' pixelated rendering look with pixels about five feet wide, to render something that on todays technology would fit onto a stamp at 72DPI.
<br/>
<br/>
I would do it at mode five myself, but I most likely would botch the job, and I am sure somebody has got to have done it.<br/>_________________<br/>[ <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dakedesu.info" target="_blank">Main Site</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://krfp.dakedesu.info/" target="_blank"> Kid Radd Fan Project</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.dakedesu.info/" target="_blank">Forums</a> ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would, but DS is complete overkill for the effect I wish to accomplish.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there some manner of low res Raytracer Program that could fit a poorly rendered movie into a format that could be compadible (or made compadible) with Mode 5?
<br/>
<br/>
I am asking this in begineers mostly because I am sure this thread, no matter how short, would be a good resource for beginners.<br/>_________________<br/>[ <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dakedesu.info" target="_blank">Main Site</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://krfp.dakedesu.info/" target="_blank"> Kid Radd Fan Project</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.dakedesu.info/" target="_blank">Forums</a> ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
