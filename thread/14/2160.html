    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I'm fairly new to this (well, I took a 5-month brake and went back to dev. for the PC using DX so I still am not too good) and whilst reading one of Dovoto's tutorials I came across a part where he meantioned that the GBA could actually read+play .wav files. This would be cool to learn how to implement into my games as right now I'm only clear on how to play .mod files and whatnot where sound quality is somewhat diminished. (and my great compositions don't sound so great anymore) If anyone could offer me a link, some advice, etc. that would get me on the right track to learning how to go about this it would be very much appriciated. Thank you.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://saoghal.cywh.com/Jer1400/index.html" target="_blank">http://saoghal.cywh.com/Jer1400/index.html</a>

Supports .mod files and digital samples (e.g. wav).  Good quality sound, for gba anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
