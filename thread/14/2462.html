<br/>
<br/>
I have recently played some Gameboy Advance and this site has made me interested in doing some GBA development. I am 18 years old and I have been doing computer programming for a while now (game programming aswell using DirectX). The thing is I do programming in Borland Delphi (I do not know enough C/C++ to do game programming) and I am not sure if it is possible to use Delphi to make GBA games. 
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any information on this please let me know. I'll continue looking around but any info will be gadly accepted.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ideally, you'd be able to just compile it and add it to a DevKit Advance distribution.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'd really recommend learning C, and not just for GBA programming; it's probably the most widely-used language for the largest variety of applications out there, and most new languages tend to be based on C's overall design and syntax. It's also not terribly hard to learn and get used to if you already have a background in programming; I don't especially know Delphi but if it's anything like Pascal you really just need to get a handle on the different syntax.
<br/>
<br/>
DMA is just a special hardware feature of the GBA for quick memory transfers. It is only one of several dozen specific features to the GBA that you will have to learn, and should not be the first. The Pern Project covers DMA on Day 5, I think.

Better to say you want to use Pascal to code GBA game.  I don't  think switching from Pascal to C or C++ should be that hard so I agree with poslundc that you should try to learn C or C++.  After all, you are already used to leave ";" after each line of code!  :)<br/>_________________<br/>Visit SR-388 now and get a 40% discount!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

However, when it comes to debugging, I'm not sure if it is very efficient.

It takes a second to get used to not using the : some much and #includes instead of uses, but once your by the semantics, it's so much easier to do pointer/memory stuff its unbelievable.  Of course, it's alot easier to shoot yourself in the foot as well, but that's the fun of it :)

The languages are both similiar enough that you should be up and running in C within a day or 2 of trying.  I personally learned Pascal first and switched to C (Pascal was taught as an introductory language at my college way back when :)) and was up and running in C in days.  So jump in and learn already :)

EXE is a compiled executable format for DOS/Windows, totally unrelated to GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
You can produce ROM images in any number of ways, the most common of which is to compile files written in a higher-level language (such as C or C++) to a binary object format (.o), and then link the object files together.

Delphi is not really under Windows. It supports Linux (Kylix) and much more. It compiles everything to ASM so I don't see why it shouldn't be possible to make a GBA rom from Delphi.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW Delphi is NOT Pascal. It comes from Pascal syntax but the ''Pascal'' language is not the same thing as Delphi. Same way that C++ comes from C but it is still not C. 
<br/>
<br/>
So far, I have made everything under Delphi that has been possible in C++. Ie: DLL calls, converting Microsoft DirectX C++ SDK to Delphi has been possible, and a lot more. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now the problem that I see is that the compilers that create the GBA rom files all depend on the c/c++ source code to compile them. Sajiimore said you guys compile the C source code to binary object files and then compile it to a GBA rom file? The next step for me is to see if there is a way to compile Delphi code to binary object files.
<br/>
<br/>
Some of you might think I am wasting my time but if it's possible to do this in Delphi, I want to find the way :) My Delphi programming friends would like this a lot aswell.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks I'll keep searching for an answer and if anyone finds anything please let me know.

Mike: I took C++ course in high school before but it didn't go into anything much more than pointers and basic IO. Now I take Java courses but Delphi has fit me better than both.
<br/>

&lt;&lt;EDIT&gt;&gt;
<br/>
I found a option in Delphi to "Generate C++ Object Files" which can include namespaces and export all the symbols.

Can this help me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Well, the short answer is that the ASM it compiles is useless unless it happens to be ASM for the ARM7TDMI chipset, which is what the GBA uses. From what you're saying, it seems far more likely that it outputs assembly instructions for the x86 series of processors, which is an entirely different instruction set.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">I found a option in Delphi to "Generate C++ Object Files" which can include namespaces and export all the symbols.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Again, the object files must be targetted for ARM processor, otherwise nothing else matters. Windows and Linux both run on the x86 processor, which is a fundamentally different processor.
<br/>
<br/>
This is not meant to sound discouraging, but I do not suspsect you will get very far with GBA programming if you aren't prepared to delve more under-the-hood than looking for a compiler option that reflects a certain language.
<br/>
<br/>
Programming Delphi (or Pascal, anyway) is not necessarily a dead end, as others have already noted, but you will have to do some tough stuff to get there (far less trivial than checking an option in the Delphi compiler). Frankly, the prerequisite knowledge needed to pull it off make something like learning C look like child's play. (At least there are plenty of tutorials on learning C).
<br/>
<br/>
So, without intending to start a holy war over languages or anything like that... my advice is to suck it up and learn C. You can always try to go back and find a way to compile your Delphi code to the ARM chipset once you have a better understanding of GBA programming.

I'm not going to try it, but it seems possible that this GPC could be installed over DevKitAdvance, giving one a fully functional Pascal compiler for ARM. It still isn't Object Pascal, however, and it seems to be at quick glance one of those Pascal-&gt;C converters, meaning compile times would be long and code might be a bit inefficient (though C and Pascal aren't too much unalike in terms of actual logic, so it shouldn't have too great an adverse effect).
