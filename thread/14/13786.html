please tell me how I can set up the gbdk thing. the readme demands a autorunexec.bat and I have no idea what that is.
<br/>
<br/>
I am also trying to use the Gameboy Code Editor made by the fountain of decay so I don't have to kill myself by using the down to earth frustarting interface that the normal gameboy demands.
<br/>
<br/>
can anyone help me? or at least point the way to a place that can answer my question.....
<br/>
<br/>
btw, is the gba sdk capable of making normal GB roms?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA SDK is not capable of creating GB Roms, it only targets the GBA! The GBDK is capable of creating real GB Roms.

<br/>
Autoexec.bat (does not usually have run) is what DOS and Windows9x runs when booting up. It's probably just changes in the path, which you <a class="postlink" href="http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm" target="_blank">do differently in Windows XP</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
You will probably find a whole load of broken links, for example all of the IDE's are no longer on-line. I used to have a backup CD with lots of GB development tools but I think I threw them away by accident.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok. can anyone help me get this GBCE code editor working? the one that I was talking about above?
<br/>
<br/>
I set it to a random make.bat that I have in my GBDK release folder but the rest of the essential linked stuff are from the RGBASM release.
<br/>
<br/>
please can anyone help understand how to set up the normal gbdk at least.....possibly post a video?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
