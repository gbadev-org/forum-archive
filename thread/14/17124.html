I try to familiarize myself with sprites in mode 4 (!). I've included GBA Junkies example "ch4a" into my project. But since it is based on mode 1, the sprite is not displayed correctly. Is there a simple way to adjust the code?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

as far as i know there should be no major difference between sprite in tile or bitmap mode, except that you lose your first block of sprite when using bitmap modes (you can only use sprite 512-1024)
<br/>
I've only used tiled mode so i'm not sure, but that's the only info I found reading tonc =&gt; <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/regobj.htm" target="_blank">tonc:8. Regular sprites</a>
<br/>
<br/>
by the way if you're programming for the GBA, read tonc... it's maybe not as beginner friendly but it's surely much better (and up to date) when it comes to programming for the GBA =&gt; <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/" target="_blank">tonc</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, you cant use tiles 512-1024 in bitmap modes. And furthermore, go with tonc it really is sweet. I used to dislike it because it was going too much into detail for a first timer, but now it really does seem the only obvious solution. Is there a ds tonc equivalent?<br/>_________________<br/>Check out my GBA game in development : <a class="postlink" href="http://ninjatale.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">忍物語</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think it's the contrary, indexing still start at the lower tileblock, but you can only use the higher tile block,resulting in having only tiles 512-1024 useable (through some "bitmap mode" macro might offset the tiles by 512...).
<br/>
feel free to correct me if i've read tonc wrong :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
