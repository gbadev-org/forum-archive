    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've had some experience in editing nes and snes tiles. I realize that some snes roms have graphics compressed and I've read that some gba roms do to. My question is, if you can view the tiles in VGBA with the tile viewer does that mean they aren't compressed? If that is the case, how would I edit those tiles? I've looked at the rom in TileED and can't find the graphics. For example, If I'd like to change a logo of a team how would I do it? Do I save the tile from VGBA as a .png? Then what? Sorry for the long winded post. Any help would be great. Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"VGBA"? Are you talking about <a class="postlink" href="http://fms.komkon.org/VGBA/VGBAWindows.html" target="_blank">Marat Fayzullin's emulator</a>? Because that costs money, a lot of us aren't familiar with it.
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, the "tile viewer" in many emulators will show the contents of RAM. Tiles are likely to be stored compressed in ROM and decompressed to RAM.

If you're interested in ROM hacking, there are other, better forums for this. Gbadev.org seems oriented more toward making original programs from scratch rather than replacing graphics in commercial games.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
