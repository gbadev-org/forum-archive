    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, Rotation Backgrounds are limited to 256 Unique Tiles?
<br/>
<br/>
Why, instead of 256 8*8 tiles don't we use 256 colours?
<br/>
<br/>
The tileset we use is going to be 256 colours anyway, why not create a map pixel by pixel refering to the colour of the pixel rather than referring to a unique tile?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone got any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this so my understanding might not be correct about what the GBA does and I realise the answer may simply come back in the form - "that's just the way it works" but i've been wondering about this so was wondering if anyone could shed some light?<br/>_________________<br/>You lost today, kid.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">256 8x8 tiles = 16,384 unique pixels, which is greater than 256.
<br/>
<br/>
You cannot create a map pixel-by-pixel; you create it tile-by-tile. The tiles can contain whatever pixels you want (8x8 pixels per tile), but you must specify which tiles to use on an 8x8 grid, not a 1x1 grid.

You use it for "mode7" effects, if you use a tilemaped mode  instead of a bitmaped mode you can have a map that is 1024x124 pixels big, in bitmaped mode it would eat up 1MByte of VRAM which you don't have on a GBA.<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
