    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I'm looking for a decent library to play around with gba development.  Does anyone know if SGADE is still used by many or has much support?
<br/>
<br/>
Or, could someone suggest what a good engine to use is?  I'd appreciate any insight and reasons.  Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, use DevKitARM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the input. I was using a library called TONC written by Cearn.  If using HAM would be in the minority, do people usually just roll their own stuff, even reg defines and such, or is there a common set of headers etc used typically that people refer to?

<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA header file should come with your devkit (at least it did back when I got started). People generally follow the naming conventions in the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.work.de/nocash/gbatek.htm" target="_blank">GBATek specification</a>.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">greyboy, I am using the SGADE and I am also contributing library code into the SGADE cvs at sourceforge. 
<br/>
<br/>
When I need a library routine and it can't be found in SGADE i would write the code for it and put it into the SGADE cvs.
<br/>
<br/>
I do not know of anyone else using SGADE right now... but well, if you run into problems with the library just post here I may be able to help :)
<br/>
<br/>
I chosen SGADE because it had really good documentation (and comments!), moreover it is a really well thought out library. I have been looking at other libraries but in the end I used SGADE.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I just got it working with DevKitArm I was also able to create a project with
<br/>
= GBAForVS6: Game Boy Advance Project AppWizard for Visual Studio 6  =
<br/>
and then tweak the mak file to use the sgade library.  I might actually be able to program somthing now.  I have been futzing around for a while but what I can tell you is that I am not using the linker script and I had to add some search paths to the compiler flags, and the library to the linker command.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using VisualHAM from the ngine.de website and have found it very useful. I'm not doing anything particularly fancy with it, but managed to get an isometric room-style game engine up and running fairly quickly.
<br/>
<br/>
It's great for sprite manipulation, and when you combine it with HEL, makes large map scrolling a doddle!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Although I am looking for anyone interested in sgade to speak and share ideas/help each other on a regular basis. I do keep in contact with a few sgade users, but I am always looking to find more. PM me or AIM if you are interested.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
