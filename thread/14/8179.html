<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to sound development in general. I'm putting together some MIDIs for a GBA title and wanted to know if anyone has any experience with putting together instruments in .aif format. The music player I have has a few in there already to use when I'm testing my sound ROMs.....but not enough.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried taking some samples from places like sampleswap.org but they introduce a lot of ambient noise into the playback.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
