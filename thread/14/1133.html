    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've just got the visual studio plugin for creating GBA workspaces, and i'm wondering what the header and CRTs options actually do. From the looks of things the different headers (either Pern Project, MrRattles or WhatZhats) have different sets of defines for interupts, registers and memory start addresses. All well and good - what do most people tend to use? I'm inclined to start with both the Pern ones and see how they go, there seems to be a lot of memory area define which i'm not sure are actually fixed. Are gba.h files usually reserved for fixed-in-stone memory addresses/registers? Is there really going to be much difference between the headers?

<br/>
The Crtls', what are these? I assume they are to control how the rom actually gets linked, but again, i'm not sure of the differences between the various options (jeff's Crt0.s, Pern crtls or WhatZhats crtls).Am i likely to have to add in extra object files (one per class file/source file?) Is this going to do something funky if i ever need to embed any ASM/Thumb code in there?
