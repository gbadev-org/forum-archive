    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've tried a few codes, mostly just filling a screen-nothing big at all
<br/>
<br/>
But the problem is...I use Notepad to type in the code, but I don't know how to make it a .C file to make the program compile.
<br/>
<br/>
How do you do this?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm brand new to this, I've no C or any other language experience, so ... yeah, i'm new ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You needs a compiler to actually create a program from it.
<br/>
<br/>
You should first learn the basis of Programming on a Pc. And when you feel confortable with C/C++ programming, then you switch to Gba which has much more issue to be aware of.
<br/>
<br/>
And about you file you created, it's actually a valid file. A 'c' file is only a text file with your code. You then ask the compiler to read it and transform it to a program.
<br/>
<br/>
So bottom line, find on the net a Tutorial about Programming, better yet, buy a good book on it. Find and install a compiler. And practice it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
