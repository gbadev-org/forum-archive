    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello.
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly I only have my gba sp for about 5 days and I didn't even hoped of getting in the program files or writing my own games... 
<br/>
But then I 'googled' on it and the suprise was big :)
<br/>
<br/>
One of the most anoying things with the gameboy was that I could use a program like 'calculator' or 'diary' and stuff... this way I could play games in class and tell my teacher I'm just using it as a calculator...
<br/>
<br/>
I still have a few questions about this:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Is it possible to damage my gba in a hardware-way (or a software-way)
<br/>
2) What hardware should I buy to get into it?
<br/>
<br/>
I know some pc languages (java, basic and php) (last one doesn't really count I guess) so I guess I can get started quite fast.<br/>_________________<br/>:: Just follow the route2destiny ::</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if you wanna get into gba programming you should first learn C
<br/>
a good knowlege of this language is essential. then you should read sevaral tutorials. one of my favorite tuts is the pern project. you found the most of the tuts here: <a href="http://www.gbadev.org/docs.php" target="_blank">http://www.gbadev.org/docs.php</a>
<br/>
<br/>
you also should read the cowbite spec to get a deeper understanding of the hardware. 
<br/>
<br/>
if you wanna see your stuff on real hardware you will need a flash card or at least an mbv2 cable (4 multiboot images only, 256k code size max i think).
<br/>
<br/>
regarding the developmentenvironment i am using eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org). its a free and very powerful ide and in the new m7 version the cdt (c/c++ plugin) is quite relieable. 
<br/>
then you will need an emulator. im using mappy vm as one of my main emus because it has the best views i think. but i also use VisualBoyAdvance-sdl because mappy is a bit slow and the debbuging is still alpha and dont work at all. you can even use eclipse with visualboy and gdb to debbug within eclipse, wich is very nice :)
<br/>
<br/>
i hope i could help you. if you had any questions just ask.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm... alright... lots of things to do... but I just love that tiny pc ... so I guess I'll start working.
<br/>
<br/>
Could you give me a real link where I can buy these flash card writers? I've been searching for them for some time now (well, 2h) and I found so many that I just don't know what to pick...
<br/>
And what price should I have in mind?
<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Learn either C or C++. There are lots of topics on this board, search and figure out which is best for you.
<br/>
<br/>
There isn't a file system or hard disk so its not possible to harm it.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't buy a flash cart right now as you won't be using it for at least 6 months since you don't know C/C++.
<br/>
<br/>
When you do get around to it, go to this site <a href="http://www.mwelectronics.com/" target="_blank">www.mwelectronics.com/</a> Unlike some sites, this company is based in the U.S. and delivery time is extremely short. You can get a good-sized flash cart for about $100.
<br/>
<br/>
Again, when deciding on what kind of flash cart, there are other forums for that (like the Flash Equipment one).
<br/>
<br/>
Learn to use the search function, and it will make looking for answers a lot easier. Chances are someone has already asked your question.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I would tell you to learn C first then any C++ useful stuff but I have a feeling I may spark off another C vs C++ war again ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Take a look at Visual Ham as it is excellent for beginners and any of the tutorial links in the FAQ
<br/>
<br/>
OR
<br/>
<br/>
you can go with DragonBasic or Catapult which uses it's own language type<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'll be starting with C++, but I guess I'll get it quite quickly since I'm already familar with other languages (java 2 for example)

Maybe not the question I should ask here, but is it possible to copy whole games for backups and more safegames? And how big is a commercial game?<br/>_________________<br/>:: Just follow the route2destiny ::</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
