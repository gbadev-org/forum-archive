    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I have bought a mbv2 cable. I work with visual ham.. Its ok when i first run my GBA game. It works on the GBA. But when i want to end my game I shut down the GBA. And stop the process by pressing ctrl+f10. When i open the GBA it doesnt open. I realized that I have to plug out the cable and then open the GBA again. It is a very painful way and it doesnt work every time. Is there any way to use this easily without pluging out he cable or shutting the GBA down. Or do you have a web link gives information about mbv2 cable...<br/>_________________<br/>--------------------

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It seems to be a problem with Win2k and probably XP as well, my home made xboo cable does the same thing although not consistently. It seems to work fine if the port is set to SPP mode in the BIOS instead of EPP or ECP.
<br/>
<br/>
I've had some cases where it will power off and on again properly with the cable still attached. Obviously it's something to do with the states of the lines which are connected to the link port. I'm in the middle of some work atm so I don't  time to figure it out.
<br/>
<br/>
If and when I discover how to set the port properly I'll add it to Xboo Communicator. I'm planning on adding MBV2 support soon(ish) too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
