    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First things first, I dont know how to code, the reason for my being here and asking this question, is that I'd like to know if its possible, before I start asking people I know(that can code) some very stupid questions. (its better to get laughed at by total strangers than by close friends =)
<br/>
<br/>
Talking about the os that comes with the ez3manager
<br/>
<br/>
*cough* here goes:
<br/>
Does anyone know what I(people I know) need to do/use to see the source? Is it possible? google search only got me translation hacks, titlemap tools and so on.  If anyone has done so, what tools were used?
<br/>
<br/>
As for why?, using the rombuilder to change the "theme" was fun for a while, but know I want more! I not only want to get rid of that useless learn engrish prog, I also want to know if it(the code) could be modified to run other tiny apps (like minesweeper thats on it).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
