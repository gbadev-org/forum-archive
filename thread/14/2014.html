    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hiya people, if any of you beginners are new to programming I am developing a website which teaches you from the very beginning of programming.
<br/>
<br/>
It will have tutorials on C and C++ so that you can choose which you prefer to program. There will be demo's of games for windows, DOS(and directX) and obviously the GBA. I will teach you tool programming using visual basic(which in my opinion is the best language for maing tools). the tutorials will be in HTML format as scene as I have limited webspace but if I get enough hits I might upgrade and put my tutorials in zip files or something. The demo's will be downloadable though.
