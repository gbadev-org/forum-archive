I dub you a troll.  Now I'll feed you a troll cookie.

There are a number of examples of pixel draws for modes 3-5 on the forum and in sample code.  With that, all you need to do is create a draw yes/no table in a 2 dimensional array per letter (so 3 dim).
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
#define MAX_LETTERS 1
<br/>
<br/>
const u8 letterTab[MAX_LETTERS][8][8] =
<br/>
{
<br/>
    {0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0),
<br/>
    {0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0),
<br/>
    {0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0),
<br/>
    {0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0),
<br/>
    {0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0),
<br/>
    {0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0),
<br/>
    {0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0),
<br/>
    {0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0),
<br/>
};
<br/>
<br/>
void drawLetter(u32 x, u32 y, u8 letter)
<br/>
{
<br/>
    int i,j;
<br/>
<br/>
    ASSERT(letter &lt; MAX_LETTERS);
<br/>
<br/>
    for(i=0; i&lt;8; i++)
<br/>
        for(j=0;j&lt;8;j++)
<br/>
        {
<br/>
            plotPixel(x + j, y + i, letterTab[0][i][j]);
<br/>
        }

The people in this forum all lead busy lives, but we are always happy to take time out to answer questions and do whatever we can to encourage and support new developers, usually because someone was there for us when we were still new to the platform and we know from experience how beneficial it is to have a community of resources to draw upon.
<br/>
<br/>
But someone who abjectly refuses to do anything to learn for themselves does not impress most of us into going out of our way to help them. This isn't arrogance; you simply aren't worth the time or effort.
<br/>
<br/>
The tutorials I pointed you to in a different thread teach you <span style="font-style: italic">everything</span> you need to know to write the code you've been looking for, with heaps of sample code that are only a stone's throw away from doing it. Have you even tried plotting a pixel in Mode 3 yet? (It's one of the exercises in the tutorial.)
<br/>
<br/>
To reiterate, if you run into any specific problems along on the way or have a specific question with code you are attempting to write, you will probably be deluged with responses from people eager to help out. But if you are honestly surprised by the responses you've been getting, you'll probably have a very tough road ahead.
<br/>
<br/>

P.S. I'm <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> American; I just work here, but you're welcome to take a shot if you feel like alienating more countries.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Saj, are you saying you've mellowed with age? Because if so, it's a good thing Impatient here didn't post their, er, "question" before then. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
To Mr. Impatient: 
<br/>
<br/>
I say this with as much calm compassion as can be transmitted via a text message. I'd change your login name, develop a simple program that displays pixels as Dan suggests, and THEN ask questions as they come up. I think you'd experience a very different kind of response.
<br/>
<br/>
I am an American, but believe it or not, I'll happily help you out. 
<br/>
<br/>
Let me start with this: Mode5 is one that is rarely used and therefore it will be hard to find a text system like you're asking for. I have one that I wrote, but it's so buried inside the code of a larger game that it would be at least an hour of work for me to pull it out and clean it up enough to be instantly helpful to you. If you demonstrate that you're a nice guy, I might actually make the effort for the betterment of the community, but right now I simply don't have an hour to spare.
<br/>
<br/>
I could send you the full source code of the game, if you're interested in trying to figure it out. PM me if that's the case.
