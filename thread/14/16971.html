    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am interested in getting into GBA development. I have an R4 card, and I have done a tiny bit of DS dev, but I really like how simple the GBA is and I think it would be fun to program on.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that I can't really find somewhere to get a homebrew card for the GBA. Can anyone help me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Get the Fire Linker and 128 mbit flash cart for about $10 from <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=14429" target="_blank">the retailer discussed here</a>.  That's assuming you have a parallel port on your computer (which is getting rarer these days, I guess)
<br/>
<br/>
I've purchased many of these carts.  You'll want to download  <a class="postlink" href="http://sites.google.com/site/gggddfdgju/home" target="_blank">a different piece of software</a> and throw away the software they supply with them, but they work fine.  I've had one or two that don't always immediately seat properly in my gba micro, (I had to re-insert it a couple times to make it work), but they always worked fine in my SP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">beware: there's also one of the firelinker that is marked as USB on this retailer, however it seems it isn't USB at all...
<br/>
if the paralel port pose problem (or if you want a caridge with more fonctionalities for NDS) you can get a slot2 supercard for 13$ from the same retailer (don't take one with "rumble" feature, as theses do not have some additional RAM..) it is however found in the "nintendo DS" section and not in the "gameboy advance"... really strange...
<br/>

edit: nm about the rumble one, they seems all out of stock...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Gotta recommend against the slot-2 Supercards from DX right now.  Lots of the ones from DX recently have died within a few weeks of owning.  First the menu turns into gibberish, then if the user tries a firmware update, it generally bricks entirely.  It is suspected that the ones they are selling now are fakes or clones.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hum, that might explain the price drop... normal supercard were around 20$ and rumble one (without EXRAM) where around 11$...
<br/>
<br/>
what about their 24$ EZflash IV slot2 card? otherwise it seems like you're out of luck for SD slot2 card...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
There are two cards that I found that are in stock and seem like a good choice. The one gauauu suggested seems like a really good deal, but I'm wondering if "3rd-Gen Kensington (?) Flash Top 512M" one might be better for the extra storage.
