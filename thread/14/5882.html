    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">VisualHAM is pretty good stuff, especially if you're just starting out.
<br/>
<br/>
Remember that VisualHAM IS configured to use Hamlib.  Hamlib is good, don't get me wrong, but at some point, you may choose to move away from using it when you're more experienced and want to get closer to the hardware.  VisualHam DOES allow you to configure compiling without Hamlib when you're ready.
<br/>
<br/>
However, VisualHAM IS a little more tightly tied to DevKitAdv.  DevKitAdv hasn't been updated for a LOOOOONG time, whereas DevKitARM, as linked to by "wintermute", is very current and updated often.  I'm pretty sure that you CAN configure VisualHAM to use DevKitARM, but it probably involves digging around some makefiles, since I didn't find any simple way to do it from the IDE.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As an experienced software/games developer (over 20yrs), some of my my personal choices turned out to be:
<br/>
<br/>
DevKitARM
<br/>
Eclipse IDE
<br/>
VisualBoyAdvance
<br/>
A subset of mildly customized wintermute headers
<br/>
<br/>
These choices were made after a lot of research here at GBADEV.ORG and elsewhere.  But, these choices were right for ME, and may not be right for someone who is just giving this type of development a go for the first time.  VisualHAM might be just the thing for you, since the distribution contains a big chunk of what a beginning GBA developer needs to get started in an easy install.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But do what I did: try out few different promising options, read what some of the long-timers here have to say, and go with what works best for you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and did you read the FAQ?   :D<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
