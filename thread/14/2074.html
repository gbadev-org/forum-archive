    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, flashing compressed games does not work. Zipped games would have to be decompressed to some sort of volatile memory, and the carts don't have that much RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, flashing compressed .mb programs could be made to work. A .mb program is smaller than 250 KB and runs from the RAM built into the GBA. I just might write an upgrade to my <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#mbmenu" target="_blank">Multiboot Menu</a> program that allows use of GBA-LZ77 compressed programs, once I've finished a project for ddrei.com.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I recommend you do not pirate games as the above post seems to recommend.  Buy a cart based on the size of a game you wish to develop yourself, not on which d/l roms you can load onto it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
