    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering, if there is anyway to soft reset to the loader menu of an EZF-Advance 128M cart.  I don't like turning my gba-sp on and off repeatedly just to change the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, my gameboy seems to drain a lot faster when I use the EZFA cart when compared to my other carts.  Does anyone else have this problem?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for you help.
<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards,
<br/>
Alex</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I looked at the writer software but it doesn't seem to have a separate menu code file, and if it IS embedded in the main application, I couldn't find it in there either. The only thing I can think of is a dump of a cartridge which has the menu in it. But as I don't have one of these carts, (but an F2A instead) I have no way to do this.

<br/>
So, does anyone have the code in question, so that someone could take a look at it?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Presumably people with EZF carts can put more than one 'ROM' on at a time, and the programmer adds a front end menu to do this selection. The code for this menu, which will be found somewhere inside a cart programmed with more than one ROM would demonstate how to control the EZF cart, and this in turn would allow Pogoshell to work with an EZF cart.
<br/>
<br/>
I was looking for the dumped code of this menu...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It returns to the game launcher menu.

If you want a dump of a EzFa cart, pm your e-mail address to me and I send one other<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, that's because Advance Wars and all other Nintendo games, (even the GB/GBC ones) are designed that way. Pick up a REAL Advance Wars cartridge and it also resets, but since the boot menu comes first when playing, it is the first to appear when the hardware completely resets.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
