    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK. I have been programming on the GBA for a while now, but I don't really have much down outside of one mode and sprite graphics. What tutorial would you recommend that I cound use to gain a good knowledge of all of the different modes and how to use their goodies? I want to be able to easily create programs to demonstrate the different modes and such so I can begin using them.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cearn's <a class="postlink" href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/tonc/toc.htm" target="_blank">TONC</a> is easily the most complete, up-to-date and (importantly) correct tutorial I'm aware of, although it doesn't hold your hand as much as some of the other ones do.
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://thepernproject.com/index.php?system_id=2&amp;page=Tutorials" target="_blank">The PERN Project</a> is one of the oldest tutorials out there; many people in this forum learned on it and it remains an excellent starting point.
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbajunkie.co.uk/" target="_blank">GBA Junkie</a> is an excellent alternative as well.

And I suppose <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbajunkie.co.uk" target="_blank">gbajunkie</a> covers all modes as well.

Damn you're fast.

The newer PERN is good for the bitmap modes and sprites, but doesn't cover tile modes (yet). The old one did, but I can't seem to find that anymore.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
