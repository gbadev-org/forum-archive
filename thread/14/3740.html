    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For those of you interested in learning C++, I'm doing a series of threads on the 3dbuzz forums on the topic. I'll do one every other day or so. Even if you're already proficient with C++ (as I imagine most of you are), I encourage you to check them out and offer feedback on anything I may have missed, explained poorly, or may have just simply gotten wrong (it happens). And even if you have no interest in this sort of thing at all, I still encourage you to check out the web site, <a href="http://www.3dbuzz.com." target="_blank">www.3dbuzz.com.</a> It's mainly dedicated to computer animation and illustration, but it has concentrations in gaming, computer hardware, and game design. It's a great community and they have some awsome resources and a good forum too.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here's the link to the forum with the articles. Lemme know what ya think!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll teach character arrays and strings. I'll leave the rest to a more in depth study. I really wouldn't feel qualified to teach the rest anyway. As I said I've never had any formal training in it (I haven't touched a conventional vector since high school). You guys can feel free, though, to submit a lesson on your own in STL either as a response to one of the threads or as your own.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">When you find yourself in the company of a halfling and an ill-tempered Dragon, remember, you do not have to outrun the Dragon... </span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
