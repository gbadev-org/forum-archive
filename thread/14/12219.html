How to set environment variables for DevKitPro in win98?
<br/>
I cannot use XP on this puter and have tried setting it up for DKP but as yet am still having problems with paths and building source code.
<br/>
<br/>
any help would be greatly apreciated</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You need to make sure that the path name to the devKitPro tools has no folders with spaces in them.  Then you need to add a few things to your PATH environment variable (not sure on WIN98 where that is).  If you put devKitPro in "c:\devkitPro" then your path needs:
<br/>
<br/>
c:\devkitPro\msys\bin
<br/>
<br/>
You will also need a DEVKITPRO environment variable (assuming it is installed where I said):
<br/>
<br/>
/c/devkitPro
<br/>
<br/>
Some of the included makefile also assume the the DEVKITARM and DEVKITARMBIN are defined.  Again assuming you installed as I said:
<br/>
<br/>
DEVKITARM  -  /c/devkitPro
<br/>
<br/>
DEVKITARMBIN - /c/devkitPro/bin
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This should be all that is needed for ARM development.  There are more that "could" be defined but this is the minimum.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You need to edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
<br/>
<br/>
see <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/ac.htm" target="_blank">http://www.computerhope.com/ac.htm</a>
<br/>
<br/>
add c:\devkitPro\msys\bin to the path variable in there and add the two variables DEVKITPRO and DEVKITARM.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">

<br/>
SET DEVKITARM=/c/devkitPro/devkitARM
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
These assume that you used the installer &amp; installed in the default location, replace c:\devkitPro and /c/devkitPro in the paths above as appropriate if you used a different path.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Note:</span> DEVKITPRO &amp; DEVKITARM contain unix style paths

You'll need to reboot your PC after editing AUTOEXEC.BAT<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

I was surprised to see it there as well but I did not want to kill some other part of the install.  It may have been added by some application I just installed (CodeBlocks::) or I might have used in a makefile some time in the past and not cleaned it up.  I will remove it and see what breaks. Sorry for the miss-information in this case.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ok, added comments to autoexec.bat
<br/>
this is what i got.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; "make" 
<br/>
Makefile:10: /c/devkitPro/devkitARM: Permission denied
<br/>
Makefile:10: /gba_rules: No such file or directory
<br/>
"make": *** No rule to make target `/gba_rules'.  Stop.
<br/>
<br/>
This is Line 10 of the makefile     include $(DEVKITARM)/gba_rules
<br/>
<br/>
gba_rules is where it should be, my puter is just blind, should have gone to specsavers
<br/>
<br/>
this laptop is 233mmx and used only for dev'ing, MPLab and stuf, i did put XP on here and devkit worked first time but it was like following a tractor down a narrow lane, slow and frustrating, so thats why it needs to run on WIN98.
<br/>
<br/>
anyhow, i'll keep at it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
your surgestions have helped but i still get this error with gba_rules, to see if it was just the file i built a project for NDS and Make came up with the same error except for DS_rules instead
<br/>
If that makes any sense</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The utilities assume unix style folder and file names so no spaces allowed.  I have always done the make from the "msys" command prompt not the windows command prompt so I don't know if this will make a difference.  I just tried it from the command prompts on XP and it works for me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
