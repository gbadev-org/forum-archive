<br/>
I wish to use a timer to check how long a piece of code takes to execute. I would like to able to quickly read that value myself. Is there any quick way of gettin at it without having to use font sprites etc..... i read in another forum about puttin it in an easy to find part of memory and looking at it in an emulator, but i cant find that link....can u do this, an if so, how would you do it?
