    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I have looked though the forums and have seen people talking about multiplexing and they refer to using it in the scenario when you want to have more sprites on screen that 128.
<br/>
<br/>
So how does it work....if I had 128 64 by 64 sprites (yes I know, that wont fit into sprite space), how could I draw them all on screen at once....
<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading about swapping in sprite data during the HBlank....
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone just tell me a little more?
<br/>
<br/>

At specific times during draw, set hblank DMA to rewrite the OAM locations corresponding to the topmost sprites with data corresponding to sprites below them.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Beware, with 64x64 sprites, you'll also run into too many sprites on a line issues.  Also, with multiplexing, the sprites postions have to be logicall segregated on the screen (In space invaders, your ship sprite is always at the bottom so it is a good canidate for multiplexing, the alien ships and shield barriers are also vertically segregated so same thing.  The bullets though are not.  Guess why shields were killed when aliens got to the same line as them - that's right because of sprite multiplexing conflicts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nope. Taito's <span style="font-style: italic">Space Invaders</span> used a bitmap mode.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
