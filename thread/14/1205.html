My friend flashed a .sav file to his original GBA game cartridge and now it won't save anything at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Can he fix this?
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to perform this correctly?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in Advance.....<br/>_________________<br/>Truly</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I would say that the memory is corrupted and therefore the game isn't able to read or write to it, as it doesn't recognize the data. You could try the following... (I have no idea whether this works so no guarantees!)
<br/>
<br/>
Write the game to a Flash cartridge (as you have a linker, you probably have a flash cartridge), clear it's savegame memory with the linker software and run the game. Then Save a game, download this savegame from the cart to the HD and try to upload that to the original game cartridge. That might set things straight.
<br/>
<br/>
Another option is to clear the savegame memory of the original GBA cart using your flash linker.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you so much for your thoughts on this matter.  I will pass the information along.  Hopefully this helps him.  All I was able to tell him was to flash the rom image, since it's legal cuz he owns the game, with the sav file to the cart.  If he can do it to the original game though, there is no risk obtaining copyrighted material; legal or not, who cares if this works!  Creative indeed.  Thanks again.<br/>_________________<br/>Truly</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
