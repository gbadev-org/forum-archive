    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">iam new to gba development and have a C compile question. some example code I have downloaded has a make.bat file to use with gcc. Other sources have a makefile without file-extension. I dont know how to compile these. I think that these samples have been created as a MSVC++ project right? Do I need to have VC++ installed to compile these sample codes or can I write my own make.bat file?
<br/>
For example take the Neimod player, which has a makefile, nmod.s, main.cpp and a bunch of .c, .h files. How would I compile it without using vc++ installed?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You don't need VC++ to run makefiles. There's a utility called "make" in the devkit advance distribution that runs them. For more information on make, see here:
