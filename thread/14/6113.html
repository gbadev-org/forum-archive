    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">VBA, in my option, is the best emulator out there that supports GBA emulation.  It also can emulate GB, GBC, GBCamera, and some other stuff.  It does have an FPS counter, along with many, many video settings.  Built in debugger and everything-viewer.  Best for a developer or a gamer.
<br/>
<br/>
VBA, or VisualBoy Advanced.  Google it.  Should be the first link.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It might be your code, and not the emulators.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I like Visual Boy for it's gdb interface that makes it possible to debug my games directly in my favorite IDE (Eclipse). VBA is also very stable and sound works well.
<br/>
On the other hand, I like some of the Views (OAM, Sprite, Background, ...) of MappyVM more than the views I have in VBA. But mappy has a bad debugging, no sound and runs a bit slower. 
<br/>
No$GBA is also very good, but you can only debug in the commercial version.
<br/>
<br/>
I use VBA for debugging and sound and sometimes Mappy if I want to inspect contents of my Map and VRAM.
