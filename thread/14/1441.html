    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey there - i have a a set of polygon (2d) functions one of which uses sin/cos lookups to rotate the coordinates of a polygon and then draws a line from point to point. THe rotation works great, but is way too fast.
<br/>
<br/>
As a test of the function I put the rotation function in a while loop in main(). I'm using WaitForVSync() to hopefully keep things from running too fast, but it still spins faster than I can even see it! I thought that WaitForVSync()  would give me a framerate of 60 fps and it would then take 6 seconds for the polygon to roatte with the angle incremented every frame...is that not true?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">answered my own post - i shouldnt have been incrementing the angle passed to the function - it's a 'rotateby' as opposed to 'rotateto'.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
