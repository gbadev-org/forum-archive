    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After lots of thinking, I have decided its probably best for me to use 16 colour palettes
<br/>
<br/>
I have a map with 2 layers, background layer 0 is the actual floor tiles and background layer 1 consists of all the walls etc
<br/>
<br/>
Trouble is I have heaps of tiles and all my tiles from background 0 nearly use up all my 16 palettes..
<br/>
<br/>
My actual question is "is it possible for a background to access the 16 sprite palettes instead?"
<br/>

<br/>
I have been thinking of that as a solution, seems very complicated to me to assign sprites to build up a background that moves around etc.  Just cant get my head around it
<br/>
<br/>
but I do need to redesign the tiles so they can share better, the way I was looking at it was to make layer 0 use 8 palettes and layer 1 use the other 8 - bad idea when you have lots of tiles for both layers..
<br/>
<br/>
I guess now it means *retracing* all these tiles with different colour indexes ... sigh</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you really - really need all the extra palettes, you could setup a system where every 8 scan lines, you use hblanks to reload the sprite/BG palettes.  This way, every set of chars could have its own unique 16/16 (or 256) palette set.  It will cost you a farily hefty CPU hit, but it gives you a ton of pretty colors to work with.  BTW, this goes from somewhat difficult to very difficult if you need to scroll vertically on the screen...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
