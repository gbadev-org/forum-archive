    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I am new to GBA development and in fact new to GBA also...
<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that there are different possibilities in terms of choosing a development enviroment/compiling tools/libraries.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any comparison made between the different tools to help a newbie decide what better suits him.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I am actually more worried about the tool chain and libraries rather than the actual development enviromens, I mentioned the development enviroments since some of the tools seem to come with the environment.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically I am wondering what is the difference between devkitAdvance, devKitPro, Ham... and any other free tool I should consider
<br/>
<br/>
All of them seem to use gcc, is that correct? so where is the difference, is it mostly a matter of libraries that come with the devkit? are some of the devkits easier to use, faster, better???
<br/>
<br/>
I guess it is more a matter of likes, but what made you choose a certain devkit?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DevkitAdvanced has not been updated for years, devKitPro is typically the way to go. The <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ngine.de/index.jsp?pageid=3510" target="_blank">HAM library </a>has many useful functions that can be helpful for a beginner.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The HAM Library (at least last time I checked) is not natively (not in eabi format) compatible with the devkitPRo tool chain.  The object files can be extracted and modified (converted to eabi format) with tools to fix this.  The libraries for GBA development are not in general tool chain dependent but I do not use any of them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the answers. I think I have a good idea of what should I go for and what can I expect from the different dev kits.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,
