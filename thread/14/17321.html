    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm interested in GBA developing; I've done a few simple things with C, not so much C++ but I'm in the process of learning more about that.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm curious about which cart I should use- there is a few that I've seen but I'm reading alot of mixed reviews.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm asking about the cart first because I'd like to play with other homebrew people have developed; and maybe play with there source codes etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using the cart. with a normal GBA and a GBA Micro; not a DS. 
<br/>
Which is ideal for that? I've been looking at the Supercard SD but mixed reviews.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Also, would it be possible to port a game like VVVVVV to GBA?

Or would it be impossible and would have to just start from scratch?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I'm trying a new one right now, I'll place it in the retailer feedback once i'll receive my goods, but I'm afraid he only had ds flashcards... GBA one seems to get harder to come by...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'dd prefer to respond you in retailers feedback as it's surelly forbitten there. but I'm afraid the retailer feedback section mod's are MIA...
<br/>
<br/>
well I ordered a DSTWO from there along with other products, including a E27 led lamp with a big heatsink, a USB-lan adaptor a car y power splitter and some other goods. the delivery was quite long (expect the same as DX, ~2weeks). out of my order, they send a wrong led light lamp model (and it has a much smaller heatsinks and it runs quite hot), the USB-lan network adapter was broken (did not report a VID/PID when pluged in differents computers), the Y splitter was not delivered yet (even if it was marked in stock and still is). 
<br/>
their customer support did not react at all about the wrong led light being sent, I got a response for the lan adapter, it seems I'll get a replacement sent. haven't heard of it yet and i'm still waiting for my car adapter... but I got my DSTWO and it's quite awesome I'dd say...
<br/>
<br/>
DX is much better in my opinion... too bad they don't sell flashcard anymore (it's strange since they still sell modchips...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If mods are absent, the preferred way to talk about retailers is via private message.  It could make sense to list the products you purchased and why so that multiple people can learn from your experience.  Most people will not want all of those products and the same product is usually sold by multiple retailers, so it makes sense to send the name of the specific retailer you used via private message, at the very least.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
