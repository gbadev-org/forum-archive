<br/>
<br/>
I've seen a lot of impressive demos around here, but does that impress the companies? What do you think the companies will look at? The technical stuff, the source, the design or something else? Probably everything, but what do you think is the most important thing to look for?
<br/>
<br/>
Have anyone here actually got hired by a big company to develop GBA games or you havn't tried?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How you win "the company's hearts"? To work for them as a programmer, or a publisher to publish your game?
<br/>
<br/>
If you want a programming job at a developer, make something nice that you can show them. A working gamedemo is usually more appealing than a bunch of graphic effects as there's a lot more to a game than just graphics. These days, quite a lot of companies will ask some questions about programming as well.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to publish a game, convince the publisher they will make a LOT of money by publishing your game! (publishers are scum imho!;-)<br/>_________________<br/>If everything fails, read the manual: If even that fails, post on forum!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
