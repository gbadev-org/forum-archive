    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got a simple 2D game here with realtime exploration and turn-based combat (it plays a bit like the original King's Bounty). I've even got the low-level graphics stuff sorted out (I've got a 2D compositor that can do smooth translations, which is enough for what I need). Problem is I have no sprites. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have no graphics or sound effects at this point, so the game could theoretically have any kind of theme - fantasy, sci-fi, modern, whatever. I'll take anything at this point. I can't really move on to the next phase of game development until I have something I can actually play, and apparently I need sprites just to figure out what the hell is going on. (ASCII output isn't doing it for me, and I want to properly test my compositor.) 
<br/>
<br/>
To get started I need sprites for several monsters, a player's avatar, and maybe some terrain types. I'd prefer some of the sprites to be animated, so I can get used to working with them. 
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can make specific suggestions, I'd be grateful. I might even post gameplay footage, whenever it's ready. 
<br/>
<br/>
Technically this is for an iPhone game I intend to release on the App Store, so proper licensing is a plus. On the other hand, I probably won't use these sprites in the final product, so it's not a big deal if they're not 100% legitimate - I just want to get back to work on my game, and I guess I need sprites to do that. 
<br/>
<br/>
I know this isn't an iPhone forum, but someone poe-nted me here. And anyway, I think we have common ground on this.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by kelpfoot on Mon Oct 05, 2009 8:44 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is my first real crack at making a game, and it seems like you guys know what you're doing better than I do. Just to make sure I'm not going to run into any show-stopping problems, is it OK if I try to explain the game's basic architecture to all of you? 
<br/>
<br/>
I know that almost all software projects ultimately fail (videogames very much included), so I'm trying to keep everything as brain-dead simple as possible. To that end the game basically has four parts:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>A "main" loop (not actually called main()) that basically runs forever and that is in charge of updating the game world. It interacts with the "interface" and "backend" components.
<br/>
</li><li>A backend, which is mostly just a bunch of variables to keep track of the state of the game world. It contains an array to represent the world map, lists of all monsters/enemies that are roaming around, et cetera. Once per frame, the "not-main" loop will read from the backend, do some calculations (some of which are determined by user input), and then update the state of the backend. This is how "time" progresses in the game. 
<br/>
</li><li>A 2D compositor, that reads from the backend (once per frame, when it gets called at the end of each iteration of the not-main loop). It combines the values it reads from the backend with sprite data, and uses this information to draw each frame (painter's algorithm). 
<br/>
</li><li>An interface, which consists of components supplied almost entirely by Apple. It displays buttons and a view; the view contains the framebuffer drawn by the compositor, and the buttons correspond to variables that are accessed by the not-main loop. </li></ul>
<br/>
I can provide more information (like headers) if that would be helpful. 
<br/>
<br/>
I also need to figure out initialization, menus, transitions (like from exploration to combat), and save/loads. I have an inkling how to do all these things (eg save/loading the game by pausing the not-main loop, storing/overwriting the backend, and then resuming). 
<br/>
<br/>
In spite of all of this, and also in spite of the fact that I've written quite a bit of code already, I still feel completely overwhelmed. I'd be relieved in someone more experienced than myself could point out where I'm about to fuck up. Advice welcome.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The overall architecture sounds pretty reasonable.
<br/>
<br/>
Really, the best way to learn it is to do it.  Over and over again.  You will mess things up, and wish you had done it differently.  That's how you learn.  My biggest suggestion is to smart small, and build up incrementally.  If you plan for a huge RPG project for your first game, you are setting yourself up for utter failure.  But if you start relatively small, you'll learn a lot as you go.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What about the compositor? It's just some bullshit I wrote myself; it doesn't even use OpenGL or anything. (I looked around for some open source libraries, but none were stable/well-documented/available under a good license, as far as I could tell.) Was that a huge mistake? 
<br/>
<br/>
I've got a 300 * 300 display area for the framebuffer, I need at least four rendering layers, and I want at least 30fps; given my slightly brain-damaged algorithm (which processes transparent pixels), that's 10,800,000 pixels/second. Do you think this will work out for me, or am I going to pull some hair out optimizing this bitch? (I haven't done any performance testing, yet; I'm still working on how to import those sprites.)

Well, beginners is somewhat the wrong forum for it, but I don't think people will mind now that the thread is created.  Although I'd recommend more descriptive textual posts than the last.  Or add some screenshots, or more info about your game, or something along those lines, to try to grab our interest ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want to know the basic gameplay mechanics, I suggest you watch some YouTube videos of the original King's Bounty. My game will hopefully play a bit like that, when I'm finished. 
<br/>
<br/>
Did I mention that my screenshots were uninteresting? Because they are.

<br/>
What you're seeing is an example of "exploration mode," where the player wanders around freely on the world map. Underscores indicate navigable terrain, 'M' indicates everything else. (There will eventually be other kinds of terrain, like forests, mountains, et cetera.) The seven by seven character grid is an ASCII representation of the game map. (I could obviously make the grid bigger, and I should probably be using a fixed-width font, but then again, there's still all sorts of little shit I haven't done yet.) 'P' indicates the player's current position. The directional buttons cause the player to move one square in the appropriate direction, assuming this is possible. They also cause the game to advance by one unit of time (exploration isn't realtime yet). 
<br/>
<br/>
The green thing is a framebuffer I'm not actually using at this point. Helpfully, it can receive touch events and bind them to actions, which will be useful later on, but it doesn't do me any good just yet. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Menu button works, but only insofar as it pauses the game and changes the display output - but otherwise it doesn't actually do anything. 
<br/>
<br/>
Combat is similar to the menus, in that I have hooks to handle it, but it's not really implemented yet. I'll also need to add more UI buttons, obviously. (Small refinement over King's Bounty: It will hopefully be possible for players to select units on screen by tapping them instead of using the D-pad.)
<br/>
<br/>
The UI is ugly as sin at this point, but I can easily fix that later on, when I find appropriate tooltips or whatever. Interface builder is unbelievably easy. 
<br/>
<br/>
My main priorities at this point are 1) to add transitions to exploration mode, so players can visit towns/collect loot/fight roaming monsters; 2) to populate the world map with towns/loot/roaming monsters; 3) to learn Cocos2D so I can integrate my project with it. I probably won't have time for any of these things until this weekend.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, that tiny boxed-in world map is mostly just for testing. The window is scrollable (centered on the hero); new maps can be loaded from text files, with sizes (currently, arbitrarily) up to 1024 * 1024. The format goes like this:
<br/>
<br/>
4 4 m m m m m _ _ m m _ 1 _ m m m m m
<br/>
<br/>
The first two numbers mean that this is a 4 square by 4 square map. The 'm' indicates what I assume will eventually be a mountain. Underscores are passable terrain, and the 1 indicates that the square preceding it contains the object whose reference number is 1 (that would be the hero). It would render like this:
<br/>
<br/>
M M M M
<br/>
M _ _ M
<br/>
M p _ M
<br/>
M M M M
<br/>
<br/>
With p indicating the player's square. 
<br/>
<br/>
(When I have graphics set up, I plan to let the player move distances shorter than one square, so that the animation is smooth; but as far as the game engine is concerned, the player will probably still be occupying the area of an entire square.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, it turns out that (because of how the App Store works) I'll either need to pay a lot of money to incorporate or I'll have to release the app under my real name, and unfortunately the name "kelpfoot" is also associated with an occasionally douchey forum that is best kept far from my personal life. For my privacy, I'm probably not going to discuss any personal projects from now on. 
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, there's one more thing I'll say. Even though I've hammered out all the logic/backend stuff, to the point where literally all I need to do is send information to a compositor function and wait for it to return a rendered frame, I'm having quite a challenge getting to the next step. 
<br/>
<br/>
The idea of having to actually load hundreds of images into a program and then manage them seems daunting, to say the least. Furthermore, I can't really think of any elegant way to do it. I could just load the binary pixel data straight into the compositor I already wrote, and this would be the easiest thing, but I'd still have to do a lot of hand-tuning for each individual sprite and animation loop, and the end result would be difficult to modify later on. I could write an interface to load sprites from an external file, but first I'd need to think of a way to do that, and then I'd need to actually write and test a fair bit of code - and I'm not 100% sure that this will give me any practical advantage over the easier method. 
<br/>
<br/>
Lastly I can integrate my game with an existing project, like Cocos2D, but this is probably the most difficult of all, and once again I'm not actually sure what practical advantages it will bring me in terms of getting work done. 
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I actually do have one last question: Is there an easy method of dealing with sprites and I've overlooked it, or is this something where you have to just sit down and slog through it the hard, obvious way?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I'm not sure exactly what you're asking, but each sprite should have both an image, and a set of information that tell properties about it, such as animation frames, timing, etc.  They should get loaded together at the same time, so that the display code just processes the properties and displays the image for the sprite appropriately.
<br/>
