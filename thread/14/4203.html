    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">is it possible to scale down sprites on the screen as ive got an image map created using a template of 8 frames saved from a tutorial (these pictures where a lot bigger than what i need therefore there is a lot of transparent space around the sprites) how would i work out how to scale this images down so they could plug straight into my program i currently have a 8 frame image which is 65 X 512
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know what you mean by "what are the different scales of everything".  The GBA screen is 240x160, so you should use art that's suitable for that resolution.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
