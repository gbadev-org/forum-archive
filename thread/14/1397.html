    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey there, I'm new to the GBA dev scene and I've got some questions.  I was wondering what dev kit is most commonly used for non commercial games.  My other question is what's the difference between one of the free dev kits and the one you buy from Nintendo?  I heard the main difference is that when you buy the package licensed by Nintendo you get some hardware to test your stuff on.  Is there any difference in code?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.

pc software: DevKit Advance by Jason Wilkins.
<br/>
hardware: MBV2 cable and/or F2A cartridge with linker.

They're both Windows-hosted GBA-targeted GCC distributions, but the free one has better C libraries.  Nintendo's has full BIOS documentation and libraries for reading and writing cart save data.  Nintendo's may also have better documentation of some of the GBA's more obscure quirks.

You can get independently made hardware at lik-sang.com or success-hk.com.

The free one has better C support and will correctly handle 'const' vs. non-'const' data.
<br/>
<br/>
But then, I haven't seen Nintendo's; I'm just relying on what I've read in this board and gbadev@yahoogroups.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by tepples on Fri Jun 06, 2003 6:01 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
