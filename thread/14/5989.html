    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interworking allows ARM and THUMB code to work together in the same program; as long as you use only ARM or only THUMB code it should still work even if one file does support it and another doesn't. That said, it is recommened to have everything support interworking.

If you get this message you may have forgotten the '-mthumb-interwork' flag somewhere in compiling and/or linking; where does it happen exactly?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
