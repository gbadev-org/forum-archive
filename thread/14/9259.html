    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys.. I'm new.. I am in college right now learning C++ programming.. unfortunately it seems that most of the GBA programming is done in C and so it all looks a little egyptian too me.. anyways I have read multiple tutorials/books and it all makes perfect sense too me untill they get to doing tile backgrounds ( the most important part ) I can copy the source from the tutorial or w/e and get it to work, but whenever i try to make my own it either doesnt work at all or it comes out as jibberish.. like im trying to use the wrong bit or size or w/e for my tilemap and its all screwed up.. anyways.. 
<br/>
<br/>
just wondering what tutorial you guys would suggest reading for this particular subject It is obviously not impossible to learn as all of you have accomplished it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

OK, there are a few differences, but mostly in that C++ has features that C doesn't, not the other way around. 
<br/>
If C/C++ is still gibberish to you, well, there's always assembly :P

Even if you can't get GBA tilemaps to work right now, do you understand the <span style="font-weight: bold">principle</span> of tilemaps? For example, can you understand <a class="postlink" href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/tonc/regbg.htm#img-map" target="_blank"> these figures</a>? How the the numbers in the tilemap of fig 1c use the tiles from fig 1b to create fig 1a? And when you try something on your own, what do you do differently?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good news guys .. Took me a good i dunno 2-3 hours but i finally understand tiles and how to make my own maps w00t .. however .. I see in a couple diffrent tutorials / books that 512 by 512 is the biggest you can make a map so i guess now the question in how would i make a map longer than that? would i have to set it up all externally to match up and then say something like 
<br/>
<br/>
if char_x = 512
<br/>
{
<br/>
 setup new map here
<br/>
}
<br/>
and then just keep doing that over and over for every multiple of 512 or is there an ezer way to go about it that im not seeing? im not actually planning on making a mario clone fyi , but I just want to be able to .. basically im just trying to learn how to do it in case the situation would arise at some point in my GBA development career. anyways . . any help greatly appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
