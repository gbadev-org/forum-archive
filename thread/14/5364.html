    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi..im a young proggramer trying to make games...im from Mexico, i just started a week ago, i?m new at this and im makin' a frogger clon(very bizarre)... but i can't check for just one press...mi frog jumps down 20 pixels everytime and im one press jumps five or more times...how can i check the single press? 
<br/>
i heard something about button states but i can't change my button state and then return to the original without using another key...example...my frog jumps with the KEY_DOWN and my buttonstate become =1 to retunr the buttonstate to 0 i need to press the KEY_A...
<br/>
<br/>
ah another thing...how can i slow mi snake...(im also making(or trying to make) a snake clon) but this the problem...my snake sprite is a 8*8 and for example if I press the KEY_DOWN the snake goes down 1 pixel at time but i want to make the snake to move 8 pixels at time but when i do this my snake becomes very fast...how can i slow things down?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Are you making sure to check for keypresses only once per vblank?
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That's not what was meant. Keep a key state for each button: for KEY_DOWN you'd store either "pressed" or "unpressed", and the frog would move only if last state was "unpressed" and current state is "pressed".
<br/>

Wait several vblanks before moving the snake. If you move the snake only once every six vblanks, it'll go six times slower than if you move the snake every vblank.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">let me see if I get it...i need a key state for each button...example KEY_DOWN pressed =state0 and KEY_DOWN unpressed=1 if I try to press the KEY_DOWN  while mi button state is 0...then nothing will happen right?
<br/>
<br/>
and the wait for VBLANK is already done..tanx....
<br/>
but do you know a simple Delay function in GBA like in c (to make timers or something)
<br/>
<br/>
by the way the snake project is harder than i though jejeje...this is what i've done so far...
<br/>
the snake head move in all directions
<br/>
the 1 food is eadible
<br/>
and the 1 food makes my snake grow larger
<br/>
<br/>
but the second food mess all things... 
<br/>
<br/>
or i can get all the foods but no food makes my snake grow 
<br/>
<br/>
