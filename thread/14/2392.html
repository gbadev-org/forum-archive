    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I've quite a bit of C/C++ experience, have done a few of the beginner tutorials for GBA development, and would like to now work on a <span style="font-weight: bold">small</span> , I repeat small, project.  I know an artist guy who is pretty good, and have a couple of ideas but am open to suggestions.  Basically if you want to work on something fun, no real pressure, and maybe the start of something pretty good, get in touch with me!  A couple ideas I have right now are: 
<br/>
<br/>
- a children's type game where you have to look after a goat or maybe a couple of goats..  
<br/>
- a crystal trading game, where you need certain crystals to complete tasks, and there is a evil opponent doing the same as you..
<br/>
.. and a couple others, but I'm really open to suggestions.  
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways I was thinking it would be cool to have:
<br/>
- a cvs type repository where the code could be located..
<br/>
- maybe look at some groupware type tools for ease of interaction
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways contact me on icq or through a private msg here and we can talk more&gt;&gt;
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can help you ... for finding a free cvs repository
<br/>
look at <a class="postlink" href="https://www.freepository.com/" target="_blank">https://www.freepository.com/</a>
<br/>
 it is free and work well (not like that slow or no-responding overloaded sourceforge).
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think you need a groupware ... a well-configured and well-tuned phpBB or  phpNuke must fit your needs. (I'm talking for 'small' project)
<br/>
<br/>
(sorry I can't do anymore, I'm am working on too many 'small' project that take all my time when I don't work :-s)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have played a lot of kids' games, though, so I could give you some ideas.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
