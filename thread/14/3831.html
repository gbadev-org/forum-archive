    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unfortunately, Nintendo is very restrictive on whom they grant publishing licenses to. Unless you are an established games publisher with a proven track record it is unlikely you will be considered.

I don't know. Maybe Mike can enlighten us as to what kind of criteria Nintendo uses. All I have is anecdotal information.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nintendo doesn't require that you purchase any dev hardware from them directly. Once you're a licensed developer you are free to either purchase the hardware from them or sn systems. I've seen the Nintendo kits and wasn't very impressed. The kit from Sn systems is $5000 and is a dream to work with. SN systems will let you demo a kit (hardware and software) from them for 30 days without charge but you have to be on the Nintendo developer list. 
<br/>
<br/>
I believe Nintendo details the licensing agreement and criteria on the warioworld website.  Last I heard they weren't licensing new developers unless you already were working with a licensed publisher.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
