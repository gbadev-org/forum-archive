    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are there any decent sound/music tutorials you can recommend, I did a Google search and there doesn't seem to be many, a lot of tutorials just have the title and nothing written about it.
<br/>
<br/>
I've seen the Maxmod, but I was really hoping to start from scratch, even if it isn't great at least I'll understand it better.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://sacredpotion.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color: red">My Homebrew Games</span></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You might want to look at deku tree's tutorials if you want to create one from the ground up. Try using a music program like Reaper and maybe a Renoise to get a feel for what goes on in mixing and music playback.
<br/>
<br/>
In short, your mod player is a sequencer; each of the channels have to be mixed and streamed, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After reading Deku's tutorial (which is VERY good), you may want to implement other formats like S3M, XM, IT, or even Midi (but MaxMod can play all tracker formats and Sonic AS can play midi ;)) as an exercise.
<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, Deku's tutorial = t3h r0ckz0rrz, hehe. It's how I made my first (yet epic failing &gt;_&gt;') S3M players that I then expanded to Midi and ported to the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

EDIT:
<br/>
wow, you have to do so much :/ no wonder I never had sound in anything I do :(
<br/>
<br/>
And it seems even more complicated for DS which is what I wanted it for since arm7 can only access the sound. Sick of my games being silent tho, has such a big impact on it :(<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://sacredpotion.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color: red">My Homebrew Games</span></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you just want sound wouldn't it just be a matter of finding a library that does what you want and starting sound events?  All my homebrew is silent at this point too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hehe, well, for tracker formats you have to support many effects and stuff which is why Deku's tutorial is so long. Midi is pretty straight forward but not as flexible. You could take a look at my Midi player and maybe get an idea of how to do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Using libnds functions to play sound it's not so hard to implement a simple module player, for instance to play XMs/MODs with no effects (do a search for AxelF.mod to see what I mean)
