    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have just converted from DevKitAdvance to DevKitARM.
<br/>
<br/>
Yikes it takes ages to start my program now, it starts off as a white screen for ages then the program starts.  Im guessing its when I'm loading in all my gfx data.  Same code works on devkitadvance with no notice of delays
<br/>
<br/>
my compile code as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
arm-elf-g++ -O2 -g -mcpu=arm7tdmi -mthumb -mthumb-interwork -c main.cpp
<br/>
<br/>
arm-elf-g++ -O2 -mthumb -mthumb-interwork -g -specs=gba.specs main.o -lafm -o test.elf
<br/>
<br/>
arm-elf-objcopy -O binary test.elf test.gba
<br/>
<br/>
Any idea why it would do this?  I was expecting it to be faster =(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The devkitARM r12 release has a bug in its startup code, specifically in the part that clears IWRAM (which is commonly used for global variables and the stack). There's a <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=5790" target="_blank">thread in Announcements and Comments</a> that tells how to fix it. I think there are a few other kinks in r12 that I can't quite put my finger on <span style="font-style: italic">yet</span>; at the moment, it might be easier for a beginner to downgrade to devkitARM r11.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

tepples may be fast, but he sure isnt good at finding bands. Why not use kazaa if you want to find kinks' songs? I think you've forgotten GBAdev is for devving, and so is devkitARM, not illegal music downloading..
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT : It seems my rather frail attempt at humour has miserably failed. the kinks are a band..
<br/>

Anyway, Kazaa has always sucked; there are better places to get, ahem, "test vectors" for GSM Player.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
