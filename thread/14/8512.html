how many 64x64 sprites is it possible to display at a time ? it seems limited to 8, am I right ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Never heard of that limitation of 950 sprites/pixels, what does it mean exactly?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Then they can all point to the same location in VRAM, and you can use as many OAM entries as you like (up to 128 of them) to replicate it as many times as you want.
<br/>
<br/>
A single 64x64 image in 16-colours will consume 2K out of the 32K of VRAM you have. If they were all different, you could only fit 16 such images into VRAM (and then you'd have no room left for other sprites).

The GBA can only process so many sprite-pixels on each scanline - including for sprites that have transparent regions or are obscured by other sprites or BGs - before dropout starts to occur. This amount is generally 950-1200 pixels, so it's rarely a problem unless you are using scale/rot sprites, which consume more than normal sprites do.
