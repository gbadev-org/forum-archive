    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just to let you know...coding in assembly isn't really necessary for a beginner (and I'm assuming you are a beginner since you're in the beginners' forum).
<br/>
<br/>
Assembly is really nice for fine-tuning those bottlenecks but if you're attempting to start up some GBA homebrew I think assembly might be a little bit much to bite off in the start.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll probably have more luck and A LOT less frustration if you start out with C.
<br/>
<br/>
That being said...if you are still sure you want to use assembly, what exactly are you trying to accomplish?  Do you just want the text to be aligned to the right (like a right alignment in Word) or do you want the words to be backwards (i.e. "hello" would be displayed "olleh").
<br/>
<br/>
And just as tepples said...it would help to see the ASM code you're using right now. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You could start with C++.  There are also things like BASIC.

i know you can do GBA coding using C++ (altho i find C to be a better fit)...but BASIC?  really?  for the GBA?  ...i had no clue...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am pretty sure some BASIC packages are floating around, but I have never used them myself.  I think there is a LUA package out there as well.  I'm sure other things have been release that I have completely forgotten about.
