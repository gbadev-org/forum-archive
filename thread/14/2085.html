<br/>
<br/>
I know this question has been discussed, but to tell you the truth i didnt get much from the other posts, so hopefully someone out there can explain this to me :)
<br/>
<br/>
what id like to do is have a 240 X 512 bg that i can scroll down/up and have loop back onto itself. I have a bmp that i can use to do it, problem is im not sure how to get visualham to roll the bmp up onto itself. I know i need to be able to show the top and tail of my bmp on the screen to have a nice join, so is there a way of doing it? I understand the concept of tiles,etc, but cant find a tutorial that shows how to work with them in visualham. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now i have already checked out the pern project as was recommended in another post, but the code available looks completely different to what ive been learning for visualham using aaron rogers tutorials, it seems way more low level, hence my lack of understanding it. So once again please help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
