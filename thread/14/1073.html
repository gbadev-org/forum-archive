    <h4>#5210 - Timmy - Wed Apr 23, 2003 7:57 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to start programming for GBA, but almost all of the tutorials I have seen are either half-assed or... not really a tutorial.
<br/>
<br/>
Could anyone guide me to a good tutorial?
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: I Don't know C or C++ yet [atleast enough to do anything] :(
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I really want to get into this, but there aren't many resources around for a beginner...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope to be able to atleast write text to the screen in 2 months... is that a viable or tangeable goal?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You said that you have found C language tutorials on the web, and that you have found them to lack quality.  Have you tried <a class="postlink" href="http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/notes/top.html" target="_blank">this one</a>?
<br/>
<br/>
And if you need a PC-targeted compiler to try out the examples, get <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mingw.org/" target="_blank">MinGW</a>. The term "PC targeted" means that the compiler produces programs that run on the PC, not on the GBA.  It's best to start by writing simple text-based C programs for the PC until you are comfortable with C.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
