    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if (for whatever reason) I decide I want to try and take a GBA game and create a PC version of it (i.e. same exact game - only you'd be able to install it just like any other game, and play it by itself without needing an emulator or anything else like that) is there any known way of doing this? 
<br/>
<br/>
cause if someone actually has tried something like this before (and succeeded) I'd love to know how it was done 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
or even if anyone has any theories about how something like this could be accomplished - that would probably be pretty helpful too<br/>_________________<br/>"An unused mind is like a defective condom - it doesn't do you a piss of good"  ~me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If it's the first one I think you're stuck with emulation...

If it's the second one I don't think you'd ask.<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">basically - what I want to do is 'beef up' a certain game and do a little experimenting with some extra features that I've envisioned for it (stuff like more characters, and what have you) unfortunately though - I'm pretty certain the GBA 'whatever-it-would-be-called' wouldn't be able to keep up with any of these new additions I'd like to tack on...simply because it's already a pretty 'beefy' game as it is, and is most likely just about as jam-packed as it's gonna get 
<br/>
<br/>
what I want to do is find some way to take the essence of the game itself and mold it in some manner that will allow me to expand on it absolutely as much as I'd like to, without having to worry about certain size restrictions or whatever (e.g. the only 'restrictions' it would *technically* have would be the size of my hard drive, speed of my processor, amount of RAM, etc...) 
<br/>
<br/>
so - 
<br/>
<br/>
what I have to figure out (to be able to get this whole idea of mine to work the way I want it to) is how to extract the raw data from a rom file, how to extract the neccessary data from the GBA emulator itself (as well as what exactly would be neccessary I suppose) and how to put it all together into it's own nice neat little package <span style="font-weight: bold">without</span> restricting myself to whatever restrictions are inherient in both the game itself and the GBA due to minimal proccessing power/memory/whatever 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
from there on out I can take care of the rest (e.g. all the 'additions' I'd like to make)<br/>_________________<br/>"An unused mind is like a defective condom - it doesn't do you a piss of good"  ~me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm assuming I'm most likely gonna havta write a whole new game from scratch and then simply copy the stats and stuff from the GBA game to this new one I'd be making...I'm hoping it doesn't come down to that though  :p 
<br/>
<br/>
if there's any way to simply copy the basic structure of the game itself and then just tweak it so it'll run without the emulator - that's what I'd prefer to do (simply because I'm still not <span style="font-style: italic">too</span> familar with all the AI and what have you...so I'm really not sure if I'd be able to re-create those parts on my own)<br/>_________________<br/>"An unused mind is like a defective condom - it doesn't do you a piss of good"  ~me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could abstract out the graphics engine such that it'd run on either GBA or OpenGL. Anything that touches the hardware would go in a separate .c file to be linked into either the PC build or the GBA build.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
