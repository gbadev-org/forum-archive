    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">how do i use, first, easily and then efficiently the 16 color palettes...any tutorial???
<br/>
<br/>
because 'til now im using a 256 color pallete and sometimes i want to change the color of my sprites..but i can't do that without changing all the sprites...i guess that the 16 color palettes works in that way...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ah i already send you some demos and games and i cant find them anywhere, why's this?
<br/>
<br/>
im making some educational games right now...the tangram, a magic square and the hanoi towers...i dont know is this is the right name in english(im translating directly :P) but as soon as i finish i let you know
<br/>
<br/>
remenber...good use of 16 color pallettes...first how to use them easily and then how to use them fast and efficiently<br/>_________________<br/>All human wisdom is summed up in these two words, - 'Wait and hope"

As far as going from "easy" to "fast", don't worry about that until you are actually having speed problems, and then we can discuss what you're trying to do.  (I'm reminded of DekuTree64's signature: the fastest thing you can do with 16 color palettes is to do nothing at all.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
