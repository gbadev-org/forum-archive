    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone have a simple example of how to use TTE in mode 4?  I looked over the TTE demos and the guide and I can't seem to get it working with my game.  
<br/>
<br/>
I'm suppose to be using bitmap rendering, right?  Can I use any other method with mode 4, like object?  
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if I want to make a screen with characters for the player to write his name, what's the best way to go about that?  Should I use TTE to display the characters or should I just have load my own character tiles?  
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
