    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, it's probably best you take a huge step back then. Try coding something simpler, and for the PC. Entry to DS can be very difficult and complicated at times.
<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest you familiarise yourself with C++ on your PC, perhaps start with some simple command line programs so that you understand the basics, then maybe move on to something more complicated such as a pong/space invaders type game. Because Sonic Advance/Rush would be a complicated first step.
<br/>
<br/>
The first steps of coding can be very difficult, and it's best you take it slowly. You'll know when you are ready.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've never had to start from square 1 (basic logic, if...else, for, variables, functions, expressions, etc), so I don't know how to give advice about those topics.

But once you get into the point where you are making a game, I got two magic words: Object Tables.  Design your game code around a big table which contains all the active objects.  Each object may be a player, an enemy, a projectile, whatever.  Each object has properties including coordinates, what the object is, animation information, and some internal counters that control what it will do, and more.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Macintosh computers and computers running GNU/Linux come with a compiler called GCC. For Windows, you can use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mingw.org/" target="_blank">MinGW</a>, a popular port of GCC to Windows. MinGW packaging can be confusing at times, but you probably want the <a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&amp;package_id=240780" target="_blank">MinGW installer</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
You can start by making programs that take text input and produce text output, working from hello world up to more complicated things such as text adventures. Then you can add the <a class="postlink" href="http://alleg.sf.net/" target="_blank">Allegro library</a> so that you can display graphics, play sound, and read joysticks (and the keyboard as if it were a joystick).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're starting out coding, then I'd suggest starting with simple programs for the PC. If you really want to start on the Nintendo DS, I'd say use PALib. I started with PALib to teach myself C programming using this website:

I'm pretty sure that you'd be better off learning on a PC environment though, there's so many useful C/C++ tutorials aimed at beginning on a PC. In any case, good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
