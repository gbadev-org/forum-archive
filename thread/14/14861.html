    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ive been trying to learn how to program, but every tutorial i read is only confusing me more. I am understanding the terms, but when they get into the code, i get lost. My main problem is that the code contains color coded words that they do not explain the meaning of (neither the color or the meaning of the colored words/symbols). There is a simple hello world code at <a href="http://www.palib.info/wiki/doku.php?id=day2" target="_blank">http://www.palib.info/wiki/doku.php?id=day2</a> under usage that uses these colors and words. Could anyone please explain to me what on earth they mean?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most of those color coded words are reserved keywords of the language.  If you don't know what a while() loop is, then you need a basic C porgramming book before you go any further.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the reply, after a little research in C, everything is starting to make more sense. In the code for the hello world, it tells me to put the preprocessor and header as "#include &lt;PA9.h&gt; //Include PAlib." I have downloaded PAlib, but when i put this in the shell, i get the error "The system cannot find the file specified." I know i have the file because i found it hidden in the layers of folders, but why cant the shell acknolege it?
