    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you can just move it off the screen so it's no longer visible (i.e. set x = 240, y = 160)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Or, you can set the scale/rotate flag to off, and the size double flag to on.  That's a sort of obscure trick that has the effect of the sprite not being displayed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA can only display a certain of sprites per line.  Even off screen sprites count towards this limit.  If you are going to move sprite off screen to hide them, set y to 160 as that puts them on a different line.  Sprites disabled with scale/rotat off + size double on are not counted toward the line limited if I recall corretly.  Check the gbatek for details.
