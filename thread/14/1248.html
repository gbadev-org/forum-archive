    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hiho,
<br/>
<br/>
I have some Problems (again :)). I downloaded the DevKitAdvance and the GBAAplicationWizard. If I compile the Tutorial files from 'The Pern Projec' there arn't any problems by using the make.bat (only with tut 4, but this is not importand yet).
<br/>
<br/>
But how can I compile my files using MSVC++. I found a makefile tutorial on gbadev.org (this page :D) but there arn't any Informations, how I could use them with MSVC++('98). Can anyone give me some introductions how to do this? The GBAAplicationWizard doesn't work. Or can someone give me a Project file?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thx,
<br/>

This may or may not help you, but if you'd like to see how to put everything togethor WITHOUT a makefile, check out the source to [url=keeper.fearware.net]keeper[/url]<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://lorrd.fearware.net" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/vzep3wth/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/lorrdbanner.gif">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well its normal for you not to be able to compile if that was what you meant. Try and click build (f7) instead.<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I finally got something working on the makefile front yesterday - using MSVC++7, in the rebuild commandline field (under properties for the project) I put 
<br/>
<br/>
nmake /f makefile.mak

<br/>
where 'makefile.mak' is whatever your mak is called.

<br/>
but I haven't seen that specific tutorial...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have figuered it out. There are still some bugs, but I hope I will get it running... I am using the GBAAplicationWizzard, but have to make some changes to the makefile it created. Somehow this was more or less strange... Do you know this kind of Bug, that you are trying to fix, but it doesnt work, but if you try it two days later it is working :D.

Cu,
