    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi! I m new in GBA-dev, started with a simple Pong game.
<br/>
Now i try to make a silphead playable demo. The original Game for Sega CD uses FMV for background. What is the best way to make a background with scrolling and motion in it? And which mode is best for it. I think i can use animated Sriptes in the background. Is it possible to change Backgrounds in a way it looks like FMV?

Thanks for all help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
