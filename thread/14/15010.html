They play in emulators fine, so I thought it was just the ELF binary, but 
<br/>
<br/>
objcopy -v -O binary yourromname.elf yourromname.gba 
<br/>
<br/>
Said that the input format was wrong, which I am assumming means that it is not in ELF format.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GBAFix, forgot about that. But alas, the headers are fine, I geuss I fixed them before, even still, I tried fixing them again but they still don't work.
<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing is, some of them work and some don't, but I can't find any real consistancy among the ones that don't.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
