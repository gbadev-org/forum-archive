<br/>
Now that we've got that out of the way, I'm looking for a GBA emulator that works as a cartridge. Basically what R4 is for the DS, only a GBA version. It would be even better if there was an update, or file that made R4 play .gba files, but there isn't that I know of...
<br/>
<br/>
I intend to eventually getting around to programming, and whatnot, but however I'm still (reletively) new to this whole thing. (It's been about half a year since I started with R4) So essentially, I'm asking which GBA emulator I should buy. I've only seen the M3 Perfect, CycloDS(If it does what I think it does), SuperCard, and GBA X-rom. I'm really sorta lost right now, lol...<br/>_________________<br/>Procrastinators unite...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">See, I would, but... I have no idea what that is. I know, I know, it's pathetic how little I know.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Ok, let me rephrase this... Is there any program for the r4 that allows GBA games to be played?
<br/>
<br/>
If not, I'll probably go with the 3in1. Sorry for being such a noob... I'm new to all this...<br/>_________________<br/>Procrastinators unite... Tomorrow.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
