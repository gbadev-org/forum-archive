    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm wondering if you can give me an idea of this being possible.  Basically I play gba at work constantly, one game I'm absolutely in love with which is Fire Pro Wrestling 2 but to create some characters there are moves missing in the game and I was hoping to try and edit the game to include these moves.  I do have a bit of programming expirience I took Q-Basic for 2 years in High School and I also took Programming concepts and Cobol though I completely suck at Cobol as I find it a rather useless program.  I've read through and have various C++ for dummies books but haven't actually tried C++ for the most part it seems a bit similar to basic just more complex.  What I was hoping to do was get the code for Fire Pro Wrestling 2 (while not too great at writing code, I think I could read through code all day to find bugs) then add the moves in.  Now I don't know if this is possible so I'm curious if I could animate the sprites in a program like Flash or something then convert the animations to the game.  I'm looking to add like 50 or so moves.  Also if possible I would love to just delete their pre-made characters and imput my own in there so I could have all 277 characters in the game be of my own creation.  So a quick list of things I'm looking for (tutorials, webpages, etc.) would be:
<br/>
<br/>
A place to get the code for Fire Pro Wrestling 2 (something I could buy that would download it to my computer)
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to make animations in Flash then add them to the game?  If so how.
<br/>
<br/>
In editing the game is it possible to delete characters and so forth to add of my own design, then transfer them to a blank cartridge (which I did find a site to buy these at)?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for any advice or knowledge you can bestow upon me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry, but you woh't find anything in this forum related to the disassembly or modification of commercial/copyrighted games.
<br/>
<br/>
You might find some information on hacking games in terms of altering graphics and basic statistics on some other forums, but you won't be able to make any modifications on the level you are interested in.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That has nothing to do with Game Boy Advance Development,Rather than that is Rom Hacking,Wich you will to do hacking by Hex Editors (you already know what hexadecimal numbers are for sure)
<br/>
I dont think there is such rom hacking for that game yet,But you could be the first one to start.
<br/>
To change the images the best way would be unLZ-GBA (if you have a good/massive computer)
<br/>
or you can use GBADecmp.
<br/>
Rather than for the moves and stuff,It might be hard for adding new moves,But you can try and replace various ones.
<br/>
You need an Hex Editor (I recommend Hex Workshop),An Image Decompressor (Note that there is various compressions [Lz77,Huff,RLU] but prolly that game uses Lz77) and Visual Boy Advance GBA Emulator (To do the logging in there so you can get information and offsets of data of the moves)
<br/>
Anyways if you got msn you can add me : <a href="mailto:howlingwolf04@hotmail.com">howlingwolf04@hotmail.com</a>
<br/>
I might help you in those cases.
<br/>
<br/>
And I've noticed something funny here,My name is Dan too o_O
<br/>
Wow the two Dans here helping XD.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
