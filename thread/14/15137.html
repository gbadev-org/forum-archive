(or look for good tutorials online...I believe there's one listed in the FAQ).

C and C++ are full programming languages, something beyond what we can explain well here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Depends on what you want to do.  Some people use C++, some use C, some use ASM, some use BASIC.  Naturally, these people tend to have different goals.
<br/>
<br/>
As for tutorials, google is your friend.

Don't get bogged down in the "video system" discussion...simple answer is that you can't use C# for gba or ds.  C, C++, and ASM are the main choices.  
<br/>
<br/>
There are at least partial implementations of basic, pascal, and maybe a few other languages, but there will be significantly less support for them, so most of us would not recommend those routes without a very specific reason.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
