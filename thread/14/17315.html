    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">how exactly do i use gfx2gba? ive been reading this chapter of a book (http://www.aaronrogers.com/ham/Books/PTGBA/GBA_05.pdf), and at about page 30, it starts getting into bitmaps. 
<br/>
<br/>
some step by step insrtuctions on how to use gfx2gba would be useful, because this book expects me to know a few terms that i dont (like root directory) and also expects me to have a few things on my computer. i keep trying to do what it says, but every time i enter anything in command prompt it says "gfx2gba isnt recognized".
<br/>
<br/>
again, i would like some step by step instuctions to putting a bitmap into a c-array.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

...what?
<br/>
ill try your link, but i already have command prompt. im pretty sure its a standard on all computers with windows
<br/>
<br/>
*update*
<br/>
if i wasnt as clear as i shouldve been, ill try to describe what ive been doing.
<br/>
<br/>
if you double click on my C:\ drive, you will see lots of folders. one is named "gfx". inside that folder is a copy of gfx2gba.exe, bg.bmp (a 256 color bitmap, 240x160), and a shortcut to command prompt. what ive been doing is opening command prompt from the shortcut, and-withcout closing the folder-i type into command prompt "gfx2gba -fsrc -c32k bg.bmp". everytime i do this, the command prompt says that gfx2gba is not recognized. once more, my goal is to get my bitmap into a c-array, so that it can be put in a game through HAM.

No, what it does it open a command prompt in the folder your right click on in Windows Explorer. You select "Open Command Prompt Here" from the context menu. It saves you having to open up the Command Prompt and then CD to the directory to run gfx2gba. The reason it can't find the file is probably because you're not CD'ed (current directory) to the folder containing gfx2gba.exe.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
