<br/>
<br/>
Should I read books on Hex, Assembler, C, Barons. Which books do you reccomend.

i've got that one and it's really not bad. i've got a quite old edition, but it's still worth reading, even today! it's only about c, though. well, once you understand c, you can allways move to learning c++.
<br/>
<br/>
when it comes to programming tools, i recommend getting used to some gui library (mfc [windows only], qt [multi platform], wx [multi platform] etc).
<br/>
<br/>
there's a free, open source version of qt3, which is pretty easy to use and program (comes with all neccessary tools and ide, though it needs to be compiled first - no big deal, as it's just running a batch, and there's a good manual on the project's page!) - once you get the idea of qt (which isn't really hard to understand.) they also have a nice tutorial available. you can also use opengl with qt etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
