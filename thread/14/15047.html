    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello!
<br/>
I'm Endres and first I have got two questions:
<br/>
<br/>
When I used the makefile (one of a tutorial) the error was: </span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">arm-agb-elf-gcc: gba_mb.specs: No such file or directory</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
It seems to be that the Specs files hadn't been installed...
<br/>
But I think that I installed all of the Packages.
<br/>
How can I fix this Problem?
<br/>
<br/>
The Second one is:
<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I've built my own XBoo-Cable (That was fun ^^), but I don't know, how to make programs, which would work with it? Is that the specs Problem?
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, by the way, when you don't understand me, I'm German and my English is very bad, I think ^^"

<span style="font-style: italic">arm-agb-elf-</span> is the platform prefix used by devkitAdvance, which does support specs-files I believe. 
<br/>
<br/>
devkitARM uses <span style="font-style: italic">arm-eabi-</span> (or <span style="font-style: italic">arm-elf-</span> in revisions 18 and lower). Now, before you change the prefix and run the makefile again, remove the old intermediary files with 'make clean'. You'll probably get nowhere when when trying to link objects files compiled by one toolchain by using the linker of another.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a little strange that you have arm-agb-elf-gcc in the makefile though ...

</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">In part, yes. devkitARM requires a specs variable to link correctly. A secondary problem here is that something went awry in devkitARM r21 regarding the linkscript causing a white-screen. Details + fixes can be found <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=14493" target="_blank">here</a>. Finally, don't forget to fix the header of the binary.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
