Is there any way of converting games made for these to GBA?</span>

But if I wanted to develop in in Clickteam and then hire someone smart to do that, how big of a job would it be?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You would be better off paying someone to do the work directly on the GBA. Just tell them what to do and pay them for it. THAT would simplify things.
