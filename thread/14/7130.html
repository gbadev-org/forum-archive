"Beginning Game Boy Advance Programming"
<br/>
<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672326604/qid%3D1129061803/701-0868478-9482744" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672326604/qid%3D1129061803/701-0868478-9482744</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Or should I stick to the gbadev references?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where can I find good GBA EXAMPLES!? NDS too. 
<br/>
<br/>
(I have this idea of using the NDS to convert sounds in the mic to MIDI (have you heard of timidity). A MIDI port for the DS would be cool too, but I guess it requires some hardware mods (and how would i know how to program for that?)  Another idea is to use the DS sounds engine to produce beats on the road...like a fruity loops :)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: reason why I mention MIDI is because I have started to develop MIDI apps for Windows and Linux for university projects. 
<br/>
<br/>
I also read the sticky and its a good resource :) Thank you.
<br/>
But I would like to see some C/C++ code examples please. I seem to learn by looking at sample code :)
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A good place to start is the Beginners GBA tutorial in the Docs &gt;&gt; Tutorials section. Yes, those of you about to yell at me, I know it doesn't exactly use the best of methods, but since you're going to use this mainly for sound (obviously) and won't need to do a lot of graphic processing at first, this will get you a general base for a game going. You should then look into the sound tutorials on site.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, but as for the book I've never read it before.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, for good GBA samples, go to the demo section of this site. Mario Balls, despite it's slightly (ok, VERY) offensive intro is an example of how it should be done. You can also search for demo sound players.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about the DS, but I do know that the GBA does not have any type of midi player. You have to code one for yourself or use someone elses. I hear that actually playing a MIDI file is a bit much on processing for the system and therefore not ideal for games. However, the idea of a MIDI editor might be feasable as that's all it would be worrying about at the time.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The book isn't available, Nintendo apparently prevented it from being published. Despite that the author made it available electronically.
<br/>
<br/>
I would link to it but it's one of the most appalling pieces of misinformation and bad code examples I've ever seen. 
<br/>
<br/>
For GBA tutorials one of the best around is Tonc found at <a href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/tonc/index.htm" target="_blank">http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/tonc/index.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi...i have a nice demo who shows you the very elemental parts of development....
<br/>
<br/>
if you are interested i can send it to you...
<br/>
<br/>
is based in the pong tutorial that i found a while ago...it uses the same functions, with a little of improvement...
<br/>
<br/>
im making a book for development but is in spanish...(coz' most mexicans hate english :S)
<br/>
<br/>
see ya later<br/>_________________<br/>All human wisdom is summed up in these two words, - 'Wait and hope"
