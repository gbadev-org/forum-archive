<br/>
<br/>
I just got my Ez Flash advance 128mb set and would like to know how to "fix the header" as I have heard talked about before. All I know is you need to include the Nintendo logo in the file at the beginning of the ROM. If someone could explain to me exactly how I would do this and what program I should use for this I would be really appreciative.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,
<br/>
Eric</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I got 4 of my programs already on there, it looks awsome and I really am happy my code worked. Now I face one problem they are all called "untitledgame" or something like that, how can I name them? Do I have to do this in the header?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
