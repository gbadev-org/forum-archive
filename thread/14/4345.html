    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Perhaps your operating system doesn't support .bat files. They are written for MS-DOS and also work in Microsoft Windows :)
<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, perhaps the bat file isn't pointing to your compiler, or isn't written to use your specific compiler, or something else.
<br/>
<br/>
You could either, post the output from when you run the bat file to offer some more indication of what could be causing the non-compilation, or you could try using some code from a tutorial with the recommended compiler to give yourself more of a chance of success.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">this particular make.bat uses armasm.exe, armcc.exe and armlink.exe which are both part of the official ARM development suite. If you are using gcc or some other compiler(s), then this particular batch file obviously will not work.
<br/>
<br/>
If you DO have these compilers, then make sure that the .bat file is pointing to them. better still, replace the file with one containing:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">armasm -Littleend -cpu ARM7TDMI boot.asm
<br/>
<br/>
armcc -c -Wall -Otime  -fpu none -Littleend -cpu ARM7TDMI apcs /narrow/noswst ebpp.c  -o ebpp.o -errors errlog.txt
<br/>
<br/>
armlink -bin -first boot.o -map -ro-base 0x08000000 -rw-base 0x2000000 boot.o   ebpp.o   -o ebpp.gba
<br/>
<br/>
del *.o</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
and prefix armasm, armcc and armlink with the directories that contain them.
<br/>
(copy the origional make.bat first, and use notepad to do this).
<br/>
<br/>
If you're not using the official arm dev suite then you would have to change the code a bit to work with your compilers :/ (unless someone were to make a program to do this :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
