    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, trying to find answers to a few questions and I have searched, but some things I don't know which keywords to seach for.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not a newbie, but not hugely experienced, I am half way through making a game and not a total idiot.
<br/>
<br/>
1) I managed to poke the right ppl to release pogoshell 2.0B4 for the EFA, and now it saves, BUT if I write .sav files in pogoshell and then try to copy them to sram folder it works but it doesn't link to the game, as in I cant load in the game it correspondes to. can someone expain why / how pogoshell links saves to games / anything helpfull?
<br/>
<br/>
2) simular to 1, when I overwrite pogoshell the saves are still there but I cant access them from there respective games, why?
<br/>
<br/>
3) if I backup a save from pogoshell and take out the individual saves with a sram explorer program can I then upload a pogoshell save file made up of saves collected together using sram explorer? (cant test yet as they havent fixed the bug on EFA cleint)
<br/>
<br/>
4) kinda a DS question. whats the best way to play ds and gba games on a ds? and what os is there? am i right u use passme or something? can I run megadrive games on a ds (cant on gba, and isn't coz megadrive has dual pro?)<br/>_________________<br/>-Rory

For commercial games, the best way is to use an official Game Pak. For homebrew games, it may depend on the title.

Yes, depending on which version of <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.pocketheaven.com/DS_Firmware" target="_blank">DS firmware</a> you have.

<br/>
There is a Megadrive emulator that runs at 1fps because it hasn't yet been optimized specifically for the DS hardware. Which homebrew ROMs did you want to run?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>

-- You know, the human.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, I only really want 1 game for the ds and its mario 64 which I have the cart for. and I want all the sonic's you see, as I have the carts too and I have lost my mega drive. (actually I'm using first person but its my gf)
<br/>
<br/>
so basically I want to play the games I most definately have but on the DS.
