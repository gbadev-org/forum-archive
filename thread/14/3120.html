    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've just started looking at doing GBA dev stuff again after a while off and have run into a bit of the problem.  On my development machine I have DJGPP (DOS port of GCC targeted at x86) and devkit advance installed. By default I would like to use DJGPP so I have my PATH set to the appropriate directory.  Now when I come to compile a GBA project I would like to be able to temporarily switch my path to something suitable for devkit advance.
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment I'm trying to do this by running 'set PATH=&lt;devkit advance path&gt;' from within my makefile, however this doesn't seem to be successfully setting the path (ie. a path command straight after returns the old path).  Anyone got any suggestions?
<br/>
<br/>
(BTW: I'm developing with Eclipse so just setting the path from within a command window then compiling is not really an ideal solution).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I used to use Windows Millennium Edition for GBA development, compiling tools for my GBA projects with DJGPP. When I switched to Windows 2000, I switched from DJGPP to MinGW because the NT kernel isn't very friendly to DPMI apps, but the basic technique I used in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#tod" target="_blank">TOD for GBA</a> continued to work:<ol type="1"><li>Set your PATH to include your native compiler (e.g. MinGW or DJGPP), then DevKit Advance, then the rest of your PATH. (I do this with batch files when I start a 'cmd' session.)</li><li>Put MinGW in front of your PATH.</li><li>When you want to use native GCC, use <span style="font-weight: bold">gcc</span>.</li><li>When you want to use cross-GCC, use <span style="font-weight: bold">arm-agb-elf-gcc</span>.</li><li>As for files that a custom tool generates, make them depend on that tool's executable.</li></ol><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the help guys, I got it working using tepples method.  I spent a while mucking around with the -B option but it seemed to just plain not work (gcc was unable to find cc.exe no matter which path I specified for -B)... no idea why.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
