    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi peoples.  I'll get the site pimpage over and done with at the start: <a class="postlink" href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/graham.reeds/index.html" target="_blank">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/graham.reeds/index.html</a> If you navigate to @play you will see the one whole tutorial I have partially written.  Comments are welcome. It's a bit dull, but I am currently focusing on content while playing with formatting ideas.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have a few questions about it (I know I wrote it but it currently is a gathering of information from around the 'Net).  What does MinSys actually provide that the 35mb worth of DevKitARM doesn't and why doesn't it?
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the Vis Studio .NET.  I am trying to create a project wizard that will create a new GBA Project - a shell of a Make file with the project name added, have check boxes for whether it should be multiboot, etc.  Currently I can get a test on to create in the VC++ folder but I feel it should either have it's own folder or be in Other Projects.  I've checked around MSDN but only found where they keep CS and VC projects.  
<br/>
<br/>
On a similar vein and mentioned on my site, the Options&gt;&gt;VC++ Directories has a drop-down box entitled Platforms.  Is it possible to add your own Platform and if so how?  Linked to the previous problem of a GBA Project.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Pretty cool, but I would like to see one on getting HAM and .NET to play nice.  I do enjoy using HAM so far (despite the so-called isolationism from hardware), and while VisualHAM has grown on me from constant usage I would prefer my .NET IDE since it's what I'm more accustomed to.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll have a look into it.  I much prefer seperation from thirdparty tools and the compiler.
<br/>
<br/>
The main area I am looking at is extending the IDE to make it even more friendly towards GBA development, and not just how to add a few bin directories to it.  There's a way of extending it but I don't currently know how, and the MSDN is very cryptic about how to go about it.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there should be a forum for IDE related threads?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I am not making much sense as I am filled with flu at the moment.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I doubt there's enough IDE related topics to constitute the necessity for a seperate forum.  But the idea of getting the most from .NET and GBA development is definitely a solid one, and I've seen other people on this and other forums asking about it so there's at least a target audience for writing a tutorial and perhaps an FAQ as well.  Like I said, for a real sense of completion you should definitely look to accomodate other people in their development choices though.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd have a look, but I've never played much with the .NET setup and right now it's being a bitch.  Every time I go to Tools&gt;Options it crashes on me, even beyond reboot so I'll have to reinstall when I get the chance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

MinSys provides a reasonably complete *nix like environment. DevkitARM doesn't provide it because MinSys does :P

It's certainly possible to do this with a VS6 project wizard - from a brief look at the docs it seems that this is done using the directory structure in .net.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been looking at that but I have come to the conclusion you need the Visual Studio Integration Program (VSIP) to get the platform option done.  However the link the MSDN provides is now 404 so I am looking at just a GBA Wizard for now.  Ideally it'll be in it's own folder structure away from the standard MS provided ones.  Currently I have one in the VC++ folder called Custom GBA Project.  A little bit of extra time could allow me sort every little detail out - I have a little list here with things to look at automating:
<br/>
<ul>Creation of the make file</ul>
<br/>
<ul>Creation of either main.c or main.cpp</ul>
<br/>
<ul>Adding of Third Party libraries to the make file</ul>
<br/>
<ul>Adding of Third Party includes to the main source file</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
Any other suggestions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yeah, I know I need to sort the layout.  I'll do that in the morning.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I've managed to find the VSIP so I might be able to get some funky .NET Wizards done:-)
