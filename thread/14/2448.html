    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it feasible to implement a simple cipher on a GBA (for example 448bit blowfish), so that data entered on it could be stored and then later retrieved via the flash cart in a secure form.
<br/>
<br/>
IE let's say I have a keyboard mod (Keyboard Advance) for the GBA, and I want oo have an *extremely* small secure client (secure because everything is in RAM on a gba), and want to leave stuff for my buddies later, in an inconspicuous package.  DOes anyone have a clue how fast the ciphers would run on the 17.whatever MHz processor?  Assuming something as simple as DES or as complex as Rijndael.<br/>_________________<br/>[ XtaC ] was here.
