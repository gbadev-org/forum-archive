    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have my own mingw gcc and I initially tried compiling the loirak beginners program hoping to see if it runs. It does compile, but it does not run.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried changing directory to the bin folder of devkitadv and using the gcc there but it needs cygwin dependencies, which I don't have when it should. So I ditched that. Compiling with mingw was first sort of unintentional as mingw is also in my PATH as devkitadv, but since devkitadv needs cygwin then I ditched it.
<br/>
<br/>
When ran on VisualBoyAdvance, it just has white screen on. Tried getting a random ROM to see if it works in the first place and it does.
<br/>
<br/>
used: 
<br/>
gcc -0 file.elf file.c -lm
<br/>
objcopy -O binary file.elf file.gba
<br/>
<br/>
For cutting corners I also tried using the .o file(which I take is the same binary) from C::B then changing the extension. Still doesn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically my problem is why won't it work and also can I use mingw, since the devkitadv needs cygwin which I don't have.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yea I sort of read about that. I got the devkitARM from the same sourceforge at devkitpro. 
<br/>
However, when I compile it with the agb gcc there and use the agb objcopy, I still can't run the game again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
