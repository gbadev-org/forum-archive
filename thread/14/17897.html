    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
This is my first post as a new member so please forgive any ignorance.
<br/>
<br/>
I am a student studying at university in England and currently am required to create a basic GBA game with Input, Sound, Game Flow, Inline ARM and a couple of other bits.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway my question is that all these memory addresses (particularly of sprites in OAM and characters in VRAM) are ofcourse difficult to impossible to remember.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there some sort of set template, a map of sorts, that can be used to keep track of where in memory each sprite is kept, where each character is, and therefore a structure that makes development easier, without having to remember where everything is. 
<br/>
<br/>
I could knock up a rough map myself but I was wondering if there were any easy to use templates out there?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nobody needs to memorize the address of anything, that's what symbols are for.  If you use Devkitarm, it comes with libgba, which includes header files that define all the registers and memory areas.
<br/>
<br/>
A common newbie mistake is to directly use the OAM as a place to hold the state of game objects.  Don't do that, you should treat OAM as if it is only for outputting stuff.  Have your game objects in memory, then write code that turns the game objects into OAM entries.  A game object could be more than one sprite large, also sprite coordinates are always relative to the scroll position of the screen.

What do you mean by symbols? Are they like define?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
