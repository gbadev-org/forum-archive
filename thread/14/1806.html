    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a couple of questions regarding Metroid Fusion's graphics:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
1. Which graphics mode does Metroid Fusion use during gameplay?
<br/>
<br/>
2. How does Metroid achieve the effect of having different objects in the background -- some "close" to the player and others "far" -- scroll at different speeds?  For example, in one of the game's rooms, Samus runs along a wall with windows overlooking some scene in the distance.  As he runs, the wall's features scroll very quickly but the distant objects in the windows scroll very slowly.  This effect generates a realistic perspective of the scene.

Metroid Fusion, like many GBA side-scrollers, uses mode 0.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Well, if you looked at the map layers using VBA, I'm sure you found out that the different objects in the background that move at different speeds are set onto different backgrounds that are scrolled at different speeds.
<br/>
<br/>
That brings up an interesting question that I was wondering about. In Elements Of Darkness demo, the clouds are all on one BG layer, yet they flow across the sky at different speeds for the different height of the clouds on the screen. 
<br/>
How did they do that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Clouds moving at different speeds on a single BG would be a HBLANK interrupt used in conjunction with the horizontal scroll register.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
