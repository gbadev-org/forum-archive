    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dear all,
<br/>
<br/>
Could someone please advise the best method to test multiplayer code without actually having to buy 2 * GBA + 2 * Flash carts?
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps there is an emulator that allows connection?
<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can use no$gba for testing multiplayer. This is great for getting the basics up and running, and can save some hassle when testing higher level functionality such as multiplayer menus, gameplay dynamics etc. However, it does not emulate the drift in synchronisation between the different gameboy units, so low level comms code that is stable on no$gba can fall over in a seemingly unpredictable way when run on hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
Afaik, the only way to be sure that your low level multiplayer code is totally robust is to test it <span style="text-decoration: underline">thoroughly</span> using actual hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
cheers
