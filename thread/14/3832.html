    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,I'm new here and im very into GBA dev, so thank you for taking the
<br/>
time to read my post. Here is my problem.
<br/>
I'm using HAM to try and devolop GBA games and it includes the GFX2GBA
<br/>
utility for converting BMPs and PCXs to GBA graphics. Im using Win98SE.
<br/>
Whenever try and output the file the program shuts down and i get an
<br/>
error messge stating that there was a problem with MSCVRT.dll.
<br/>
I've tried using the other versions of this program found in this sites
<br/>
download section and the frontend, but the same thing always happens.
<br/>
Does anyone know a solution to this problem, or am i S.O.L.
<br/>
