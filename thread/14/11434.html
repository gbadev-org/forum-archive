    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been learning about GBA development for a while now, and I finally have to ask a question that has really been bugging me.  When I run a program on Visual Boy Advance, why is it so much faster than when I try to run it on GBA hardware?  I'm pretty sure this sounds like a question that would have been covered before, but I've been having a hard time tracking down a solution myself.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been reading up on all kinds of solutions to timers to regulate the framerate (I'm still not completely sure how to implement that).  And right now the program I am working on waits for the vertical blank, but there is still a huge difference between how fast the program runs on the emulator, and how fast it runs on my GBA.  I may be wrong on this one, but it sounds like this should regulate the graphics.
<br/>
<br/>
Again, I really hope this isn't too tough of a question.  If Visual Boy does try to run faster on a faster computer, then I guess all I really need help with is making programs run at the same speed no matter what it's being played on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also, timing with VisualBoyAdvance isn't quite correct in regards to the GBA, but is close. No$GBA is probably closer to the actual timing.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
