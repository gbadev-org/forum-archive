    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Greetings gbadev community,
<br/>
<br/>
This is my first post so be sure and welcome me hehe =)
<br/>
<br/>
I've been writing software titles (not games) for five years, and now I'm starting a venture of my own. I created an software company "Opcode Software", and am hoping to start out with a Nintendo title. The next stop will be a title for the psp.
<br/>
<br/>
I am aware of the status you need in order to obtain a Nintendo license, and from that I know we won't be getting one just by asking for it. So, the plan is to design a well thought out game with good solid gameplay yada yada yada. Then, force my way into a publishing company, get licensed, and published.
<br/>
<br/>
So, those are the lofty goals in a nutshell. My question to you guys is this. Since I won't be able to obtain the coveted [fanfare] Official Nintendo Gameboy Advance Devkit, do you think it's possible to *develop* a commerical software title by using the community tools?[/b][/url]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nintendo doesn't really care what tools you use. Everything I've read here and on gbadev@yahoogroups indicates that Nintendo cares only that 1. the developer has already made a name for itself on PC or Palm OS platforms, and 2. each binary submitted to Nintendo works as advertised on all versions of GBA hardware, even a few versions that Nintendo hasn't yet sold to the public.
<br/>
<br/>
However, if you're going to support SRAM, flash, or EEPROM savegames on the cart, you'll need to use Nintendo's libraries, as the register-level interface for save tends to change from one cart revision to the next. Leave your APIs open so that you can switch once you get licensed; for instance, use a memcpy() style interface rather than just reading and writing savegame space directly.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good advice.  And yes, you can develop a GBA game just fine on No$GBA and VBoy without too much problem, though eventually you'll need a flash burner of some sorts to test on hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">in general, it's a good idea to use a library -- even for things that don't change on the GBA, like sprites for example.
<br/>
<br/>
If designed properly, the library should add very little overhead and provide a lot of benefits later on when you need/want to change your implementation :)<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
