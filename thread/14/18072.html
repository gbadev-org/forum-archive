    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm really sorry for any rudeness I may cause by posting this as my first post, but as I'm being currently motivated (and I don't know how long I'll be), I wanted to realize some old child dream : programming for video games.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm just working and programming stuff far from any of this, so on a whimp, I told myself "I should patch an old game I loved !".
<br/>
<br/>
That's how I had the idea to try this on a GBA rom.
<br/>
<br/>
So the game that's currently on my mind is... Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town !
<br/>
I've been thinking that it was such a great game, and I have some ideas I'd like to add to this game but...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
TL;DR
<br/>
So my question is : is it hard to develop something like...  Some additionnal scenes with dialogue ? Add some new items ? Add new characters ? Add new actions to the game ?
<br/>
<br/>
And by hard, I mean, is it gonna take me like one month or two for a dozen of features, or a dozen of months for one or two features ?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry again for my sudden intrusion, and for my bad english (I'm french by the way), I just want to know if I can quickly get started or try again in the future when I get much more free time on my hands... !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You want to ROM hack. Unless there's a specific tool for the game you want to hack (yeah, some exists...) it's VERY hard. Will take months before you start actually adding something.
<br/>
<br/>
I suggest you start programming your own (simple) games. If you're already a programmer it won't take long :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://bit.ly/yiQrz9" target="_blank">libXM7</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://bit.ly/yJwcOo" target="_blank">NDS programming tutorial (Italiano)</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://disjointedstudio.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Waimanu DS / GBA</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://adshomebrewersdiary.blogspot.com" target="_blank">A DS Homebrewer's Diary</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
