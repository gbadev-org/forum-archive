    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">there are existing libraries for doing this. but if you want to do this yourself it's basically a case of storing a list of notes and playing them back.
<br/>
<br/>
To do this easily every 12 or so VBL's you change to the next note. If you want to further this you can create note lengths
<br/>
<br/>
once you've done this you can start to factor in code to have playlists and the like, just get the code for reading your notes from the list first - it's quite easy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But in the playback routine that runs every 10 or so vblanks, you're going to have to play a note. At this stage, you probably don't want to write a mixer and deal with PCM, so you're going to need to learn to deal with the four tone generators inherited from the GBC. I'd suggest reading <a class="postlink" href="http://belogic.com/gba/" target="_blank">the guide at belogic.com</a> (if it's still up) and then learning about <a class="postlink" href="http://www.answers.com/equal+temperament&amp;r=67" target="_blank">equal temperament</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

you can get away without knowing about equal temperment, if i can find my trusty gbdk includes i'll post the tunings - they should be the same for gba right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want to know the <span style="font-weight: bold">easiest</span> way, you use one of the existing libraries that keldon was talking about.  
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://synk.at/krawall/download" target="_blank">Krawall</a> is a common one.  (there are others, just do a search on the forums or look at the faq).  With these, you can often just "play" certain types of music files, by adding a couple function calls, and linking in the library.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Although your music may be simple, there's really no simple way to include audio in your game. Krawall is the only system I've evet actually gotten to work, and I can walk you through it if you'd like.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
