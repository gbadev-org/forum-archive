    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Mode 3 has only enough VRAM for 240x160 pixels, and it doesn't wrap at the boundaries of VRAM. If you want to scroll a full-screen, full-resolution image, you'll have to either 1. repeatedly overwrite the whole screen, or 2. overwrite only the lines at the seam and, when you get to the part where it would otherwise wrap except for the limitation of the GBA hardware, rewrite the scrolling registers during vblank.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
