    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody, I'm new here.
<br/>
<br/>
I intend to compile a cross-compiler for ARM on my Debian Linux (initially woody, which just upgraded to Sarge, using kernel 2.4.18). For the beginning of time, I referenced to devrs.com and Dooby's doc and linux.gbadev.org(said based on Dooby's doc) to get some cross-compiler how-tos. But I failed to compile my gcc for either way. From the make output, I saw "Bad instruction" or "no such instruction". 
<br/>
<br/>
So I turn to google, which told me I shall add the formally built binutils's bin directory to my PATH enviornment variable. Then I add both ./binutils/bin and ./binutils/arm-thumb-elf/bin to my PATH. But the 'configure' script turned out to stop functioning, saying 'config.guess' cannot determine the host type. I have no idea of all these.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone who had setup your environment on such a system? Or anyone who has a familiar experience?
<br/>
<br/>
Any help will be appreciated , thank you!<br/>_________________<br/>Into the void..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
