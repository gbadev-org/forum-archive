    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">nvm figured it out... really stupid actually. I made my project in 
<br/>
C:\GBA Projects\ folder. After many hours of trial and error, i realised that it compiled in any other folder... odd no? So i changed the name of this folder and found that it worked! I guess it doesnt compile in folders which contain spaces!!! Well for those who want to know how to set it up, its quite simple (using devkitPro &amp; Visual Studio):
<br/>
- new makefile project, make sure the "create directory for solution" is     unchecked.
<br/>
- in the build command line, type in: " make -r 2&gt;&amp;1 | sed -e 's/\(.[a-zA-Z]\+\):\([0-9]\+\):/\1(\2):/' " (without the spaces be4 and after the quotes and without the quotes).
<br/>
- next for output put (yourprojname).gba
<br/>
- also for Clean Commands type in "make clean"
<br/>
- copy the makefile from a devkitpro template project in devkitPro\examples\gba(or another one)\template.
<br/>
thats it, should work (dont forget to add the devkitPro\devkitARM\bin to executables under vc++ directories. note when you make a code file it should be in the source folder of your project or else the makefile wont find it.
<br/>
Alright thats it hope this helps!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
