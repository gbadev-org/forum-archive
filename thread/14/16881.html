    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I really want to learn how to use libgba, as is, without using extra libraries such as tonc; and I have been looking around the internet for ages. If anyone knows of a libgba tutorial please give me a link or something.

Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm pretty sure the tonc tutorials are what your looking for.  If you look at the first demo, you can see that it doesn't use any libraries.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">in parts of the code it says stuff like: "(from tonc_memmap.h)" and stuff, I do not want to use tonc I want to use libgba. Tonc uses different names and stuff for variables. It doesn't use libgba at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the done thing is to learn tonc, then switch to libgba? Or am I misunderstanding tonc?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most of Libgba is nothing more than names of hardware registers, and macros to help you set the correct bits.
<br/>
<br/>
So the real tutorial is figuring out what you intend on doing, and either looking up the bit patterns in GBATEK, or looking through the header files and seeing what the bits are named.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is also other code in LibGBA too now, including the MaxMod sound library, the simple text console, and others.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah I see, I shall learn the tonc tutorial then since that explains things in great depth. Thank you for your help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
