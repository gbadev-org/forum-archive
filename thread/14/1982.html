    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello there!
<br/>
<br/>
While an old hat at C, I'm quite new to the GBA programming scene, and am having a good time thus far slogging my way through the process. (Yay, all the old coding tricks I knew ten years ago are suddenly applicable again!)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I've read vague references in these forums to displaying actual bitmaps in the backgrounds used in modes 0-2. Can this only be done by cramming the entire image into the background tile data and then having each tile of your background map point to the corresponding section of your image? Or is there a way to access the screen directly when in these modes, like the way you can in modes 3-5?
<br/>
<br/>
My reason for asking is that I would like to superimpose over the various backgrounds and sprites various effects generated from mathematical equations, lines, elipses, etc. and would be easiest to do if I could access the screen's data.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,
<br/>
<br/>
Dan.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's one way, the way that <span style="font-style: italic">Qix</span> (NES), <span style="font-style: italic">Qix</span> (Game Boy), <span style="font-style: italic">Videomation</span> (NES), <span style="font-style: italic">Game Boy Camera</span> (Game Boy), and many Super FX games (Super NES) work. It's just as applicable on GBA; the "free cylindrical tunnel" scene in the demo <span style="font-style: italic">fr018</span> by Farbrausch uses this.

That works too, actually. It's possible to set up a specially formatted rot/scale map that acts much like a scaled mode 4 bitmap background. This requires putting your head on diagonally and thinking about the rot/scale display hardware in a whole new way.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Hm, is there a FAQ on this, or can you give me a pointer as to how it might be done?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Never tried it, but here is my best guess:  Take a big rot/scale BG, format the tiles 0, 1, 2, 3, 4... scale it so the whole thing is shown on the screen and then just change the character entries.  I'm guessing that you put solid color tiles in VRAM.
<br/>
<br/>
Can this be improved?

I've just tried out the easy method in mode 0 and it works.
<br/>
<br/>
convert the solid image into X unique tiles and then tile 'em up just like any normal tile background.
<br/>
<br/>
If it is 256 colors, you'll have to make sure all backgrounds 0-3 use the same palette.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you only use 128 colors, then you have 8 palettes left for 16 color BGs.

    <h4>#22525 - tepples - Wed Jun 23, 2004 5:29 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's not exactly the diagonal I had in mind. Try pa =  256*1/2, pb = 0, pc = 256*1/16, pd = 256*4 (I think, haven't tried it recently), with a size-2 mosaic vertically.  Then line up a map like this:
<br/>
<br/>
00000000
<br/>
2222222211111111
<br/>
4444444433333333
<br/>
6666666655555555
<br/>
etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Then the beam will cross each tile eight times, scanning successive rows in the tile, until it hits the next set of eight tiles down and to the right.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
