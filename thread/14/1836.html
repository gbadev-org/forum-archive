    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what I have gathered you can develope GBA games using unnoffical GBA dev kits but is this just for personal stuff? If you wanted to develope a full blown commercial game would Nintendo have a problem with you not using their software?
<br/>
<br/>
Also do you need to be liscenced by Nintendo to actually start on development or can you have the thing done before you get the OK from the big N? Can you get the game done, try find a developer before doing this?
<br/>
<br/>
How does it work if you have a game in progress and you want to show it off somewhere public, say a convention or a game show to get publicity or try to snag a publisher?
<br/>
<br/>
General development guidlines would be appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
And if you want to show off a game to the publishers and are afraid of being found out for owning independently manufactured tools, show off a PC port.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Do publishers really care if you use independently manufactured tools? I mean, if Nintendo doesn't even care...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They wont care, but there is a rule of the thumb:
<br/>
<br/>
Always burn the game to a CD and send it with a license.txt to the publishers physical adress, after they have confirmed that they will take a look at your game. It will make the game non-public.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A general how-to-show-your-game-to-a-publisher rule, by the way, is having them send you a Non Disclosure Agreement, which both you and they sign. This will legally forbid both you and them to try anything with the game. In other words, you can't go and try selling it to other publishers, and they can't steal your idea and make money off it themselves. Most (if not all) publishers will simply not look at game proposals or demos at all if they have no NDA. Look around in the Articles section of <a href="http://www.gamedev.net" target="_blank">www.gamedev.net</a> for more information about getting published.
<br/>
<br/>
As for Nintendo... I have no idea how to become a licensed Nintendo developer... You apparently get a two-digit 'developer' number, and your game gets a four digit AGB-XXXX number... 
<br/>
<br/>
But what's the order of business? First get licensed, and then get a publisher, or vice versa?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not quite sure about game shows, but with publishers it should be okay since you are only showing a 'demo reel' behind closed doors with only you and publisher in the know.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
