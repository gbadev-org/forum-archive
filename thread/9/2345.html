I have a series of tiles that add up to 255 colours.  Is there a way to move a colour from one spot into another spot on the colour table, and have all the effected pixels change also?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's a thing called PaletteTool in the graphics tools section at the main site that will do what you want. Photoshop really does have a crappy palette editor, but I have yet to find a drawing program with a better one.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

This tool rocks!
<br/>
<br/>
Ideal for creating 8bit (256 colour) images for your GBA games.
<br/>
<br/>
It even has build in palette quantizer / colour reduction so you can convert 256 colour tiles to 16 / 16 colour tiles ... (although it seems a bit basic at doing this compared to professional tools).<br/>_________________<br/>Qwak - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk</a> | Forum - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk/forum/" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk/forum/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It can shuffle colours around without mucking up your artwork....shift + left-click...then drag to where you want it.

Supports layers and frames (for animation).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not really familiar with it myself, but a friend of mine tells me that PSP 7 isn't half bad at color reduction.  You've got to keep in mind that photoshop is really geared for people that want to do high-end graphics, and so it's believed that no one in their right minds would want to <span style="font-style: italic">reduce</span> the # of colors. Except us, of course.<br/>_________________<br/>"Two wolves are fighting. One wolf is all evil, hate, jealousy and discontent, and the other good, love, happiness and is content."

You got the exact same problem as me. I can't move the palettes &gt;.&lt;;;
<br/>
<br/>
I also want to have 16 color sprites and backgrounds because it's more like the old games, and you can have some cool effects and different colours on the same sprites, like Street Fighter II games have</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Personally I use BitEdit.EXE from a bit of freeware from Microsoft's Video for Windows tools (from around 1992) - it only works with BMP files but has the best palette editing I've seen. You can select one or more colour(s) and move them around within your palette. Means you can easy create a single 256 colour palette which has the transparent colours in the right places for your palette to really be 16 16 colour palettes.

Have an ftp search and you'll find it somewhere on the web.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
