<br/>
<br/>
In many commercial game I can see this trick. (e.g. No. 1102 our sun)
<br/>
The screen mode is often mode0. The map data is updated dynamically in a column/row when the hero moves. I guess it's using a camera system. Does it use REG_BGOFFSET? And how the cam sys works in this mode?
<br/>
<br/>
I am a newbie and sorry for my poor english. Any response will be appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You've just described edge scrolling.  Because the VRAM buffers wrap, you only need to write out a row/column along the edge of the screen that is just coming into view - instead of updating the whole VRAM page.  The scroll offset registers show the upper-left hand corner of the current window.  Every time they move to a different char, an updated is requested.  Note: because you can't use DMAs as much here, the benefit, while large, isn't quite as big as you'd think.  It also means you have to be real tricky if your gonna use that VRAM page for anything else besides scrolling.

BTW, quick question: Does anyone know of Bitmap modes (3,4,5) allow wrapping?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
