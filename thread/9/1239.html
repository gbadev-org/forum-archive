<br/>
I?m a 3D Artist, and I would like to know the right way to make a gba graphics look. The masters what do you use ? a pre-rendered 3D images or paint into photoshop each pixel ??
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to make an isometric graphics like mario or castelvania. :P
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot !!!

Pre-rendered images work well in games with large sprites such as <span style="font-style: italic">Donkey Kong Country</span> or <span style="font-style: italic">Killer Instinct</span>. The details tend not to show up well when a rendered image is scaled down much smaller than 32x32 pixels; such an image will need a pass of pixel-by-pixel touch-up.

<br/>
The <span style="font-style: italic">Donkey Kong Country</span> games for Super NES were not Super FX or SA-1 games but just 32 Mbits of software. I'm guessing that you're remembering more colors than you originally saw because 1. <span style="font-style: italic">DKC</span> for Super NES had smarter shading than other 16-bit games that came out at the same time, and 2. composite video blurs the image, making dithering more effective. When <span style="font-style: italic">DKC</span> for GBA comes out, try playing it through the GameCube Game Boy Player and comparing it to the Super NES version on the same TV.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tepples nailed it.  I would add also that judging the entirety of graphics for a game based off of a screen shot isn't too smart since there is no animation.  Also, the GBA LCD tends to blur things a little.  I've notice that fact help in scaling images, but not on dithering, etc.  Tepples?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
A CRT is temporally sharper than an LCD (that is, the value of each pixel changes faster vs. time), but an LCD is spatially sharper, especially when compared to a sub-$500 living-room television set.
<br/>
<br/>
And no, LCD blurring doesn't necessarily help in scaling images because the GBA's background and sprite texture mapping is nearest-neighbor (like the PS1), not bilinear (like the N64). However, if an image is moving, the human visual system can't perceive as much detail, and the scaling looks smooth.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to optimize dithering for a slow display, try temporal dithering. Have pixels that were "too dark" in the previous frame be "too light" in the next frame. This is also the basis behind "super-transparency" as described in <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=124" target="_blank">this topic</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
