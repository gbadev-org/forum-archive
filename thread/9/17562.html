    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've seen that usenti has a default palette stored as a .pal file, does anyone know how these files are generated? It seems pretty straight forward how the data is stored and probably wouldn't be too hard for me to just write up a converter (or just manually write out my palette), but if there's already some software that does this lying around that I've just missed, I would rather just use that.

EDIT: Found such a software, just missed it when I looked the first time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
