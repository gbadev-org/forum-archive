    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I like study some commercial roms when I see an effect that I didn't encount before or never imagine to do ^^
<br/>
<br/>
And in a RPG rom, I saw big monsters (bigger than 64x64) composed by multiparts sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
So I'd like some guiding lines on how I must organize my monster image in a array.
<br/>
1D or 2D?
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a tool that can allow me to specify size of parts when cutting and generating .C?
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is not much for one frame monster, but for an animated one.
<br/>
Should I use one big source image with all frames of my monster, disposed in 1D way? or somthing else?
<br/>
<br/>
thank you ^^<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm guessing you never played any NES games. Because the NES's biggest sprites were 8x16 pixels, just about everything was made of multiple sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to do multiple sprites, please take a look at a tool called <a class="postlink" href="http://www.taswegian.com/TwoHeaded/objective.html" target="_blank">Objective</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I played rpg since they exist on console, so I had my NES period long ago ^^
<br/>
And at this time, I didn't study games like I do since I want to create one :P
<br/>
<br/>
yep, I know Objective (I have it too)
<br/>
But I wanted to have some comments of someone about using it or another soft ^^
<br/>
<br/>
The question is still open, but thank you tepples, when I got time and need I look at this.<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sometimes, when you need a really big enemy (End boss?), not sprites are used but a text layer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yep Sweex, maybe not, but I found it in Sprites so I'll try to do it by this way ^^
<br/>
<br/>
Si, I keep on studying this rom and this way to cut sprites in multi part.
<br/>
<br/>
And I found this :
<br/>
<br/>
- Sprites in left standing position :
<br/>
|---------|
<br/>
| 16X8   |
<br/>
|---------|
<br/>
| 16X16 |
<br/>
|---------|
<br/>
| 16X8   |
<br/>
|---------|
<br/>
<br/>
- then 1st animation frame to the left :
<br/>
|---------||---------|
<br/>
| 16X8   || NULL   |
<br/>
|---------||---------|
<br/>
| 16X16 || 8X16   |
<br/>
|---------||---------|
<br/>
| 16X8   ||   8X8   |
<br/>
|---------||---------|
<br/>
<br/>
Look very interesting, doesn't it? ^^
<br/>
<br/>
I understand why they using cutted sprites now, I suppose it's because the sprite size/shape isn't always the same, depending of the move.
<br/>
<br/>
But I keep on asking how may I have to organize my sprites and which tool could generate an array I can use this way?
<br/>
<br/>
Is it that we call "2D" (instead of "1D")?
<br/>
<br/>
For now I used to input one sized sprites in a 1D way (a bmp with one sprite width and X*sprite height).
<br/>
<br/>
I work on it, but if you have any idea.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry to re-open an old topic, but it's time for me to deal with multi-parts sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
And I wanted to know if anyone can provide me a good help on this tool (Objective), or a good way to manage multiparts-multisize sprites.
