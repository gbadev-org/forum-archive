    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was authorized to use some amazing graphics (poker cards) created by DayDream. I am having an issue though. In order to use them plus a font I had to manipulate them so that they would fit into memory. They now fit into memory however to make them useable it will take 95% of the OAM just to show the sprites during gameplay. I could fix this by using muliple palettes however they take up more than 16 colors. One other option would be to leave the card #'s (A, 2, 3, ... J, Q, K) black and show the suit in the correct color as shown here.

Do you think that people would be turned off by this? If so does anyone have any idea's as to how to make this work?
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the current sprite sheet that I am using.

I will try the dithering and see if that works. As far as the number of cards that I would show, there could be a max of 17 cards. There is a possibility of using tiled backgrounds I guess. Not 100% on how I would do that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another strategy would be to only use a sprite for cards that are moving. Once a card has been moved across the screen, you could "write" it into your background, then delete the sprite. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you set your palettes up right, you can use the exact same sprite set as your source data for the background drawing.
<br/>
<br/>
And actually, that strategy could work nicely for your text as well, depending on whether you need to move the text around at all or do other fancy effects with it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the input. Here is what I have done and will be doing. I have converted this image to 16 colors with dithering. I loaded this into the rom and it still looks good. I have to now create a 2nd palette so that I can show the proper colors. Also I was able to rearrange the tiles so that I don't have to use many sprites to display the cards. The whole using the tiled background thing sounds good however I don't think that I am that advanced yet (still a newbie c / c++ programmer).

Thanks again,
