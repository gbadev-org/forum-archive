    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looks like you're also using screen base 0, which overlaps with char 0. I usualy start with char base 0, and screen base 31. Add more chars going upward, and screens going down, so I don't have to worry about it unless I start running out of VRAM altogether. 
<br/>
<br/>
Either that or load your char data in past the first screen block (2KB), and offset your map entries to match.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Screenshots aren't as much help in solving programming problems as you may think, as the problem itself is usually underneath it. It's similar to asking a mechanic what's wrong with the engine by showing him a photgraph of your car. The binary or a code snippet would be more beneficial.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, I have a sneaking suspicion that you're using screenblock 0 and charblock 0. These use the same memory so that when you set one, you'll overwrite the other. If you separate tiles and screen entries so they won't have lap it should work again. <a class="postlink" href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/tonc/regbg.htm#tbl-cbb-sbb" target="_blank">tonc:cbb/sbb overlap table</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's OK to use map 0 and chr 0 as long as you don't use tiles 0-64 (16-color) or 0-32 (256-color). If you don't scroll the screen, then you need only avoid tiles 0-40 (16-color) or tiles 0-20 (256-color).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
