    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all, make sure you're not using the first half of sprite tile RAM.  In modes 3-5, the video buffer uses tiles 0-511, so you must start at 512.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, check your sprite tile RAM in an emulator and make sure it contains what you think it should.
<br/>
<br/>
If it still doesn't work, post some code and/or a binary.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
