    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The platform is GBA I suppose? Are you using the VRAM for other purposes? Graphics usually don't have to go outside of that space.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well my post still stands. There are a few memories that you can use to store data in. For graphics that would be the VRAM. If you include your graphicsdata inside the NDS binary, then it will end up in the Main RAM as well.
<br/>
<br/>
So be specific in what memory you're trying to save up on. How big is your binary right now? Do you plan to use libfat for FAT access?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hm I don't really know. I've just started programming on DS with the PaLib tutorials. The thing is my program works flawlessly without any graphics but since I added sprites and gif backgrounds to it, it stops working properly after 10mn (doesn't send MIDI messages anymore)
<br/>
<br/>
So I'd like to know what could be the problem and what's the best way to get nice graphics that don't mess with the rest of the program at all</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
