    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, im new here, i got a flash cart for my gba recently and its opened my eyes to a world of pdroms and emulation on the gba. I have always wondered though, why Doom/Doom 2 on the gba seems (to me) to look so much better than other FPS games on the system? couldnt people use the same techniques/engine to create wonderful looking homebrew games? ive put yeti3d onto my gb, i hate to say it as whoever made it has way more skill than me but i thought it looked bad next to doom.

thankyou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeti 3D is a full-fledged 3D engine that lets you view just about any mesh at any angle. Doom is a raycasting engine: the world can only be shown at certain angles, and only with certain types of geometries (mostly walls that are straight and perpendicular to the ground).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i take it the raycasting engine also doesnt allow you as the player to walk on a 2nd floor above another room? or was that just hardware limitations when the original doom was made?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't played Doom in maybe a decade or so, but you can make a raycasting engine that has multiple floors; it's just more complicated and processor intensive. I don't think the original Doom had that capability, though.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeh, i wondered if raycasting was capable of it because i seem to remember duke nukem 3d's engine being able to do so. are there any goodlooking raycasting projects for gba going on at the moment?

You can look up and down in the original doom's. The engine was capable of that, what you are thinking of is the BUILD engine. Ken didn't come up with a true way of being able to look up/down, so he simply made the textures shift angle (which works for the most part, unless you look at the background texture).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Doom had multiple levels - but not a floor on top of another. Duke nukem did looking up and down by (I believe) shearing. If you consider what a ray casting engine does it is easy to understand why it would be this way</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
