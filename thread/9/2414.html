    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As I mentioned before, quite a few new features are in MapEd since the last release, but I'm in a position where I <span style="font-style: italic">can't</span> release the new version because it contains certain data items that are very specific to my in-progress game.
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to make everything generic, but time got short so I did it the easy way.  And worse, because I'm short on time, I won't be able to fix this for *quite* a while.  This also means, that if there are other minor fixees, there is no way they will possibly get out to the community until the first issue is fixed.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">If there are any programmers that are interested in making the required changes to MapEd so a community version can be released, that would be a very nice gesture.  Whether or not a new version ever gets realeased really has no effect on me, but other people may appreciate the effort.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, you can take full credit for your efforts.  Once several issues have been addressed, an open source version may be possible.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Nessie on Wed Dec 17, 2003 1:12 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just wanted to report that a very generous programmer has offered to help maintain the community version and is in the process of updating the tool.  I don't have an ETA on when it'll be ready.
<br/>
<br/>
I imagine a code release would happen some time after that if there's any interest in that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
