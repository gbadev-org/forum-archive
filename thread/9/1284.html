<br/>
<br/>
I have just been sitting designing some sprites with different armor, etc. and was wondering if I could get opinions.
<br/>

I can make any of them more 3D, so dont concentrate on their flatness.
<br/>
<br/>
I was first wondering which sprite anyone likes best, and suggestions to it, or just combo's of boots with armor, and greaves with helmets. Also any ideas for different styles in RPG sense would be appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I was wondering when they make commercial games, they don't have enough space on the cartridge to have switchable uniforms or sprites do they? or else their would be many doing that. What is the maximum space on a commercial cartdridge, isn't it 8mb and 16mb? It would be cool to buy a game with 32mb used.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And you can have quite some different "uniforms" on a cartridge. Don't think of hundreds of different ones, but certainly quite a few as sprites are small and don't take up a real lot of memory. Alternatively, you could combine certain parts of the uniform to make before it's drawn to screen. You can have virtually endless combinations that way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Regarding different uniforms, if you draw your sprite clever you can change the apperance just by changing palette. For instance, have a motive on the shirt which you can "remove" by simply setting the color of the motive to the same as the rest of the shirt. Stuff and such..<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The palette swapping idea will buy you a lot of space.  At this level of detail simple changes in color can make a big difference in the apperance of your characters.  I notice that a good deal of your characters pretty much have the same head.  It would appear to me that by simply crafting a couple of different heads and a few 'suits' of armour you can create a great variety of characters and save memory at the same time.  You need only to cleverly place the head 'atop' the suit of armour and voila.  Also, superimposing a small piece of armour, or accessories atop your characters can help create the illusion of more detail.  You just have to make sure you design an engine that can easily handle the addition of these items and your art must properly represent each of these pieces as your character changes direction and animates.  For instance, you don't want a breast-plate to be visible when the character is facing away from the viewer.
<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck in your endevours!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
