    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What makes a sprite to be shown over another ? My first guess (according to the result I currently have) would be that sprites at the begining of the OAM are on top. Am I right ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can also specify a priority level as one of the OAM attributes that determines the ordering of sprites relatives to several "layers" that include backgrounds as well. There are 4 different priority levels, with 0 being highest-priority and 3 being lowest-priority.
<br/>
<br/>
So if you have two sprites that are OAM entries 50 and 51, and they are both priority 0, then sprite 50 will display above sprite 51. But if sprite 50 is priority 1 and sprite 51 is priority 0, then sprite 51 will display above sprite 50, even though it is a higher OAM entry.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh ya, that too.  And sprite priority levels interact nicely with background priority levels -- sprites are drawn just on top of the background with the same priority.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bet you want to know how to set one sprite in front of another now?
<br/>
<br/>
Simply swap the attributes. Isn't the GBA easy to program for? (except for multiplayer)
