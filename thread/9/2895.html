I tried that GBA Map Editor Beta 4 and it was totally useless; it scrambled my map when I save it and won't export to .c file correctly. Does anybody know how to fix this or of a better map editor?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Only drawback: it produces a file and currently there is no exporter to C file. You will have to do it manually with incbin or something equivalent.
<br/>
It has just every function I wanted to find in a map editor. Has a few things I would like to see enhanced (I have bought it yesterday the full version, hope I'll get some feedback for my requirements :O) ), but it's really minor issues... Give it a try, there's a free version !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Only drawback is that it only exports 16-color tiles.

Take a look at the tools section on the main site. There are tons.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
