    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if anyone know a program/GBA tool or anything that
<br/>
can convert an image to use 16 color palettes.
<br/>
Here comes the tricky part: I want to be able to tell the tool how many palettes it should use if it overflows!
<br/>
<br/>
in Photoshop I can set how many colors a whole image should have
<br/>
but the tiles can still have more than 16 colors in it and it doesnt
<br/>
takes care of the transparent color in each 16-color bank.
<br/>
But maybe i can trick with it cause it is quite much Index color functions in
<br/>
photoshop!
<br/>
<br/>
Help would be great!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I use the gimp.  Make sure to put your transparent pixel in the upper lefthand corner.  Then convert from RGB to Indexed.
<br/>
<br/>
Your transparent pixel will probably not be index 0 at this point.  Convert back to RGB then back to Indexed and everrything should be good.  This only works to convert full color images to 15 + transparency color images.  Results are not alway good.  (Render plasma and try converting it.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes I know but the problem is that I want to use more then one 16 color palette for my image.
<br/>
Its hard to select myself which tiles that should use which one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's a program called Quither that's been flying around here for a while.  If you'd be interested, this sort of program can take a truecolor image, break it into tiles, and pick a set of 16 palettes that will retain as much accuracy as possible (according to the algorithm).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can also do this in Pro Motion ... but the results are not what I would call good.
<br/>
<br/>
From a programmers perspective ... the main problem is calculating an optimal palette from a 24 bit colour image (and after that it's just a case of remapping colours to closest match).
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of any online resources for computing an optimal palette !?<br/>_________________<br/>Qwak - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk</a> | Forum - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk/forum/" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk/forum/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sajiimori: 
<br/>
Is it possible to get output in same format (Bitmap) with fixed palettes
<br/>
with Quither.
<br/>
And where can I find it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes.  Go grab it and give it a run.  It a pretty neat tool.  You'll get 256 color bmps for output with the palettes aligned as needed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
