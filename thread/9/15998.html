<br/>
<br/>
So is that one going to be like for an overworld walk around and talk to people type of deal?

<br/>
I've not played Bangai-o (I've heard of it) so I'm just a little curious.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: gray">The lone Wolf howls, driven by pride he presses on.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the idea for this game is really simple... you shoot 360? to everything that move in the screen in a simil-zelda's view.
<br/>
<br/>
you are a terribly boring man (the one you see in the sprite posted above) in the day of his birthday... he found that his mobile phone isn't working so he must run personally to invite all of his friends at the big "boring" party in his house that evening... 
<br/>
<br/>
so imagine his words became a sort of bullet to "bore" anything that he found in his way to reach all his best friends (the level's bosses) and destroy them talking...tooooo much... 
<br/>
<br/>
we want to develop a lot of really small and quick levels and change a bit the way to reach the goal for every level...
<br/>
<br/>
i think we release the game in 2017 considering how slowly my knowledge is growing up and the fact that i'm a graphic designer...(are there volounterous developers?)
<br/>
so believe me... give a try to bangai-o, it's developed by treasure(gunstar heroes, radiant silvergun, ikaruga) and it's really all about shooting.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you are familiar with any game with a day and night cycle, what does this game use? A transparent background or a change in palette to simulate the day/night effect?<br/>_________________<br/>If you are looking for fast success in <span style="font-weight: bold">spam url removed</span> exams then join today</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes. Color 0 of your palette is always rendered as transparent. So any BG tiles that use color 0 will have transparency.  I'd recommend you read up on how color palettes work, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/video.htm#sec-colors" target="_blank">you can refer to this page on tonc</a>, and if you haven't read the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=418" target="_blank">beginner's FAQ</a> here, please do.

I can't think of any examples, but I think a change in palette would be an easy solution that would be appropriate in many cases.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
