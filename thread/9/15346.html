    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For someone with no artistic talent, what is the best way to design and create a user interface?
<br/>
I figure tile graphics are the way to go since they use less cpu time and memory but my artistic talents don't even compare to coder art.
<br/>
<br/>
What I may end up doing is writing a library of some kind to make simple user interfaces.
<br/>
Something lightweight but supports things like dialogs, buttons, checkboxes, list views and tab pages.
<br/>
<br/>
This is coming about since I want to redo my Mini vMac port but I also want a nice user interface that is not a total hack and can look somewhat nice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're making a UI for Mini vMac, you'll probably want to use the Chicago font for consistency with the system font of the machine being emulated. And if you're using proportional fonts like Chicago, you'll probably want to make your UI in a bitmap or pseudo-bitmap mode. Pseudo-bitmap involves a 4-bit-per-pixel mode where each entry in the map points to a separate tile, and drawing involves editing the pixels within the tiles. I can explain further if you want, including code.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, it would be for Mini vMac but I was thinking of making a general library as well in case I do other projects that could benefit from easily made UIs.
<br/>
What I'm going for is a nice looking user interface that is powerful but not computationally expensive or memory hungry.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not computationally expensive: Check. My library was originally designed to run on GBA, so it's even faster on DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Not memory hungry: Check. Only 26 KiB of VRAM is needed for one background plane, and in theory, it would fit into VRAM H. So even programs that use A, B, C, and D for textures can use it.

This way, each 8x160 pixel region is a contiguous mini-bitmap. To go down by 1 pixel, add 4 to your address (1 if using a u32 *). To go right by 1 tile (8 pixels), add 4*8*20 to your address (8*20 if using a u32 *).

I have written a working implementation of this pseudo-bitmap method as part of the "RAC wizard engine", which powers some of my DS tools, such as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/dx/RAC" target="_blank">RAC</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/#memtestARM" target="_blank">memtestARM</a>. The pseudo-bitmap code is also used for menus in the GBA and DS ports of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/lj/" target="_blank">Lockjaw Tetromino Game</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
