    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to load a large sprite made up several smaller ones on the NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
Got a couple of questions:
<br/>
<br/>
1) What should I be adding on the Makefile so that Objective automatically takes an image and do its thing when I build my project? And where should I place Objective.exe. I'm guessing it is all similar to how grit is set up, but a more comprehensive explanation would be apreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
2) I did make a small test using the command line to see what Objective's output was, and it worked fine, or so it seems. My problem is that I still can't figure out how should I use all the data. In short, what would be the fastest way to have the bigger image made up of the smaller ones up and running?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Most converters require you to place your sprite animation frames in discreate regular intervals related to the size of the sprite.  
<br/>
<br/>
Devkitarm comes with a graphics converter to do this and there allready is a makefile rule to pass the images through this tool.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
# This rule creates assembly source files using grit
<br/>
# grit takes an image file and a .grit describing how the file is to be processed
<br/>
# add additional rules like this for each image extension
<br/>
# you use in the graphics folders

you should be able to do something similar with your tool.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
