    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Converting to .bmp files would just run up your ROM size, possibly beyond what one GBA Game Pak can store without bankswitching and definitely beyond what you'll be able to afford to have replicated should you manage to get your game accepted by a publisher.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd consider using some SWF tool for prototyping the animation and then recoding the animation using GBA sprite hardware.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

the intro is quite short, just 5.6 seconds, and there are 24 pics each second.
<br/>
How does your program work, touchstone?
<br/>
maybe I could convert the swf to a director file, or something, (since macromedia made both).

<br/>
More precisely, do you claim that there exists a publicly available, freely usable full-motion video compression system with acceptable rate/distortion performance and real-time decoding on a 16.78 MHz ARM7 CPU? It's not like a homebrew developer could just call up Majesco, ask to use their GBA Video codec, and expect to get any useful answer.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

That's a bit of psuto (can't spell it; soo-toe) code, but it should be clear.  And I infer that you know hoe to set up the HBlank interrupt, no?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If that effect is too slow, just replace s++ with s += 2 or something.

I can post other effects if you'd like.  Maybe I should compile them into a rom to show you how it works...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#43379 - Lord Graga - Sun May 22, 2005 10:00 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When making video, I suggest being using as many tricks as possible to get the size down. Use 120x80, and cut it down to 20 fps, compress it with the heavist stuff you can get your hands on. That'll give you 3 full frames to decompress in mode 4, which should be enough for some really heavy decompresssionmodules :)
<br/>
<br/>
If you are lucky you'll end up at &lt;300 kbyte for 6 seconds without writting an actual codec :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
