    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well i'm currently using Aaron Rogers tutorial(http://www.aaronrogers.com/) on day 4. Well this is my question... i want to replace his picture with one that i made but when i convert it with gfx2gba i get a *.pal and *.raw file. Now in his tutorial there is two picture files in his source bg.pal.c and bg.raw.c. How would i make my picture that i made be converted to work under his tutorial? The picture is set to *.bmp and at 8bit with 240*160 resolution.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
