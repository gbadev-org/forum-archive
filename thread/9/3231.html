    <h4>#19248 - josath - Thu Apr 15, 2004 8:01 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I wrote a GBA game without actually having a gba or flash cart (<a class="postlink" href="http://rorex.isa-geek.net/wizards" target="_blank">wizards</a>), and when i finally got a chance to play it on the hardware, i noticed the colors were much darker. Is there a way (i'm sure there is, i just can't think of how) to lighten the colors, not within my graphics programs (gimp, psp etc), but within the code it self, like increase the brightness of all the colors in the palette. 
<br/>
<br/>
I tried a couple different algorithms, but I couldn't come up with any that worked (I tried adding to the color, no good, then I split it into R,G,B components, and added to each of them, but that still washed all the color out, i also tried multiplying). 
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe i had some errors in my code, not sure, but basically i would just loop over the palette and perform some operation on each color. What I am looking for, i guess, is an operation/formula I can apply to a color (RGB555) that will brighten it (and not make it too large, if you do that it loops back into dark colors)
<br/>
<br/>
I can show some of my test code if you want, but it doesn't really work right.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.

<br/>
Basically you need to implement gamma correction. I did this in Atomix (see <a href="http://rmstudiogames.free.fr" target="_blank">http://rmstudiogames.free.fr</a>) and you can select the level at run time. The algorithm is not about adding or applying linear ratio. The gamma correction is a "square algorithm". To sum up you choose a ratio and you apply ratio*ratio.
<br/>
<br/>
I googled for "gamma correction", found pages which explained how gamma correction works and it was very easy to code it for the GBA format.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Else, when you load the palette, add 10% to the color it loads, and check for any errors that should occur.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wouldn't worry about such little things as gamma correction at first. Just tune your palettes to the screen you like (GBA, SP, DS, TV) and add in the gamma correction later on if you really want it.
<br/>
<br/>
Normally you don't want to put code in headers, just the function prototypes to call things. Then put the function itself in a .c file somewhere. Doesn't matter too much where it is as long as it gets linked in, just depends on how you want to keep things organized.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Slow as in Pentium II 333MHz, 640k system memory with 63Mb of added memory. A 4Gig hard drive, wich has been madly partitioned before the computer was mine, so the C drive is full up and the rest.. aren't. A monitor from 1992 (seriously) which I got free this year from a weird man. The only nice bit is the wireless card which I bought. I asked for some computer-bits for Christmas but didn't get any, and my birthday is the 16th so, maybe.. -_-</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, so you mean slow as in my 1999 laptop (PII 333 MHz, 64 MB RAM, 6 GB HD). On a machine like that, you might want to stick to NES or GBC development.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Exactimo. But I like GBA dev. That's why I can't dev on this computer, so I use the newer one, which my dad enjoys modding (once I overclocked it a bit over the top, but didn't fry it). Talking of which, I have made a very basic, not very nice game called 'Acorn Collector' for a squirrel-mad friend. I might give you a look at it when I get onto the computer (my two-years older brother ALWAYS plays championship manager and other long games just when I want to go on the computer..).

Thanks,
