When i try to paint a red square it appears fragmented in several lines. The image is 240x160 in 256 colours generated with photoshop, it should work but it doesn't.

Does anybody know why can it be?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem is, that the converter is not "designed" for the mode you are using on the GBA (is it tilemap and/or sprites?). I think you might have got your hands on an mode 4 converter instead of a tile converter. Just ask here if you need more explenation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using mode 4 with background 2. Which are the mode 4 converters? Can you tell me which are good? I use bmp2gba but it doesn't seem to work. Also I have tried to convert a pcx with pcx2gba but it gives me an error. Both images are 240x160.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you were referring to the utility I mentioned, apparently it can generate C arrays by using the -f option.  Read the docs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
