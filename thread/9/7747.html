    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
I have many 16 bits bmp files to display in mode 3.
<br/>
I need a command-line version of Bimbo (like gfx2gba for example) to have it run in a makefile. 
<br/>
<br/>
Bimbo works fine but it is a Windows exec and using it to converti many changeable files is very tedious !
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have a tip?
<br/>
Many thanks in advance</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
