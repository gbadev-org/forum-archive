    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was a bit curious when I first started programming for gba about the array for all the pixels (the video memory in the bitmap modes).

And you won't like DOS. You have to support lots of devices. That's why DirectX is much, much better.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Luckily, Allegro's blit() calls make it easy.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Dos has mode 13h, which is a 320x200 screen with 8 bit colours, now how easy is that?
<br/>
<br/>
In windows there you can get direct access to your pixels like that using the basic windows functions. You can have many different modes, with palettes, etc. Only that there are no tile modes, you'll have to write that yourself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Most computers sold nowadays come with Windows XP, which 1. doesn't run DOS apps perfectly and 2. uses a DOS-incompatible file system by default. Most beginners do not know how to reboot the computer into FreeDOS and repartition the machine to hold a FreeDOS partition.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I'd just run that stuff on VMWare; although I would like VMWare to have an option to make your computer appear slower; because it forces you to use slowdos all the time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
to get a simple frame (buffer) with Windows, just use the TinyPTC Library, which creates a DirectX Surface for you (which is a really ugly thing if you have to do by yourself :-). Then just use the update-function of that library with an array of the screen-size.
<br/>
<br/>
Really simple to use and reopens the fun of coding for windows just like in good old Dos times ! (Mode 13h) ... :-)
<br/>
<br/>
The smallest DirectX Test with LCC-Win32 + TinyPTC - 3 kb packed with UPX .. it's better than in Dos-Times :-) (using .exe-files)

First off, the character modes which the GBA has is simular to the PC's charecter modes. The only differences are palettes and backgrounds. In the standard PC text modes, you can not have different palette lines for different 8x8 characters, and you can only have 1 background that cannot be scrolled. Also, the PC does not genetate any interrupts for VBlanks or HBlanks so you can't mess with the screen. And to not forget, monitors update the screen in 60 Hz mostly, but it can update at other refresh rates so you won't get a smooth animation like you get on the GBA.
<br/>
The PC was not built as a game computer. The PC is a big calculator with a floppy disk that takes a higher interrupt level than the rest of the system so synchronization doesn't exist.
<br/>
Microsoft changed the PC into something it is not! The hardware and IRQ levels are not handled in respect for synchronization. It's sad but true. The closest thing to a console I have seen in synchronization on a PC was BeOS. But BeOS is no more because Microsoft didn't like it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">actually if you write to the address that was the video segment in dos (i cant remember, was it 0xA000 or something??) then it does draw to the top (64k perhaps??) of the windows screen. well, it did in win95 anyway. i haven't checked if xp implements this historical addressing. you could probably access the rest as well. so the answer may well be yes. it's not a practical solution, and windows will still be writing to the same bit of memory, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I believe Windows will put you into an exception if you write outside the preserved memory for the application. At least in Win32 applications.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
