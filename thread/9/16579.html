    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys.
<br/>
<br/>
So I decided to go back to the GBA, cos I honestly couldn't bother remembering/learning how to use Sphere again so..
<br/>
<br/>
I've got a nice little menu screen, music, etc. running, but I've hit a brick wall, atm...
<br/>
<br/>
So basically, I want to make an FFIV sequel titled "FFIV - Dawn of Darkness"... and this screen is the saved game loading screen, so it'd have to show at least some basic info like which map it was saved on, time and hopefully character stuff (like portrait, HP/MP or status ailment, etc).. But I have no friggin' idea WHERE to place it :P
<br/>

<br/>
(Note: Image has been quantized to 4-bpp to save a tiny bit of space.. originally it was 3x 16-colour palettes)
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone got any ideas where to place the data?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Ruben on Sat Apr 04, 2009 8:24 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Make sure to check the FAQs first in case your question can be answered there.

Just make sure you only save the basics. Anything that is going to change over time should be saved as-is (like HP/MP, opened treasure chests, map coordinates, etc.), Everything else that is relevant, but won't change, should be saved with a value that points (like a reference) to the target information (like portraits, or current map the save was taken place, etc.)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I meant.. where on the screen should I print/blit this data?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, lol. I just assumed because you were talking about "saved" data, that you were wondering where to put that "data". Sorry about that.
<br/>
<br/>
For your actual question, I'm kinda confused, because for this circumstance, the BGs and sprites are available to use, so why not use those to display the information? If you know what you want displayed, then why not just go and display them? Or, are you asking a good way to format the screen with all that information to be shown?
<br/>
<br/>
You can always reference what prior Final Fantasy games have done with displaying the data. Or, design your own on scratch paper. What I did in the past when working with that kind of stuff was first draw what looked good on paper, then in MSPaint, mimicked what I had on paper, but limiting myself to an image of 240x160, all the while aligning certain elements to 8x8 pixelboundaries if I planned to place those into BGs.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh, yeah, I was asking for a good way to format the screen, cos I've never been good with positioning stuff that I designed from scratch..
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, that screen does something similar to FF Dawn Of Souls, except that nothing's copied, lol, cos I wanted that design cos it looked nice and calm, and not blocky like all the other ones (just a big screen with gradiented menus and yeah)..
<br/>
<br/>
I would've gone with that but I wanted something a bit more.. original, since I wanted the challenge and cos it would look nice but.. yeah.. I can't really think of any place to put the data..
<br/>
<br/>
I've actually been trying to visualize in my mind where to place it.. but nothing seems "right".. hm.. Maybe I'll try that suggestion of drawing on paper later today, lol (no sleep -.-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
