    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, 
<br/>
I don't know how or what is doing that but the FF00FF color get replaced by some others color (little bit degraded around the sprite) when i switch to 256 color mode. 
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the way I convert sprite: 
<br/>
1) I open the picture (sprite without background) and copy it. 
<br/>
2) I make a new file: 256*256pixel 
<br/>
3) I paste the sprite 
<br/>
4) I make a new layer which is full of margenta color 
<br/>
5) I reduce the size of the sprite: 64*64pixel then I save. 
<br/>
<br/>
Once I did that (1 or 2 times for example), I make a new file which is the number of sprite files's height*64 pixel width. 
<br/>
I copy paste every sprite into a different layer. Once I'm done with the copy pasting thing, I switch to 256 color mode and HERE happend the drama !!! :/ the FF00FF color is replaced and the color(s) around the sprite is a little bit degraded. U can guess the result of playing the sprite xD. 
<br/>
<br/>
(all of that is done with THE GIMP) 
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone tell me the problem ? what is changing the color ? Is there a way to stop it from doing that 
<br/>
? (I can't manualy change the new colors because as it is a little bit degraded, there are too much colors to change :/) 
<br/>
<br/>
Thank in advance ++</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You may want to disable dithring when you convert to indexed mode.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Gimp sucks for palette work, anyone know a good app that does palette/pixeling stuff on Linux?<br/>_________________<br/>---yuriks---</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try the gimp. It was used for sinbad the sailor and shrek 2 so it can't be that bad. And it has been fine for me; although I do occasionally use usenti.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Productions like shrek 2  have there own programers to sort problems like the one being mentioned.
<br/>
<br/>
the only problem is they never release the code ... they just dont get opensource.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want an indexed sprit its best to start with indexed colours, disabling dithering will help like yuriks said.<br/>_________________<br/>i cant program but i make a mean piece of toast.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
