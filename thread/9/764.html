    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm having a problem using gfx2gba with mode 4.  I've tried saving my picture as .bmp, .tga, .pcx, .png and .xcf  they convert fine with most of those picture types but when i run the binary i get a sliced picture that only shows certain corners of the original pic.  I've checked my source with a tutorial's image source and it displays fine, so i know it's not that.
<br/>
<br/>
At this point i just want something that works.  If someone knows certain params to output for mode4 usage with gfx2gba that would help.  OR if someone knows of another program to convert images in linux that will do mode4 that would work.  - tHe_pUnK</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had the same problem. You need to strip the sprite first. THere is another post in reply to a message I posted on the same question. A helpful sprite stripper tool was posted there too! U should try and find it. I think its in this section of the forum</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Mode 4 is in full "strips", not 8x8 blocks, and that is why it srews your game up.
<br/>
<br/>
I goes like this:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It sounds like it's only displaying a quarter or less (8 x 8) of your sprite :( 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, try comparing your_sprite.h with tutorial_sprite.h and check for differences.
<br/>
<br/>
The utility that works for me is PCX2GBA (the Dovoto one), but it's a DOS program :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
