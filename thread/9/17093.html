    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to make the first color in my palette pinkish (31,0,16), but when i rearrange the palette in usenti, save the image, and load it again later, the palette seems to have reset itself, with black as the first color. I most certainly do not want black to be my transparent color. Any idea on what is going on? do i need to export to gba for it to save my palette?
<br/>
I have my project set up to automatically convert my graphics during build. If it's the only way to fix it, i'd be willing to pre-convert, but i'd rather not have to.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by zelbo on Wed Feb 03, 2010 7:31 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My guess is that the image is actually a direct-color (bitdepth &gt; 8). If this is the case, the image doesn't actually have a real palette (the one you see is constructed on the fly), so any palette-changes you make won't end up in the saved image. Save it as a 4bpp or 8bpp image if the palette order matters.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
