    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it possible to stream video inbound through the GBA link port?  I am trying to use the GBA as a display and was wondering if somebody has ever tried making a utility to do this.  Is the GBA link port data speed fast enough for full frame video?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I doubt the link port is fast enough... If it was you could quite easily stream video from the master GBA to the slave GBA in a game, and make the master do all the processing, simply having the slave GBA sending keypresses. But I'm going on..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're developing a custom device that attaches directly to the GBA, not a link cable, you can fit 2000 kbps through the GBA link port. Majesco's GBA Video cartridges, for comparison, are encoded at 100 kbps.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
