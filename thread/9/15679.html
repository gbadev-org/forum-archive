<br/>
Either way, you raise some interesting points that are making me reconsider the style of my idea.
<br/>
<br/>
Top-down: Easiest, very little detail.
<br/>
Side scrolling: Harder to draw, more detail and much better looking*
<br/>
Isometric: Probably way out of my league
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Did you try to building things with simple shapes in 3D? Sometimes that helps to get a "usable" look and it's not that hard to do, once you make yourself familiar with a software package. I hear blender is quite easy, but I use an old version of Cinema4D.
<br/>
But then, I do have some basic art skills, that let me do what I want most of the time... so I may be biased. ;^D<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hope it helps: 15min. of "work" (this is my coder art) resulted in the following image: <a href="http://www.robs-basement.de/images/VendMaster4k-MarkII.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
I will PM you a link to the Photoshop 6 file, if you like to, so you can check it out in more "detail" - it's still 22 x 32 - and hopefully learn from it. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
It's 32 colors, but you can easily reduce it to 16 colors without big changes in the image.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw: I believe, that if you are very good at one thing, most other things you won't be able to master, without totally neglecting the single thing you are good at. So, it's no loss, if you aren't exactly an artist, as long as you are a good programmer. :^)

You can only put your time so many places.  My theory is that you can only become super good at one thing in your life, and it will take your whole life.  You could also become very good at a few things, etc.

Try sketching on paper for a while before hitting the pixels.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had a lot of luck with using ugly programmer-drawn sprites and free internet resources for a demo of my game, which attracted an artist who made it look good in the end.
<br/>
<br/>
My point being:  if you're the programmer, make the game fun before worrying TOO much about whether your graphics are ugly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">True, although you would be surprised how much better a game 'feels' with appropriate graphics. Our brains associate look to feel so much that a new appearance can make some people feel like they are playing a different game!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since I'm working on a competition entry I cannot ask for outside help which means my coder art will be the final product :D
<br/>
That being said I'm hoping the gameplay will be good enough that people can see beyond poorly drawn graphics.
<br/>
<br/>
My main problem is drawing curves, can they be well done in an 8x8 square or should I be drawing 16x16 tiles?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#158826 - DekuTree64 - Wed Jun 18, 2008 10:30 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, for general repeating patterns like grass and dirt, 8x8 will probably never look good. You can use a bunch of 8x8 tiles to get the same effect as larger tiles though. I like 16x16 as the general size for things on GBA/DS size screens, or if you want more space for a body on characters they can be 16x24 or 16x32.
<br/>
<br/>
And coders can be artists too, but it does take the same kind of love for the craft as writing code. Otherwise it's probably not worth the amount of time it takes to get good. As sgeos said, you can't be the best at everything. But for someone like me, having many skills up to a fairly high level is better than being the best in the world at one thing.
<br/>
<br/>
Curves in pixel art are tricky, but since you have so few possible arrangements of pixels to begin with, it's not too tough to brute-force find what looks best :)
<br/>
Usually 2 or 3 shades of each color works best for me, so I can do a bit of manual anti-aliasing to give the illusion of smoother curves.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

Anyone can train talent, but in general only people with a passion for the craft bother to do so.

You do not need good art for something to be captivating.  My friend started a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.vindalf.net/vindalflist.html" target="_blank">webcomic</a> with <span style="font-weight: bold">really bad</span> stick figures.  Now he is on volume 360 and the stick figures are pretty good, although the art is still worse than most of the other webcomics I have looked at.
