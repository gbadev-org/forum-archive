    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm porting a PC game to GBA and was looking on the net for a program to rip graphics from an .exe file, not just the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I found Graphics Ripper 0.81 Beta ( <a class="postlink" href="http://www3.sympatico.ca/marclaf/RIP081.ZIP" target="_blank">http://www3.sympatico.ca/marclaf/RIP081.ZIP</a> ) which was designed for ripping graphics from MAME Roms, but I found it works quite well for PC games.
<br/>
<br/>
It's good, but not perfect... Does anyone know of anything else like this program?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Sorry, can a mod move this to the graphics section</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
