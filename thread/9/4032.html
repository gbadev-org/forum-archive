<br/>
<br/>
I have released a sprite and tile extractor program that I use when doing GBA programming. I have tried to clean it up for general public use, but it may still have some bugs.
<br/>
<br/>
In a nutshell it can
<br/>
- produce output similar to pcx2sprite
<br/>
- create maps and tile graphics in u8 or u16 format (i.e. rot or text bg)
<br/>
- output the file in either C or assembly
<br/>
- can generate entire projects including the make file (C only)
<br/>
<br/>
Things I cannot do yet are
<br/>
- support 16 colors (or reduce from 256 colors into multiple palettes)
<br/>
- generate project files in ASM
<br/>
<br/>
I am releasing the source code too in case anyone wants it.
<br/>
<br/>
I am still actively working on this project, so any suggestions, bugs or improvements would be appreciated. I hope people will find this useful.
<br/>
