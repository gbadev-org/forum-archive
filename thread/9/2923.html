<br/>
<br/>
I would like to know one thing...
<br/>
My problem is that i would rip some sprites in a gba rom, but the screenshot / OAM Viewer is too cheap, i make a sprite by an hour, and i almost never take the good sreen at right time, so is someone can tell me if it exist any program than can extract directly from the Roms any grpahic ?
<br/>
And if i do not, please link me some documentation about rom and i'll try to  make one :D
<br/>
<br/>
Thx
<br/>

<br/>
I'm French too, perhaps we could talk in private ;)
<br/>
Don't hesitate, french people are few on gba scene ^^

Anyway, the VBA emulator allows you to disable some BG.
<br/>
You might use the following menu entries :
<br/>
<br/>
Options&gt;Video&gt;Layers (last choice on VBA 1.7)
<br/>
<br/>
In addition to CTRL+N (next frame) and File&gt;Screen capture...
<br/>
<br/>
Then with an imagery tool, you'd do your sprite stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps ^^<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Thx for your answers ;)
<br/>
I didn't know the CTRL+N tip, i think it will grantly help me ^_^, but what i was talking about was a program that can extract directly from any rom the sprites ? :D

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not always. Sprite cels in many GBA programs are compressed, and especially for larger sprites, they may not be ordered in left-to-right and top-to-bottom reading order but instead some sort of optimized scattering produced by tools such as Objective.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, if a program uses the most straightforward storage for its sprites (uncompressed, 4-bit or 8-bit packed, left-to-right and top-to-bottom), you can rip the data with any tile editor such as 8TED, Tile Molester, etc. This probably won't give you the palettes though.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
