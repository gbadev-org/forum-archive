When using mode 3 display, everything is fine. However, the font size is enlarged when mode 4 is used. Why? Is there any method to solve this problem?
<br/>
Also, is there any software to convert font to bitmap(8-bit)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You cannot write to Video memory in terms of a byte, you can only use Word sized writes (see what the prior person said). So however you are putting the data to the display it is not likely working with this in mind. 
<br/>
<br/>
You can make your own software to make fonts, as well.  Use the GDI to estimate the width of the character preset your spacing. Write the text to a drawing surface then scan the drawing surface and convert the pixels to whatever way you wish them packed.   It is advisable however to consider antialiasing the fonts, or they might look a bit rough around the edges.
<br/>
<br/>
It's easier to do in Borland C++ Builder (RAD tools) but it's still quite doable in VC++.

Have fun!
