    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know there are some other people out there developing 3D games on the Gameboy Advance.  As far as I've seen most people are writing their own little 3D libraries.  Are there any 3D APIs out there for the GBA yet?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also wondering, what about a 3D API on GBA that tries to follow the OpenGL standard a OpenGB so to speak ;-)  Is this something anyone is interested in developing?<br/>_________________<br/>"Oh yeah, so what kind of warrior are you?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know that the GBA is a limited platform with no 3D support.  OpenGL is available on cell phones even.  The idea here would not be to have the GBA to offer a full OpenGL API, but rather a limited API that follows the OpenGL standard for the features it does support.  With some nice documentation of the supported features it would allow people to more quickly develop by using a API that many are already familiar with.<br/>_________________<br/>"Oh yeah, so what kind of warrior are you?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the <a class="postlink" href="http://sgade.com/" target="_blank">SGADE</a> library has some 3D functions and structures that may be worth looking into.  It has pretty good documentation too.<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
