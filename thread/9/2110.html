    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Space Twins is the best game of the compo! The graphics are absolutely beautiful! They remind me of Watman and other great high quality isometric games. Good quality isometric graphics are the hardest to do, and this game nails them perfectly! I just can't get over how nice the graphics are!
<br/>
<br/>
It's got my vote, but why is everyone voting for other games? Have they not seen this one? In my opinion, it blows all the other compo games away!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So explain to me how to _play_ the game?
<br/>
<br/>
imo pretty graphics are very much secondary to game play - they are also much easier to do than good gameplay!
<br/>
<br/>
If i want to look at eyecandy, i go to an art gallery or to the cinema ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not criticising the author of space twins - it looks like a very promising game engine, and the graphics are nice, but there are some way more playable games in the compo.
<br/>
<br/>
The way i chose my favourites was to play them all, and which ever game got me coming back the most is the best !
<br/>
<br/>
moneymatch was best for me - closely followed by Kitchen Acadamy.
<br/>
<br/>
cheers

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sokoban is excelent too, I've played that for hours, some wicked puzzles in there. And ClaQ is original, very playable and has excellent presentation - reminded me of Wario Ware in style. 
<br/>
<br/>
In fact all the puzzle games are really good, but I think take too much "getting into" to receive the votes they deserve. The pretty-but-shallow Sushi looks like it'll win the public vote, as it is the game that really grabs your attention if you play the entries for 5 minutes each on an emulator. Not that I'm having a go at Sushi - it is a quality game and has clearly had a lot of work put into it - but hasn't been played the most out of all the entries I flashed to my cart...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice graphics are always a plus, but sometimes I just want to grab a game and be able to start playing it with minimal effort of figuring out what the rules are.  
<br/>
<br/>
From that angle, moneymatch was an instant hit for me.  and the more I played it the more it impressed me.  
<br/>
<br/>
Most of the other games I tried had something of a "playtested by the developer" feel.  As in, they developed the rules and so they naturally know how to play the game.  Now, if those rules are just arbitrarily decided or not really planned at all, someone else picking that game up might have a very hard time figuring out how to play the game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I found sushi the cat fun to play, for a short while. But in the long run, i'd prefer the taitris or maler master game which i found had an interesting concept. But, i only gave each game a 5 minutes test run.<br/>_________________<br/>-Inside every large program is a small program struggling to get out. (Hoare's Law of Large Programs)

Pretty graphics alone do not make a good game.  Spacetwins is pretty indeed, but it suffers in gameplay department.  Sushi plays like a platformer and it feels like a platformer right off the back - while it's not necessarily my cup of tea, it gets my vote because it gets the most overall points in the range of my criteria:  gameplay (1st and foremost) / inuitiveness / graphics / music / replayability.
