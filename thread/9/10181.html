    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Many video games have cartoonish characters with huge heads, sometimes larger than their shoulders. They are often shown wearing clothes with much too small of a neckhole to have any chance in heck of pulling them on. Case in point: <a class="postlink" href="http://images.google.com/images?q=mario" target="_blank">Mario's red shirt</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://images.google.com/images?q=earthbound+ness" target="_blank">Ness's striped shirt</a>, and <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Zelda_Wind_Waker_Link_waves_goodbye.jpg" target="_blank">Link's green tunic</a>. Google Image Search gives examples from other media for <a class="postlink" href="http://images.google.com/images?q=chibi" target="_blank">chibi</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://images.google.com/images?q=precious+moments" target="_blank">Precious Moments</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://images.google.com/images?q=south+park" target="_blank">South Park</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://images.google.com/images?q=charlie+brown" target="_blank">Peanuts</a>, etc.

<span style="font-weight: bold">The 64,000 pok?dollar question:</span> How do such characters put their clothes on in the morning? Otherwise the game's intro sequence will have a big ugly "SCENE MISSING".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Each morning they go to this machine that makes their clothes right on their bodies, so they don't hav eto take it on or off.  Then, to take it off, the machine unsews everything and stores it for the next day ^^
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm going with brennan's answer and comparing it to baby clothes.. as they have simular issues..  Some have 2 or 3 snaps on the top of the sholder to make the hole bigger, as well as in the back.. some snap all the way down the length of them, both front and back.  Also, keep in mind that they may have fabric over the snaps, so they are not even visible unless you look real good.
<br/>
<br/>
Then.. to go from baby clothes to adult clothes, some sexy stuff have zippers up the back, side, etc.  These.. I can't remember if they are noticable or not.. but if the person wearing them can fill the clothes out right.. you won't notice any zippers anyway.. ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
