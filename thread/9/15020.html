    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I am trying to decipher the TONC background tutorial but have run into a snag: Halfway down while trying to explain what SBB you are currently in, a variable, pitch is pulled seemingly out of thin air. Can someone explain what this variable is?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In a graphics context, pitch is the number of bytes per scanline or row. It's related to width, which is the number of elements in a row, but there's a difference in bitdepth per element and perhaps padding too. 
<br/>
<br/>
In this case is should have actually said width (more precisely mapWidth, in units of tiles) here; I'll fix this later.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh I didnt realize you were the guy who wrote tonc! Nice job on the tutorial, I've learned a lot about the ARM processor from these lessons
<br/>
<br/>
Thats what I thought pitch must be so in this case it should be 160? 
<br/>
or since i'm using 256 colors should it be 320?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know of any 256-color mode on the GBA with a 320-byte row pitch. Mode 4 has a 240-byte row pitch, and modes 0, 1, and 2 are tiled with a 16- to 128-byte row pitch.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
