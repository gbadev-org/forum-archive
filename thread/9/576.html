<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don't understand transparency on the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have a simple example showing this capability off?  Like a sprite moving around a multi-colored background and the sprite maintains transparency on the parts it should the entire time?
<br/>
<br/>
I am working in mode 2 with a bitmap map and a bitmap sprite. The sprite is my character and has white surrounding the character outline. The map is multicolored. I want to be able to move the sprite around the map and have the white color around the sprite show up transparent so the background map will show through it.
<br/>
<br/>
Any help please?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
