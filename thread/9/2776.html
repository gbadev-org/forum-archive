    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have some trouble with sprites that goes out of screen in the left and top (left -&gt; x negative, top -&gt; y negative). If i use a 16x16 sprite, i don't want it to be off when x &lt; 0 or y &lt; 0 but when x &lt; -16 or y &lt; -16. Does this problem occur often or the problem is in my sprite_manager ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you ANDing your positions with 511 for x and 255 for y? If not, a negative will fill the upper part of the attribute with 1's, which will make a mess of things. For example, X position 510 will place the upper left corner 2 pixels off the left of the screen. Since -2 in binary is 1111111111111110, then if you AND with 511, which is 111111111, you get 111111110, which is 510, so it works. The positions aren't exactly signed numbers, because 128 for a Y coordinate is still on the screen, even though it's the same binary value as an 8-bit -128. They wrap around in the same way though, so anAND is all you need.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.

Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
