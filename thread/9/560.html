    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd like to make a 3D fighter for the GBA, and I've been looking for 3D engines, but the only one I can seem to find is by the Pocketeers, costs me money and isn't available yet.
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if there aren't any Free 3D Engines available, are there any Free Pseudo 3D Engines? Like what Namco made for Tekken Advance.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone could point me in that direction... that'd be great.
