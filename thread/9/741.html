You look like you are a beginner so Im gonna start explaining everything to make sure you understand, sorry if you already knew those things.
<br/>
<br/>
Well there are several things you could do, but these are the options
<br/>
the number x number bitd are how much pixels (dots on the computer screen) take up each graphical option for the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Sprites (if you don;t know this, a sprite is a object on screen, like Mario and toads were Sprites in Super Mario Bros).
<br/>
<br/>
Square Sprites.
<br/>
8 by 8.
<br/>
16 by 16.
<br/>
32 by 32.
<br/>
64 by 64.
<br/>
<br/>
Horizontal Sprites.
<br/>
16 by 8.
<br/>
32 by 8.
<br/>
32 by 16.
<br/>
64 by 32.
<br/>
<br/>
Vertical Sprites.
<br/>
8 by 16.
<br/>
8 by 32.
<br/>
16 by 32.
<br/>
32 by 64.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And we have tile backgrounds, these are backgrounds made of a number of tiles we already have but them together make the eventual picture you see on your screen. All these tiles are 8 by 8 pixels. You can have objects bigger then that but then you must use several tiles for one object wich pracitcally all poeple do.
<br/>
<br/>
I am myself am almost beginning on a game on wich i would need some graphics, the game is just an excersize for me and I wont try to send it to a publisher or something. It will just become avaible on GBAdev.org.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to make those sprites you could make these for me, if you dont want to you obviously dont have to :).
<br/>
<br/>
A red button of the A button on the Game Boy Advance.
<br/>
A blue button of the B button on the Game Boy advance.
<br/>
A yellow button of the L button on the Game Boy Advance.
<br/>
A green button of the R button on the Game Boy Advance.
<br/>
<br/>
And arrows for the 4 direction of the D-pad. (up, down, left, right).
<br/>
<br/>
If you could do it I would like round buttons resembling the actual buttons for A and B and other sprites resembling the shoulder buttons for L and R.
<br/>
<br/>
If you dont want to make those sprites its ok, maybe im repeating myself here but no harm in saying it again to mak sure. I had the 64 by 64 format in mind for the round buttons, maybe you need other dimensiosn for the shoulder buttons but your the artist now ;).<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tip: for the round buttons... just make one button, and use some palette magic to change the color of it... That would save quite some VideoRAM.
<br/>
Same thing goes for the shoulder and arrow-buttons... create one and use hardware palettes and rotations to make the other.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This third sprite will become a "A" if you use this palette:
