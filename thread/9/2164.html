    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I've been having a problem that I'm not sure how to fix.  I've made 4 sprites 16x16.  The first sprite displays perfectly but none of the ones afterwards do.  What I was wondering is what is the best graphics file size:
<br/>
<br/>
ie 64x64, 16x128, etc
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What I'm getting at is right now I have to have my sprites as 16x16 bytes before it is converted to GBA.  What I want to know is if there is a way to combine the sprites in one bmp and then process all of the sprites, turning them to GBA.  I hope this helps.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're using 2D mapping mode, place all your sprite cels on a 128-byte-wide bitmap and convert them all at once. (For 16-color sprite cels, this is 256 pixels wide; for 256-color sprite cels, this is 128 pixels wide.)
<br/>
<br/>
If you're using 1D mapping mode, place all your sprite cels top-to-bottom in a single bitmap and convert them all at once. Thus, if you have 20 cels of 16x16 pixels, make a 16x320 pixel bitmap.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That is exactly what I was looking for.  I'd tried so many different file type I was pulling out my hair! :) I tried them in a column but when I looked at my graphic size i was 1column short on my sprites.  I've been able to fix things ip.  Thankyou.
