    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">gfx2gba is command-line based, so just double-clicking the icon in windows won't work.
<br/>
<br/>
To see what you're doing, and add options to the command line, either run it from a makefile/batch file, or start a command prompt window (also known as DOS shell window) and run it from there.
<br/>
<br/>
To see the options, just read the readme.txt file you get with it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Presumably, you are running it in windows.
<br/>
<br/>
In windows XP, you just click on the start button (Bottom left of your screen), click run and type CMD.
<br/>
(in windows 95/98/NT you click start, then click command/dos prompt.)
<br/>
This brings up a dos window and you can run it from there.
<br/>
<br/>
These simple Dos commands might help;
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
cd folder_name = change directory (folder)
<br/>
(note : the folder your are trying to view must be a subfolder of the one you are in)
<br/>
<br/>
dir = Display directory (folder) contents
<br/>
<br/>
cd.. = up a directory (folder)
<br/>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
You can just type these commands in to get to your gfx2gba folder,
<br/>
then type 'GFX2GBA' to load the program.
<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, get PCX2GBA and just drag &amp; drop your files(PCX files)(in windows) onto it to get a .h file that you can use in your projects.
<br/>

                                      Hope this helps :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
