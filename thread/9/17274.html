    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm NTA and ive been wondering about alot of thing concerning the gba graphics and videos also some concerns with pokemon fire red and emarald
<br/>
<br/>
for the first part i notice that fire red uses mode 4
<br/>
i also see wher the bgs are in order in priority too
<br/>
<br/>
i have images for each background
<br/>
but what if i wanted to animate a sprite on the title screen?  i would mind using the smaller sprites that are used in the game 16x32; but the pokemon sprites are 64x64 and i was wondering if i could animate them? and would i be able to have a delay between the frames? since its only two and im also wondering about playing videos ive seen an avi to gba converter but i dont understand how i could implement a video to a rom in stead of turning the video into a rom like the intro video for the pokemon games
<br/>
<br/>
and also for the 4bgs, which one or two might contain the sprites i want to animate, its fine for them to all have different palettes right? as long as the first color is transparent?
<br/>
<br/>
also would it be possible once ive made a title screen and converted it would it be possible to add that to a rom and replace\insert the title screen thats already there and would i need to repoint? fire red for exmaple
<br/>
<br/>
any help would be appreciated :|</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Bleh.  You can animate any sprite of any size by loading its VRAM and/or OAM information each vblank you want to change the sprite graphics/dimensions.
<br/>
<br/>
To play a video on the GBA/DS, you place a video player in your source code somewhere that streams the video into RAM from the ROM and converts/decompresses/does magic to make it run on full screen with sound playing.
<br/>
<br/>
BGs do not contain sprites.  They can contain animations that change frame to frame (like a movie player), but are not sprites - a hardware feature that is completely different.
<br/>
<br/>
You will not ever, ever be able to hack a commercial game's title screen and change it to your own content.  It is illegal because you are breaking copyright laws and will go to jail.  Now that is post is on the net forever, I'm sure the SEA and teh FBI are already tracing your IP address and will want to talk with you soon about your pirating ways as you have implied that you are playing this commercial game on an emulator from a pirated ROM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">lol its not exactly that its just that im used to hacking pokemon and im just very preoccupied with they way the titlescreen is i usually hack the titlescreens for mainly fire red but it has limitations and ive also wanted to figure out how the intro video was done and how i could make my own and put it into the game  and the way i could make my own custom titlescreen and implement into the fire red rom using and the same with a video
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
is that true? lol as many people do that everyday? people even compile theyre own scripts for pokemon creating new storylines and everything <a href="http://www.pokecommunity.com" target="_blank">www.pokecommunity.com</a> and its not like i make profit from it even in rpg maker ppl have pokemon starter kits or whatever and they have custom battle systems and everything
<br/>
<br/>
oh and thinks about explaing the video player part really helped :P
<br/>
<br/>
now i just gotta find the source code</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by NTA on Wed May 26, 2010 5:28 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lol - no prob.  Your post sounded so much like a lot of the first post "I want to make pokemon, but wiht my graphics and a new pokemon picture!!!" that I may have jumped to conclusions.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, it sounds like you are trying to re-release a commercial game with your own codes hacked in.  That is not legal nor allowed by this board or the law.  That is piracy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">lol i see what u mean
<br/>
but ut isnt exaclty like that i just like the wy they did theyres and i dont know where else to start lol
<br/>
ive  was thinking of having a a picture or image saying press start to view movie and then the video would start from there i think its more complicated than it sounds though
<br/>
wish i couldve started this a year back =|
<br/>
where would i be able to get a video player?
<br/>
<br/>
