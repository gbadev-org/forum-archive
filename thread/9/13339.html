    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I remember a while ago I saw somewhere a spritesheet with face parts on it, I think from a gameboy/color/advance game where you have to put together a character.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know what I'm talking about and where I might find these sprites?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

-- You know, the human.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nope, neither of those... I don't think that aim of the game was to make a character, it was just something in the game I think.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are some fonts that have faces and/or face parts that I've seen. You could try to find a free font and use those to build a sprite sheet of your own.
<br/>
<br/>
If you build something using "borrowed" art that makes a cool game or demo, you can usually find an artist on the forums who will reskin your old graphics for new, custom freshness.
