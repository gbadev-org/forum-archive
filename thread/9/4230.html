    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there,
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if you guys know of a way to re-order palette index entries? I converted over a bunch of gifs to make animation strips to use in a GBA demo, but even though the gifs are of the same character (different animations) their palette index entries are in a different order.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to re-order a palette entry so that all the sprites reference the correct colours? My goal here is to make them all use the same 16-colour palette. (For reference I'm a newbie Pro Motion v5.0 user, so I'm not sure if the program already has functionality to perform this palette operation).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Open your cels in GIMP (or any other image editor with an indexed mode). Paste all the cels into one RGB-color image file in a strip from top to bottom. Use dark black (#000000) for transparency and dark bluish gray (#222244) for black. Now convert this strip to indexed color and then to GBA format.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I just tried to re-order the palettes entries, which I thought I had working on Pro Motion but it just seems to copy the colours rather than updating the index references on the actual image. Does anyone know how to do that in Pro Motion?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After spending some time with GIMP, I used the method of putting all the sprites into one big image file. Then using that palette to output all the sprites into pcx files.

Thanks for the tip.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
