    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was going through the GBAJunkie tutorials and i have finally made it to tutorial 6, Tiled Modes (0-2). Now, i copied all of the code exactly and it worked! 
<br/>
<br/>
The problem comes when i try to create my OWN maps. It seems whenever i try to convert my .pcx file it comes up with this "stringfailed to open pcx file". I know this is a valied .pcx file. It does give me data, but the problem is that it is junk. I look at the tile viewer and it is nothing like my tiles. Some help here?
<br/>
<br/>
The image converters i used are ImageForge (freeware) and 123 Graphic Converter (shareware) if that matters.
<br/>
<br/>
Tell me what you use to make .pcx files by the way so i know.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not familiar with the tool, but I'd double check the bit-depth of your pcx image.  If it's not 256 color indexed, I doubt it would work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have changed my bit-depth to 8-bit (256 colors) and still no luck. It keeps printing that message i said before. Anyone else have an idea?

If anybody could just describe what you do when converting to a .pcx file, I might see my problem.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you sure what you get is junk? Maybe it's a 16 vs. 256 color issue? The tiles have been created for 16 color use and you are trying to use them as 256 color tiles?
<br/>
<br/>
There are also two types of tilemaps, one with 16 bit indices and one with 8 bit indices. 16 bit for use with non-rotatable backgrounds and 8 bit for rotatable backgrounds.
<br/>
<br/>
I've written my own image converter that read PCX and SPR files and removes duplicate tiles for the tilebanks in either 16 or 256 color mode with either 8 or 16 bit tilemap indices. The sprite converter obviously doesn't optimize tiles nor does it produce a tilemap.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That might help some. And i checked my image and changed it to 256 colors, it still didn't work.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think many of people here use tile modes; why that implies they use PCX files I don't know.
<br/>
<br/>
I use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.seanreid.ca/project/TileMax" target="_blank">TileMax</a> to convert images and edit maps. It doesn't support PCX, but it does support PNG, GIF, and JPEG. It allows you to edit you maps and tiles and export them to C code, object files, or anything else you write a plugin for.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can you send the program to me in a zip file (dagamer34@yahoo.com) because i don't have a program that opens a file with a "tar.gz" extension.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No. I can suggest getting a program to decompress *.tar.gz archives. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.stuffit.com/" target="_blank">Stuffit Expander</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.zipitfast.com/" target="_blank">ZipItFast!</a> are two GUI tools will decompress tarballs; but I use the traditional Unix tools tar and gzip.
