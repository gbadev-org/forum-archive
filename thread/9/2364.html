    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey,
<br/>
Ive created a voxel demo using mode 5 (u can download it from the main page at the moment). now i would like to create some nice maps. i was just wondering if anyone new of a program that would generate would allow the simulatneosly generation of both heightfields and color maps for this sort of engine, or has anyone tackled this problem
<br/>
thanks for your help</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've never done it before myself, but how about using something like Paint Shop Pro to draw an image with a color layer and a height layer, then exporting the layers to 2 different bitmap files and converting them to the format you want?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
thanks for your reply. i was toying with this idea. setting up a pallete of colours and using them for different heights i.e. red = 1, green =2 etc. but i just thought there might be a tool for doin this automagically.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What I'd do is take <a class="postlink" href="http://www.povray.org" target="_blank">POV-Ray</a> and create a script where it puts a terrain object down using a heightfield, then takes a snapshot of it from an orthographic camera above it looking straight down, and then use the image for colour.  That way you can exploit the many features of that program, such as making a gradient from the height data (blending either colours or whole textures), getting sun shadows both sharp and smooth, putting in localised lights as appropriate and overlaying textures, such as a runway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey,
<br/>
I had a look at POV ray, its seems too complicated for what im looking for, plus i dont have time right now to be learning something completely new. i think i might go with that photoshop idea, maybe have layers to ease the implementation of the relationship between height and colour, unless anyone else has an idea?????</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
