I am working on a game that I thought I might be able to use 64x64 sprites, until I realized how much space the actual bitmaps take up.  But I was hoping that I could simply stretch the normally square 32x32 sprite to better take advantage of the space.  Is this the right way to go about doing that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

TALL and WIDE do not stretch the sprites graphics. They are states telling the shape of non squared sprites.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">Exceptions are fun</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How many 64x64 sprites do you intend to use? With only a 240x160 screen it can fill up pretty quickly so it can't be that many. If you're worried about the amount of animation frames, you don't have to load them up all at once; you can overwrite obj-VRAM at any time. Well not <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> time I guess, but you should be able to finish copying before the VBlank runs out if you use CpuFastSet or DMA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's important to bear in mind that (in addition to the 128 object limit) the GBA can only process so much sprite data on each scanline, and affine sprites consume more than three times the available cycles that normal sprites do.
<br/>
<br/>
If you use 32x32 scaled to 64x64, you will not be able to have more than 5 of them sharing a single scanline (including sprites that are partially or entirely obscured by other sprites) without having dropout occur.

<br/>
<br/>
When I said the sprites take up too much room, it's not in the RAM, but the actual bitmaps themselves.
<br/>
<br/>
I made 10 64x64 frames, and when I compiled them into the .gba file, the file size increased by 50-75 Kb.  I can live with the 32x32 size, but I don't want to have to shell out 500-700 Kb for the animations of the main sprite <span style="font-style: italic">alone</span>.  I have so many other things like the actual levels, coding, and enemy sprites, that I'd rather conserve space than find out halfway through the project that I'll end up way over my 4096 Kb goal.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
One quick (hopefully not too stupid) question:
<br/>
Am I right to assume that a 32x32 bitmap would take up 1/4 of the space a 64x64 bitmap would?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So you are worried about the total size of your ROM?
<br/>
<br/>
First, you should decide if a smaller rom size will be worth uglier sprites -- remember what scaled sprites looked like on the SNES?  Neat while they were scaling, but ugly if you caught them in a still frame.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, consider some sort of compression on your bitmaps.  Even something simple like run-length encoding usually significantly shrinks down the size.
<br/>
<br/>
Third, if you aren't using 16-color sprites, switching to them will really cut the size of your graphics data in half.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">64*64*10 = 40960 bytes. Gauauu is right on both counts: If you use 16-color sprite cels, you can cut that in half. And yes, run-length compression of the transparent areas of the sprite cel is a big win.
<br/>
<br/>
But in a modern commercial-quality GBA game, it might be wise to devote 500 KB to a main character. You have 8192 KB available in the "64 Mbit" cart.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
