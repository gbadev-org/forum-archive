I don't know if it's easier than Catapult (or more or less complete) but more documented.
<br/>
<br/>
I use it as gba newbie programmer and manage to do really cool things with the IDE and library.
<br/>
But it has limitations too, and the more I use it, the more I'll try to write my own hardware fonctions ^^<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
