    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know the program which can count tiles (8x8) in the graphic and say how many tiles of each kind there are???
<br/>
<br/>
I just want to know if there are tiles made by mistake or tiles which exist only once or twice and maybe I can replace them...
<br/>
<br/>
thanks
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't have a util that does exactly what you want, but my mapEditor does something similar.  The idea is that you can load in as many tilePages you want into the editor, draw up your maps, then the tool identifies which unique tiles you've used in your map, and then packs those into a unique BG tile list for easy uploading to vram.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I do it this way because most map tools allow you to draw with very small selections...my editor is more designed to work with pre-built tile sections ( say, like a column or a staircase, etc ) that you can easily paste in (though you can do it the lamo slow way of tile by tile if you want)...and many times these pre-built sections will contain redundant tiles, which is ok really, because my util strips them down to the smallest unique set that it can.
<br/>
<br/>
So, in short, I'd recommend not worrying about duplicate tiles at the graphic end unless you are using a map editing tool that is not particularly sophisticated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
