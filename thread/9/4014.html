<br/>
<br/>
Basically I have a lot of bmp files and I want to ensure they all the the same 256 colour palette.  I would also need to ensure that colour 0 is black to make the transparencies work correctly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well one thing you can do is to make one LARGE picture containing all of your pictures; and then use that pallette.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason why I suggest this method is so that the final pallette takes into consideration the distribution of colours, so that you don't have for example, a pallette that has more shades of red than blue when 3 pictures are mostly blue and only one is mostly red.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
