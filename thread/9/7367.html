It could potentially be useful if your planning is closely tied to your implementation, or if you have tools that export data specifically for that format.

Don't use it, then.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I've found it to be useful, working with a system where I have different sized sprites, and only swap sprites out of video memory in large chunks (1/4 of sprite memory at a time, for example).....
<br/>
<br/>
Then, when doing the graphics work, I can put the whole "chunk" into a single image, and convert to data as one big unit, without having to convert each sprite separately.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not 100% convinced I'm doing it the optimal way, but it ended up being easier using 2d in the way I'm doing it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Watch Super Mario 3, Kart Fighter, or Kirby's Adventure in an NES emulator with a pattern table display (Nintendulator or *shudder* NESticle), and see other games that use the same technique.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've never found any situation where 2D mode was more useful on GBA. Every time I've tried to come up with a use on it, it turned out to be at least just as easy to arrange my data for 1D. I guess it was just dragged along from older systems, although I don't know why those older systems would bother with it either :)
<br/>
<br/>
2D mapping is useful on the DS with bitmap sprites though, to display a large bitmap spread over several of them.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
