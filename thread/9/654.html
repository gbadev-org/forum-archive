    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought about posting a position for 1-2 artists in the vocation section (which I may yet do), but I don't exactly get the sense that many artists frequent this message board.

Note:  I'd be looking for people who wouldn't be asking any huge salaries or anything. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
