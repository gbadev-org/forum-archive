    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, I'm a pencil artist (for the most part), as well as a pixil artist. Seeing how I'm going to have troubles learning to code, I thought I would find a way to become some sort of graphics artist for some team somewhere out there in need of some graphics (mostly icons) for some sort of DS homebrew. I have made myself familiar with almost all aspect sizes of icons (from around 12x12 to 32x32). Now the problem is, I mostly work in 32x32, as I need a large canvas for more details, but i was wondering if my icons (because they're all I have on me currently, I lost all my other stuff is a reinstallation of the computer I use) are up to snuff with the homebrew criteria.
<br/>
<br/>
Here just a few examples of what I've made:
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I know they're slightly large in deminsion, especially for a DS/GBA screen, but does it look like I have what it takes? (I used to have over 60 icons of different suits of armour and weapons, but like I said, I lost it in the reinstallation of my computer)<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

<br/>
That's true of relatively flat areas, but conversions of detailed graphics look less ugly. You can use "posterize to 32 levels" to preview conversions of true-color to high-color. In some cases, you can even go to 8-bit or 4-bit without losing noticeable detail.

<br/>
In 2D modes, the DS alpha channel is 1-bit (all opaque or all transparent). It's possible to make an entire layer or an entire sprite semitransparent, but not per pixel unless you draw your sprites as quads using the 3D core.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Basically, the programmers will create some conversion tools.  Your art needs to work with their tools.  The GBA/DS basically use 4-bit color, so your images need to be converted to 15 colors + transparency at some point.  Generally, images are indexed and then converted to binary or source.
<br/>
<br/>
This has a couple of implications for the artist.  First, you can not use more than 15 colors + something to represent transparency.  It is common for artists to use formats that do not support transparency.  Second, you may need to make indexed images.
<br/>
<br/>
PNG is a loss-less format that supports transparency, but transparent pixels may or may not be useful useful for conversion tools.  Pixels on the GBA/DS are either 100% transparent or 100% opaque.
<br/>
<br/>
Using PNG, pixels can have any transparenct level (37%), and you could even create a gradient from 0% to 100% transparency with everything in between.  The GBA/DS can not deal with this kind of transparency though.
<br/>
<br/>
You want something lossless, because that way you know it will only have 15 colors + something represent transparency.  Indexing your images may make them easier to work with, and some software even lets you put your palette in the order you want it in.

What he said.  A couple other thoughts:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  The 15-color palette limit applies to each tile, or each sprite.   You can have up to 16 sprite palettes and 16 background palettes on the screen at once*.  So, for example, your background tiles could use a few different palettes.  In my game, Anguna, for example, in the overworld, I have 2  palettes for tiles in use at any time -- one for basic ground/grass tiles, and one for rocks/walls tiles.  So while you do need to work within the 15-color limits, you will likely be able to use more than one palette for areas where you'll really need to (I say likely, as it depends on the overall design of the game -- what's on the screen at once, how your programmer will implement palette loading/swapping/etc)
<br/>
<br/>
2.  Understand and use the 15 colors to your advantage.  In other words, keep track of the palettes you use with different images.  Reuse palettes whenever there's significant overlap.  And, unless you have tons of time to make lots of sprites and tiles, palette swaps are your friend.  Your programmer will love you.
<br/>
<br/>
* -- There might be ways of tricking the gba into using more by changing palettes during refreshes, but I'm ignoring that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#159193 - sgeos - Thu Jun 26, 2008 7:19 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">15 colors is not a set limit, but if you want to use more, you will probably need to do something tricky.  Tricky has other limits, and you need to know what the hardware can and can not do before you think about tricky things.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are curious about tricks, think paper dolls + using extra palettes.  The problem is, you only have 16 object (sprite) and 16 background palettes.  In theory, you could use all of them for one crazy compound object, but you could not do anything else.
<br/>
<br/>
The other way I know of is scanline effects.  You change the palette on a certain scanline, or every scanline.  There are speed issues though.  You can not change every palette every scanline and still do what you need to do.  Complex scanline effects will be prone to bugs or just not working at all because they are not possible (if you are going really crazy).
<br/>
<br/>
Palette animations are like scanline effects, only you change the palette every frame.  Games like Secret of Mana use this for things like water and lava.  The images are actually static (they do not change) and they never show more than 15 colors per frame.
<br/>
<br/>
That is a long way of saying, just use 15 colors + transparency for now.

Unless we are talking about a masochist, I think the artist will be happier.  Programmers should be happy to have access to extra art.  I don't see any reason why your tile paging system should care how many tilesets your game includes.  ROM size is your limit.  Although yes, without compression you can max out the ROM size quite easily.

I guess you're right.  I was thinking in terms of my own experience, where I was programmer + game designer, and had an artist with relatively limited time.  Palette swaps from my artist meant I got to add more enemies into my game, as "just making more different enemy graphics" wasn't an option.

<br/>
On the PC, you would edit the palette indices in an indexed images.  It depends on your software.  Games typically store images and palatte separately though, and define image palatte pairs for display purposes.  This is why palette swaps are so natural.  No new images, maybe a new palette (maybe not) and a new palette image pair.

Yes, because you are storing each pixel with 8 bits instead of, say 24.  The palette only add 24 * say 256 bits to your image assuming it stores a palette with 256 entries.

Good plan.  Using the GIMP you index an image, although the GIMP is a bad tool for pixel art.  I suspect Graphics Gale can do everything you want to do.

It should be "<span style="font-weight: bold">16</span> bits * 256 entries." The NDS doesn't have 24bit colors, only 15bit (+ 1bit of "alpha"). ;^)

I was talking about the data section for files on the PC.  Naturally, with compressed file formats the number of pixels only kind of correlate to the number of bytes.
<br/>
<br/>
When I convert art, I typically just drob LSBs of each RGB component.  (OK, the truth is that I really prefer to work in HSB space.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so when it comes to the original image, I would make it colored correct? But, could I make a grey scale palette to make the original images of all things in, and then make multiple other palettes that'll just replace the original grey scale when needed to be done? also currently I am working on a little 1 panel sprite (just a standing there frame of it) to show what I can do. but what should its height deminsion be? it's right now 32x32, but thats just a little to small from what i see, could I change it to 37 in height and not really make it to large for the screen?<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

Slighly longer: It pretty much depends on the game. If it allowed multi object sprites, you could, e.g. cut it in half and have two objects represent the whole sprite. You could also use differnt sizes for the objects (wide or tall object modes.)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are going for monochrome art (or have other special requirements), you can work in greyscale and change the palette at runtime.
<br/>
<br/>
Imagine you have a guy.  He has skin and hair.  If you use greyscale, how can you ensure that his skin and hair are colored properly if they have roughly the same brightness?  You do not have to use the final colors.  You could give him green skin and pink hair and then replace those with more reasonable colors at runtime.

Given a proper art spec, you can blit to VRAM or permute at build time.  If you blit to VRAM, you probably want to cache frames.  If you permute at build time, you may wish to exclude combinations that probably will not be used.  (To save space.)
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, think paper dolls.

In theory, yes.  In practice it is just easier to use different colors.  You can make a green dragon with a yellow belly and red eyes, and then create the alternative palettes later.  If you want to, you could even have a palette spec so that any palette can be used with any monster and not look horrible.  For example:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">Color 0x0: Transparent
<br/>
Color 0x1: Black
<br/>
Color 0x2: White
<br/>
Color 0x3: Eyes
<br/>
Color 0x4: Skin Light
<br/>
Color 0x5: Skin Base
<br/>
Color 0x6: Skin Shadow
<br/>
Color 0x7: Hair Light
<br/>
Color 0x8: Hair Base
<br/>
Color 0x9: Hair Shadow
<br/>
Color 0xA: Clothing Light
<br/>
Color 0xB: Clothing Base
<br/>
Color 0xC: Clothing Shadow
<br/>
Color 0xD: Sub Clothing Light
<br/>
Color 0xE: Sub Clothing Base
<br/>
Color 0xF: Sub Clothing Shadow</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
In theory, the sprite's palette could even be filled in algorithmically if you use some like this.

<br/>
That optimization had not occurred to me.  This is why it is good idea to run things by a couple of other people.  Yes, the art could be stored 2 bit per pixels (transparent, light, base, shadow), and you could use some other metadata to shift it into the final palette position.  The thing I like about this, is that you only have to store the HSB values for the base color, and you can fill the light and shadow in at run time.  (Note that just changing the brightness is not best way of doing this; hue needs to be changed a little as well, depending on whether you want a hot shadow or a cold shadow.)

Basically, you create one animated character template.  Then you create all the costume animations so they will fit that template.  Then you create the other characters and make sure that they are also compatible with the template.  All of your character will move the same.  If you need big and small characters, then you create the big template and the small template and create two animations for each outfit.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, it just amounts to the artists putting in a lot of hours.  For what it's worth, they may not actually put in any more hours.  Once the system is set up, I suspect that making characters with unique looks could be done very efficiently.

From the standpoint of the publisher, they need to look at the projected ROI of "Animal Crossing GBA" and compare it with the projected ROI for any of the other wonder proposed projects coming through the door.  Then they pick the one they think will do the best.  They do not have unlimited resources (can't make everything), nor do their customers (can't buy everything).

Animated sprites are hard.  I'm not sure what your ultimate goals are, but for what it is worth, ability is often taken for granted in the world of commercial art; it is all about speed.  I remember commenting that a certain artist's work looked pretty good to me, and the lead reasponded 'anyone who makes it this far can do that; he is not fast enough'.  Of course, if you are content remaining a hobbiest, none of this matters.
