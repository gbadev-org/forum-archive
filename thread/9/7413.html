what's (for you) the best 3d graphic tool or software you can find...(and if is free, better :D)

<br/>
and what are the best tutorials for 3d graphics...:D

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My favorite modeller is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.caligari.com/" target="_blank">trueSpace</a>. Anything version 4 or above is plenty for most game models, although it doesn't look like they're even selling 4 anymore. 
<br/>
Normally it's pretty pricey, but they have specials pretty frequently that are much better (like, a few months ago they had trueSpace 5 for $79, when the normal price is $395).
<br/>
<br/>
The built in skeletal animation system is pretty crappy though. There's a plugin that works good, but I don't think there's any documentation on its data format so you couldn't really use it for a game.
<br/>
The actual model data format is pretty straightforward and well documented though. I wrote an exporter for it a couple years ago for a demo.
<br/>
<br/>
As for tutorials... you're on your own :)
<br/>
I usually start with a single polygon and just scoot vertices around, add an edge here, remove an edge there, until I've got the shape I want.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

Now before you yell at me because of how bad a program that is, I say this because it's the only free one I've seen thats any good. It also has an extensive tutorial to get you started. Did I mention, it's free? This way, you don't go spending money on something you may not end up getting into.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure, but I think 3d canvas has a good selection of export formats for models and such.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

<br/>
<br/>
I've found that I can model stuff twice as fast in Sketchup than any other 3D tool I've used. Reason? As the name suggests, the program is all about "sketching" your ideas in 2D (either in space or onto another 3d surface) then stretching them out into 3D shapes. Its manipulation tools are very intuitive.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I haven't used Sketchup for generating any game assets... so I'm not sure how well that would work for you. But I highly recommend taking a look.

Don't most 3D modeling programs let you sketch a 2D polygon and then extrude it to a stack of <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_%28geometry%29" target="_blank">prisms</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiprism" target="_blank">antiprisms</a>?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think that you should get a demo of Maya and mainly focus on learning everything maya has to offer. There are lots of tutorials in the maya documentation which are easy to follow and remember. I personally feel that it has the best workflow ever. 
<br/>
<br/>
Sure great 3D art can be achieved with cheaper tools but it is always better to learn the industry standard. PIXAR, Dreamworks and ILM all use maya and it is truly a pleasure to work with.
<br/>
<br/>
I find 3D studio Max to be annoying, buggy and unreliable when working on large projects. However that is my opinion and many 3D artists use 3D Max and swear by it.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't use Lightwave. I started to learn it after Maya and simply thought Maya was easier.
<br/>
<br/>
Other suggestions include Cinema4D or Hashs Animation Master.
<br/>
<br/>
Most developers of expensive 3D applications will provide a demo which has all the important features and documentation included, only the renders have a watermark. Just look in the downloads section of the companies' websites and you should find the demos.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway in my opinion learn the best and then if you want try the rest.
<br/>
You probably won't bother after learning Maya though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

PIXAR uses Renderman, which if I am not mistaken was there long before Maya. For a while there was a freeware renderman-complient program called Blue Moon Rendering Tool, but due to a lot of legal hassle this has been discontinued.<br/>_________________<br/>OogyBoogy</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yes, of course they do, but Sketchup's entire interface is built around this concept, and its sketching tools are extremely "smart" in how they work. You can sketch onto other 3d shapes then extrude or warp the bits you've just created in realtime and with ease. It's really hard to describe, but once you've used it for a drawing or two, it's great.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're looking to build a career in the 3D games world, then Sketchup would be a terrible choice, I think, since nobody in that industry uses it (AFAIK). But if you're a weekend modeller like me, Sketchup is awesome.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
