This is why I was looking for something to generate them.

<br/>
A "scalable font" is a computer program, in formats such as .ttf, whose input is a reference to a glyph and a point size and whose output is some raster representation of the glyph's shape. Specifically, 8x8s.png != "scalable font". Why do you think so many 1990s arcade games used a font identical to that of <span style="font-style: italic">Donkey Kong</span>?

Generate them from what source data? Mouse clicks? If so, just use GIMP or 8TED.

You meant "copyrighted", right? Under U.S. law,* these fonts by themselves do not constitute a substantial original portion of the works from which they were copied. Besides, as I said, the "who's cuter" and "mbmenu" blocks are my own original work.

<br/>
There are tons of free TTF fonts on the web. If you post what font you need to the "help wanted" section, there's probably a GIMP or Photoshop artist out there who will generate a strip for you in a couple of minutes. 
<br/>
<br/>
But like Mike said, it's really not hard to make one yourself. Or, write a tool that does what you need and post it to the community for all to use.
