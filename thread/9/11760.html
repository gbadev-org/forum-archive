    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was trying to understand the process of converting images (especially 256 color bitmaps) and i thought i could start on replacing actual pictures located in the NDS Examples tutorial available with devkitpro...
<br/>
<br/>
to be more detailed it is the BG_ROTATION demo available in your default folder at "C:\devkitPro\Projects\Tryouts\nds\Graphics\2D\BG_Rotation" and i am trying to re-compile it after i have replaced the images ".bin"s and palettes with my own picture but it ends up similarly fuzzy to these pictures:-
<br/>
<br/>
This is another person's pictures but they are the same thing that happen to me.... (YES I DO REALISE THAT's GBA, not Nds but that's not the point)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GUI: Usenti version 1.7.6
<br/>
Original picture file: drunkenlogo.bmp (which is any picture i renamed to be used in this case), 24 color Bitmap.
<br/>
<br/>
Options as shown below (pretty much the default options):-
<br/>
<br/>
pal (checked) - start=0, num=256
<br/>
image (checked) - tiles(checked), bpp=8,cprs=none
<br/>
Map(unchecked)
<br/>
Tile Group - sqr,1,cstm(unchecked)
<br/>
Area - as img (checked)
<br/>
File - ...\Desktop\drunkenlogo.bin, type=Binary(*.bin), h file(checked), u16
<br/>
<br/>
So these options are displayed before i export them:-
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">pal: 0-256 [256]
<br/>
img: tile, 8bpp, cprs: none
<br/>
area: (0,0)-(308,276)   [308, 276]
<br/>
meta: 1x1 tiles (8x8 px)
<br/>
map: -
<br/>
files:  drunkenlogo.h   drunkenlogo.gbfs </span>
<br/>
<br/>
even though the actual files exported (as i have seen) are
<br/>
drunkenlogo.h, drunkenlogo.img.bin, drunkenlogo.pal.bin
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">and i rename the last 2 of these three files to fit the example in the "data" folder before i "make". i.e. to the names</span>
<br/>
drunkenlogo.bin &amp; palette.bin
<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry i do not have a webspace to show the options on a picture but i will arrange one soon, appreciating your help <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">tepples</span></span> :)<br/>_________________<br/>"To be or not to be, --that is the question:--

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The BG_Rotation example uses a bitmap, not a tilemap, so switch the image-mode to bitmap. Also, 308x276 doesn't fit the DS screen; you need to resize the image beforehand, export only a portion of the image, or take care of the discrepancy on the NDS side of things.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
