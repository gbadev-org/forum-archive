    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi ^^
<br/>
<br/>
I have some questions about the future and the features ^^ of this great map editor for GBA ^^
<br/>
<br/>
As me and my teamates make an old school RPG, we essentially use 16 colors BG, so this editor is almost perfect for this task.
<br/>
<br/>
almost, because I encoutered some points that made this task a little bit more complex than thought.
<br/>
<br/>
The fact is that we use 2 (sometimes 3 layers (BGs)) so we create our maps in an unique mapEd map file.
<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes we need to add another layer not linked to the map, for instance the dialogbox.
<br/>
Dialogbox that we created with mapEd too. 
<br/>
<br/>
But this layer is isolated from the other maps we can create, so when exporting it to header, it use palettes from palette 0.
<br/>
<br/>
And if we want to display it on a screen that have other maps yet, and thus other palettes loaded, we need to programmatically adjust map info for this dialog box BG (updating palette number in bits 12-15).
<br/>
<br/>
So I wanted to know if there's a way to tell the editor an offset to palettes so the exported map header would be ok, and the palette too.
<br/>
<br/>
If no, is it possible to have it in a next version of mapEd?
<br/>
<br/>
Finally I notice another thing.
<br/>
Always with this dialogbox which only uses 16 colors.
<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that the original tileset use a 256 colors palette, but each tile is 16 color (the validateTileset tool say Yeah! ^^).
<br/>
<br/>
I create the map with mapEd, and when I export it, the palette contains 2 rows :
<br/>
<br/>
- the first row of the initial palette of the tileset
<br/>
- the row of the palette used by dialogbox map
<br/>
<br/>
So, is this a bug?
<br/>
Is there a way not to have it ?
<br/>
<br/>
Hope I haven't been too "heavy" in my explanation. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks ^^<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I apologize for the lack of mapEd updates as of late.  
<br/>
<br/>
I had been busy for a while and didn't have much chance to get around to making fixes...or more accurately, I had made fixes, but because we needed some very specific features for a demo I was doing and it was fastest to hardcode the features in, all of a sudden I was in a position where I couldn't release new versions of mapEd unless I had everyone sign an NDA. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Specifically regarding your questions, yeah, I discovered that we needed to do a similar thing to your dialog box.  We wanted a cloud backdrop that was basically constant across many levels.  We could have put the same clouds in each of the maps, but we would have been exporting kind of a lot of redundant data.
<br/>
<br/>
Because I had the source code, I just hacked the palette offsets, etc.  In a future update, it would be easy to provide an offset for both palettes and tiles.  
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding just the tile end of it, one easy way to handle that is to set the character base block (bits 2-3 in BGxCNT) and upload the array of tiles to the required block (naturally, make sure they don't overlap!) 
<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what you mean about the last question though.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: darkblue">Anyway, if anyone is interested in helping support the mapEd code or test newer versions prior to a release, that would be hugely helpful.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: red">Edit</span>  Doh, I know what you mean about the palette thing now.  Yes, I think I fixed this issue a while back.  Getting a new version of mapEd out will be dependant on getting it bug-tested etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
