    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">BG is "background." There are two main types of background: tiled backgrounds and bitmapped backgrounds. Yes, bitmapped backgrounds can have a front buffer and a back buffer, and whichever page you're not displaying (page 1 initially) is a back buffer.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

-- You know, the human.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A Bg a background in modes 0-2. A background is a plane where tiles are placed to be displayed.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't get confused with a buffer which is in modes 3-5. A buffer is just an area of memory that represents the screen itself.
<br/>
<br/>
This might make more sense once you do a couple of tutorials.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">dagamer34, if you're going to post information that contradicts tepples, perhaps you should qualify yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, it is generally agreed that a background is a background, whether it is made of tiles or not -- and a "buffer" can be any intermediate data area, whether it is for a display or not.
<br/>
<br/>
It may only be a matter of semantics, but it's best to avoid causing confusion.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
