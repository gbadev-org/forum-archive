    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a general approach to make the colors I see when working on my pc appear nearly the same on the GBA screen?
<br/>
<br/>
What I mean is that the GBA screen is much less saturated and also darker than a pc screen.
<br/>
In other games when seeing through an emulator often the colors seem over saturated on the pc but look good on the gba.
<br/>
<br/>
HEPP Now one of my programmers just told me about a photoshop plugin from warioworld that might do the trick, ill tell you if it works...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

AGB LCD Color Emulation for Photoshop

What is it?:
<br/>
These files are an attempt to approximate the chromaticity settings 
<br/>
of the AGB LCD within Adobe Photoshop;  in essence, to make the colors 
<br/>
you're drawing with and using on your monitor as much like the screen 
<br/>
on a Game Boy Advance as possible.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Youll need to be an authorized developer to get it though:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The gamma of a display system calibrated to sRGB is 2.2. The gamma of a GBA or GBA SP LCD is closer to 3 or 4 depending on the lighting angle. However, 2.2 will best represent what a game will look like on a GameCube or a DS, whose display characteristics are much closer to sRGB.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Brightness?
<br/>
And do I understand you right, Ill need to bump up the gamma by 3-4 (times? percent?) to make the graphics look good on the GBA screen?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well the photoshop plugin didnt work, all it does is emulate the way the graphics would look on a gba screen so its useless.
<br/>
I found a gamma setting in image ready (but not in photoshop odd enough).
<br/>
Bumping up the gamma does not help, i dont think the relation is that simple, the result was not good.
<br/>
However i found that adjusting curves for each r g b channel works good but i havnt found a perfect solution yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Ill share the results when i succeed, but if anyone knows of a good way ill be glad to hear it so i dont have to go through a tiresome trial and error process.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Since the sRGB gamma is around 2.2 (as Tepples said), my guess would be to divide the two (3-4.. I'd say 3.4 :)), which results in 1.54545454..., or rounded to 1.55 times the current gamma.
<br/>
<br/>
Use PhotoShop's gamma adjustment AFTER you have modified your graphics to the way you like on your computer, and be sure to back up your origional, "PC version."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've found the following steps have produced good results for me (in Photoshop):
<br/>
<br/>
1. flatten you image
<br/>
2. Go to Image &gt; Adjust &gt; Levels (CTRL+L)
<br/>
3. The input levels start at 0, 1.00, 255... Change to 0,1.5,235
<br/>
<br/>
This isn't a scientific approach. I just monkied with the levels until I got something that I'm fairly happy with.
<br/>
<br/>
Another tip: If you're using a shared palette across all of your images, it's a snap to build your whole game in "PC" gamma, then just swap out your *palette* to correct for color rather than rebuilding every image. Then you don't have to maintain two versions of everything.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also a big fan of the "Save for Web" feature, since you can maintain all of your photoshop layers and dump out a long list of Slices at any time. (.GIF has become my output format of choice for this reason.) It's a lot easier to work with one photoshop file that contains all of your gfx than dozens of individual files.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That looks pretty close cheers!
<br/>
<br/>
My coders are doing this directly on the gba now though so i dont have to change anything.. 
<br/>
I dont think its as easy as just making things brighter and darker though, some colors have to be brighter than others etc..
<br/>
<br/>
Ill see if i can get them to post the code for it, its not perfect yet but its very very close..
<br/>
<br/>
edit thanks for the tips by the way! heres one-
<br/>
If i want to animate something with alot of colors i first animate a mask in Pro Motion and then import the frames to Photoshop and color them there. Works brilliantly for special effects, i did a water explosion that way and it looks incredible.
<br/>
Masks is great for tiles as well when making several backgrounds with transparant borders - make the mask first and then color away and youll get brilliant results.
<br/>
Im not a big fan of the pixelated look if its not really good, the way i see it, theres the technology to make things look better today so why not use it. The game im making now looks more like an animated film than a game because of these methods..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
