    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm a complete newbie at GBA programming, so you have to excuse my inexperience. When I try to display a sprite, it looks like the graphics on the NES when the game is messed up and you have to blow in it and put it back in the system. Its just all really messed up. I tried using different graphics conversion tools, and a whole ton of diff. dimensions and formats for the actual graphics file. Anyone have any idea what could be wrong?<br/>_________________<br/>-=Playing God=-</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
The possibilities are (one or more of the following) :-
<br/>
<br/>
1. Your graphics file is broke. what type is it? can you upload it somewhere?
<br/>
<br/>
2. Your code has an error in it. post it here, so somebody can take a look at it for you (maybe not because you tried tutorial samples but worth a try).
<br/>
<br/>
3. The sprite isn't being converted into a .h file properly.
<br/>
post the code for the .h file here. 
<br/>
<br/>
4. You don't have a computer and you are trying to compile it in the blender in your kitchen. ( only joking! :) ).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, wish you the best of luck.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
