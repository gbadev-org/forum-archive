    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So you want to put an opening movie into your game.
<br/>
<br/>
Are you talking about the movies they had on Super NES games?  Those are easy.  Write some code that can move the backgrounds and sprites and change the palettes and tiles based on a script.
<br/>
<br/>
Or are you talking about the fmv movies they had on PlayStation games? Those are a bit harder to pull off on the GBA.  You'll probably need to license a commercial codec for those.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

We can see also others tipe of movies especially in RPG games when the player walk without i move it and appear the scenes with texts or mountains crashs!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most intro "movies" are just scripted animated sprites and backgrounds.
<br/>
Sprite animation is very easy.
<br/>
<br/>
A full screen resolution "movie" is also very easy (just use a bitmap mode and uncompressed graphics), the hard part is to fit in into a GBA cart.
<br/>
You'll get a few seconds of movie from a standard sized cart, if uncompressed... :-)
<br/>
<br/>
There are some built BIOS decompression routines... you might be able to use thoose to extend the movie to about ten seconds... :)
<br/>
<br/>
For more than that you'll need a full featured video codec.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To achieve all those effect, they're using mode 0,1,2. Those mode allow to you to use 4 layers on top of each others. Those 4 layer can be moved independantly of each other, making it easy to create some effects. So the rear most layer could be clouds moving slowly, then in front, some forest, moving at a slow pace, based on the character walking, then in front of that, some others object, like fence, houses, .... And top layer coudl be a logo, with the dialog text, or whatever. Finally, you'd just use some sprites for the characters moving around.
<br/>
<br/>
The limit of this method is that you need to use Tiles(8x8squares) combined with a Map(tell which square to use where on the screen). Using this you can easily display a screen size of 256x256, 256x512, 512x256, 512x512 pixels (of course, only 240x160 is visible at anytime, you need to scroll to see the rest) but only ~900Tiles(in 256colors) or ~1800Tiles(in 16 colors) can be displayed at once (you can change them at any time though). So this could cover about 57600 square pixels, or a 240x240pixels areas that you have to share between 4 layers of 256x256 surface. The trick is to re-use the same tiles at many places.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Perfect you are been very exhaustive, i thanx u! :)
<br/>
Now i would ask you same suggestions about a graphic program to use to make the bitmap, or sprite and so on...
<br/>
i used Gimp, Photoshop but the first is bad, really, the second one when i export the image in pcx format i get an error when compile the bin file (usually i make graphics with Firework save it in gif 256 color and open it with photoshop, finally export the image in pcx file...)
<br/>
I would a Graphic Program that support the exportation of all the format and all th colour...
<br/>
Firework permit the only 256 color image at gif, no for Bmp or Tiff or Png!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just posted in the other thread about this same issue. There used to be a free, but watermarked codec available, but the company went out of buisness I believe. The file sizes from that arent too bad at all, video is a bit pixely (10-12fps) but you can have sound as well.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a sample - it looks way better on hardware then emu though

Keep note, such high quality that is it 7.3mb, and the normal gba cartridge is only 8.0mb .. just noting for link that these kinds of things cant be used very long in his game.
