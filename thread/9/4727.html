    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A simple tile editor would work for uncompressed games, but many GBA games' sprite cels are compressed. If the game doesn't have strong anti-emulation protection, or you can patch around it, try running the game in VisualBoyAdvance for Windows and keeping the Tile Viewer focused on 0x06010000.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wrote a gba program ages ago called GFX Hunt which is supposed to be for ripping graphics from a GBA game in Visualboy Advance.
<br/>
<br/>
It works likes this:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Copy and rename the game to ROM.gba in same directory
<br/>
2. Run mk.bat, it will compile attaching gbahunt.bin to the start of ROM.gba to create gbahunt.gba
<br/>
3. Run gbahunt.gba in Visualboy Advance
<br/>
<br/>
Use up/down/left/right to scroll through graphics memory
<br/>
Use Select to change view mode to text (shows memory address/mode/decompression routine)
<br/>
Use A/B to change graphics mode 0/3
<br/>
Use Left/Right to change BIOS Decompression routine
<br/>
<br/>
Compiled using DevkitAdv
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, it works in theory, but in practice it dosn't seem to work very well. Perhaps you can make it work better, or find a way to make it work.
