    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I've been programming a game which involves several sub-games, which I've been working on seperately, and now I am trying to put them all together. 
<br/>
However the sprites used were drawn at different times and have come from various sources thus the palette output from pcx-sprite are all different.
<br/>
Can anyone tell me a simple procedure to stardardise all the palettes accross all my sprites, using photoshop 6?
<br/>
If nothing this has taught me to plan from the beggining in future! 
<br/>
Thank you for your time and help

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why can't you just load a new palette for every sub-game?
<br/>
If you really need 1 general palette, then pas all of your sprite in 1 picture, and generate the palette from it. Afterward, use that palette with your other picture, when convertinh them to 256colors and then sprites/tiles.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was thinking about loading up a new palette every time but the main problem was that the text palette was completely different from all the other sprites and I only found that out later when I added text to the levels.
<br/>
Also I thought it'd be more effecient overall to just load the palette once, though maybe I should look into 16 colour sprites....
<br/>
thanks for the help anyways.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A thing you could do would be to only use the 240 colors palette for your regular sub-gamess. So you use it in 256colors mode, but only load the 240first colors. You store in the last 16colors, your text palette using the 16colors mode to access it. That way, you keep all of your mini-games color scheme, while also having a constant palette.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks alot!
<br/>
Have tried both ways now,
<br/>
one version with just one big picture, and one huge array for all the sprites.
<br/>
and another version just using the first 240 colours.
<br/>
Performance wise not much difference between the two but the first way involves alot more thinking about where in the array the sprites are and where they should be loaded to.
<br/>
cheers once more.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You also get more adapted colors with the second method, seing that you can change the palette for every sub-game. Migth not be needed, but at least you know it's there. You can store 1/2 less sprites tile in 256colors though(compared to 16colors).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Then I tried Mappy with Fmp2Gba but the output is different and there are no good examples on how to use it.
