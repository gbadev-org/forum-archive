    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Your Map editor is excellent!!!   Thanks!!! 
<br/>
<br/>
just a couple of quick questions though...
<br/>
<br/>
1. How do I navigate around the tile area (it doesn't appear to have scrollbars or a photoshop-type navigation view)?
<br/>
<br/>
2. Is it possible to cut&amp;paste more than 128 tiles?
<br/>
<br/>
3. How does the 'IMPORT LAYER FROM -bmp' feature work? 
<br/>
(it appears to be greyed out)
<br/>
<br/>
Once again - thanks for a brilliant graphics tool.
<br/>
(I can't wait till sept 10th for the next release!!)<br/>_________________<br/>---------------------------------------------------

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1)  The Tile View window was one of the first things that I did, so no, there is no way to scroll around it.  It's actually something that has annoyed me a bit, usually I just use smaller tilesets, like 128x64 and/or zoom out to either 2x or 3x.  So, yes, this is something I will try to fix for the next release if it doesn't take too long.  Otherwise it'll have to wait until the release after that.
<br/>
<br/>
2)  Hmmm, the un-lite (full) version allows a much larger selection.  I'll double the number for the next release, but in the meantime, one thing that might help (depending on what you are trying to do) is press 'T' to trim out the transparent tiles.  If you have a lot of transparent tiles in the selection, that will make the selection smaller, meaning you can then add additional items.   Sort of lame for now, but...
<br/>
<br/>
3) Any feature that is greyed out is either unavailable in the un-lite version or has not been done yet.  In the case of the import layer from, that will be available in the lite version, possibly the next release or definetly by the one after that.

<span style="color: blue"><span style="font-weight: bold">Edit:</span> Well, I was a bit bored this morning so I've made the changes I described in 2 &amp; 3, above.  While I was in there, I added Clone Layer, and Layer V/H Flipping since they were easy and I needed those features the other day and they weren't done yet!  Uploaded a new build and updated helpDoc to the mapEd site.</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
