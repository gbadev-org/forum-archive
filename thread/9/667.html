Download some of his sample bg demos to learn how to use the files the map editor generates.  
<br/>
<br/>
His map editor is nice because you can work on multiple layers at the same time, and view them with transparency, then export all the layers into a .H and .C file.<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind".

Has the map editor and tools to rip out maps - although you would have to modify the tool to process your own maps.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, ok, enough now, heh.  It's still a work in progress so it's not perfect yet. 
<br/>
<br/>
You do mean 1024x1024 <span style="font-style: italic">pixels</span>, right?  If not, mapEd0.95 Lite only supports 256x256 tile maps or less.  
<br/>
<br/>
So...the whole Lite version thing isn't really doing anyone any good, so I'm releasing v0.96 later today which will be a non-Lite version.  It'll have basic undo support and some other new features including the much-talked-about-but-as-of-yet-not-heavily-tested-export-customization (I'd very much appreciate anyone that can help me test it...please,please), various fixes, etc...
<br/>
<br/>
...and I can easily remove the map size restrictions to have support for anything up to a 1024x1024 layer.
<br/>
<br/>
[edit]  And one other thing mapEd only supports 16 colour tile mode and if I recall rotate-scale BG's can only work in 256 colour mode?  256 colour mode support is fairly low on my list of things to do.[/edit]
<br/>
