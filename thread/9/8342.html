    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have few graphical glitches in my game that I thought WaitForVBlank was granting me to be ok. I copy vertical columns of tiles to handle my huge maps scrolling and once in a while, there seems to be some garbage (looks like 1 tile not refreshed in an exiting [left of the screen] column)

I don't see this behavior on my GBA SP, but  just in VisualBoy Advance. I tried to comment out the WaitForVBlank and I've been surprised to see that it did no change at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
