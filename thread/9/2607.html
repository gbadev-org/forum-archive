    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most commercial games that have any 3D element to them use the Mode 7 hardware technique as mentioned above to create the illusion of perspective. This does not mean that the GBA is limited to Mode 7 for 3D, though. People have written everything from raycasters to voxel-engines to full-fledged 3D engines for the GBA. I'm not aware of any full-3D engines that are fast enough on the GBA's hardware to be truly fluid, though.
<br/>
<br/>
As for how games that are available are rendered, that depends on the game, now, doesn't it? :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tony Hawk does some Polygon work for the sprites (if I remember correctly.)  I've helped with some 3D demos as well in 8-bit color mode that got decent frame rate with flat, Gourand, and textured polys (in the 1000s range on screen at 30Hz or so with sound and engine underneath)
<br/>
<br/>
So you can software render stuff, it just takes forever and alot of GBA know how to get it fast enough.
