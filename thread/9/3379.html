    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can anyone recommend a good utility for Windows/DOS that converts images to binary-files (tileformat). I've tried a dozen from this website but found none that did what I wanted or if it did, it didn't do it correctly. Have I missed something here? I'd really like a universal gba gfx converter tool but perhaps there is none? :)

Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
