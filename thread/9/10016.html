    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone here would know a program that allows to convert any image into many 32*32 pixel images?
<br/>
<br/>
I am asking this because it is really hard to make backgrounds tile by tile, and it would help alot more if that kind of program existed :)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway thanks for your help.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw if you are interested here are the graphics to the game so far (don't worry about the cell phone size they are just mock ups)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi - Do you still need this doing? If so is there a specific file format you want as an output? Would a 24bit bitmap be ok? If so I don't mind knocking something together quickly for you ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's exactly a program like the one you want by a user named Windy from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.zfgc.com" target="_blank">ZFGC</a>.  As he no longer has links in his signature, I've uploaded the tool for him.  It's called TileSet Optimizer 2.1 and it can do a number of things to tilesets, though I'll just give you instructions for splitting/unsplitting a tileset.
<br/>
<br/>
First download it from <a href="http://danthemanms.googlepages.com/TileSet_Optimizer2.1.zip" target="_blank">http://danthemanms.googlepages.com/TileSet_Optimizer2.1.zip</a> and extract it, launching the program.  Enter the Options page and set the following values:  width 32, height 32, input border 0, output border 1 (or whatever you want).  Change the background color to the color you want the lines to be (hot pink is usually used).  Then check the box for "already optimized" or else it will remove duplicate tiles by default.  Exit the Options, load the image (must be BMP or PNG), and click Commands - Process.
<br/>
<br/>
The other features of the software can be found in the Readme file.
<br/>
<br/>
Prior to releasing this, he also made a separate program that does nothing but splitting (no optimization tools included) called TileSplit.  It might be easier to use if all you want is simple splitting and unsplitting, though it only accepts bitmap files, not PNG or GIF or anything.  I've uploaded it to <a href="http://danthemanms.googlepages.com/Tile_Split.zip" target="_blank">http://danthemanms.googlepages.com/Tile_Split.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
There are two versions in there, one of which does not require some OCX file I think, but in that version you must type in the path of your image file manually rather than browsing to it through a dialog box.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
