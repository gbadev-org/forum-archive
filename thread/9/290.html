    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Of course :)   just don't draw to any of the other pixels :)  You can't limit the hardware to only draw the 4x4 but if there are no pixels set (anything other than 0) then it will do what you want.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Umm... clear out the other areas?  The hardware doesn't really support 4x4 tiles... It depends on how you want to use it.  If you'll need 4x4 tiles next to other 4x4 tiles you could write some front-end to do the copying/moving/arranging of 4x4 tiles on the 8x8 tiles.  If you just need some random 4x4's floating around, might want to just use an 8x8 tile and leave the other area as color 0.
