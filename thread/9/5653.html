    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just downloaded a copy of TileMax 1.6 and I want to make my own exporter and importer plugins.  Unfortunately, the author's website seems to be down, at least on my side, and I can't get the file anywhere else on the web.  If anyone has a copy of tmxmodel.jar please upload it here or e-mail it to me at <a href="mailto:jarobi_genius@hotmail.com">jarobi_genius@hotmail.com</a>.  Or if you know where the file is on the web (any location that isn't inaccessible), please post the link in this thread.  Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
