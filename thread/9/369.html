    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Link, Palettes are fundamental to many graphics systems. PC's *TV's Gameboys, Aple Macs all have some sort of palette support, if you look on the web you will see how to use them and what they are for. 
<br/>
<br/>
On the Gameboy you only need to set up a palette if you use mode 4. I think that is the only screen mode you need to set up a pallete for. The other modes you write to the screen RGB values, or Tile indices.
<br/>
<br/>
Palettes were probably originaly invented becuase memory was expensive, and a palettized sceen buffer reduced cost. We still have palettes today probably for a similar reason. You can do a few neat tricks with palettes too like palette animation, and Alpha blending by palette reduction(but you won't want to do that on the gba, it's got some sort of alpha blending).
<br/>
<br/>
* - High end TV's perhaps not the older ones. For example the Viper chip from Phillips has two cores, one MIPS and one Trimedia. The Trimedia core supports the notion of palletes, which can be used for drawing subtiles mainly, since they send palettes as part of the digital transport stream.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most PC graphics hardware (nowadays) is running at (at least) 16 bpp, which is NOT a palette mode. I can't speak for macs.
<br/>
<br/>
As for TVs... I know that all analog television standards (NTSC, PAL) are NOT palette based. I suppose that some digital television protocols/interfaces (Which, by the way, I know nothing about) COULD be palette based, but with the number of colors that need to be availible, a palette would become extremely unwieldy, and would contradict the concept of stream. (If it was palette based, you would need to send a palette for every single frame.) Besides that, I know that many digital video (film quality) standards, such as DVD and DiVX, use 24 bpp (RGB, not palette)...
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the TV could be communicating to itself in 8bpp palette based... In which case, I'm gonna wait a lot longer to get a digital TV.
<br/>
<br/>
[Long rant to get a single point out...]
<br/>
<br/>
Palette based systems are very memory efficient, but only in low (graphics) quality situations, which simply means that palettes are on their way out. As the demand for quality goes through the roof, palettes (and VRAM restrictions) go in the trash. (For instance, no self-respecting 3D engine uses textures under 24 bpp. Even if the target (render) image quality is lower, the higher quality texture map leads to better final images.)<br/>_________________<br/>Moron!

Well they don't use palette neither RGB, it's called YPbPr/YCbCr and is Luminance(Light) &amp; difference for Red &amp; Blue. and often you have the Red &amp; Blue in a much lower resolution then the Luminance, eg 4:2:2 or 4:1:1.<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#3216 - mantrid - Thu Feb 20, 2003 11:32 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe I made this thread go off topic :-|. Yes, you get the luminance and chrominace in video, subtitles and other stuff - but that's not really important is it. Anyway in this TV the video buffer is RGB and the palette is RGB encoded too. The subtitle palettes are luminance and colour difference encoded so we have to convert them to RGB. 
<br/>
<br/>
The subtitling in a digital tv broacasts uses palettes because it:
<br/>
saves memory
<br/>
it saves bandwith
<br/>
it reduces processing time
<br/>
<br/>
So there is quite a good reason to have a palette. I think it all comes down to hardware cost(and perhaps the state of the art)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So my point is you still see a lot of palette type things going on in real world applications today.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll should stop now. I made the thread drift off topic. Sorry.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Example:
<br/>
<br/>
Question: Do i need palettes!
<br/>
<br/>
Answer:
<br/>
Only 1 mode does not use palettes (mode3). This means that only 20% off all the modes actualy is useable to that "request".
<br/>
Now let's see what mode 3 can do:
<br/>
Plot a 32bit colored pixel.
<br/>
No double buffering
<br/>
Not too fast.
<br/>
<br/>
Is that enough?
<br/>
<br/>
If (youranswer=="yes")
<br/>
{
<br/>
SET_MODE(MODE_3|BG2_ENABLE);
<br/>
}
<br/>
else
<br/>
{

Uhh, I thought that MPEG2 only supported RGB. As a matter of fact, I woulda sworn it. The magical VOB files (that you find on a DVD) are really just simple wrappers which are capeable of stream encoding + padding the data for random access.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, whats so 'sucky' about RGB? It is very simple on all sides, and can achive infinite colors just by increasing the (analog) bandwidth, and (digital) bits per pixel.
<br/>
<br/>
The only reason why RGB doesn't look better (IMHO) is because we are still stuck on old analog formats (NTSC (or PAL)) except for these wierd formats where they break out the signal differantly. I prepose a simple standard that is basically a high-speed, serial (maybe optical?), interface which would make several improvements on NTSC or other analog counter-parts. (BPP, Pixels-per-scanline, scanlines-per-frame, and maybe even more FPS.)
<br/>
<br/>
This wouldn't really be useful for broadcast, cable or satelite or whatever, but it would be good to communicate between PCs and monitors, and it would be good to communicate between DVD players and TVs, and it just might turn out to be the standard that theatres use for displaying digital movies. (Have you ever sat through a digital video stream at a theatre? the resolution is AWFUL!)

I was refering to the gfxcards not RGB, old (sucky) cards doesn't have YPbPr overlay support, this saves bandwith to the GFX card and CPU, the signal to your monitor is still RGB.
<br/>
You mean that mpeg2 is uncompressed or ?
<br/>
Have you made backups of your DVD movies? Then you probably have seen that it saves the images in some format like TGA or BMP, and then you say that it's RGB in the VOB file right?
<br/>
Not so, as there are few supported file formats which support some kind of YPbPr, so the ripping program have to convert the images before saving. New versions of videoediting programs can uncompress-&gt;compress without going via RGB.

Yes I agree that both PAL &amp; NTSC are bad.

As for AVIs, AVI doesn't mean uncompressed. AVI is a simple file format which allows two paralell data streams to exist in the same file.
