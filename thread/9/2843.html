    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tile and map data in modes 0, 1, and 2 cover VRAM addresses from 0 KB to 64 KB. In bitmap mode 4 or 5, the two pages cover from 0 KB to 40 KB and from 40 KB to 80 KB. You can go from a tile mode to bitmap mode 4 or 5 and back and preserve tile and map data that lies within 0 KB to 40 KB as long as you write only to the bitmap mode's second page.
<br/>
<br/>
No, you can't meaningfully go from a tile mode to mode 3 and back without data loss because mode 3 has one page that covers 0 KB to 80 KB.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
