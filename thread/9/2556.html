    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it possible to somehow have walls that don't occupy floor tile space (ie. so they would fit between floor tiles without there being a gap between them)?  I'm using an isometric engine, so I mean as far as tilemaps go.  The art of the walls will obviously occupy tile-space on the screen, or else you wouldn't be able to see them.  I've been trying to figure out how I would do this without resorting to using sprites (the cost would be too great).  Combining tile and floor art for the edges around a room wouldn't work either, because the player needs to be able to walk on the tiles, but not through walls (the additional art would also take up too much tile space).
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, but after much thinking about this problem, I may have a solution.  My tiles are ~22.5 degrees isometric (as opposed to the typical 45 degrees isometric), so it may not work.  But anyways, my 32x16 floor tiles take up eight 8x8-pixel tiles... I could stick two half-tiles together, and plant a wall tile right over the seams.  That would require 2 backgrounds I think, but I'm already using 2 backgrounds in order for the isometric tiles to align properly, and I'm not sure I could use one of those for the walls or not.  Dang, this is so confusing.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have any ideas, please let me know.  Thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, you could always stop using 2 bg layers just to get them to line up.  You can draw 16x8 tiles that will line up naturally on a tilemap.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
