    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there such a program that runs on the PC that allows for maps to be built for FPS on GBA? - if there isn`t there`s sure room for one. Imagine a simply editor that allows for 3D maps to be built from standard sized squares (2 poly`s) so that floors, walls and ceilings could be built. Then a standard size texture could be snapped onto these wall/floor/ceiling surfaces, thus a full world/area could be created :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Cool. Thanks. I think "MOH Underground" was written very quickly. The texture mapping is awful but the maps are nice. It has some strange stretching effect that I've never seen before. Textures seem to grow larger than the polygon. Warping is a problem with DDA texture mapping, but this is warping to the extreme!
<br/>
<br/>
A standard PS1 style tmapper would of made the game a little nicer to play. It looks like they had overflow issues. Maybe from a 16:16 tmapper.
<br/>
<br/>
But, GBA 3D engines have come a long way since then. DOOM II &amp; DukeNukem Advance use an amazing 2.5D engine. 
<br/>
Made in Australia of course :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, look at ashen comming out on ngage! I have a feeling its the same guy behind the above GBA engines. Im a little jealous. Grrr.
<br/>
<br/>
In case people dont know. There are 2 MOH games. MOH Infiltrator is a very nice overhead 2D war shooter and is unrelated to MOH Underground.

oooo, dont do that. Its GPL. Feel free to release under the terms of the GPL license. Dont keep it private. Any goofie demos would be cool. ie: 
<br/>
<br/>
1) How about slicing a sky box up into 64x64 textures and releasing a skybox renderer.
<br/>
2) A 3D version of Snake would be easy.

Jealous of the guy behing the above GBA engines, or jealous of the N-gage?

Try trading in all of the hardware-accelerated 2D stuff for more than 6 times the processor speed.
<br/>
<br/>
So, no fancy 2D backgrounds or sprites with rotation/scaling features, but lots more cycles in which to do the geometric computations required by 3D.

its much more controlable on the gba because the N-Gage controls sucks hard, and you have an ugly screenformat on the n-gage :)
<br/>
<br/>
N-Gage is a pice of expensive shit

this is just my opinion of this

Where ever I turn, I get this answer.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone who's actually like the N-gage? Has anyone tried it? Does anyone know what kind of hardware it's using? Does it have the same screen modes as the GBA (for easy game porting)?
<br/>
<br/>
And yea, I know about the ugly resolution.
<br/>
<br/>
I've also seen the ugly ads.
<br/>
<br/>
Still it's a game console, and I want to know why it isn't capable of competing with Gameboy Advance when it was released a few years after.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll guess there are no answers to my questions :P
<br/>
<br/>
I know that 3d games are the future and that GBA lack 3d hardware. So does N-gage have more support for 3d games than the GBA?
<br/>
<br/>
If not, then I guess 3d hardware is too expensive for a handheld console?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think the main reason 4 the N-Gage unable to compete is the high prize and the bad develper support of it. There are just not enogh games and the most are ports from other consoles some even from the gba (e.g. Super Monkey ball). Its even funny that N-Gage alway advertises wireless multiplayer but Super monkey ball has multiplayer onto the gba but not on the N-Gage.
<br/>
And i'm not the kind of person who just says something is shit because i don't like the company or such. I tryed the N-Gage on the Games Convention and i just didn't like it. I will give the PSP a chance too even if i don't like the PS2.

btw. i don't like to have my mobile phone and my mobile gaming plattform in one device. I'm intressted about how other people think about that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
