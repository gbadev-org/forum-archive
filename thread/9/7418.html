    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Like the subjects says, which tool do you use and do you find the most useful for creating your tile based worlds?
<br/>
<br/>
I currently use <a class="postlink" href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/downloads.htm" target="_blank">Mirach</a>

I like how it doesn't complain about using 4bit tiles and it's super easy to use.  I just wish it had a few levels of Undo.  It also exports in 32bit format which I guess is good for the DMAcopy command, but I don't know how to use that yet.  So I get to feel like a retard when I for-loop all the data in (horray for bit shifting)
<br/>
<br/>
In my dreams I think I would like an editor that could export each u16 map data in the actual DS/GBA format for tiles (Pal_ID/Vflip/Hflip/Tile_ID).  And I'll take a diamond yacht and reasonably priced gasoline too.<br/>_________________<br/>Codax

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not claiming it's the best, but I use Mappy (not the emulator, the map editor (yes, it's confusing)) for laying out the tiles.  Then I use a heavily customized version of Dave Etherton's fmp2gba to export the data.  I also have my own textfile based map configuration file format to detail all the other map data (how the maps fit together, enemies, items, doors, etc).
<br/>
<br/>
My makefile and an associated perl script take care of exporting the map data, combining it with my textfile data, and generating one C file per level.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
