    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi ^^
<br/>
<br/>
I notice there're some bugs in the last two versions of this emulator: 1.6a and 1.7.X.
<br/>
<br/>
These are the following :
<br/>
<br/>
- 1.6a exports right the palettes in different formats (Windows, PSP, or ACT) BUT the BMP exported (from map viewer) are wrong &gt; any graphics tools didn't recognize the format...
<br/>
<br/>
- 1.7.x exports right BMP files but the palette is always 'bg.pal' even if I choose PSP format or ACT format, or change the filename.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I wanted to contact the author to report this but the official site displays "NO EMAIL AVAILABLE", and I didn't find any board...even on the sourceforge project site.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know how I can transmit these info to the VBA's author?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks ^^<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To report differences in behavior between the hardware and an emulator to the maintainer of an emulator hosted on SourceForge.net, do the following:<ul><li>Create a SourceForge.net account.</li><li>Create a reproducible testcase, including instructions.</li><li>Log in to SourceForge.net.</li><li>Decide whether your issue is a <a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=63889&amp;atid=505529" target="_blank">bug</a> or a <a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=63889&amp;atid=505532" target="_blank">feature request</a>.</li><li>Post your issue report to the appropriate board.</li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
