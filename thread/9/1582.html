    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm looking to edit the graphics stored inside of a GBA rom. I know that in the past with older consoles, it was possible to decompile the rom, edit the graphics, and recompile the rom with the new graphics - basically I'm looking for a how-to on how to do this for the GBA.

Thanks for all the help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If the GFX are not compressed, locating them in the ROM is easy.  Find them in VRAM, and then search for that byte sequence in the ROM with your favorite hex editor.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I seen that post - but it only deals with extracting them - once they're extracted, I wouldn't know how to put them back in. I did read that topic before posting though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
