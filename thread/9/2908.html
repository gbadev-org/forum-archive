    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I did a search and all that came up was Flash Cartridges? But what I want to know is how I would go about converting flash animations to GBA tiles in the correct format. I know I can scale the images up and down to any size due to flash being vector based, but once I export do I have to draw over all my animations in 256 colors? Or can I use a utility to export them outright? Thanks in Advance!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Flash animation format is fundamentally different from the way the GBA operates. There is no direct way to convert from one to another. You would have to write a Flash player for the GBA, and that would be no simple task and probably would run very slowly on the GBA's processor.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">there may be a VERY long way to get your animations onto the gba.
<br/>
<br/>
swf to avi somehow
<br/>
avi to gif via Jasc Animation
<br/>
<br/>
now you have your basic indivdual frames to convert into GBA usual format.
<br/>
Write a program that will 'flick' through all the indivdual frames in order
<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind that although this is an idea it is not necessary a good one :P<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In case you're curious, you can get an SWF2AVI or an SWF2GIF program at the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.effectmatrix.com/" target="_blank">iTinySoft website</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm currently using Quicktime for Java to read frames from a Flash movie and convert them to bitmaps at the job&lt;tm&gt;. It works pretty well, but of course it isn't worth messing with unless you've already produced a ton of Flash animations you need to export.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">File &gt; Export Movie &gt; GIF Sequence works pretty well from flash, assuming your animations are strictly keyframed graphics and not ActionScripted. You can control the output size down to the pixel and Flash does an excellent job of scaling/color dithering.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have something more complex where you're trying to dump out ActionScripted animations or even nested movieclips, you may want to check out <a href="http://www.multidmedia.com/" target="_blank">http://www.multidmedia.com/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
They have a cool product called Flash Studio Pro that allows you to extend ActionScripting with all kinds of tasty FSCommands, including ExportToBMP, which you could then use to export each frame regardless of how the contents of that frame were generated.
