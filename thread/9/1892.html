IMHO is a very good editor, and I think the main strenght is the 'F' option, along with the clear code generation.
<br/>
A nice plus should be a .bin generator for testing the levels directly on the device/emulator. Code generation for this purpose should be even better.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't like the screen flashing when the editor gains the focus against other apps.
<br/>
<br/>
The features of this tool are perfect for a freeware product.
<br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion: don't make it commercial. The community will be grateful. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Bye.

hmm...I'm a happy user of the Nessie Editor (0.94 with collision layer is great!) and I don't know about what editor you told about in saying that.
<br/>
<br/>
Cause I told with the author/commercial of GBATools and the soft isn't freeware....and from so far !!!
