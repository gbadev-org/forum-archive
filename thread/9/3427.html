    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just wanted to let any and all artists that lurk around here I am making a website dedicated to all things game art related. It's hosted on the same server as gbadev.org, (thanks a heap Simon) so it should be nice and stable. Not much content there now of course, as it's in it's infancy. So give it a look and stop back once in awhile, I'd like to start building a community. See ya there!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice. This site is exactly what I was looking for! Hopefully you will move on towards making sprites, as they are one of the most difficult things to get right.

Good job and keep up the good work.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh, very good then sgeos. We will buy the offspring at $20.00 USD/lb. =]
<br/>
And yeah Dagamer, we will have a decent amount of sprite related material, as we all know sprite art is a demon in and of itself. There's some existing sprite related sites out there already, I will link to them and hopefully pull some of them in. Keep an eye out for future tutorials, as stuff like that will be the meat of game-art. Peace<br/>_________________<br/>#gameart on EFnet.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Damn hagglers. Well I suppose I'll have to look elsewhere for black market babies. However 20/hr isn't too bad for pro level artwork. I might know at least one person that might be willing to hire for something around there.<br/>_________________<br/>#gameart on EFnet.
