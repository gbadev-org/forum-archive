FAT16? Isn't that a little overkill for a ROM filesystem, where you can guarantee that every file will be contiguous? You could just use a simple archive system such as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/" target="_blank">TAR</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.nullsoft.com/free/ass/" target="_blank">ASS</a>, or my own <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#gbfs" target="_blank">GBFS</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What would be _waaay_ more usefull as Photoshop plugin would be a palette handler with quantizer so you can arrange 16 color tiles and palettes. Seeing as photoshop can save linear binary by default I fail to see the reason to write a plugin for this. But like I said, a palette manager plugin would be helluva more usefull.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I hope it is ok that we want to use it ?!?!
<br/>
<br/>
However. How we make it with palettes?
<br/>
Hm im not sure. Currently it is planed to strip the gfx files to .p4 .p8 files for palettes and .g4 .g8 files for the data. then crompressed .c8 .c16 or just liniar true color data .g16
<br/>
<br/>
So u can handle the files however u want.
<br/>
The reason why i include this feature is that graphic workers in our team can work without the source code AND u have more control about the mass of files.<br/>_________________<br/>... but im just a <span style="text-decoration: underline">dummy</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">Newbie</span>

That'd be perfectly fine.  My GBA-side runtime library is under the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.jclark.com/xml/copying.txt" target="_blank">Expat License, a simple all-permissive license</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the PC-side tools are under the GNU General Public License.  I've decided to grant an exception to allow users of GBFS to make Photoshop plug-ins using the GBFS tools.  To take advatage of this exception, go back and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#gbfs" target="_blank">re-download GBFS</a>.  However, this does mean that you must publish the source code of any Photoshop plug-in that includes my implementation of the PC side of GBFS.  If you do not accept the GNU GPL, feel free to rewrite the PC side of GBFS yourself based on the format documentation in README.txt in the GBFS package.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hm ure right i dont want to publish the whole plugin code because the GBFS Part for hisself is aviable at our Homepage. I will write youre URL and so on into the readme/credit file and i think everyone that is interested will go to the Page and dl it.
<br/>
<br/>
So long as the plugin is freeware i think there is no prob. I hope so.<br/>_________________<br/>... but im just a <span style="text-decoration: underline">dummy</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">Newbie</span>

<br/>
<br/>
"Re-organise palette".. to allow you to change the order of colours in a palette as well as setting the background colour (index colour #0).
<br/>
<br/>
"Match palette".. lets you load an ACT/ACO/PAL and will adjust the palette to be the same. If you have two 16 colour pictures and you want them to both use the same palette, you can use this to match the colours.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
