    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I am a webdesigner with 2 years experiance desinging websites, game interface, banners, signatures, avatars, and pretty much every graphical thing you can think of.
<br/>
<br/>
I would love to get into the DS development scene, but i have no C or C++ programing nolage.. I am almost an expert at Visual Basic though.
<br/>
But since you cant use VB to make DS games, Why not offer my best skills; Graphics!
<br/>
<br/>
I will make websites, game interfaces, banner sets, signatures, avatars, well basicly any graphic work you need for your game and/or games website.
<br/>
<br/>
I may do some very small jobs for free; 
<br/>
But if its anything you wont me to take serious, then i will charge a small fee.
<br/>
<br/>
Small Project: ?1-?5
<br/>
Medium Project: ?5-?15
<br/>
Large Project: ?15-?25
<br/>
<br/>
This is a rough guide, so if you wont an actuall quote, give me a PM with everything you need and ill get back to you.
<br/>
<br/>
Alternativly, if you cannot pay me for whatever reasons, you could donate some kind of thing to me. What this could be is up to you, if you think i may find it interesting just include it in your PM. It could be a PassMe, it could be a DS game, hell it could even be that you will program me my custem game!
<br/>
<br/>
Any questions PM me, or add me on MSN messenger; <a href="mailto:radixware@gmail.com">radixware@gmail.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Many Thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Im currently working on a portfolio but i need some more work to add to it :)
<br/>
<br/>
I dont have many things online, and most of them are old, But here goes:
<br/>
<br/>
1.) <a href="http://www.Eternal-Evolution.com" target="_blank">http://www.Eternal-Evolution.com</a> - This guy asked me to design him a website based upon his ideas and size colours etc. This is the outcome, but he has since change dthe background colour, and now it does not match.. So ignore that. Note: This is a layout from 2004.
<br/>
<br/>
2.) <a href="http://www.biohazardz.net" target="_blank">http://www.biohazardz.net</a> - I have not made the actual site template here, please note that. I have made some of the template in the template section.. But PLEASE note - This is a VERY VERY old site, and the domain will soon run out. My skills have greatly improved since this website.
<br/>
<br/>
3.) Here is a signature and avatar i made for a friend.. I could only find these two:
<br/>
<a href="http://x-box360.net/images/fox.gif" target="_blank">http://x-box360.net/images/fox.gif</a>
<br/>
<a href="http://x-box360.net/images/foxacy2.gif" target="_blank">http://x-box360.net/images/foxacy2.gif</a>
<br/>
<br/>
And on another note, all payments must be PayPal only unless you are donating something to me (an object or virtual object). And ofcourse, all work will be shown in low quality before i accept your payment.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
