I get this error when I try to run it, and it requires the Task Manager to kill it.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by SaruCoder on Thu Oct 18, 2007 3:42 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's the interesting part, I get that error when I first run the program.  Double-clicked on PaletteTool.exe and I get that message.  I never once was able to execute the program without any problems.
<br/>
<br/>
Ran it through command line just in case it was command line app.  I even gave it a file argument, and I get the same result as before.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to try it on another computer when I get the chance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I tried PaletteTool at work and I get the same error when I startup the program.
<br/>
<br/>
So maybe there's something wrong with the current version of PaletteTool (3.1)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
