    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">been trying to decide which one is better.  both are going to require a lot of research and studying into what all of the command arguments are and how they work.
<br/>
<br/>
grit has a gui option, wingrit, which is very watered down but a little bit more user friendly...gfx2gba seems to be more of a standard however.
<br/>
<br/>
which do you use and why?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Using a GUI interface to convert graphics can sometimes be time consuming since you have to manually convert the graphics every time you edit them. Then after converting you must replace the old source files, rebuild...etc. 
<br/>
<br/>
It's easy to setup the makefile to convert graphics automatically (using grit). There's a thread somewhere that explains how to use grit with the devkitPro template makefiles, I'm not sure where it is though....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Grit, all the way.  I always had trouble getting gfx2gba to do exactly what I wanted (not sure if I wanted something weird, or if I was too dumb to use it).  It is true that wingrit can really help you figure out what options you need...somehow staring at all the ui options as widgets on the screen helped me think through what options I needed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Grit for me too. Sometimes I export straight from Usenti for testing, but I understand that's the same code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
