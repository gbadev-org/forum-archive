    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In general, a sprite or a tiled object drawn on the background will be all one palette. You can draw those in 16 colors (#0 being transparent), use any of several image conversion tools to get 4-bit tile data, and assign a palette ID at runtime.
<br/>
<br/>
If you need to make a single tiled object on the background using multiple 15-color palettes, based on a 256-color or high-color bitmap, take a look at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.angelfire.com/wizard/deku/program.html" target="_blank"><b style="color:#FFA34F">Quither</b></a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I made an action some months ago in photoshop which converts an image into 16 images of 16 colors each (one color being the background color - #FF00FF)
<br/>
I tried it on one of the images the <b style="color:#FFA34F">Quither</b> tool also used and I got a far better result.
<br/>
I've uploaded a zip file containing the action, the individual images and the <b style="color:#FFA34F">quither</b> output image so you can compare.
<br/>
If anyone would like me to explain what the action does, I'd be more than happy to do so.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the zip:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I saw the tools, but I don't figure how to use the images that they generate. I'd like to now how, from those images, I can build a tileset that I can use in a map editor and do the link between tiles and palettes at runtime.

<br/>
<br/>
I would like to know what does your action do, so I can learn. I like photoshop but not good with it ^_^. I know how to change image mode to indexed but nothing more.
<br/>
<br/>
thank you for your time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#23355 - Popstar - Sat Jul 10, 2004 11:48 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all, the image must be proportioned right: pixel width and height must be a multiple of 8.
<br/>
<br/>
The action does this:
<br/>
<br/>
- It duplicates the image.
<br/>
- The duplicate image is scaled down to 12.5%, which means that each pixel in the duplicated image coresponds to each 8x8 tile.
<br/>
- The duplicate image is then turned into a 16 color image (by using indexed color) which coresponds to a color for every palette.
<br/>
- Then I adjust the 16 colors so that they are like this: #000000, #111111, #222222 etc up to #FFFFFF - this is so that the action can pick the colors later by their value, instead of their location on the screen.
<br/>
- The last thing to do to the duplicated image now, is to scale it up to its original size (or 800%) using <span style="font-style: italic">nearest neighbour</span>. Now the action selects the entire image (ctrl+a) and copies it (ctrl+c).
<br/>
- The duplicated image is closed and we don't need to save it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the original image, we now paste the clipboard to a new layer.
<br/>
[loop]
<br/>
- Copy the new layer, turn off the visibility of the copy and go back to the layer you just pasted.
<br/>
- Using the function 'Color Range' we can now select each of the specific colors, starting with #000000. Press OK after having set fuzziness to 0 and press the Delete key.
<br/>
- Now you have a weird looking greyscale-mosaic with parts of the image peering out of the holes you just made.
<br/>
- With the selection still active, you press ctrl+shift+I to invert the selection and fill with your prefered background color. I usually use magenta. #FF00FF.
<br/>
- Now you have have an image with some tiles on a magenta background. Duplicate this image with merged layers and set the indexed colors to 16. Now you have all the tiles for your first palette.
<br/>
- Save the duplicated image and go back to the original. delete all the layers except the layer you copied earlier... turn the visibility on and start over from [loop]. Now you just use #111111 instead of #000000 to pick the next batch of tiles.
<br/>
[/loop]
<br/>
<br/>
You end up with 16 images, one for each palette, which you can copy into a single psd file and remove all magenta pixels from each layer. Thus ending up with a single image containing 8x8 tiles with 16 colors each from one of 16 palettes.
<br/>
<br/>
That's how it works.
<br/>
<br/>
What happened when you played the action?<br/>_________________<br/>-One pixel to rule them all, one pixel to find them.
