I, too, use tUME.

My conversion tool, tumeric, does a great job of converting tUME maps into GBA-compatible data (source code for compilation).  You can get that tool from <a href="http://www.2headed.com/tumeric.html" target="_blank">www.2headed.com/tumeric.html</a> - and sample code to draw maps from that data at <a href="http://www.2headed.com/bg.zip" target="_blank">www.2headed.com/bg.zip</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been creating my own map editor this past week.  Here are the features so far:
<br/>
<br/>
- Edit all four backgrounds for the same map
<br/>
- Backgrounds can be edited and viewd seperatly, or viewed as a how it will appear on the gameboy advance.
<br/>
- Fully compatible with Windows XP (sorry if you don't use windows).
<br/>
- Tilesets are loadeded as bitmaps (24b,16b, 256 color, or 16 color)
<br/>
- Tilesets are enlarged for selection
<br/>
- Double Buffering is used for drawing to ensure quality of display.
<br/>
<br/>
I still have a lot of features to add.  I will be uploading a demo soon.  It will be closed-source, but I'm open to suggestions.  For now, here is a preview.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it would be much nicer if it exported plain binary files so you could convert it to a format of your own choice. I mean, maybe you want to rearrange the map data to suit your own game. Hint: write plugin support for your mapeditor. I'm currently working on a mapeditor that support plugins for importing/exporting and modifying map data as well as accessing my rendering system and when (if) the editor ships it will come with a simple API so people can write their own plugins. That way I think my mapeditor will cover everybodies needs. You need it to save in a special format? Write your own exporter! You want to add support for game objects and not only map data? Write a plugin that access your personal data chunk in the 'user data' area of the map data and also have the plugin render sprites via my rendering pipeline.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm designing a GBA map editor right now.  Once the specification is done coding will begin.  Anyone that wants to can help.  I will post to the help wanted group when the spec is ready.  It will be open source.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think greed necessarily have to do with why people don't release their mapeditors. Me for instance was scurrying around the internet looking for a decent mapeditor one and a half year ago and I found basically nothing so I decided to write my own. 18 months later and my mapeditor is still nothing spectacular and I'm sure there are plenty of editors out there that are a lot better than mine so I don't see a reason for releasing my editor to the public. I don't want to release the source to the editor neither and it's not becuase I'm greedy, it's because I would be so embarraced if someone I saw the code I've written. For gods sake, even my artist laughs at me when he sees the code and he doesn't know much about object oriented programming. :P I'm planning on writing a new mapeditor for Mac OS X, that way I think I have something special to offer and I will indeed release it if it gets good enough. Untill then you can either start writing on your own mapeditor or keep your fingers crossed that someone will release a really good one soon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I also understand that one could be embarrassed about people looking at your code.  I guess my opinion is that, even though my editor code might be terrible, I could perhaps learn a lot if someone else would take a look at the code and maybe fix a few things.  In the end, people do the best they can at the time and they usually discover better ways to do things as they continue to program.  I'm always looking back at old code and wondering why I did something a certain way!
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if it's of any interest to anyone, I'd be happy to release my code for anyone to use.  If all goes well, I hope to be at the point where things are working well in a week or two.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Quick update.  My map editor is coming along quite well these days.  I'm almost at the point where I could post a demo by this weekend.  The features currently include:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Image plug-in for loading tilesets. Of course, the source for the plug-ins will be freely available so someone could improve the existing plug-ins or write custom ones.
<br/>
2) BMP and PCX importer plug-ins but will probably also make a TGA one shortly.  
<br/>
3) Create complex brushes from a tile set and then use those for map drawing.  
<br/>
4) Currently have a brush-slot system so the user can create a couple of custom brushes at a time, quickly recalling them for use as needed.
<br/>
5) Multiple levels of zoom for both tile and map view windows ( 1x,2x,3x,5x,7x,10x,15x ) ...more can easily be added.
<br/>
<br/>
Things I'm still working on:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Map export and import plug-in support.  I'll include a couple of pre-built plug-ins that anyone can modify if they desire.
<br/>
2) Support for multiple BG layers rendered very similarly to what you'd see on a real GBA.
<br/>
3) ? ( anything else I think would be cool/useful ).
<br/>
<br/>
I also plan to release the full source for the editor ( in addition to the plug-ins already mentioned )....I'd just ask that people making mods of it return their work back to the community so we all can have decent tools to work with. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Of course, I knew GDI rendering would never be the fastest by far, but had hoped that it would have the highest compatibility and that it would be sufficiently fast.  Well, not so.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I spent the part of this weekend hooking up OpenGL to my MFC app and getting that to work.  Still some bugs and features I'm working on, but the speed boost is just insane ( naturally ) since the video card gets to do most of the work now.  It also makes it much easier to do some slick layer transparency effects which might be useful for level designers out there.

I'm still planning on doing an Alpha release soon.  When it gets to a Beta state, I'll release the source as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The Tumeric utilitiy optimises character sets and tile sets, so the redundant information you talk about would not translate to wasted ROM space.  If there's something you don't understand, either RTFM or email the author and I'm sure he'd be willing to help out.
