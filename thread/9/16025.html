    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How much need is there for a multiple image file quantizer? And does one exist already? I know this is a difficult programming problem, but my proposed solution relates to some studies I did on clustering and genetic algorithms (well when done efficiently anyway).
<br/>
<br/>
At the start I was just going to attempt a different approach to tile quantizing, but <a class="postlink" href="http://deku.gbadev.org/program/quither/quither.zip" target="_blank">quither</a> is proving to be a mighty program that fulfilled my conversion needs, and at a fast speed too (which is why I began to think of multiple files).

<br/>
<br/>
Input:
<br/>
- directory
<br/>
- number of palettes to use
<br/>
- bits per pixel
<br/>
- number of colours to use in each palette
<br/>
<br/>
Output (per file in directory):
<br/>
- image.img.bin
<br/>
- image.map.bin
<br/>
- image.pal.bin</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've written one myself, but it's quite hacky and I'd love to see a proper tool for this. However, I'd prefer seeing it as a process-only tool (not conversion). That is, take in a series of PNG images and output a series of PNG files, all using the same palette.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It could be useful.  Keep in mind that it will be more useful if it does not have GBA specific restriction.  Ie, I might have a valid reason to want 64 palettes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good point; bearing in mind it is quite a general problem any solution would probably be most effective as a process to be accessed by another program for its own uses and also be able to produce results for varying setups.
<br/>
<br/>
Well I'll get cracking on some algorithms and see what I can come up with.

Exactly what I want to avoid! Another practice I sometimes employ is to seperate tiles into their own images so that I can use specific palettes for certain areas of the image and then merge the quantized images together - I find that I am [still] able to get much better results like this. Of course, not all images are well suited for this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
