cuz a point in 2d is denoted by a vector (x,y) so they are everywhere in any case...

This answers the question "What are you using to draw vectors?", not "What are you using vectors to draw?". I'll phrase it another way: What images in your game do you plan to make with vectors?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As is often the case, it's possible to do it on limited hardware, but you'll have to make sacrifices in image resolution or complexity (or both).
<br/>
<br/>
A good programmer could produce something that looks uniquely lo-fi using vector graphics on GBA, but if you want high image quality, the last thing you should do is ignore the built-in hardware for sprites and tiled backgrounds and render everything using the CPU (which is what you'd be doing).
<br/>

I know this board is more focused towards graphics programming than actual game art, but we have some questions about this part of the game.  We've been talking a lot about graphic styles, and he's really interesting in making the game look, and hopefully run, like a program that uses vectors.  I get the idea that this is a lot easier to do in 3d systems (I don't have a clue about programming it anyway), but do you have any suggestions for us to make some kind of compromise, like to make our sprites look and animate like a vector drawing?  Our biggest challenge so far is that we haven't been able to figure out at least how to pixelize a vector drawing.  The things my friend likes most about vectors are the crisp, even lines and the easy scaling, so is there any easy way to do get that kind of art on this kind of system?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can either render out every possible animation frame, which is what most GBA games do, or try to create images on-the-fly.
<br/>
<br/>
Rendering frames beforehand is all a matter of tools, and there's not much to say about the GBA side of things.  The hardware can scale and rotate sprites, but that's probably not what you want.
<br/>
<br/>
You can practice rendering vector graphics on your PC -- it'll be the same thing on GBA.  The hardware isn't going to do much for you; you have to do it pixel by pixel.
<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be a lot of information out there about it.  Here's something to get you started:

It's another world for an array.

It's a 1 dimensional matrix used for many physics and game calcs.
<br/>
It can be a line drawn on a display using an electron beam as opposed to a bunch of pixels (your version) popular many years as in vector graphics.

Instead of the electron beam(s) going across the screen each scan line horizontally lighting up RGB pixels, imagine programming it directly to move between various points on the screen and turning it off and on.  No "pixels", no "jaggies" on sloped lines, just a completely straight line between 2 points.  That, fairly simplified, is how a vector graphic system works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
