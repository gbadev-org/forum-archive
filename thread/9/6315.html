    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm new with programming GBA stuff. I am currently using HAM and i'm trying to get a 40 frame 128 x 128 image into my project. But I figured that 64x64 is the max you can use. How can I solve this problem?
<br/>
Tile it using 4 x 64 x 64 sprites or any other method?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, tile them.  But dang, that's a lot of sprite data!  A third of a megabyte...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh I know I might cut it in halve or change the animation using functions like blending if possible. Might make it look even better :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If it has much repetition (including empty areas), maybe you could use a background instead.  Then repeated tiles can be reused.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well it's for an animation in the main menu so I guess I can make a tile background with the animation thing in it. Replacing the tiles with the next ones in the animation cycle would work i guess.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh btw does anyone happen to know a way to give multiple seperate images the same pallete. Like a function with photoshop that let's you select all images and then set the pallete for them?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you could always use 4 64x64 sprites if necessary</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Basically you have two choices combining two palettes.
<br/>
<br/>
One (the simple) would be to create a general palette which works a lot like n-bit direct data. where you have 2-3-3 bits for each color. But that might look ugly. (complex with O(n))
<br/>
<br/>
The second is to create a larger palette and put all colors in, then step for step find the colors that are the nearest to each other (Thats about O(n^2) complex) and combine them to one. [ maybe use the pixelcount of this color to weight the interpolation when combining them. Like (palette[a] * weight[a] + palette[b] * weight[b]) / (weight[a]+weight[b]) ] Now replace in all images this palette entry with the new created one, and remove the old entries. Do this while you have &gt;255 palette entries.
<br/>
<br/>
In both cases you might loose quality.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I could also combine all the images into one so I get uh (128 x 40) x 128 bitmap with a 256 color palette I think IrfanView would do that right. And then tile it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've made a strip of the animation now it's 2688x128 in size and sharing one pallete of 256 colors. How do I tile this using gfx2gba?
<br/>
<br/>
edit: nevermind I figured it out... But my raw file still is 2 mb and that's a tad big :/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
