Hmm, Muse fan ? ^^
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway it's a great idea :)
<br/>
<br/>
I have just a little question for now: (I test but it initially didn't work)
<br/>
<br/>
Can I input a bmp that use a 256 colors palette (each 8x8 use only 16 colors) to TileGrabber and, when generated, it keeps the 16-color palettes order, and tiles are exported to 16 color each, and they use the right palette (if the 16-color palette used are only exported it would be really useful :) ) ?
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
YES !!!! ... you can do that RaBBi.
<br/>
<br/>
Just set the tileset to be 16 colours in the config / text file for Tile Grabber ... ie. 'colours = 16'.
<br/>
<br/>
The bank number (0-15) for each 8x8 pixel tile will be encoded in the outputed tileset [.TS] file. You can also output the bank numbers as a pure binary data file.
<br/>
<br/>
Any errors are shown on the outputted diagnostic [.TGA] image.
<br/>
<br/>

Does that answer your question RaBBi ?<br/>_________________<br/>Qwak - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk</a> | Forum - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk/forum/" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk/forum/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But it seems that could work, nevertheless, if the .TGA diagnostic reports errors, it would mean that it couldn't :)<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">RaBBi,
<br/>
<br/>
If the diagnostic .TGA output reports errors, it means :-
<br/>
<br/>
There were tiles (8*8 pixel areas) on the input tile bitmap, that used colours from 2 or more banks (ie. if a tile used colours 2 and 17).
<br/>
<br/>
16 colour tiles can only use colours from one bank (or you can use colour 0 as transparency).
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you are looking for something to convert 256 colour or 24 bit images in to a 256 colour (16*16 colour palettes) image ?<br/>_________________<br/>Qwak - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk</a> | Forum - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk/forum/" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk/forum/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">By "it could'nt" I meant my attempt, not the diagnostic report ^^
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I extract a 256-or-less BMP from a BG of a commercial game.
<br/>
It's in 16 color mode, and tiles use 4-5 different palettes from the 16 loaded.
<br/>
<br/>
I extract the palette too, and assigned it to the BMP.
<br/>
<br/>
And I wanted to grab tiles on it with TilesGrabber so it keeps only the 4-5 used palette to form one (and banks if it can)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: after try, it doesn't work...
<br/>
I'll link here the test folder, if you could look at ^^

<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT2: I think it's because some colors are in several palettes, so when I assign the palette to the BMP with Photoshop or PaintShop Pro, if a color is find on a tile pixel, the software affects the first it finds in the palette, I think...<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I have a custom tool (Tile Quantizer) that will match each 8*8 pixel area to one of the 16 palettes.
<br/>
<br/>
You just need to try remaping the colours for each 8*8 pixel area, against the 16 palettes, until you get a match.
<br/>
<br/>
But like Nessie says, most art packages will just match to the first colour found.
<br/>
<br/>
I've got a bit more work to do on my Tile Quantizer. It will be available eventually (soon I hope).<br/>_________________<br/>Qwak - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk</a> | Forum - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk/forum/" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk/forum/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not at the moment yaustar ...
<br/>
<br/>
I personally much prefer to work with just raw binary data. I think for bigger projects with lots of data items, it's much more manageable.
<br/>
<br/>
If I get enough requests for this I may do an export .H file thingy. It is likely to be one way though (ie. you can't import the .H file back in to Level Mapper).
<br/>
<br/>
It may be an option is to have another console (command line) app that will convert a .MAP or .TIL file in to .H files ...<br/>_________________<br/>Qwak - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk</a> | Forum - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk/forum/" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk/forum/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This pic is the one hardest to use for me...all others games I ripped (just for test no for public demo) have a better logical use of palette...

So does anyone know a tool that type of tool (Tile Quantizer) in waiting that eventually Jamie release his one ?

<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I could see that throwing out any kind of money for a bmp to .h tool would be ridiculous...it would not take much effort to code up such a tool from scratch in about a day (or less if you used some off-the shelf components).
<br/>
<br/>
Something like a level editing tool is a much different story.  I'm guessing based on the complexity and functionality of your level editor that a 1000+ hours went into it?  Maybe (probably?) more?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
In terms of complexity ... a big difference between a map editor and say a bmp2h tool.
<br/>
<br/>
Level Mapper was a serious investment of my time. I even created the GUI enviroment it runs under ... up from scratch (buttons ... menu system ... windows). I would say 1000's of hours work at least.
<br/>
<br/>
Still ... I am happy for other GBA developers to make use of it.<br/>_________________<br/>Qwak - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk</a> | Forum - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk/forum/" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk/forum/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not waiting to have tools for nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
The proof is that I try, with a little experience in app development (I'm a web developer), to write the quantizer tool which will help me in re-indexing pixels of ripped bmps from VBA in order to use them in LevelMapper ^^
<br/>
<br/>
But you said, and it's true, that doing that take a lot of time.
<br/>
So, anyone, with a great dev experience, can't code all the tools he need.
<br/>
<br/>
It's why I'm searching for them first before trying to code them.
<br/>
But if a tool really interest me, and is very useful for my projects, I'm ok for donations ^^<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
