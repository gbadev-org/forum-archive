<br/>
<br/>
I'm a beginner in using Nitro Engine! And I wanted to know what I should do if I want to include a model with some .png pictures as textures in my game?  How does this model exporter/texture converter in Nitro Engine work? Please can anyone give me an introduction step by step?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's really easy to convert things with that programs (specially the NDS model exporter) and it is even easier to use the output (just look at the examples!). That texture converter comes with a sample bat to see how it works.

<br/>
If you can't figure out how to make them work, look for another converters, there are more out there and some of them come with a frontend (well, the NDS model exporter comes with a frontend).
<br/>
<br/>
To figure out how to use them, just look at the examples. The output is usually a bin file (or two if it is a paletted texture) you have to include in your project. It is really easy, but remember that most model exporters don't do any scale conversion, you have to make really small models so that they don't exceed the coordinate limits of the DS (+/-7.99), and you have to set the texture size when you convert the model.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If I only run the model exporter for a very very short moment a black window appears and nothing happens! If I put the file I want to convert on it, the black window appears and also a white window for a very short moment and I get the model as bin file output. I can't do anything else with this program! What am I doing wrong??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
