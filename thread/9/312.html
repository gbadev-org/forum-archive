How i can have bigger control on the tile? i Explain: Think to heve a tile of a wall, but it is no completly wall but just in the middle, 25% void space then 50% of wall and at last 25% of void space. when i meet this tile i can't continue to go if the part of the wall is in front of my way, but if i mome me of just pixel so i can stay in the void space i can continue to go. So how i can understand that from a single tile?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think I understand what you want to know so,  the graphic in the tile has nothing to do with if you can move through it, it's the way you check for collisions that is important.  Sorry, probably not much help but if you search around the forum there are a few posts about collisions detection and there's no point in repeating them here ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tile dimension is 8x8 pixels, either 256 or 16 colour (64 or 32 bytes) you CAN'T change the size BUT you can group them together while making your background map (2x2 tiles 3x3 tiles etc) to make map editing easier.  You can also (but it's a waste really) scale up/down the screen so the tiles VISIBLY become larger/smaller but physically they're always 8x8.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From observing the games it is fairly easy to see the patterns, and to notice that all of the repeating blocks are 16x16. It's a matter of visual estimation; you could count the pixels if you like, but it's fairly obvious to notice that all blocks are at least 16x16 or multiples of 16 in height and width.<br/>_________________<br/>(Works for me!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For games like thoose there are quite some space savings and code simplifications associated with the use of 16*16 instead of 8*8 tiles.
<br/>
The maps for the two worlds and all the caves and dungeons in Zelda must be huge as they are now... If they used 8*8 tiles, the size of the maps would be four times the current size.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
