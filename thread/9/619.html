    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am new to this forum and have recently got interested in GBA development. My experience with game development is limited to making 3d models and animating them for Quake3 MODs but I want to get into GBA development and in terms of production the art side of it.
<br/>
<br/>
At this moment I am writing down my ideas for a small GBA action game into a small game design document and I am trying to figure out the possibilities for the character sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if somebody can answer the following questions that I am stuck with.
<br/>
<br/>
- Do sprites always have to be square like 8x8, 16x16, 64x64?
<br/>
- Can sprites consists of separate images? For instance for a human character lower body images for walk and jump animations and upper body images for aiming, shooting and blocking.
<br/>
- Can you have sprites with "layers". For instance fire from a weapon is a separate image that you place on top of the character sprite when firing and a separate image for a shield that can be destroyed (this will probably be a separate sprite too).
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to drop a bomb of questions in my first post :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">they don't have to be a square, they can also be
<br/>
16x8 or 8x16 or 32x16 or 64x32, etc..
<br/>
<br/>
but if you want a sprite to be 64x8, you can use eight 8x8 sprites or,
<br/>
four 16x8 sprites and so you can do other combinations.
<br/>
<br/>
and they can consist of separate images, but it's best way to split
<br/>
those 2 animations in two sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
Sprites have priorities, so the priority of the fire sprite should be one
<br/>
higher then the character sprite, so that the fire is displayed on top.<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, if i remember correctly, the higher priorities are drawn first, and get overwritten by the lower priorities, which are drawn last. (So higher goes on the bottom.)
<br/>
<br/>
So, basically, yes, you can use any combo of sprites and sizes, and they can be layered.<br/>_________________<br/>Moron! You don't herd chickens with a shotgun!
