<br/>
<br/>
Glad I found this place, it's been a good aid so far. I'm just starting to get into GBA Dev and was wondering: when creating tiles in Photoshop, how can I be sure the colours I am using, will display correctly on the GBA? I've read that GBA supports 256 colours etc and to save in 256 colour bmp, but what I am seeking is some sort of photoshop palette that has all those 256 colours.
<br/>
<br/>
I figured the Web Safe Palette would contain them all, but I want to be sure before I go ahead and start creating the pieces.
<br/>
<br/>
So basically, does anyone have a GBA 'friendly' palette for photoshop? Or does photoshop have one similar that comes with the program?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

they way i do it is to change the image-&gt;mode-&gt;indexed color.  then you can go to image-&gt;mode-&gt;color table and specifically choose the 256 colors you will use on your image.  If you've allready drawn it, you can convert it and hope for the closest 256 colors.  The important thing is to make sure that the last color in the color table will be the "transparent" color if you are using pcx2gba or what ever its called.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if this works for you

hi Oidua,
<br/>
it sounds to me like you are under the impression that the gba has a fixed set of 256 colours!  this is not the case.
<br/>
<br/>
When you use a 256 colour palette, you choose 256 colours from a total of 32768 colours.
<br/>
<br/>
each palette entry is a 16bit number. Bit 15 is unused, and bits 0 to 14 are read as 3 seperate 5 bit numbers - one for each of the red green and blue components of the colour.
<br/>
<br/>
To use a bitmap from photoshop/paintShop, you should reduce it to 256 colours - keeping its own palette, then use one of the many conversion tools to create gba compatable data/palette info.
<br/>
<br/>
cheers
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, that doesn't seem to work.  I had posted a seperate topic on this but I guess I really should have started here.  When you make the image and set it to indexed color you will notice that your swatches change.  They represent the colors that are currently in the image.  If you want to change them you can go to Mode-&gt;Color Table and you will see the whole palette. There you can change them or replace them.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that when you save it to a PCX file and run it through pcx2sprite or pcx2gba (at least with the tile switch) it is unclear as to how transparency is handled.  For instance the first entry in my table is the transparent color.  When I put it through pcx2gba the first entry in the palette is the correct color. However, my Color Table is not completely filled as my image doesn't use 256 colors. More like 132.  The remaining palette is black.  So I am thinking that it is grabbing these other colors from the table to use when displaying the sprite and even though they are the same color as Color 0 they are not actually Color 0 in the palette and are therefore being displayed.
<br/>
<br/>
I am still playing with this but have yet to solve it. NinJ4dn says that it is the last color in the table which is interesting.  If that is the case then that would clearly cause the frustration I am having. I will try it and post back.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When I use photo shop, what I do for sprites &amp; BGs is....
<br/>
<br/>
first index it down to like 16 (for sprites) or 256 (for backgrounds) colours.  Then go to Index, Color pallete, and CTRL-C the colour number (ie. #3CE4F7) out of the zero colour (transparent) slot (first slot) then place it (CTRL-V) where photoshop placed the zero colour, the colour you want for Transparent(ussualy a hot pink stand out colour), it needs to be in the first slot..... Sometimes your lucky and photoshop nails the zero colour in spot zero.  Then I save out the pal as temp.act (pal file).... THEN I HIT CANCEL.  So the image remains the same index, then turn it to RPG again (the colour #'s will stay the same) and then index it, only this time choose CUSTOM and load in the nicely arranged temp.act file.
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I need a lot of sprites to use their own rows.. Or I want to arrange my Backgorund colours so they are very managable and can be manipulate (all the sky colors group together for example)  for this I use...
<br/>
<br/>
This is kind of expensive...

<a class="postlink" href="http://www.equilibrium.com/Internet/Equil/products/DeBabelizer/index.htm" target="_blank">Debabelizer</a> And have been for years... I think they have a demo online.
<br/>
<br/>
If your serious about managing your palletes and you do it a lot, this is the only way to go.  We always save out in windows .bmp format.  Debabelizer LE might not do color pallete stuff, so make sure to find out if you get that version.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Eric Kinkead</span>
