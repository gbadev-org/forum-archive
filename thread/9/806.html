    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well it does not have to be all 3d just a little bit with 3d people and 2d back ground
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm working on some 3d stuff, and especially something to display and animate characters.
<br/>
<br/>
It can import Half-Life files, so you can design characters with any tool that can export to this format (MilkShape, for instance, and i think that there's a plugin for 3ds)
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to have a look <a class="postlink" href="http://geokaris.com/poly.gba" target="_blank">http://geokaris.com/poly.gba</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
That's an quite "early stage" demo, as it isn't optimized.
<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if that kind of thing could help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yes.  Ask the people who translate Japanese RPGs into English.
<br/>
<br/>
The easy way:  
<br/>
1. Open the ROM in VisualBoyAdvance.
<br/>
2. Open the Tile Viewer.
<br/>
3. See whether the program uses 16-color or 256-color tiles.
<br/>
4. Open the ROM in a tile editor.
<br/>
5. Switch to GBA 16-color or packed-pixels 256-color mode.
<br/>
6. Page down through the ROM until you find the graphics you want to change.
<br/>
7. Either draw your graphics directly into the ROM or copy graphics from another file that you have converted to tile editor format.
<br/>
8. Save the ROM.
<br/>
9. Get sued under the Copyright Act because you just "prepare[d a] derivative work[]".
<br/>
<br/>
Some ROMs use compressed graphics, and you'll have to figure out which codec was used (one of the GBA's internal codecs, or something else entirely), decompress the graphics, draw your own, compress it, and re-insert it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
