<br/>
<br/>
Do you know of a good graphic program to draw sprites? Especially one that would let me see how the sprite animates while I draw it, and that could export to GBA code. And windows-based, if that's not asking too much...

I use PcxToSprite for sprite conversions. Or write your own Convertor instead.<br/>_________________<br/>"You have to finish what you have started"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I already use PSP, but I have to copy all frames between PSP and Animation Shop just to see the animation (and besides it's just to see it, because I don't want to make any animated GIF). I was looking for a simpler tool, just to draw some pixels in.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Haven't tried this aspect of the soft, but TileStudio support animation frames for tiles. <a class="postlink" href="http://tilestudio.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://tilestudio.sourceforge.net/</a>. Give it a try. You'll have to create your own export file to get the data as you want. But this means you can have it exactly as you want. The soft isn't a real drawing program though, it's more of a tile/maps editor, with basic drawing support.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No it can't export to C/C++ GBA format (source code). It however does allow you to set your color bit-depth. Thus you can make all your palettes use only 5 bits per color (GBA color format) so you can see what it should look like on the GBA. It also has a bunch of other very useful functions like setting up grid locking so you can create images using tiles (8x8 blocks), creating animations, ect.

I would highly suggest getting Pro-motion if you're serious about making graphics for the GBA. I think it's pretty cheap, plus there's also a trial version if I remember correctly.<br/>_________________<br/>Robert
