    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
Newbie question.  I am trying to change the mask color to magenta from the default black that gfx2gba sets because some of my sprites use black.  I could go through and change all of the black in my sprites to one off of black but there has got to be a way to change the mask to magenta.  In the command line options it says you can specify a different color between 0 and 255, I assume this refers to the pallette it creates but am not sure.  Any help would be great.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The option -a in gfx2gba does exactly what you want. If magenta is the 10th colour in the palette then you'd do this:
<br/>
<br/>
gfx2gba -a10 mypic.pcx
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You need a paint program that lets you see where the colours are in your palette, or to use the palette viewer in VBA to check where magenta is at the moment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
