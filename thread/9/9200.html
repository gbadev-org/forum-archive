    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You don't really want to use "bmp2sprite" of any kind. The reason we use PCX files is because you have control over the pallete, which is actually very important in the gba world. Sure, you can use a universal palette and tailor every sprite to that, but in the end your limiting yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
If youd like, I recommend you use usenti. (check out the TONC page for it.) This handy program will take any .bmp and open it in PCX format. (pallete and all.) It also supports a nifty copy and paste operation. Use paint and copy a file into a usenti document, and it uses the pallete already there, eliminating any confusion. You can handle 16x16 sprites with it quite well, and it has good pallete swaping operations, unlike a lot of big-company software products.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it can export the data, but for my own purposes I still prefer to use PCX2sprite, just cause I like the output format better. That's my own taste though...<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

What's the difference? The .bmp format also supports 16-color and 256-color indexed images.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

This is dead wrong (as per Tepples comment).  You are probably trying to edit your bmp files with Paint or something equivelant which defaults you to the windows system pallete for 16 or 256 colors.  
<br/>
<br/>
If you use The Gimp (free s/w) or Adobe Photoshop, you have complete control of your pallete for BMPs. 
<br/>
<br/>
I personally prefer working with BMPs and have never had any problems using them in 16 or 256 color mode, with custom palletes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Gosh I hate microsoft for coming out with cheap things like paint... Oh well. I don't have an editor that supports it, so I guess thats why <span style="font-style: italic">I</span> use PCX.

Just out of curiousity, what do you find 'better' about it?

Actually, MS-Paint can also create 16 color bmps. Of course, you have no control over the palette, but it does support them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well nothing really I guess. It's simple and to the point. I'm a simple minded guy, so...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure usenti can probably export a lot better, I'm just used to the other way and haven't got the motivation to change yet. I still use usenti for all of my graphics editing though.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

<br/>
<br/>
You can choose to either link the <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">katie</span></span> generated ResourceData.o file directly with the code to produce a self-contained ROM image, or if you're using a GBAMP2 or similar piece of kit, you can set up your program to load the <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">ResourceData.raw</span></span> file dynamically using chism's FAT library. 
<br/>
<br/>
The cool thing is that the resource header generated by katie can be used for both types of builds. The same offsets/sizes work with the data in your ROM, or as as offsets/sizes for FAT_fseek/FAT_fread calls as you access the <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">ResourceData.raw</span></span> file. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have my own data IO wrapper functions set up so that IO requests automatically use that resource header data in the right way, depending on the type of build I have specified. I also have a specialized "free" function that actually frees the data if it was allocated and loaded from a FAT function, or does nothing if the data was originally returned as a pointer to a ROM location. 
<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, I automatically generate both types of builds in my makefile so that I can always run on my PC with an emulator using the "ROM data" version, and run on my GBAMP2 using the "CF data" version. 
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, be aware that I'm no expert on gba/nds data management. I haven't really felt the urge to investigate other similar tools because <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">katie</span></span> does what I need it to do quite nicely. There may be something out there that someone likes better, or that works better for their needs. Using <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">katie</span></span> is only my own personal choice.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"><br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
