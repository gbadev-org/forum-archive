    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there guys.
<br/>
<br/>
I seem to have a problem with trying gfx2gba to work
<br/>
alongside what is given on the HAM tutorial 6.
<br/>
<br/>
To save you guys the trip, here an excerpt:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote"> Change to that directory and type:
<br/>
gfx2gba -fsrc -m -pparadise.pal -t8 paradise.bmp
<br/>
NOTE: This is different from what we used on Day 4.
<br/>
            -t8 means 8 pixel tiles, -m means map
<br/>
<br/>
This will create three files:
<br/>
paradise.pal.c
<br/>
paradise.raw.c
<br/>
paradise.map.c
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
However, this doesn't work anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
-m no longer means map, it means merge and etc
<br/>
<br/>
So can anyone recommend how to do this via command line
<br/>
or better yet through the gfx2gba front end?
<br/>
<br/>
Much appreciated</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you sure you talk about the same gfx2gba as aaron does hin his tutorials?
<br/>
Since the options didn't change as far as i know.
<br/>
<br/>
However, you should download the recent version, get it here:

What output does it give when you follow those instructions?<br/>_________________<br/>There are 10 types of people in the world. Those who understand binary and those who don't.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are 2 different gfx2gba available aren't there? And they are completely different in output, functionality and syntax. The one by markus at console-dev is the one to use. It has a file size of 27KB and is currently on version 0.13.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
lol - I re-read the article prior and discovered that it was the one that came bundled with HAM ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, if he's following the Aaron Rogers tutes, he would be using the gfx2gba that came with HAM. 
<br/>
<br/>
So have you sorted out that problem yet?<br/>_________________<br/>There are 10 types of people in the world. Those who understand binary and those who don't.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I just checked the gfx2gba documentation 
<br/>
-m still means map.
<br/>
<br/>
We'll at least in the version that comes with HAM 2.6<br/>_________________<br/>There are 10 types of people in the world. Those who understand binary and those who don't.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yep, it worked.
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't realise that it came bundled with HAM so I looked
<br/>
around and found a pretty comprehensive version and I
<br/>
thought it was that one ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Re-read it again and everything is working again ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
