    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A while back, I had been working on a GBA demo, hoping to attract some attention from a publisher.   
<br/>
<br/>
Well, nothing came of it.  :)
<br/>
<br/>
So, I'm releasing the tilesets for the demo, available at the MapEd site, hosted by gbadev.org.   Please note that the tilesets are <span style="font-style: italic">free</span> for non-commercial use!
<br/>

(oh, and you can find the demo itself on the site listed above)
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sweet!  I'm glad to see it released.  By the way, if you find a secret room without a power up in it, there is nothing there.  I took the FFIII secrets everywhere approach to stage design.  Evidently I like secret rooms a little more than Nessie does. =)

Not that I know of...  What state is the project in?  Would it be feasible to continue it at this point?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had thought about going in and actually applying some much needed polishing and balancing to the demo, but frankly, I have less than zero time free on my hands.  I ended up going back to Raven Software after my hiatus to work on Quake 4.
<br/>
<br/>
I did find enough time though to add a quickie credits screen, remove the jump boots from the cathedral entrance, and remove a plat section in the left tower so that you can't access that area until you find the jump boots in the proper location.  The latter two changes just made the demo a bit closer to they way I had intended on the game being played.  Oh, and I made the boss do less damage.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
