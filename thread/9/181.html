    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just have to jump in here. Jenswa you ask an open ended question to say the least. For one thing that is totally a matter of opinion, it's like asking what is the best flavor of ice cream. There is no definitive answer, other than try some to see what you like and suits your needs. Gbadev.org has links to several, (map editors, not ice cream. =P) and several more can be found through your friend Google. Not trying to be harsh, but if you're going to ask a question on a forum board you might be better off asking something a bit more...specific. Hope this helped you out somewhat.<br/>_________________<br/>#gameart on EFnet. The pixel owns you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So you guys don't even have an <span style="font-style: italic">opinion</span> about which Map Editors are the best, or even which ones are incomplete to the point that they're not much use at all?
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't used them much myself, but I have noticed that most seem to be quickly thrown together so the developer can get back to the fun stuff (GBA dev, of course).  As a result, the free ones seem a bit limited/incomplete.  Check out the demo of EMapper Advanced - that's a pretty slick product:
