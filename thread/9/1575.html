<br/>
Doing 3D on the GBA is tough, as there is no hardware support for it (except "mode7" which is somewhat 3D, but note that it isn't an actual videomode). If you want to do 3D you will have to write your own engine and know quite some assembler to get it running at a reasonable framerate. I believe HAM has some support for 3D, but not quite sure.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want a typical doom kind of game, use the raycasting technique. Searching google should give you loads of webpages about this.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't seen MonkeyBall 2 or JB in action so they might use some hardware tricks to fake 3D that I'm not aware of.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have no experience in 3D, then put it out of your mind for a while!:)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Put together a team of top notch developers.  They have to be experts in asm, matrix and vector maths, and the AGB hardware.  Then keep them focus on the project for 12-18 months. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">its definiatly possible to write some good 3d apps on the gba. look into the book Micheal Abrash's Graphics Programming blackbook .
<br/>
<br/>
if your really interested, get that book
