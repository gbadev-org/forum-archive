    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have an image that contains my entire tileset....something like 12 tiles by 96 tiles.  
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to rearrange it to be a different dimension (16 tiles by X tiles, or 1 tile by a lot of tiles).  Anyone know of a good tool to do that?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Usenti can do this (Menu: Image-&gt;Rearrange). From the existing image, rearrange to a tile column (enter tile sizes), and then to the arrangement you want by using the width of the desired outcome and the height of of a single tile.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, if a tile is WxH and you have 12x96 tiles, rearrange by WxH gives an image Wx(H*12*96) in size, representing 1x(12*96) tiles. Now enter (16*W)xH and you get an image of 16 tiles by 36.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Cearn:  Heh, not sure how I missed that...I looked through the menus of Usenti (it being my main tool for this sort of thing!) but somehow didn't see it. (or more likely, saw it and wrongly thought it wouldn't do what I needed) Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
