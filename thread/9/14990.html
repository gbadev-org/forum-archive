    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just started using Tile Studio as it seems to be the nicest map editor for DS development (someone tell me if I'm wrong :P) and it's working fine Edorul's GBA C code generator for basic export, so that's what I'm using as the base for my own custom generator.
<br/>
<br/>
The main issue is that it merges the back/mid/front layers into one.  I could work around this by just making different maps in Tile Studio, but I'd rather make use of the layer feature.  The docs seem to indicate I can use TSMidTile and so on to pull out each layer separately, but it doesn't seem to work properly with 8x8 tinytiles, giving me "corrupted" results.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
For maps I sketch them with TS, but don't export them.  Instead I hardcode the map as a metatile array and wrote a parser to unravel the metatiles into the full tile map.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
