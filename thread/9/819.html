    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Either buy a very expensive commercial codec (I think they run about $2000), or write your own. Either way is a lot of work^^
<br/>
Of course if you're just doing it for fun, you can play uncompressed video, but that takes a huge amount of ROM, so you probably won't get much more than a few seconds on a flash cart. You could probably get away with using RLE compression on each frame though, and especially if your whole animation is 256 color with the same palette it would be smaller. If you want sound though, that's another story. You could play a MOD with short sound effects and stuff without soaking up a lot of memory though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am designing a hardware adapter to connect a SmartMedia card to the GBA cartridge bus.  If someone made a way to convert video files to GBA rom files, it would be comprable to the am3 or PocketPix.  It would provide up to 128MB (1Gbit) of storage partitioned into pages of up to 32MB (256Mbit).  This is ample space for a decent quality/length video, so any video conversion program would be very helpful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Seems like the HW is able to decompress video with sufficient speed.
<br/>
There is also an OpenDivX port for the GBA but i think its not yet that fast.
<br/>
Search for: OpenDivx 4.48 port on GBA using GCC</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The old predator vid codec used to be around, and I make short GBA videos all the time with it. Its watermarked, takes a hella long time to compile, and is lower res then the matrix video. But its a good party trick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
