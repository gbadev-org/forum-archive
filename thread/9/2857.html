    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For my program, I'm trying to do rotation and scaling at the same time with sprites, but it is not working as I would like it to. When doing each separately, it works just fine, but when I do them together, the scaling of the x/y axis after the rotation is not correct, it stays on the axis if rotation were 0. The code that I'm using is the same as in The Pern Project tutorials. Is there more that I need to do to make it work?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It seems that Dovoto of The Pern Project made an error with his example code, though his example didn't show it due to equal x/y scaling. For pb, x-scale should have been used, and y-scale should have been used with pc. Now it will act as if scaling was done first, then rotation (from a visual POV)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
