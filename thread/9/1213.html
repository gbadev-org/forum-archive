Why do you need GIF?  GIF uses compression technology that's patented in several jurisdictions (U.S. Patent 4,558,302 and foreign counterparts).  Other than the lack of GIF writing support because of the patent, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gimp.org/win32" target="_blank">GIMP</a> seems to do what you want.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">what mean 'resolution' into image?
<br/>
<br/>
Some graphic program use resolution corresponding to image dimension
<br/>
instead others use resolution dont' blind to the image size...
<br/>
<br/>
So what is the resolution?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Resolution is used when you want to print out your picture. It tells you that for an inch wide, it will insert 100pixels in it. The highter, the better. Since a picture got a fixed amount of pixels, increasing resolution mean that the printed will appear smaller, diminishing resolution will mean that the printed picture will be bigger.
<br/>
<br/>
The resolution is of no relevance for GBA dev, we only needs to know the actual pixels size of it, since we don't intend to print it out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GIMP is quite horriffic if you ask me, it is a photoshop clone, and a quite bad one on top of that, but enough of that. Personally i use a small dos app called <a class="postlink" href="http://www.scene.org/file.php?file=/resources/graphics/gfx2b965.zip&amp;fileinfo" target="_blank">GFX2</a>, it has all the features you could possibly need to make graphics with an indexed palette. It works great in both Windows 98 and Windows 2000 for me, I have no idea about Windows XP but i guess it should work fine there too.
<br/>
<br/>
However, if it doesn't work for you or if you simply prefer to work in a Windows environment, you could always check out this app called <a class="postlink" href="http://cosmigo.com/promotion/" target="_blank">Pro Motion</a>, it's commercial but still quite cheap. Both of these programs I mentioned above should be fairly easy to get into if you have worked with programs like Deluxe Paint before.
