    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi All,
<br/>
I want to switch Mode 4 to Mode 3, acutally , in my program, if I just use mode 4 or just mode 3 there are no any problem, however , when combine these two modes, there are some problems. The problem as following:
<br/>
1. When I compile the program, all the header files which conver from image have having an error, which say that 
<br/>
" BT_bg.h:3: parse error before "const" ".
<br/>
I have used different image converter to conver those images for for Mode 3 and Mode 4, Also , there is no problem when I just use one of the mode in the program.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know what is the problem. 
<br/>
Thanks for your help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
