    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to convert some 256 color tilesets into 16 colors. So far, what I've done is find similar colors in the palette and convert them to one color ( i.e 3 shades of dark gray all converted to black). This reduces the number of colors I have, but there are still multiple palette entries, each one the same color.
<br/>
<br/>
So, my question is, does anyone know of some kind of utility perhaps that will "merge" the palette indeces together? Kind of like swapping to indeces, to a single one. Instead of trading colors, assigning the all to a third color.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In GIMP 2.2.17[1], if you convert an indexed image to RGB and back, it will create a new palette without duplicated colors.

<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[1] I tried 2.4. After about an hour of trying to get used to its new selection mechanism, where the user has to both manually confirm and manually float each selection in order to move the selected pixels, I uninstalled it in favor of 2.2.17.</span><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
