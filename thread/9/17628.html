How are images important to gba like with Open GL and Direct X (where you've got functions that convert data in images)? And with the gba image files, whats/how are they created?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Usually GBA images are converted from a standard image format (usually png) to raw data in the form that the GBA can handle -- either just a raw binary blob, or as C or assembly code that can be compiled and linked into your project.

There are various tools for this, but the semi-standard one nowadays that's recommended is grit, which is part of the devkitPro tools.
