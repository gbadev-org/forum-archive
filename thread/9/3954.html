is it faster to draw 8-bit ot 16 bit?

I am trying to improve my 3d engine, and it's important
<br/>
for me to know, if I can make it faster on mode 4.

my engine is faster with 16bit. with 8bit I had to have a backbuffer in iwram, then I copied it to the vram. it was slower. but I do not know any other way how to solve the 16bit allignment problem.
<br/>
<br/>
at the moment I'm drawing about 3.2k triangles with a resolution of  120x80. I think it's faster 'cause it doesn't matter how many pixels you 'could' write at once, because of the texturelookup you're working with just one pixel at time.
<br/>
<br/>
but I haven't testet my flat-rasterizer.

yes :)
<br/>
but before you ask, maybe it helps to take a look at: <a href="http://www.racer.nl/reference/vfc.htm" target="_blank">http://www.racer.nl/reference/vfc.htm</a>

You could unroll your texture loop, shifting four pixels into a register and then writing them all out at once, no?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

1. not really, what about h-lines with a lenght of 3 5 or 7? there's a pixel left, but I cannot read from the vram, so I cannot set the last pixel.
<br/>
2. I think there's an 16bit alignment for writing to the vram, it would be not that easy to draw a line in 8bit mode. (i'm not that sure about the alignment-restriction)

you're right, I've looked at the papers... i don't know why I was thinking that all the time long. *curious*

yes, if you can read from the vram it isn't that difficult.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the way I was trying to solve this problems was a s-buffer rasterizer. it's nearly finished ;)
