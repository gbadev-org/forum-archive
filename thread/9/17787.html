    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know this totally is a noob question. So what is it and if you know the software specifically for Resident Evil 3?
<br/>
<br/>
Playstation One was not the first game console I had. But when i bought it, I bought it with a couple of games and I still remember Resident Evil 3 was the first game I chose to play on my playstation. I will never forget how amazingly shocked I was. It was like WTF!! How do they do this 3d model and for the next hours I got glued with the joystick.
<br/>
<br/>
Playstation definitely is the reason why I'm doing programming now. Tho I never programmed a complete game, I'm capable to do it. I just don't have the time.
<br/>
<br/>
I know i'll never want to try to do those 3d modelling stuffs. The only thing I'm always curious about is the 3d software. What is it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">3DStudio or Maya are the popular software applications right now for creating 3D graphics on consoles and handhelds.  They were during the GBAs time as well.  Artists create the models and textures, programmers write utilities to take that output and compress and convert it into a format that is usable on the target, then other programmers write engines on target that process that incoming data into actual calls to hardware chips and such that make the 3D models appear.
<br/>
<br/>
Then there's the whole fun of doing so at least 30 times a second, while not using up too much RAM, and still leaving at least 50% of the CPU's time available for sound, AI, and other game play tasks outside of rendering.
<br/>
<br/>
And this would be on a system that natively supports 3D.  The GBA is not such a system.  Here, the task is even more difficult as you have zero hardware support for rendering.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You get it all wrong with all those assumptions and you didn't answer my question. First of all, I didn't say that I was going to develop for gba. I guess it's my mistake to post this kind of question on the wrong category.  I'm a programmer myself, i've done lots of works on this area. From assembly language to a full fledged web application.

I don't know whether you're a programmer or not but if you are. Then you really need to stop making assumptions. I had that attitude when i started programming and that didn't contribute in a positive way. ;) (just a bit from my experience)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, programming isn't really that hard. All you need is hard working. Btw, I'm really sorry for the question. I should've said that this is an off topic question.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is graphics related so it seems like a perfectly logical place to post the question.
<br/>
<br/>
It might be worth noting Google Sketchup, Blender, Lightwave and Milkshape too. There are quite alot to choose from really.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
