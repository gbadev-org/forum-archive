( I am making my own GBA engine based off a shareware programs language called GML ( from GameMaker ) ) Anyway, my simple question is ( as I may have missed somewhere ) what does the GBA use to render graphics? I mean like, OpenGL, or DirectDraw? If it can use both, which is the best?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Neither. Please read through the PERN Project tutorial. If you are familiar <span style="font-style: italic">only</span> with PC graphics architecture, GBA's most basic graphics mode could best be compared to text mode, albeit four layers of text mode with customizable 16-color fonts, with 128 hardware mouse pointer images on top of it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
