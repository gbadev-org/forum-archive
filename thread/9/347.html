    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a tool to convert a 256 color bitmap (with for example 60 different colors) to a gba map using 16 color tiles? I've seen several tools like this, but they always work only with 256 color tiles or if you want to output 16 bit tiles, the input bmp must have 16 colors or less.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But is there a way to reduce the colors of a bitmap so that each 8x8 pixel tile of an image can use one of sixteen 15-color palettes, instead of using one 16-color palette for the whole map?  This may provide gains because some areas of an image use more of a given color than other areas; for example, a sky area will be mostly light blues, and a grassy area will be mostly greens.
<br/>
<br/>
I think I know a way, in theory, but I know of no tools that implement anything like this.  First, you have to decide which palette each tile will take.  Then you have to design each palette to minimize error for the pixels that belong to each palette.  Now dither the image based on what colors are available for each palette entry.
<br/>
<br/>
It won't be exactly straightforward to decide which palette each tile will take, but here's a suggestion:  Reduce the image by a factor of 8 in each dimension (full screen becomes 30x20 pixels) and color-reduce that to 16 indexed colors.  Then assign each tile's palette index based on the corresponding pixel of the reduced image.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

doragasu,
<br/>
 You can do it!  Overcome your own mentally-imposed limitations.  Get an artist friend who knows how to draw.  Or here's a hint:  make a tile set that confirms to the "16 palettes of 16 colors" rule.  Then use the tile set to build a map.  It IS that easy!

Static screens (title screens, etc.) shouldn't need color reduction because they can just use bitmap modes.

Besides, there really isn't too much of a market for puzzle games.  Publishers don't care.  They sell license-based games.

Homebreweries do make money, especially on computer platforms.  It's called shareware.  The reason shareware does not exist on the GBA, Wonderswan, and NGPC is because of the console makers' tight control over what software can be marketed for those systems.

Then why did Sega bring out Puyo Pop on GBA without the Sonic license? (The GameCube version of Puyo Pop, called Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, has the Sonic license because it's on the same disc with a half dozen other emulated Sonic games.)  And what about Mr. Driller 1 and 2?  What about Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo and Spin Jam for PS1?  What about the Bust-A-Move series, that's still going strong?

I've been thinking about this recently - it is possible to do shareware on the GBA, but no one has tried it yet. Knock up a demo of your game and distribute it freely, put your address inside where they can send payment and you send them the full and complete ROM file. obviously, this limits your market to people with a Linker / other backup device - but if the game is good enough then i'm sure you could sell a 'homebrew' (i hate that word!) game for about ?5 per copy.
<br/>
<br/>
for example - if a gamer had a choice of the original GBA version of Bomberman for ?30 - ?40, or a rather good but massively playable GBA clone for ?5; which do you think they'd choose?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Firstish, Sega is its own publisher.  Secondy, Puyo Pop is basically a license to them as it had mild success on Dreamcast.  Mr. Driller is a license.  So is Super Puzzle Fighter.  Spin Jam, published by Take Two, doesn't seem to be license based, but guess what!  There are always exceptions!  Bust-A-Move is a license, too!  Oh no!  Thank you for pointing out that most puzzle games are a license based.

Sure a license has to start somewhere (with an original).  That's not the point.

Tetris was done back in the day, when license-based publishing just wasn't as like it is today.  No, no, the dynamics of publishing were different then.  (Right, guys?)  However!  Tertris became a license!  Tetris 2 just proves it.  Tetrisphere proves it.  The New Tetris proves it.  Tetris Attack proves it.  Root word:  TETRIS.  This couldn't have been more easy for you.

Not even the publisher of Snood, which started out as shareware and is in effect a homebrew GBA title that made it?  Or will you call Snood an "exception that proves the rule"?
