    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What tools do you use for creating/editing sprites for DS/GBA development?  Photoshop doesn't seem to have good palette tools.  I tried Graphics Gale, and the docs show it has all kinds of palette functions (making gradients, etc.) but I can't figure out how to use them.  (It is almost like I'm missing a menu or something)
<br/>
<br/>
I need to create 256-color palettes, reserve some colors, and let the rest map to the best match for a series of icons and images.  (It looks like Graphics Gale can do this, but I just can't make it work).
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been reading up on commonly used editing materials. It seems CorelDraw has been constantly used in the past.
<br/>
<br/>
About Photoshop during the time when CorelDraw was popular Photoshop was in it's 1.0 stages. Again I am limited to my tools as I am using a 566Mhz Celeron 98 machine that could use a good PCI 3d accellerator and CPU upgrade but at the moment is limited to 256 Memory which I would like to upgrade the bios but I don't want that ugly Blue Screen AWARDS Bios.
<br/>
<br/>
Your computer needs vasts amounts of memory to use high end image editing tools. The Qaurk I was using last last semester year in college was running extremly slow on the only G5 Machine left in the building ( which looks pretty slick ) then one of the extinct Imacs there a 19 incher ( the first release ) was really slow when I tried to use any of the new installed tools and G3 was the one used to dev Saturn games.
<br/>
<br/>
I need to get around and install some of the programs and somehow get a computer that can at least run XSI.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

(now Corel) PaintShop Pro is pretty good with this sort of stuff.  When you convert a 32 or 24 bit image to a 256-color palette, it'll find the best matching colors for you.  Also, it can even reduce colors if you want to reduce the number of colors used in your bitmap.
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that it doesn't do (and what I'm currently looking for) is that it doesn't reserve colors.  For example, if I want colors indexes 0-16 for a flame image, but color indexes 32-64 used for blood.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
