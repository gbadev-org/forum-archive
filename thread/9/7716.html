<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way in usenti to use the exporter from a command line?  The exporter is really good and flexible, so I tend to use it most of the time, but it'd be really great to be able to automate the graphics-to-data conversion in my makefile. 
<br/>
<br/>
Just curious!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, I was working on that about 2 months ago ... then I blew my PCs PSU (at least, I <span style="font-style: italic">think</span> that's what's happened, all I know is that the thing's completely dead right now) and I don't have all my latest stuff on my laptop to continue right now.
<br/>
Don't worry I ordered a new PC (was long overdue anyway) and should arrive around Nov 14. 
<br/>
Errr, Nov 28. 
<br/>
Oh right, we've past that date too ... Dec 4 then.
<br/>
Dammit, don't have the opportunity to pick it up &gt;_&lt;
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe tomorrow. 
<br/>
...
<br/>
Well, I'll get it soon enough.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the plan is to have everything that the current (v1.7.1) Usenti exporter has in there, i.e.
<br/>
<ul><li>(partial) palette
<br/>
</li><li>(partial) image, as bitmap or tiles
<br/>
</li><li>rudimentary mapping options, with tile reduction and meta tiling
<br/>
</li><li>compression: bitpacking, RLE, LZ77, Huffman (though thats still buggy sometimes :( )
<br/>
</li><li>C, asm, binary, gbfs formats; header optional. u8, u16, u32.</li></ul>All the actual exporting code is already there, I just need the command-line parser, and maybe some extra safety code for dying gracefully.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, as Cearn is working through improving his exporter, I got impatient, and implemented the command-line features I needed myself, since he was kind enough to provide the code for wingit (which uses the same exporter as usenti).
<br/>
<br/>
From my website, you can download what I call wingitCLI -- a command line interface to Cearn's exporter.  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tolberts.net/wingitCLI.zip" target="_blank">http://www.tolberts.net/wingitCLI.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
To use it, you'll need to download the <a class="postlink" href="http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/download.html" target="_blank">FreeImage dll</a>.  (sorry, I was too lazy to statically link it in).
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't include a help file, but you can figure it out pretty easily by just running it with no options, or taking a look at the source.
<br/>
<br/>
In the zip file, I included the source files that I added.  The other sources you can get directly from <a class="postlink" href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/downloads.htm#wingit" target="_blank">Cearn's website</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I didn't do any extensive testing, and it was very much a hack-together job, so I'm making no claims to the quality.  And I guess since wingit was under a GPL license, my code is too :)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, enjoy.   Thanks, Cearn!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
