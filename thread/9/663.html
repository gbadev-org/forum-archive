    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
Im working in mode 4, and wish to display a sprite. I followed dovoto's tutorial, and got a sprite provided with that tutorial displayed on screen in Mode 4,. When i try to use my own sprites, however, something is displayed, but it looks wrong, like its all jumbled up. Ive tried a number of tools to create the sprite, but none seem to work. 
<br/>
Can anyone help?
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
