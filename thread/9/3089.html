    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm a COMPLETE newbie to making maps on GBA...  But the need as arisen in our project.
<br/>
<br/>
So I wonder if you can help me out...
<br/>
<br/>
I've got the pictures that I will use in my tileset in BMP format.
<br/>
How do I convert that BMP file into a .ts file so I can use it in levelmapper?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The answer is in the docs you downloaded with Level Mapper :O)
<br/>
You have to use grab_tile.exe...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"docs"?  Hmm.  This is a word that's unfamiliar to me.....
<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean I have to READ something in order to gain knowledge &amp; understanding of how to use it???
<br/>
<br/>
That doesn't sound like fun!
<br/>
<br/>
:)
<br/>
<br/>
(Cheers for the advice!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I do mean you have to READ, yes...
<br/>
<br/>
You won't go very far otherwise, except if you are a genius ! I think this is the case with most people here... Lots of work and experiment lead to knowledge.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck anyway !
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you want to use the data output by LevelMapper, you will have to read the docs, section concerning the files format. So better start know :O)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
