    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">3d isn't the easiest 'mode' on the gba,
<br/>
since the is no build in 3d engine, you need to
<br/>
make up your own.
<br/>
<br/>
So you tried jamagic? Then why start programming for the gba?
<br/>
If you can create 3d games in windows?
<br/>
<br/>
One reason:
<br/>
The gba doesn't crash that often.
<br/>
<br/>
Anywayz, since i am new too, i can't help you anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
And most people who have a 3d engine, aren't going to share it
<br/>
that easy with other users. There some simple 3d stuff around,
<br/>
but now 3d games.<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
