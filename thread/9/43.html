No, there isn't any extra green bit. The MSB of the half-word (15th bit starting from 0) is unused. Then the rest of the bits are split up into 5 bit color units following the BGR format. You could say that the format of one palette entry is: 1U-5B-5G-5R where U is unused, B is blue, G is green, and R is red.

:) true. I ment counting from LSB, but drawed it reversed. Shit happens when you're low on coffein and are up and running when you're supposed to be counting sheep.<br/>_________________<br/>"The best optimizer is between your ears..."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It seems to depend on where you get your documents from for this extra green bit,  the official nintendo one I got says it's there, but an older version of the same document doesn't have anything about it..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmm, strange. However, I've heard of ppl utilizing the extra bit in the format to process higher resolution graphics (color depth). Not sure how, but probably using the bit as a 'toggle' to enable the double amount of colors (2 x 15bit) or so, but now I'm just guessing.<br/>_________________<br/>"The best optimizer is between your ears..."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was trying if the extra bit actually is making any difference.
<br/>
I also played with the register 0x4000002 (green swap).
<br/>
<br/>
I thought, maybe enabling a certain bit in that register can turn on
<br/>
the 6-bit green feature.
<br/>
<br/>
However, with or without the extra 6th "green" bit, there is no difference.
