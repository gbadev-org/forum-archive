    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The answer is no...and...no.  Well, sort of.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead, you have 32 rotation/scale matrices at your disposal...and each sprite can index into one of these 32 matrices if you want them to rotate/scale.  
<br/>
<br/>
So, for a given sprite, you just set bit 8 of OBJ Attribute 0 in order to enabled rotation/scaling.  You may also want to set bit 9 of this attribute to enabled double sized mode...this will help with clipping with rotation/scaling, but there will still be a limit on how large it can be scaled/rotated before clipping begins....there are some other problems with it as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, on OBJ Attribute 1 of the same sprite, you set bits 9-13 with a value that corresponds to index of the rotation/scale matrix you want that sprite to use.  This value will be in the range of 0-31.
<br/>
<br/>
One other point is that, if I recall, H/V flipping of sprites does not work in rotation/scale mode...you have to apply a negative scale factor to the rotation/scale matrix to flip a sprite.  (correct me if I'm wrong)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You are correct - no flipping with rotation as those bits are part of the scaling factor when in rotation mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
