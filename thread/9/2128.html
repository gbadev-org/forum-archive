    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone remember my old post on a map-editor I was writing called MapStudio Advance?  That project had a lot of issues from the start and never got released, so I've started a new project on sourceforge.net called GameBoy Advance MapStudio.  It's licensed under the GPL, and will have some awesome features.  Right now, I'm still working on the code for adjusting the map properties and editing the actual map data, so I might not have a working version posted untill this weekend, but I'll post the current code now.  A big feature I plan to have is the ability to import from source code (C/C++).
<br/>
<br/>
Note well that this is not the cleanest code in the world.  There are some places where I've used a quick and easy method to get something done.  Hopefully after I get some more important features finished, I'll go back and fix these things up.

Thanks a lot.

BTW, I like open source!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">here is the current release.  just a preview.  no real features.  It just shows how the interface will work.  The map is of a fixed size, there is only one tool (pencil), and the tileset is fixed.  I'll try to have it working by the weekend.  Look forward to tile import, tile selection, multiple tools, and adjustable map properties.  I should also have the file loading/saving code working by then too.
