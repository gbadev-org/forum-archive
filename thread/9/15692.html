Any links (that I have found) from previous topics are casualties of 404.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If those are doing what I think they're doing, the general idea is that you would use hblank dma to update one of the windows with every frame.  So instead of a square window, you get any old odd shape you want, as long as you update the window correctly for each scanline.  
<br/>
<br/>
The ones with lots of different shapes for each scan line seem trickier, so maybe I'm missing something, but something like the swirl could be done using 2 windows.
<br/>
<br/>
If you start with a "simple" circle, you could expand from there.  
<br/>
<br/>
See <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9023&amp;highlight=mario+key" target="_blank">this discussion</a> for a nice little code snippet from cearn.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The swirl, random, vertical swipes, and plasma are not HBlank related.  HBlank windowing can only be turned on and off once per scanline.  The swirl I'm guessing is using Sprite Windowing and the vertical swipe just normal windowing.  Random could be accomplished with Sprite windowing as well.  The plasma probably isn't a screen fade.  :)
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, hadn't seen that site before.  Good info.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Once or twice? I thought there were two windows, both of which could be controlled by HDMA.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had forgot about the 2nd window - you are correct.  You can start and stop the window twice which would allow for the swirl effect via BGs.  Still is probably done with sprites though :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I couldn't explain the plasma as a typical effect; must just be his own processing of the bitmap data (still would be a good effect with fading corresponding to the plasma).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looks like DarkCloud's website is no more, but I have uploaded the demo's mentioned in my article <a class="postlink" href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeaxs/gbacomp/files/All_Screen_Demos.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. Those are mostly using window's.
<br/>
<br/>
The swirl effect mentioned in the article uses a palette effect. You can download it from <a class="postlink" href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeaxs/gbacomp/files/swirl.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. The link to Cearn's splotlight effect is also very good and I will add that to the website. As for the sine wave effect it is very easy, you simply modify the horizontal scroll register during a hblank using a sin lookup table.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
