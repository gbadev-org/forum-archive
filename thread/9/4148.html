<br/>
I have not heard from Derek Evans, nor seen any posts by him in months.
<br/>
He does not reply to emails. His site has not been updated.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone heard from Derek? Do you know the status of YETI3D?
<br/>
<br/>
He's a great programmer and a nice guy. I hope he's still involved
<br/>
with the GBA scene.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">actually and sadly Derek was involved with an accident.
<br/>
While he developed a new feature for the engine, he got soak
<br/>
into his screen - i.e into Yeti3d world, now he is fighting the monsters,
<br/>
and he is very sad he made the AI of the monsters too smart....
<br/>
we hope he'll get out of it....
<br/>
<br/>
:) :)
<br/>
<br/>
just kidding, he might be busy or something like that.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Tomer</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
