<br/>
Im using pixel font on the balloon which will be bobbing through out the game, its a side scrolling game. In this the fonts on balloon looks smugged as the balloon is bobbing, i dont want to remove bobbing in balloon  because without that it will not look good, so is there any ways to fix this either art wise or programmatically. If someone knows how to fix this Please reply me, Thanks in advance :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
