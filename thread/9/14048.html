    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wanted to ask that when you make a title for a game, do you start with Mode 3 for the title screen and then when the game starts, you switch to Mode 0 for tile mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It depends on 1. how much space you have in the ROM, 2. what kind of compression you're using for the title screen (as some compression schemes work better with some modes), and 3. what visual effects you are doing on the title screen. I've seen title screens that use mode 1, with most of the screen as a text background and the actual title as a rotation background so that it can zoom in and jiggle a bit once it appears.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're just going to do a static image for a title, then yes mode 3 or 4 would work fine. I actually recommend for GBA that you use 4, because if I recall correctly that will save you a lot of space. (Mode 4 is a 256 color palette image, whereas mode 3 is just a bitmap, which is rather huge.)
<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that you can still use sprites and such on these modes for motion. However, as tepples said, it really depends on how much you want your title screen to actually move.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've also just used mode 0.  There's enough tiles available to cover the screen with unique tiles.  Then I used sprites for anything "interesting" or dynamic.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
