It's true that special-purpose codecs are "not so easily" designed. But wouldn't it make sense to store one of many similar looking NPC houses as "house, a tiles wide, b tiles deep, painted in color scheme c", a wall as "south-facing wall, a tiles high, b tiles long, origin (x, y)", or a river or dirt path as a polygon, and then let the compositor decompress it into a 2D array of tiles? I can guess it'd allow for a much bigger map in the same amount of ROM space at the cost of a bit of loading time between map segments. Remember that keeping all other factors equal, it's a lot easier to get a 32 Mbit (4 MByte) game published than a 128 Mbit (16 MByte) game because the publisher of a smaller program incurs less replication cost from Nintendo. Therefore, compression is important in real-world designs.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
LZ77 is based on copying previous words in a moving window to next words. Because each map starts with a fresh window content, LZ77 doesn't exploit redundancies from one map to another. And because it isn't special-purpose, it doesn't exploit invariants in the game model. The LZSS implementations used in the Allegro library and in the GBA BIOS are LZ77 family algorithms.
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, LZ78 is a dictionary based method, and theoretically, multiple maps can use the same dictionary. Amortizing the size of the shared dictionary across multiple maps can exploit cross-map redundancies. The method I describe, naming attributes of multi-tile objects on the map and expanding them at runtime, feels like a two-dimensional LZ78. In addition, the "dictionary" analogy makes it easier for the map editor to "spell check" the levels that the user draws.
<br/>
<br/>
Remember that NES RPGs were 512 KB in size, and the size of graphics shouldn't more than quadruple (double color depth, double unique tiles) from the NES to the GBA. Do you think LZSS alone could have optimized all the maps of Super Mario Bros. down to just 10 KB or so?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
My RPG uses LZ77 on maps, which are broken into 16x16 tile blocks. The compression rate isn't incredible or anything, but it's certainly better than nothing. Mainly what it's good for is multi-layer maps, where the bottom layer is full of detail and doesn't compress well, but the upper layers are mostly transparent anyway, so they barely make any difference to the size as opposed to fully multiplying it. In that sense, RLE would work about as well, but LZ77 does get good enough rates to be worth using on the more complicated layers too.
<br/>
<br/>
Using a sort of level-scripting does seem to be the best in terms of compression, but I do wonder how you would go about designing a level editor for an RPG that way. Seems like it would take forever writing all the parametric object drawing bits with the number of different types of places in most SNES RPGs. Although it would be helpful for just designing levels to be able to draw out just the floor and have it calculate up all the walls and floor edges and such, and then specify detail objects here and there. I might have to try writing something like that sometime. Although it may be more time consuming than drawing the maps by hand...<br/>_________________<br/>___________

Some implementations of LZ78 use such a dynamic dictionary. However, other similar algorithms use a static dictionary. I might have been a bit loose in my application of the "LZ78" label, but its "dictionary" does seem like a good analogy to explicit dictionary-based compression.

Right, pixel and vector art are two very different approaches, and depending on what you are trying to do, one approach may be a very poor substitute for the other.
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I suspect that if you ask an artist which approach they prefer, they'll respond with...depends on what I'm doing.  If I need to paint, I'll use Photoshop (pixels).  If I'm doing an ad layout, I'll use Illustrator (vector based).

Honestly though, the game <span style="font-style: italic">looks</span> like it was extensively compressed, and much to the detriment of the levels.  The game is sufficiently old, repetitive, and simplistic that using it to 'sell' your opinion that the map storage techniques it uses are ideal for seemingly every kind of 2D side-scroller/top-down (you haven't stated otherwise) hardly seems relevant to any modern game.
<br/>
<br/>
To keep it fair, how about suggesting a game (new or old) with more complicated levels that uses the approach you have proposed.  Say, something on par with Lady Sia, Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion or Golden Sun, just to pick a couple of games off the top of my head.
<br/>

<br/>
Maybe, however, if we imagine a hypothetical situation that is slighly more complicated than what you have suggested (the real-word is rarely simple, right?), one where you have a game with cookie-cutter levels and it happily fits on a 4 MB cart...vs...a game that has levels that are much more varied and it just squeezes on a 8 MB cart...
<br/>
<br/>
..with all other factors being equal, which game will the publisher spring for?  
<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand, they have a game that may be more visually appealing and therefore more likely to be able to compete with other 'attractive' games out there.
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the production costs may be cheaper but the game may be much harder to sell.
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, if you are seeking a publisher, I'd suggest that answering the question yourself is probably not suitable and may actually be offensive to a publisher.  They will be the people funding your game, they will be taking the risk, and they would therefore want to carefully weigh all of the parameters of the product they will have to market, only one of which is cart size.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I know Zelda 1 used an object based system similar to the one I describe.
<br/>
<br/>
After a bit of research, it seems that <a class="postlink" href="http://home.comcast.net/~alanweiss3/dwedit/dwedit/html/screenshots.html" target="_blank">Dragon Warrior does indeed use a 2D array based system</a>. However, it's based on 16x16 pixel metatiles rather than 8x8 pixel tiles; most of the GBA tile editors are hardwired to work on 8x8 pixel tiles. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is based on 128x128 pixel(!) metatiles, and I can see how 128x128 pixel tiles would look almost like a dictionary based solution to some people.

I have a feeling that Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion store a door as "door, (x, y), access requires level A powerup or key-item B".

<br/>
(backpedal backpedal) OK, maybe I was too strong in my initial assertion. The point I was ultimately trying to get across is that actual map editors are rather domain-specific, and the constraints of each game dictate what should go into the map editor. A map editor that directly describes which hardware tile goes in which hardware space often doesn't map well onto a game's domain. Now I recognize that a 2D array based solution may work best for some domains, but please, map editor developers, don't hardwire your editors to 8x8 pixel tiles.
<br/>

Revised assertion:
<br/>
<br/>
WRONG IN MOST CASES: A game map editor that works directly in hardware tile space.

The block mappings for Sonic 2 (Genesis) are made up of 4 times 8x8 tiles putted together with different palette lines and different flip parameters into 16x16 tiles. Those 16x16 tiles are compressed with a format with an unknown name. Then these 16x16 tiles can use different flip parameters and are put together into 128x128 tiles which are yet again compressed with another format with an unknown name.

256 colors are only for lazy game designers. You have a lot of more choices to have 16 color tiles bcause you can use different palette lines. And I hope Nessie will make it so you can change the palette the tile is using. Most of the platform games from Japan uses this technique, and I want to use it too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Regarding using multiple palettes for a single tile, the export optimization will detect tiles that are using the same bit-pattern, but a different palette.
<br/>
<br/>
In other words, I just save the art as a different .bmp, then change the palette to the desired colors (without actually changing the base art).  
<br/>
<br/>
Then you just load this different 'tileset' into mapEd and paint away.
<br/>
<br/>
At export time, the tool should export the tile once... and each of the palettes used for that tile.  Naturally, the map BG data is also adjust to reflect the shared tile but the different palette.
<br/>
<br/>
I intentionally did it this way because I didn't want to clumsy up the mapEd interface any more than it already was.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if there are more mapEd questions, it might make sense to start up a different thread instead of hi-jacking this one?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Let's hi-jack it a little longer since it has been dead one day alread :P
<br/>
<br/>
mapED seems smart if it can find out the same bit pattern for multiple tiles. So I'm happy with that.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, one thing that you must fix is to make the editor so you can make new layers in customized size, and not just in percent of the main layer.
<br/>
<br/>
I have made a few tilesets with 16-colors that are used for the level layout, but also for the background. The background uses HBlank to scroll in a 3-d parallax way. I have an upper level background which will be replace with a cavern background when the main character enters a mine climbing down a hole. The forground will be in the way of the background so you can't see when the background is switched. This must be done because compression and upload time of the new background will probably take more than one frame to complete.
<br/>
The way of having this background swap will make the game more variable and funnier to play, but also funnier for me as a programmer to come up with the ideas. mapEd exports different palettes depending on how many tiles that was used, and that makes it impossible for me to do multiple backgrounds with the size of 256x256 and a level area of unknown (possible big) size, and still share the same tilesets and palettes.
<br/>
I don't know how long it would take for you to make it possible to have customized sizes of layers so I can do this. But I hope you will think about it at least.
<br/>
<br/>
My game has been delayed because of this. I don't want to use other map editors because they can't be compared with yours. I could do a lot of hacks to try to make my level structure possible with the current mapED but then I would be forced to make just one map, and never be able to edit it again, because it will be a different palette/tileset result when exported.

Wonderful to hear. I though my GBA programming day were over then those things stopped me from doing what I've always dreamed about. My big dream is not just to make a game like Mario, I want to make it more dynamically and deeper. I want the levels to be special, and not just the original 8x8 tile scrolling.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping me out! I'm very greatful</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
