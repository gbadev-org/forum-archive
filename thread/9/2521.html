    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA runs in different graphics modes depending on what the graphical requirements of the application are.
<br/>
<br/>
Three of them allow for multiple independent "layers" made up of tiles that are 8 pixels wide by 8 pixels tall. The other three permit direct access to the GBA's screen as an array of coloured pixels. (Obviously there are minor variations between what each of those modes are capable of, but that's the gist of them right there.)
<br/>
<br/>
Mode 7 is not an actual graphics mode on the GBA, but rather is a name coined for a hardware technique that can be used in Mode 1 or Mode 2 that allows for some pseudo-3D effects (basically to make a background layer appear as though it has perspective).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Rotozoom and floor plane perspective projection effects are often called "Mode 7" because the rot/scale mode on the Super NES hardware was actually numbered 7.
<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, part 3 of The PERN Project's tutorial explains the basics of rot/scale, part 4 explains how to apply it to affine backgrounds, and part 5 shows you how to use DMA. The "Examples" section contains source code for floor plane perspective projection, under "Tutor Day 5".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
