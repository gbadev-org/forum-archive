    <h4>#48628 - gauauu - Thu Jul 21, 2005 9:47 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been working on a 2d top-down action/adventure game, not so unlike <span style="font-style: italic">The Legend of Zelda</span> or <span style="font-style: italic">Crystalis</span>.   Now I'm at graphics time.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm curious if anyone knows of any good places to get some free "stock" tilesets for games like this.  I've been using stuff from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.reinerstileset.4players.de:1059/englisch.htm" target="_blank">Reiner's tilesets</a>, which is awesome stuff, but most of his tiles are for an isometric view, at something like a 4:3 ratio, which makes it a little harder to work with.  (In the past, I've resized the tiles to square, and then used them to make a fake iso view.  But it's not a great solution)
<br/>
<br/>
Are there other places with cool great resources like this?
<br/>
<br/>
Or, I guess I could post this in the help wanted section and see if anyone wanted to make some art for me, but since I'm sortof hacking this project together as I go, I'm doubting I'd get a quality artist on board.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unfortunately, most of everything I've found on those sites is Final-fantasy wannabe art.   Not bad, but not really what I was going for.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes Reiner's TileSet's from what I have seen seems like they have a lot of really good artwork for Iso style RTS games... but then again I only looked over the site for a minute or so.  Good quality though, I am impressed.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for some really good Dragon Quest/Final Fantasy artwork that is of the quality of GoldenSun, which IMHO had awesome graphics for the GBA.  I had outsourced a really good friend of mine who was going to University for a Game Art Degree, but she ended up being too busy with her studies to complete the project.  Oh, well someday I will be able to afford to actually hire a good artist!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think you should use original tiles in the end though.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
