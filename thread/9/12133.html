<br/>
<br/>
i have been kind of looking for a map editor for the gba, to make continuously scrolling maps. gbadev seems to have tons, but most are really not that good. The beginners faq is not very specific either, and searching "best map editor" will give you lots of entries.
<br/>
So, can anybody please give me a hint which map editor out there is really good. I'd like to create big maps, and I would it to be good with tilesets (i.e. allow tilesets that dont only rely on 8x8 tiles).
<br/>
thanksinadvance

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been using <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tilemap.co.uk/mappy.php" target="_blank">Mappy</a> and found that it's pretty good.  There's a few things it doesn't do well that I wish it did (I don't like its exporter, and it doesn't do tile-flipping the way I want it to), but I always end up using <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbadev.org/tools.php?showinfo=154" target="_blank">fmp2gba</a> in my build process for the export part of things.  For the most part, it works well and doesn't get in my way.

<br/>
I'm not going to say it's the best, but it's the best that I've found for my purposes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
