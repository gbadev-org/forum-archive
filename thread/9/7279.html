    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How do you do the (yes cheap, but useful) fading effect of images commonly used at the start of games for logos and such? It seems simple, but I get the feeling it's either a piece of the programming puzzle I don't have (ate it accidentaly in my cereal) or it's something you learn w/ expirience.
<br/>
<br/>
It seems like there should be an easy way to alpha blend your image with a black image to produce the effect. However, I do not know the math required to do this. Is there a simple way?<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Or the blend register.
<br/>
Palette fading is harder to do, and takes a lot more CPU time. It's good for when you're already using the blend register for alpha blending, or if you only want to fade one thing like to make a sprite flash.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The easiest way would be to use the <a class="postlink" href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/tonc/gfx.htm#sec-blend" target="_blank">hardware fading</a> registers. Blend mode 3 (well, 3&lt;&lt;6) would fade to black.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're already using the fading registers for something else, you'll have to use palette fading. Ther are many ways to do this, but the easiest would be to do a linear interpolation (you know lines? y= a*x+b) from the current color component values down to 0.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Am I correct in guessing that it stores the specified number to the specified bit? (and if so, which is which?)
<br/>
<br/>
Does this mean that I can simply write a while loop that changes the blending register so often every frame to produce the effect? If so, what are the max/min values of the register?<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

Bit-shift operators. Part of <a class="postlink" href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/tonc/numbers.htm#sec-bitops" target="_blank">Bit operations</a>, a class of the elementary set of C operators. Does anyone have a link to a "C for programmers" tutorial or something? I've seen other people have difficulty with some C-specific constructs as well.

<br/>
Something like that, yeah. Min/max values are at the links given earlier. (it's 17 btw. Well, 0 to 1 in 1.4 fixed point notation, that's 17 steps total). You'll have to divide by the number of steps you have. Or multiply with its reciprocal because division is slow on the GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
