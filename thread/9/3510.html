    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi
<br/>
<br/>
I need some help. iam trying to do a platform game..
<br/>
I want to use 4 backgrounds so Displaymode0 is my choice.
<br/>
The biggest hardware map in mode0 (as I suppose you already know) is 512x512 or 64x64 tiles... But i want to create bigger levels but how?
<br/>
I've tried the technic: when the player step in to a new tile column or row copy the whole screen, the mapentries of course (with DMA). But it doesn't run smoothly.
<br/>
Plz Help
<br/>
<br/>
hope you understand my english</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
