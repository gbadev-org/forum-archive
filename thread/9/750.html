<br/>
<br/>
How the zooming works on a hardware? I mean is it simple pixel resize, or something more complex (bilinear, bicubic ?).
<br/>
I dont have a hardware(to check it), but in my game I want to scale background and just wonder how many pixels do I lose....
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You know how MS Paint kind of just cuts out some pixels, or repeats some to scale things? It's like that. Not very pretty, but at least it's done by hardware. And actually it usually looks perfectly fine on such a small screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">... so it's just a pixel resize?
<br/>
when I put a horizontal line, I just miss it during zooming?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yep, that's pretty much it! What you can do however to improve quality a bit is to use a large sprite/map and only shrink it. You still don't have nice (ie. bilinear) filtering, but at least you don't get the blocky pixels!
<br/>
<br/>
(Offcourse, it does take up more VRAM!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
