    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dear all, i have a question on mode 4 of display a background and sprite with priority. When i set the priority of my sprites to 0,they can be see on the bg pic, but if set above 0 then they didnt appear. so i would like to ask if there is some method to set the priority of the bg image so that the sprites can be see.thank you for answering me^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You said setting the sprites' priority to 0 worked for you to get your sprites to appear. So what's your actual problem? If you care about sprite-to-sprite priorities, put frontmost sprites first in OAM. If you want the background to half-cover a sprite, you can't do that on the GBA in bitmap modes without using object window voodoo.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've come across a problem like that before. If you are using the previous sprite to determine what character data you are going to set then you will need to mask the priority otherwise it will take the priority of the other one as well. I'm sure you know that but I thought I might point it out.
<br/>
<br/>
This is how I did mine. I'm sure there are better methods but I'm no GBA expert.
<br/>
<br/>
sprites[1].attribute0= COLOR_256 | SQUARE | 3;
<br/>
sprites[1].attribute1= SIZE_8 | 3;
<br/>
sprites[1].attribute2= 0;
<br/>
sprites[1].attribute2=  ((sprites[0].attribute2 &amp; 0x01FF)+32) | PRIORITY(0);
<br/>
<br/>
Don't foget to set background priorities as well. I've used this code with mode zero so I don't know about mode 4.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
