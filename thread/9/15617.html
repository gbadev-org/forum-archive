    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi folks!
<br/>
<br/>
i was testing a lot of map editors out there, but unfortunately none seemed to be any good.
<br/>
either there were problems with controls, missing imperative features, exporting / handling data or you know what.
<br/>
<br/>
so, is there any decent (free) map editor out there?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks! :^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, i'd like a map editor, that can export raw binary data, without breaking the map and tile set or palettes (the latter two come in two flavours, on load / import and on save / export.)
<br/>
<br/>
secondly, it should be an editor that can produce any size tiled maps, that can be (without too much work spent on programmer side with converting etc.) used in projects targeting the gba or, in my case, the nds.
<br/>
<br/>
another feature is "brush" handling. i find it way better to "draw" rectangles over a tileset to select a tile brush, but in some editors you have to pick each tile individually. that should be an optional feature, imo.
<br/>
<br/>
well, then there's the user interface. what the heck is a fully feature packed editor good for, when you can't even *scroll* the map inside the editing area?
<br/>
<br/>
entity / sprite placement would be an optional feature.
<br/>
<br/>
ps: i should have posted this in the origial post, but i was short on time and i was also hoping that someone would simply pop up and make a recommendation.

<br/>
What would a map editor have to do with palettes, unless you are specifically editing a screen-size map for a non-scrolling screen? Every professional scrolling game engine that I've analyzed stores an abstract map of "metatiles", either as a grid (e.g. Rush 'n' Attack, Sonic, Pokemon) or as a list of object definitions (e.g. Mario), and then the game engine generates the hardware tile display and the collision map from that.

<br/>
Because the game engine "converts" a metatile map to a hardware map at runtime, I don't see exactly how a map editor would depend on the target platform's hardware.

In fact, in some game engines such as the 8- and 16-bit Super Mario games, everything is an "entity" (that is, a tuple of x, y, and what), including background objects such as platforms.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <h4>#157880 - silent_code - Sat May 31, 2008 4:27 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, i need to be a bit more specific, as i realize, you (and probably others, too) don't fully understand my "needs". :^/
<br/>
<br/>
raw binary data is not a "format" in a strict way, but it is still a way to output arbitrary raw binary data to a file. that data itself would have a certain format, which in my case, *could* be something close to the nds'/gba's hardware maps.
<br/>
even if it was just saving meta data to a proprietary and sufficiently documented file format (a real one this time), everything was fine.
<br/>
<br/>
BUT: most editors i have tried, tend to export to source code files, which we all know... stinks.
<br/>
all i need is a stream of binary tile numbers in a binary file, that's it.
<br/>
<br/>
those editors, that had the export functionality i am looking for, had insufficient editing capabilities (e.g. see below... let's just leave it at that right now.)
<br/>
<br/>
if i just threw all the good aspects of each editor together, it would yield a really decent one! but unfortunately, i don't have the time to create my own editor.
<br/>
<br/>
what i mean by tile brush (and i think this is a common term) is a set of one or multiple tiles, which form a meta tile, which one can "draw" onto the map, usually by clicking onto a tile in the editing area.
<br/>
<br/>
example: imagine you want to have "closed door structures" in your map, each made of 2x3 8x8 pixel tiles. instead of setting all the individual tiles of the door, some editors allow you to specify all the 2x3 tiles used by the door and set them all together.
<br/>
<br/>
right now, i'm feeling like describing a map editor basics rather than requesting a recommendation (and i know you, tepples, don't need that explained) ... but, well, it's ok. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so, i would like to have access to some remotely usable editor to create data with, that i can then use with my code. that would involve meta tiling etc., yes, but i don't want to resolve to any desperate map editing voodoo.
<br/>
<br/>
Cearn had his Mirach editor on his page once, but it's gone and unfortunately, as much as i like Usenti, which i use for non tiled graphics and tile sets, Mirach was not meant to be a "feature complete" editor and i can't use it (although i'd like to.)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
about entities: yes, it's kind of a generic / subjectively defined term, but what i mean is anything that can move indipendently from the "map" or does some special things (like triggers). for those "entities", all i would need is to be able to set it's position with a certain tile (there would be a special one for each entity type) on a special "entity layer".
<br/>
but again, that is optional. it can be done in any editor that supports multiple tilesets and does not limit the number of "layers" a map can have.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so, what that clear enough? i'm kind of tired right now, as we're having guests that stay over night... not cool.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

Or you could just define one tile that represents "closed door", and then have the game engine expand it to all the tiles that make up the image of a door so that you don't have redundant information for every door. That's what Super Mario Bros. does, that's what Animal Crossing: Wild World does, and that's what Super Smash Bros. Brawl does.

Actually, I did need that explained. The only "map editors" that I've used have been SHMANSi (an app to edit colored ASCII art), SnowBro's NSA (DOS-based title screen editor for NES games), my own 8name (a clone of NSA that runs better on 32-bit Windows), AnimalMap from that Aibo hacker, and the stage builder of Nintendo's Super Smash Bros.

as i explained earlier, i don't have the time to make one myself, and the project isn't really that big, to make it worthwhile.

i guess i'll have to wait and see how things get along and maybe there will be some spare time to be dedicated to creating a map editor for my needs. it's a pity though, that with so much great home brew for the gba, there are no "good" tools available to the public (at least i didn't find them.) :^(

Super Mario World defines a wall structure as an object with a texture, height, and width. SMB and SMW maps are more like SVG than like PNG, and their editors are more like Inkscape than like GIMP. In Sonic 2 for Sega Genesis, the metatiles are 128 pixels by 128 pixels, allowing a large wall to be built up out of a couple structures.

Sometimes, you can use a similar map editor for a 2D overhead-view game and a 3D game: look at how Wolfenstein 3D level maps are structured, and look at how Animal Crossing: Wild World town maps are structured.

You define some IO scripts to get the binary file in the format you want, so this should work well for what you need.

As for the features that you don't need. The modules that you see in that demo are written as plugins and you will be able to turn on/off the features you want for your project type (project type being a configuration specfic to your game). Also you could write new modules to be able to configure data that is missing from the UI.
<br/>
<br/>

as you said it is written in java, it is using simple swing for the UI.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I actually haven't installed any of the game makers out there yet to do a compare but they are fundamentally different.
<br/>
<br/>
The tool that I'm building has no game engine behind it, and everything you see in the demo is customized to a game engine I'm writing for a specific game. That maybe a subtile difference to some but it is a big design for me as i built it out. If I wanted to I could build a generic game engine, then customize the editor for that specfic game engine, package that up and call it a game maker studio but that isn't my target audience. I want to create a tool for programmers to use with their code, not a tool for artists who wants to build a shareware game.
<br/>
<br/>
I like to think of my editor as a big metadata editor for games with some visual feedback.

Yeah java's use of the layout classes are a pain. basically to get nice looking layouts you need to master nesting them. I use a combination of border, flow, grid all nested to get the look/layout i'm going for.
<br/>
<br/>
 I use netbeans ide for my development they came up with a new layout (which i think is being adopted by swing) for laying out dialogs and such more naturally in a wysiwyg gui editor. <a href="https://swing-layout.dev.java.net/" target="_blank">https://swing-layout.dev.java.net/</a>

Backed up a bit and watched all of the videos you have up.  Very impressive.  I partcularly like the dynamic brush feature as i have had a similar feature in mind for a while now.  I also really like your chat editor and sprite animation builder.
<br/>
<br/>
The ability to organize your boards by draging them around and relating them to each other is also something i have been considering.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be interesting to see how you handle multiple layers of background.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it difficult to define new types of sprites?  
<br/>
<br/>
Is your tilesize fixed?
<br/>
<br/>
Is your brush tool multilayer?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, i don't know exactly what you mean by background layer. You can add multiple layers in the layer editor. Think of that as a high level layer a direct corrilation to the layers in your tiled game. Under that i have what i consider editing layers. In those you can also have multiple layers as you can tell in the vidoes i use different layers for containing all of the sprites or brushes but they can also contain multiple simple tile layers you can use the to make editing easier.

<br/>
The types for everything (sprites, chats, regions...) are all configurable thru a config xml file. They all share a common base so every thing that is editable can have multiple types associated with it. If you had different types of tilesets or boards you could add that to the config file.

Nope, you can also have non square tiles (although i haven't tested that in awhile). I plan on adding iso/hex tiles at some point in the future also.

Awesome...is this going to be available at some point to the general public (free or at a price) or is it an internal tool?
<br/>

I am only working on mine for lack of a decent general purpose tile editor and it appears yours may meet my original design goals (meaning i can stop mine :)

Well, a free version with most of the features (and a not for profit usage stipulation) would be great but i would not mind paying a small bit for such a tool.  Money tends to keep the motivation level up ;)
<br/>
<br/>
If i were doing commercial work I would be willing to pay a good deal more than "a bit" for your product if it reaches the level your demo videos forshadow.  Not sure if others would feel the same though as 2D map making is not a huge market these days.
