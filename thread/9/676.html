    <h4>#3499 - bphallad - Wed Feb 26, 2003 6:01 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought I read somewhere that each sprite image can have its own 16-color palette. Is this true?
<br/>
<br/>
If so, then would it be possible to have 100 different sprites onscreen with 100 different 16-color palettes even in 256-color display mode?
<br/>
<br/>
Would someone please clarify this? I need to begin work on some sprites soon.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In 16-color mode, there are 16 16-color palettes.  Each sprite can use one of these palettes, thus in total you still have a total of 256 colors.  The advantage to using 16-color sprites is that they take up half the space in memory, compared to 256-color sprites, so they are quicker to copy and smaller to store.<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
