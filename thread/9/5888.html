    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have 24-bit bitmaps that are tiles from existing GBA games (i ripped them).
<br/>
Every bmp -&gt; c/h/tile program requires that the image is in a 256 color format, but when i convert the picture, it looks like poo.
<br/>
<br/>
is there a way i can take my existing bmps and port them straight to tiles, without having to convert them to 256 colors?
<br/>
<br/>
should i convert it to another format, not 256 bmp (pcx, gif, etc).
<br/>
<br/>
thanks

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, you'll have to convert to 8-bit at some point. If there are no sprites in the tiles (you can turn sprites off in VBA to be sure that what you're getting is BGs only), and no blending going on, they should be able to convert to 256 colors perfectly. Try <a class="postlink" href="http://www.humanbalance.net/gale/us/" target="_blank">GraphicsGale</a>, it can tell you how many colors there are in the image, and will convert perfectly to 8-bit if there are 256 or less.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

well i ripped tiles from Link To The Past. they were direct screenshots from the game. when i saved them as 8 bit, they looked completely different. LTTP definately has tiles and sprites, so how did they do it?

The GBA has a minimum of 512 displayable colours: 256 for backgrounds and 256 for sprites. If you take a screencap of a game in action that uses both and try to reduce it to 256 colours (8-bit), it won't work.
<br/>
<br/>
Better to open the game in a program like VBA and use its tile viewer to get to the tileset directly.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the images that i was converting to 8 bit had no sprites. they were purely background tiles. 
<br/>
<br/>
what im wondering is how in the world they got such detailed tiles using only the 256 colors. 
<br/>
those exact tiles, when saved in 8bit, look completely different. 
<br/>
maybe they used a different palette for every tile?
<br/>
<br/>
uber-confused cause my tiles look like shit

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. Make sure that your emulator isn't using any fancy display modes to antialias the edges or anything.
<br/>
<br/>
2. There are other ways the GBA generates additional colours outside of its gamut, such as through alpha blending.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Just use the tileviewer already.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">wow that makes sense.
<br/>
<br/>
so the paint 256 palette is already set, so it causes colors outside its range to change to colors in its palette.
<br/>
<br/>
ure saying photoshop, however, can use a different palette to contain all the colors in the screenshot.
<br/>
<br/>
are there any other programs (preferably free) other than photoshop i can use; i dont want to buy photoshop
<br/>
<br/>
also, in mode 0-3, are tiles 8x8 or 16x16?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks so much, chris g</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

8x8 (that is, in mode 0-2. mode 3 is a 15-bit linear bitmap)<br/>_________________<br/>___________
