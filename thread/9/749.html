    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well the question you ask is rather broad. Your best bet would be to simply practice. Start by ripping or finding good originals from commercial games that feature what you like, and try to see how they were done, looking at style, proportions, color usage, etc. There is also a forum called pixelation.swoo.net that has a userbase of many pixelers. Finally, you can go to EFnet and join #gameart, people there may be willing to help you. HTH
