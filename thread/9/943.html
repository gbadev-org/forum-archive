    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have the following problem:
<br/>
<br/>
I have two sprites, one is sprite1 = priority 0 the other one sprite2 = priority 2. Additionally i have a priority 1 Background layer. sprite1 has transparency.
<br/>
<br/>
The odd thing is that if sprite2 moves to the coordinates of sprite1 you can see sprite2 though it should be covered by the Background layer.
<br/>
<br/>
Is that a normal behaviour? Are there any flags to correct that?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
This effect can only occours on original hardware and not on emulator.<br/>_________________<br/>To this day, many C programmers believe that "strong typing" just means pounding extra hard on the keyboard.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That is normal behaviour on a real GBA, none of the emulators seem to have it down yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, the trick is <span style="font-style: italic">don't use the "priority" flag to determine sprite to sprite priority</span> - only use that for sprite to bg priority. Use the index in the sprite list to set your sprite to sprite z value, index 0 has higher priority than index 127.
<br/>
<br/>
Also you can't have sprite to sprite alpha blending, when an ab'd sprite goes over a non ab'd one, the one underneath won't show through as you might imagine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
