    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As a suggestions, try to tone down the brightness of the green for the grass - it's awfully hard on the eyes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would also suggest a darker grass color... I think it'd be better with a tileing green pattern, rather than just solid green as well.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd suggest testing it on a real gba before altering colours, they tend to become a lot darker, but that green IS a bit bright ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You'll want to add a bit more shading and texture to the grass and to the sprites.  Try to draw your graphics in the style of the great overhead adventures and RPGs on the Super NES platform (think FF4, FF6, Zelda, Mana, Chrono Trigger, etc) as well as Wild ARMs[1] for PS1.
<br/>
<br/>
[1] If a game running on a MIPS architecture based PS1 is called "Wild <a class="postlink" href="http://www.arm.com/" target="_blank">ARM</a>s", then can a game running on an ARM architecture based GBA be called "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.sparc.com/" target="_blank">Sparc</a> of Life"?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">zelda uses a solid green color for its grass tiles but then it has seperate tiles that help to add texture, like a flower tile and simple plant tiles.  I like the zelda graphics style because it's simple but very stylish and looks good.<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
