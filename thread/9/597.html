    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I have a problem when making my own graphics that the colors always turn out darker than i expected on the real hardware. I'm not sure how to aproach this. Should i just make the graphics so they look good on my pc and then lighten everything? or should i start with a premade bright pallete to make my graphics with? any other suggestions?
<br/>
thanks
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How do you mean 'darker than I expected'? Are you using a gamma value? The GBA's screen is quite dark; try setting it to a completely white screen and you'll see what I mean. The best solution would be to make them look nice on your PC and then find an appropriate gamma and batch-process all of your images from there to lighten them--trying to make them lighter on the PC will give you no end of fiddling.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>_________________<br/>(Works for me!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have noticed that the gba screen is quite dark. that is what I am trying to work around. what is the difference between lightness and gama level?
<br/>
if i want to increase the gama level of my pallete in photoshop what would i do?
<br/>
thanks :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Then you change 1.00 to whatever, i.e. 2.00 for twice as bright.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Now that I think of it, probably it'll save you a lot of hassle in the long run to code a palette correction routine into your game; lots of games these days seem to be giving the user the choice of how washed-out or dark they want to view the screen for varying light conditions--in this case, you wouldn't have to manually apply filters for every single picture, and if you change your mind later you can just change the default value of the correction routine.<br/>_________________<br/>(Works for me!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Perhaps it goes without saying, but if you are going to run a batch process on all of your image files to gamma correct them, you'd be wise have a setup where you have two folders....
<br/>
<br/>
folder one is for un-gamma corrected images--for the most part all art tweaks should be made on the originals stored here.
<br/>
<br/>
folder two is the destination folder for the gamma corrected images.  Your game will, of course, use these images.
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, <span style="font-style: italic">should</span> be obvious, but...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Expanding on Nessie's comment:
<br/>
<br/>
I add palette gamma correction to my BMP to tile converter.  Thus, the original .png artwork stays in sRGB (gamma = 2.2), but when the tool writes the palette, it writes it in GBA RGB (gamma closer to 4).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right, the point is to always have the original source data (for whatever) around.  
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know, it's probably dead obvious, but then again, we found out that some of our artists at work were taking .jpegs (we convert most of our .tga, .png images to .jpeg to save CD space in the final game build) out of the "already processed" folder, modifying them, then saving them back out to the "original" folder in .png format!
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you could see that a few iterations of converting between lossy and loss-less formats causes the source art to slowly degrade in quality.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
