    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you familiar with palettes stored in certain image types? If not, heres the run down. Certain types of images (PCX in this case) save a 256 color palette with their images. The image then uses only the colors in the palette. The GBA uses the same thing. I noticed you're using the pong tutorial, so he assumes you use your sprites in 256 color mode, making thiings a little easier. The first image you make has a set palette, and that is loaded. Every image after that uses the same palette untill you load a new one.
<br/>
<br/>
What does this all mean? In photoshop, you should open a PCX image. Go to image&gt;&gt;mode&gt;&gt;Color Table (I think) aand there is the palette for the image. This is what to do. Change the last color in the image to whatever you want your transparent color to be. Then, when editing, use that exact color and photoshop will figure it out and make it the last one in the palette. (One easy way to do this is to save the palette in the color table and then load it into your swatch.)
<br/>
<br/>
What they were talking about earlier with the palette being reversed is that Adobe does indeed reverse the palette on save. This means that the last color becomes the first, the GBA recognises is as transparent, and you are a happy fellow.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Over your head a little? Got it? <span style="font-style: italic">Not using photoshop?</span> Let me know and I can help further.
<br/>
<br/>
There is a nice little tool on the TONC website called utensi that can do about the same thing, much easier. Note that it does not reverse the palette, so the first would be transparent, not the last. If you use this to save the PCX, you can then run it through pcx2sprite like the tutorial wants.
<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck! Pardon any typos...<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

Transparency isn't something govered by the colors, but by pa<span style="font-weight: bold">l</span>e<span style="font-weight: bold">tt</span>e index. Pixels with value 0 are always transparent, so the pixels you want to be transparent should be using palette index 0. If this is not the case in your current bitmaps, you need to change the bitmaps accordingly. This is why it's important to have an editor that allows palette manipulation and doesn't rearrange the palette on saving.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
