    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A standard tile editor such as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/pc/#ted" target="_blank">8TED</a> can hack the sprite cels in any NES, Game Boy, Super NES, or GBA game that uses an uncompressed tile format.
<br/>
<br/>
As for compressed tiles, some NES and Super NES games are so beloved that fans have written unpackers and packers to make each game's tiles editable to facilitate "total conversions" of the game's engine. I don't seem to know of as much of a ROM hacking community centered around the GBA given that 1. GBA games are on average 8 times bigger than Super NES games and 2. the perceived quality ratio isn't as high on the GBA as it was on the Super NES.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
