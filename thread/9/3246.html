I don't think it saves .gifs anyway, but I have heard that the GIMP is like the best free graphics editor you will find.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because U.S. Patent 4,558,302 (Unisys's LZW patent) has expired in the United States, the GIMP 2 binaries now ship with GIF support.
<br/>
<br/>
Or use a different converter program that can grab sprite cels from a different file format.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My favorite is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tempest-j.com/gale/e/" target="_blank">GraphicsGale</a>, which does support GIF, but it's shareware and cuts the GIF support after 20 days or something. Still, it's awesome for low-color artwork, and you could convert to GIF with GIMP or something. Or get a better GBA converter program that can do bitmaps :-P<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

Eh? I thought Photoshop Elements was <a class="postlink" href="http://www.adobe.com/store/products/master.jhtml?id=catPhotoshopElements" target="_blank">$100</a>, roughly in the same price range as Paint Shop Pro (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.jasc.com/products/paintshoppro/?" target="_blank">$100</a>).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

True, but since Paint Shop Pro is Jasc's main product, I would think that they would try to create the perfect image editor since it is the highest generator of profits for the company. Elements is just Photoshop for cheap people to Adobe. They make 1/7 the money per copy and really don't remove 6/7 of the features.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">this is true elements is not as good as paint shop pro. but full photoshop is amazing (and should be at $600) i use it in college.
<br/>
<br/>
paint shop pro also comes with animation shop if you buy it boxed which is great for gifs etc.
<br/>
<br/>
but then gimp2 is good too so you may as well try it (i have an issue with my tablet so i dont use it) you might find you hate the interface too i do.
<br/>
<br/>
but cant knock it cos its free. if your used too mspaint gimp will be a godsend.<br/>_________________<br/>i cant program but i make a mean piece of toast.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
