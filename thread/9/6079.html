    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Which is the best tool to convert a bmp-image into sprites? I've tried some in the tool-section, like bmp3spr but the result was very uggly and didnt work (and it's not because of my code). I would like to have a sprite-converter where I can choose what color to be transpararent and all that. Any suggestions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Obviously it's not for bitmaps, but I find gifs2sprites v1.0 in the tools section quite good. You can select the transparancy etc. I dunno, it just seemed easy to use. Unfortunately I think it only outputs .h files and not raw.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It supports images larger than 64x64.  It just gives this warning so you know that sprites can be no larger than 64x64 pixels.  Just ignore this error and move on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
