<br/>
but all square ones....
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to make a game where the user can buy a terrain and buy a house and make the house bigger and bigger adding trees, roads, whetever, but I need a tileset because I suck at design :( and I know you might have some extra tilesets
<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather castlevania (I mean gothic) styles.
<br/>
<br/>
if someone is able to help me, I'll be really appreciated...
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance<br/>_________________<br/>All human wisdom is summed up in these two words, - 'Wait and hope"

Are you trying to clone SimCity, SimTown, Sims, Animal Crossing, or Harvest Moon?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can you post a list of tiles that you need?
<br/>
<br/>
Or better yet, mock up a complete set of tiles that demonstrates what you're after (even if the art sucks.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm just trying to give my players more options...in fact this is not gba game...but the idea of using tiles come to my mind as I used to code a lot for the GBA...
<br/>
<br/>
the idea is that you have a 8x8 tile and you can put a house, a road, a tree, a fence...etc...and dinamically build your terrain :P
<br/>
<br/>
but I just suck at design...lemme do my horrible tiles and maybe you can help me polishing them :P<br/>_________________<br/>All human wisdom is summed up in these two words, - 'Wait and hope"
