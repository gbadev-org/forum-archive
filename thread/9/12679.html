bdf is a 1 bit bitmapped font format.  Anti-aliasing is a software feature.  This question is like asking if plates support washing.  Yes, plates can be washed, but they don't provide any built in facilities for it.  (Yes, bdf fonts can be anti-aliased, but they don't provide any built in facilities for it.)
<br/>
<br/>
Poor man's anti-aliasing:
<br/>
Shift bitmap up one pixel, blit in midtone.  Shift right and blit.  Shift down and blit.  Shift left and blit.  (Midtone outline.)  Do not shift, blit in normal color.  You can preprocess/optimize as much of this as you want to.  (Masks and multiplies are an optimization.)
<br/>
<br/>
I say midtone because you may be using a dark font, or a light font.  You may even want to use black and white.  I actually like white text with a black outline.

In the case of bitmaps, it's also a feature of the data set. Sure, downsampling a 1-bit bitmap font into an alphascale font works, but if the 1-bit font isn't <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_hinting" target="_blank">hinted</a>, the result won't be the clearest.

Per Glyph: bitmap, width.

<br/>
You will need some way to hook code points to special characters.  Newline, formfeed, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
You might consider taking a user defined code point to font index funtion.  It could return negative values to indicate newline and friends.  (Naturally, they should be hidden behind macros like LIBPREFIX_NEWLINE.)

<br/>
Yes.  If I were you, I would have 2 values- bitmap height (8, 16, 32) and font height.  Bitmap height affects VRAM usage.  Glyphs should be positioned in the upper lefthand corner of the bitmap.  The next line starts (font_height + v_spacing) pixels down.  The next character starts (glyph_width + h_spacing) to the right.

<br/>
4 bit sprites?  Sprites are a fantastic way to display text.  They make character positioning easy.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You could recycle sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
Version 3 or so should probably support antialiasing and/or font outlines.  I would write the initial library with this in mind.
<br/>
<br/>
Version 5 or so might want to support dropping user defined sprites in the middle of the text.
<br/>
"Look for a person that looks like (face icon).
<br/>
He will give you (lamp icon)."
<br/>
A user defined function could be responsible for reporting these items (return LIBPREFIX_ICON(3)).  The user would have to figure out how to encode everything to make it work happily with the library.

My text engine uses a background, as a lot of the time, there will be a character name, four lines of dialogue, and up to four responses. Currently, the default font in my engine has a total height of 12 pixels: 2 for diacritics, 2 for ascenders, 6 for x-height, and 2 for descenders. Then it's set on 14 pixel line height, which is easy because it uses column-major tile ordering, where each 8-pixel-wide column of tiles is a contiguous pixel map.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Basically everyone is using proportional fonts these days.  Even translated ROMs use proportional font systems.  I can't really see fixed width being all that useful for anyone who want to make production quality software.
<br/>
<br/>
I can see a few ways of doing things.
<br/>
<br/>
Text scrolls off the end of the screen unless the data contains newlines:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">setCursor(x, y);¬† // (x, y + vofs) after newline
<br/>
print(string);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Text autowraps.  User newlines might be needed to make things look prettier.  Data will scroll off of the end of the screen if it is too long.
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">setCursor(x, y, w);¬† // as above with autowrap
<br/>
print(string);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Text autowraps and requires automatic keypress to advance.
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">setCursor(x, y, w, h);¬† // as above with autowrap
<br/>
print(string);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Game related control codes include "wait for user input" and "delay output".  Delay may or may not want to be fancy.  One control code is probably enough if the delay time can be changed using a library function.  Delay can be used to do things like this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">Was that a joke?
<br/>
[delay].[delay].[delay].
<br/>
[delay]Oh, now I get it.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Formfeed clears the screen.  It is very useful.
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">Only you can prevent forest fires.
<br/>
[userinput][formfeed]...wait...
<br/>
[userinput][formfeed]So can I![newline]
<br/>
Everyone can prevent forest fires!</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Formfeed probably wants to automatically call userinput.  I can't see using it without user input, but I can see requiring user input without clearing the screen:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">One[userinput], two[userinput], three[userinput]...[userinput][newline]
<br/>
I don't see four orbs.¬† What are you trying to pull?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT:</span>  I would not have the library directly poll for user input.  The user program is perfectly capable of figuring out what user input is.  It can then call some sort of a gotUserInput() function.  I would probably include an isTextOnScreen() query function.

If you don't implent a vertical display region, undefined bahavior happens.  The system just tries to write off the bottom of the screen.  Nothing much happens if you drop sprites off the bottom of the screen.  At any rate, it is a bug and will need to be fixed before the program "ships".

One useful feature I have in my text render function is a "clear width" parameter. Basically it draws the string, and then clears any space after it, up to the clear width. With that, you generally don't have to explicitly clear anything. Just redraw the string and it will take care of the leftover garbage if the old string was longer.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

does vertical text have variable width, height?
<br/>
<br/>
so far:
<br/>
text is written in text boxes. text boxes either live in bg or on sprites. in order to write text one has to specify a font. a 'font' specifies
<br/>
-font name (?)
<br/>
-the writing direction (or xOffset,yOffset - width and height are reversed in the following if writing direction vertical?)
<br/>
-the height of the characters
<br/>
-whether its fixed width
<br/>
-the width of characters
<br/>
-the height offsets
<br/>
-the palette for character bitmpas? (16 colors?)
<br/>
-the interval of allowed character indizes
<br/>
-the list of characters (maybe in implementation an array of offsets)
<br/>
<br/>
a 'character' with a given index specifies
<br/>
- the associated bitmap
<br/>
- bpp, index (or should this be global?)
<br/>
- the width
<br/>
- whether its a control character, specified together with options (or specifying that the options should be read like arguments following the control character in the text), which there could be the following
<br/>
-- word separater (i.e. space - simply to know where to break text for newline) - specifying when it gets printed
<br/>
-- new line
<br/>
-- 'delay' - with specified 'n' vblanks (?)
<br/>
-- scroll a character height (immediately/slow)
<br/>
-- delete screen ('form feed'?)
<br/>
-- callback/callback with string return to print
<br/>
-- simply functions of the text engine itself?
<br/>
-- tab -- why?
<br/>
-- userinput -- on gba? how?
<br/>
<br/>
its probably useful to have callbacks sit in some array, which has to get initialized during runtime. also, it would probably make sense to try to make callbacks safe so that the callback function itself can access the text engine (no?). would it be useful to be able to useful multiple fonts at once?
<br/>
functions
<br/>
initialize (options - autowrap..)
<br/>
create, delete text box
<br/>
set/move/get cursor position - in pixels
<br/>
set/move cursor position - in line,column
<br/>
print (returns width printed)
<br/>
clear (either a width in pixels, or some string)
<br/>
scroll (wole line, pixels, instant, slow)
<br/>
clear text box
<br/>
move text box
<br/>
hide/show box
<br/>
set palette (?)
<br/>
set callback
<br/>
<br/>
would one want to draw anything besides text?
<br/>
what about text color?
<br/>
would it make sense on such a limited system as the gba to assume that every possible font has a character set with 8 bit indizes?
<br/>
i guess that if the texbox lives in the same space as some other graphics (i.e. a sprite that specifies the background of an 'ok' dialog), then it should be possible to speciy a transparent background color blit.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would try to keep the library itself as simple as possible, while leaving plug(s) so it can easily be extended by the user.  There are things your library should do and things it should not do.
<br/>
<br/>
Making messages is basically a four step process:
<br/>
Data creation (user hanldes this; text and fonts)
<br/>
Data conversion (user handles this; text and fonts, so they work with your library)
<br/>
Custom extensions (user handles this; helps the library do fancy game specific things)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Putting glyphs on the screen</span> (your library does this)
<br/>
Anything else (not really related =)
<br/>
<br/>
You should not directly handle anything that doesn't involve putting glyphs on the screen.  A little about each step:
<br/>
<br/>
Data creation.  The programmer defines what the system will support, and then the person who writes the script writes it at a very high level, probably using tags for special display features.  You may end up with thousands of messages that look something like this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">MES_ID_HERE:
<br/>
// Register Input
<br/>
// r0 - NPC ID
<br/>
// r1 - number of items to be given
<br/>
// r2 - type of item to be given
<br/>
// r3 - sound effect linked to getting item
<br/>
//
<br/>
¬† ¬†[meta][face(r0)][name(r0)][voice(r0)][/meta]
<br/>
¬† ¬†[red][playername][/red]![sound(DRAMATIC)][delay] [icon(HEART)][delay]¬† I'm [name(r0)]![playerinput][newline]
<br/>
¬† ¬†[red]I[/red] really,[delay] REALLY,[delay] want to go with [red]you[/red]. [icon(HEART)][userinput][newline]
<br/>
¬† ¬†You have [big]no idea[/big] how much this means to me. [icon(HAPPYFACE)][delay][newline]
<br/>
¬† ¬†[bold]If you let my go with you,[/bold] [italic]I'll give you [green][caps][count(r1)][x_items(r2)][/caps][/green]![/italic][sound(r3)][userinput]
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Not all of the tags directly print something.  The metadata is not printed directly.  [count()] sets an internal variable that [x_items()] uses.  [caps] causes the callback to always return upper case glyph entries.  [bold] and [italic] change the font, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Data conversion.  The messages and font(s) are precompiled.  The font is converted into a format your library is happy with.  All of the tags and tag functions are converted into code points.  Magic cookies may be inserted.  (A [voice] tag may automatically be inserted before every line, [bigline] may be inserted before lines that contain big text.)  The output is going to be a bunch of bytes if the user wants to do anything fancy.
<br/>
<br/>
I think a single callback function should be able to handle user extensions if the library has hooks to things like moveCursor().  Normal glyphs return a font index.  Control codes do something (change the font, color, etc) and the return NODISPLAY.  If the user want to implement caps, sound effects, register based input, etc, that is completely up to them.  Your library doesn't worry about it.
<br/>
<br/>
Your library only really worries about moving a cursor around and dropping glyphs on the screen.  It library should provide facilities for things like changing the font color, but in general it should be as simple as possible.

If I want a fairly complete Chinese font, I'm looking at ~5000 characters.  If I want a Chinese font with all the glyphs nobody uses, I'm looking at ~50,000 characters.

If you want to support full color icons in addition to fixed bpp glyphs, that would be really cool.  I do not want to store bpp for each of 50,000 characters (the bpp will be 1, btw =).

I would not store this information with each character.  In the fanciest Chinese system I can imagine, there will be ~50,000 glyphs and ~250 control codes.

If possible, your library should communicate with one callback function.  The callback function can use engine functions to do fancy things, but I would actually avoid separate callbacks.  Text insertion (player name, item name, etc) can be accomplished by setting the engine substring buffer and then telling the engine to print that buffer.

<br/>
Yes and no.  You should be able to switch the glyphset (and other font data) in the callback, but there should only be one active font at once.  By switching glyphsets, you can implement bold/italic fonts.  A bold control code sets the bold font, and a normal control code restores the normal font.  The engine loads bitmaps from the active font.  When fonts are switched, the engine should expect them to be more or less compatible (same size, writing direction, etc).  If the user must, they can move the cursor around to do strange things.  (The reason why I mentioned a magic cookie on a line with big text.)

If you must switch directions mid stream, you'll probably need some sort of <span style="font-weight: bold">non-newline carriage return</span> to move to the beginning of the line based on the new directional rules.  Japanese never (really) changes directions mid stream, but it can flow from either LTRUTD or UTDRTL.  Somehow I imagine a game would just pick one and run with it.  Being able to switch at runtime would be neat (a few code points use differnt glyphs depending on the directional flow of the text).

Evidently, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.i18nguy.com/unicode/hebrew-numbers.html" target="_blank">the order of numbers doesn't matter in Hebrew</a>.

The engine should expose this functionality so that the user can pull something like this off, but I don't think that the system needs to support this kind of control directly because very few people will need something like this.

This is a premature optimization.  I think that the flexibility gained outweighs any potential performance penalties that may not exist.  If a game is doing a lot, it will only display simple messages.  If a game has complex messages, it won't do much else while those messages are being displayed.
<br/>
<br/>
Using a callback for all characters, the user can implement case locking, glyph morphing and other fancy things.  The fantastic part of all of this, is that your engine will not have to worry about any of that.  It can just print the control codes it gets.  A simple callback function would look like this:

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">return_t callback(param_t pId)
<br/>
{
<br/>
¬† ¬†// if this is a normal character...
<br/>
¬† ¬†if ((MIN_PRINTABLE) &amp;&amp; (pId &lt;= MAX_PRINTABLE))
<br/>
¬† ¬†{
<br/>
¬† ¬†¬† ¬†// glyph morphing here, if any
<br/>
¬† ¬†¬† ¬†// return the font index
<br/>
¬† ¬†¬† ¬†return pId - MIN_PRINTABLE;
<br/>
¬† ¬†}
<br/>
<br/>
¬† ¬†// else, it is something special
<br/>
¬† ¬†switch (pId)
<br/>
¬† ¬†{
<br/>
¬† ¬†¬† ¬†// handle control codes
<br/>
¬† ¬†¬† ¬†// user can create special control codes with library hooks
<br/>
¬† ¬†}
<br/>
<br/>
¬† ¬†// if we got this far, something went wrong
<br/>
¬† ¬†assert(0);
<br/>
<br/>
¬† ¬†// don't display anything
<br/>
¬† ¬†return UNDISPLAYABLE:
<br/>
}</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Adding caselocks would make the "normal character" portion more complex.  Native SJIS would be ugly- pId would have to mangled to work with the font, but it could be done.

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">I dont like the idea of having a callback on every character to see whether its a control character,</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
You are doing more than finding out if it is a control character.  You are asking the user what the current code value really is.  What goes in as "a", may come out as "A" or "?" if the user wants a filter like that.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, how would you handle user defined control codes?
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">i think that should be encoded with each character.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Control codes don't generally have displayable glyphs associated with them.  Displayable characters generally don't need control information, although I could see adding something like "line breakable" to them.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">And since width,height has to be specified with each character anyway, there might be some bits leftover for control information</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Any reasonable font will only have either a proportional width or a proportional height, but not both.  If font bitmaps can be up to 32 pixels wide, it is reasonable for proportional width to range from 0 to 32 plus a bit, or 0 to 63 at the most.  This leaves 2 control bits per glyph entry, if the font is proportional.

<br/>
Yes.  The glyph data (font) is stored in a normal array.  The encoding format used may not directly map to the font (SJIS is a horrible ugly encoding format, but it is fairly compact and standard in Japan).  The user callback turns the character index into a glyph index (trivial for anything like ASCII).  It also returns system control codes (because you don't know anything about the encoding format and you don't want to) and handles user extensions by catching user control codes and calling library functions (this is really powerful; you can't directly support everything anyone would want to do, but you can make it easy for them to add support).
<br/>
<br/>
As I said, preprocessing can but used to eliminate direct mapping issues.  This would actually make SJIS take up more space, because single byte charactars would have to be stored as 16 bit indices.  This is not really a big deal.  There are other advantages to a callback filter.

<br/>
Right.  The user fills the substring buffer (or sets a substring pointer, maybe this would be better?) and then returns a PRINT_SUBSTRING control code.  Whether the system prints the substring with a recursive call or not is up to you, but that should be documented.
<br/>

<br/>
A peek() function might be neat, but in general I think that the callback should cache a value and then wait until it is called again.  I suppose the callback could call getNextCharacter(), which would return the next character and advance the stream.  This is probably better.  It would simplify escape characters, for the people who want to use them.
<br/>
<br/>
The system should operate on a typedefed character type.  Some people might want to natively work with wide characters instead of multibyte characters.  They should be able to do that by changing one line in the library header.

The windows that the text is drawn over?  Without knowing what the user wants, it is hard to handle this problem.  My advice is, don't do this directly. Your library should just worry about where glyphs end up on the screen (you will need to keep track of the size of the display area).  Either let the user handle this directly (without involving your library at all), or use openTextBox() closeTextBox() callbacks and let the user handle the implemention.   There are many things the user might want to do:

You need to know what cells to write in the BG and/or which tiles to update.  Treating a bunch of tiles as a bitmap is the most powerful way to use a BG.  Part of the BG is formatted to use tiles like this:

Then you just need to update the tiles.  Proportional fonts can be written to BGs using this technique.  You need to know how big the text area (width, height) is, and what tile index it starts at.  If you go this route, you may want to include a function that initialized a square of tiles.

Peek seems like a cool idea, it only needs to return a pointer to the next byt in the string.
<br/>
<br/>
the idea of using a big struct that declares offsets and array sizes for some of its members is that the data can easily be stored in some continuous fashion, i.e. a file. It also means there is only one big structure (of unkown length, but oh well) despite there being many dynamic members.

I guess the linking with the hardware is the hardest part of the specification, because it seems there is no balance between being powerful, general and being simple. the above would mean that the VRAM has to be layout in a special way, i.e. a continuous section of VRAM in which sprites life in a specified way. It is not always clear whether its possible for the user to create that environment, that's why i proposed giving an array of pointers to sprites, i.e.
<br/>
maketextbox(......,u32 spritec,void **spritevrampointers).
<br/>
Same goes for bg, where it seems to me that specifying a bg (0-3), and then specifying a rectangle in the bg map is fairly general. Knowing the hardware it can easily be figured out where each bgtile sits. The assumption here is that the bg map stays constant.
<br/>
I see it would be favorable to have a useful layout (as Tepples proposed), but in general the only layout one can assume is 'tiles'. Since the data to be drawn has to be buffered anyway (if it is to be written during vblank), one could try to buffer it in such a way that it can be quickly copied into any arrangement of tiles.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You need to careful when defining what your library does, and more importantly, what it does not do.  I actually recommend that you start with either BG text display or OBJ text display, but not both.  I think that windows are out of scope.

Sure it is.  For a tiled BG:

If you use a formatted matrix, all you have to do is DMA tile data to VRAM during the vblank.  If you use contiguous sprites, you will have to DMA sprite tile data and OAM entries to VRAM.  I don't know of a faster simpler way of doing things.  I also can't think of a situation where this would not be acceptable library behavior, but I would be happy to hear about one.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The sprite library that i have been setting up the last couple of months (don't habe much time for it) manages vram and sprite. If you wanna use that you have to load the sprite tiled bitmap (the picture information) and you have to create a sprite object that uses that bitmap. I only load the picture information into vram when its actually needed, and only put the sprite into oam when it's displayed. So after a while everything is totally out of order. To get some sprites that sit in vram in constant positions one can create some space, or one can create sprites that are always in some position in vram. I.e., you tell it "i want that sprite to always be in vram at the same spot". this has to be in a block either in front or after the sprites that get dynamicly loaded, otherwise things get too complicated to handle for me. But if you create and destroy these 'constant' sprites, after a while that memory gets noncontinuously allocable. To make a long story short, in this scenario it might not always be possible to have continuous sprite space. Anyhoo, I guess if one can give an array of sprites pointers, giving a continuous space of sprites is just a special case. So is the specially arranged block of bg vram vs figuring out the tile arrangement from hardware.

<br/>
If the bg (0-3) is supplied, the base block is bit 2-3 of bg&lt;n&gt;control.
<br/>
<br/>
I have to think about that typedef (make sure I don't subly make assumptions about the size of characters in a string), but I guess it makes sense.
<br/>
<br/>
After giving it some thought, I think its not really necessary to copy during vram. texting is not done 20 times a second, so one would probably not see much of flicker. And if it is really necessary, the user could just give a shadow ram block as oppossed to a block in vram, and copy him/herself.

Is that still true if there are multiple members that are arrays of unkown size, and it is not even known whether they actually exist? I.e. all widths and/or heights can be stored in array each, or they could be constant. The glyphs are of uknown size, and there is an unknown number of them. I would create one big struct like this

<br/>
¬† ...probably some more stuff
<br/>
} Font</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Here the 2nd element gives the size of the whole struct, which has constant data in the beginning and dynamic in the end.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as the as the callback goes.. I think the thing could be done like this: when somebody calls print(textbox,string), the engine goes into printing mode. It copies the string into some internal buffer. When there is a callback, one is allowed to call a the library functions, plus a few functions only accessible in reading mode, when not in reading mode they do nothing (nextchar,peek,insert string,cancel print). Insert string inserts the string after the current position in the reading buffer. after '0' is reached, the engine goes out of print mode. The callback returns the glyph index to be print. The highest bits of the return are used for control information (i.e. 'not printable', 'new line', 'breakable'). One could use the highest 16 bits for control.
<br/>
Would one have a font on the GBA that actually uses more than 65536 possible glyphs?
<br/>
<br/>
I see you would define a couple of structs instead, I dont understand how that would be more convenient. Maybe I am missing something</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is more or less how sprite text systems work- you reserve a fixed number, say half, of your sprites for text.  VRAM is really more of an issue than OAM.  Once you start dealing with thousands of glyphs, every character needs its own tiles.

"I want 64 sprites, starting here."  If you are using a low level API, the sprite system should be happier with continuous VRAM/OAM usage.  If your API has a way to just get the next sprite this may not matter.  My fear is VRAM fragmentation.

Breaking the assumption that 1 char == 1 glyph is very important if you want to work with international texts.  I suggest that you typedef to something like u32 while developing just to make sure that you can't forget.

If you intend to support multidirectional text, I recommend using a DTU(characters)RTL(lines) test at the same time just because it is basically the opposite of English (and all European languages that I am aware of).

When does charcount != glyphcount?  Do unprintable characters somehow matter?  I may choose to put control characters at the end of my encoding format (0xFFFF~) and printable characters at the start (0x0000~).
<br/>
Is PROPORTIONAL set using defaultxoffset,defaultyoffset?
<br/>
I'm assuming that the newline offset is in there somewhere, probably under a different name...
<br/>
What is the difference between charwidth,charheight and glyphwidth,glyphheight?
<br/>
If the font has a proportional height, heightcount == glyphcount; there is one proportional height entry per glyph (unless you want a height callback).
<br/>
If the font has a proportional width, widthcount == glyphcount; there is one proportional width entry per glyph (unless you want a width callback).
<br/>
A typedef is better than charwidth:

I doubt it.  A more or less complete unicode font is a little over 60000.  I can't imagine anyone needing more than that.  If you allow font switching, they could always "bankswitch" fonts to use more than 65536 characters.

IIRC, you can set u8 to -1, but it will end up being 255.  Not that it really matters.  Effective values should be in the range of 0 to about 40, unless someone wants to encode tab as a really wide/tall character.  A width of 127 should be enough.
<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, negative values might be legit for RTL writing systems.  -128 might work better for PROPORTIONAL.  It depends on how you want to handle things.  Being able to use the same table for LTR and RTL would be neat.  The table should be valid.
<br/>
<br/>
A mirror glyph mode (H-flip/V-flip/HV-flip) would be neat, but that is probably ultimately useless feature creep.

I'm not convinced that it is, really.  You seem to want files.  I like compiled data tables.  It's a little easier to set up data table export filters.  I do like having the option of recycling a 1300 ~ 6000 character glyphset, but I'll admit that chances are slim that both vertical and horizontal writing will be used in the same version of the game.

String buffering or shadow VRAM?  The problem with sting buffering is, how long is the string?  Some strings are really long, especially once you start adding user input breaks and form feeds.

Ahh yes, the classic "second disc of Xenogears" school of game design. But do you really want to hang your entire cut scene system off your text engine?</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

No, but that doesn't mean that I won't have a message 18 forms long or longer somewhere else.  With embedded character portraits, this is quite feasible.  Consider something like Fire Emblem or Super Robot Wars- treating each dialogue as a single message (until bgs change/units get deployed, etc) is reasonable-

message(MES_STAGE_01_01);¬† // plans at enemy base; 17 forms
<br/>
script(SCR_STAGE_01_01);¬† ¬†// launch enemy units
<br/>
script(SCR_STAGE_01_02);¬† ¬†// load battle map, deploy and move new units
<br/>

<br/>

Naturally, all of this would actually exist in one big SCR_STAGE_01 script file (*) with the messages stored on the side and called from the script.
<br/>
<br/>
(*) this file may be exported to some other format before it run on the GBA (or DS, or toaster or whatever you want to run it on).
