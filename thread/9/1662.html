    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How do they make moving backgrounds, like waves in water? e.g.: <span style="font-style: italic">Zelda: A Link to the Past</span> has several 'animated backrounds'.
<br/>
<br/>
Do they just swap the tiles in and out, or what?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">An alternative (not necessarily better) is to have each of the anim tiles in vram (assuming they can all fit), and then change the map tile index to point to whichever anim frame you want.    Depending on the number of animating tiles you have, this method might possibly be faster.  The only other obvious advantage is that you could have each map tile animating at a different rate, whereas, with changing the underlying tile artwork, you force all tiles to change at the same time.  Something like animating grass blowing in the wind might look better if you have them animate at different rates...just as a hypothetical example.

<br/>
So, depends what you need to do really...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
