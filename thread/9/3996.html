    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It?s very simple to do in C. Create a ?struct? for your player and in it have a pointer to the image data. When you are selecting your character, just point to the data you would like to display to the screen depending on your selection.
<br/>
<br/>
I think you might be thinking that a player is an actual entity when in programming it?s just a grouping of data. I think you would be interested in reading some tutorials on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.thepernproject.com" target="_blank">this site.</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, did you mean how to use different characters in the game, or were you referring to some visual effects that were going on inside the actual character select screen?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I meant: 
<br/>
there are 3 characters: char1, char2, char3(- ok?), and a white screen
<br/>
for ex.:
<br/>
char1 - is on the left and it's small
<br/>
char2 - is in the middle and it's big
<br/>
char3 - like char1 but on the right
<br/>
The animation:
<br/>
<br/>
_____CHAR2             
<br/>
char1_______char3
<br/>
-------------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
_____CHAR3             //pressed -&gt;
<br/>
char2_______char1
<br/>
-------------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
_____CHAR1              //pressed -&gt;
<br/>
char3_______char2
<br/>
-------------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
_____CHAR3               //pressed &lt;-
<br/>
char2_______char1
<br/>
-------------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
etc. ...
<br/>
<br/>
The effect of choosing a "char"  (ex.: char1) makes that char bigger and fluently "carriz"* him to the center of the screen whilst others (ex.: char2 char3) get smaller and one of them (depends which driection would you choose  &lt;-- or --&gt;) goes to his place, the other one is moving out of the middle part of screen. (that char coosing was in Sonic Adv. 1) But thats not everything! With the charstheir names are moving but at the bottom of the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
ex.:
<br/>
<br/>
_____CHAR1              
<br/>
char3 ______char2
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
_____CHAR2              //pressed -&gt;
<br/>
char1_______char3
<br/>
-------------------------------------
<br/>
bill___PETER__jonh      ___//also fluent effect of changing*
<br/>
-------------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
fluent effect of changing* - you can see the chars, names moving, getting smaller etc. It's not a sudden effect, it's an effect with visible progress</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've never done it myself but I think I know what you want described. Basically the character select screen of any game and how to rotate the sprites around. You need to use sprite scaling and some sort of matrix rotation to make them move around a complete circle if that's what you want. If you want to achieve something like the Mac OSX tool bar then simple scaling is appropriate. <a class="postlink" href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/tonc/toc.htm" target="_blank">Here </a> is a good website that describes all about what you need to know for creating the effect. Try to be more specific with the questions I don't think I really answered you completely.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
