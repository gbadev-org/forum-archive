<br/>
<br/>
for my first game, I had no trouble. The colors used by the graphics I grabbed were fine on the hardware.
<br/>
But for the second game I am about to finish, in the emulator everything is fine, but on the hardware, it is sooooo dark.... If I do not have my GBA under a 1GWatt light, I see nothing :O( What can I do on my graphics to have this enhanced ?
<br/>
Thanks in advance !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
