<br/>
<br/>
I should have been more careful, but since the customizations you make are stored in the registry, my local settings made it look ok!  Sorry about that.  
<br/>
<br/>
Easy fix though, just go to the Customize option on the Export to .H dialog box...then import the mapEdExportDefinition.mdf.  That should get you to a clean starting point with file exporting like mapEd v0.95.  From there, you can alter it to suit your needs.

Bad idea. Storing too much in the Windows registry makes it too hard to move a project from one computer to another or to have multiple projects on one computer. I'd have it store the customizations in a "project file" like MSVC does.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
I was checking out your editor, but I think something is amiss.  Perhaps I've done something wrong but when I tried to create a 256x512 map I can only view the top third of it.  There are no scroll bars on the window for me to view the rest of the map.  I'm using XP Home.  I read that there is an issue with XP Pro, but I'm not sure if it included Home, also the issue didn't mention not being able to scroll.
<br/>
<br/>
It also occurred when I opened the sample file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lack of a scroll bar would be a GUI issue. The differences between XP Home and XP Pro involve not the GUI but rather the underlying kernel: the filesystem features supported, the multiprocessing capabilities, the included server software, etc. The GUI difference is between 98/ME and 2000 or between 2000 and XP. Therefore, what applies to one version of Windows XP probably applies to the rest.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

No scrollbars, no.  I was initially confused when I first used it too, until I read the documentation.  Before worrying about system conflicts, etc. with any new piece of software, read the docs.  Heed this advice and you'll save yourself trouble and frustration in the future.

As a suggestion for Nessie, though I like the grab 'n scroll functionality as you have it, some users may not have a 3-button mouse.  You might consider adding an alternate means of scrolling.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Key Shortcuts ? The NumPad now can be used to scroll the map in 8 directions.

<br/>
As a general rule I always list any new features or changes in the change log at the top of the help file.  I also color code any new documentation changes so if people have read previous versions, they can more easily (I hope) home in on the specific changes instead of having to reread the whole thing.
<br/>
<br/>
v.98 might change the interface a lot, hopefully fixing any of the above issues and hopefully a few others, then again, it might not.  Entity placement is something we need for our game so that will likely be the next thing I do.
<br/>
<br/>
[Edit] - I'll just show the changes here as well.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Version 0.97</span> ? added Export Layer To .BMP, PCX Tileset Loader, ?Solo? Active Layer, Show All Layers
<br/>
<br/>
Enhanced ? BMP (tileset)  loader now supports 16 colour uncompressed .bmp?s.
<br/>
Enhanced ? Undo handles Add, Clone, Delete, Flip, Shift, &amp; Shuffle Active Layer operations (NOTE: Resize is the only one that doesn?t work yet).
<br/>
Enhanced ? Number of undo levels can be adjusted via File-&gt;Settings?
<br/>
Enhanced ? Drag ?n- drop?can drop multiple tileset files onto the workspace window to 	add them to the project.
<br/>
Key Shortcuts ? The NumPad now can be used to scroll the map in 8 directions.
<br/>
Fixed ? Better validation of .bmp files.
<br/>
Fixed ? Misc. undo bugs, mostly related to loading a new map.
<br/>
Fixed ? Collision tile index wasn?t being written properly when customized.
<br/>
Fixed ? Menus had some inconsistencies and broken accelerator keys.
<br/>
Fixed ? Trailing comma?s on last data element no longer exported.
<br/>
Fixed ? Export To .CLL menu option wasn?t enabling correctly.
<br/>
Fixed ? If a .CLL is being constructed, quitting or loading a new map triggers an ?Export .CLL?? request.
<br/>
Fixed ? Update Active Tileset was not altering palette information correctly, causing bad palette exporting in some cases..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Regarding your 512x512 map, I just did a test map and it exported the full 512x512 map.  My test also had a secondary layer at 0.5 parallax, which creates a layer with dimensions of:
<br/>
<br/>
/* width: 271     height: 266     parallax: 0.50 */

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I think I see what's happening.  
<br/>
<br/>
In the engine I'm working with, we only use a 32x32 tile (256x256 pixels) hardware map....and that is dynamically built from the mapEd generated array which can be much larger.   So, mapEd writes the data out with that in mind...just a huge rectangular array.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know this for a fact, but I'm guessing in 64x64 tile (512x512 pixel) mode, which you are using, the map data has to be uploaded in 32x32 blocks or something like that?  So, that's probably why you are seeing the goofy alignment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
So, basically I fixed it with flood filling in the blank areas with a valid tile...then refilled it back with an empty tile.  Obviously not a good solution, but until I can get a better idea how the data got that way, fixing it would be difficult.  
<br/>
<br/>
One thing I will do though is to put in a proper error message that the export didn't fully work.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm, most map editors I've tried actually didn't seem to optimize out the tiles (though I certainly haven't tried them all), they just spew out the tileset you load in.  So unless I'm mistaken, you should have no problem finding a tool that will work like that?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you are suggesting mapEd running in multi- 16 colour palette mode...OR...256 colour mode....(but never both), sure, that's fairly easy to do. 
<br/>
<br/>
But, if you are suggesting allowing a map to use one layer running in 16 colour mode and another layer in 256 colour mode, providing even a minimally robust export system to handle all of the things that could easily go wrong would be a nightmare.  
<br/>
<br/>
So, as of right now, I'm pretty sure this is not something I will do (ever?) unless I have a serious need for it in the project that I'm working on or some game company (or individual) is willing to pay me gross sums of money to add such a feature, heh.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As of now, there is no way to do it.  So, it would be something I would have to code into the tool.  
<br/>
<br/>
For starters, I probably wouldn't bother with optimizing palettes in that mode, which simplifies some things...that and I would have to change the tile data dump since each tile pixel takes up 1 byte instead of 1 nibble (4bits)....the tileset loader would need to load the tileset with colour 0 as transparent instead of treating every 16th colour as transparent....the map exporter wouldn't need to dump a palette index...and that's about it, I think.
<br/>
<br/>
Supporting one or the other isn't hard.  Supporting a mixed mode in a useful way is not something I care to tackle unless I really have to, heh.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Nessie on Thu Oct 02, 2003 5:40 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
 I suppose it wouldn't be hard to support an unoptimised mode...one where you can only load 1 tileset and that just gets spewed into a tile array...and the palettes get dumped with no optimization.
<br/>
<br/>
If that would be of use to you, I could do that over my lunch hour.  No big deal, I just have other work to do during my regular work hours.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One thing I just thought of, if you are trying to get 256 colour support out of this, I don't think you'll have much luck unless you jump through some seriously nasty hoops.
<br/>
<br/>
Main reason, 256 colour tiles can only use every other tile index if I recall (or does that only apply to 256 colour sprites??).  If this is true, the unoptimized mode I'm adding isn't going to fix the limitation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thats true. :( *at complete lost now*. 
<br/>
In that case, i need to ask if I have two different tiles sets, will I get two seperate 16 colour palettes in the export. If I can, I use that to work round.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm, all might not be lost?  It would be ugly, but I guess you could just multiply (shift) the tile index in the exported map by two?  As long as you didn't use more than 512 tiles, I guess it would work out after all?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't really have time to sift through the documentation to make sure I even know what I'm talking about, heh, so if someone else knows the answer, I wouldn't mind any relevant corrections.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For what it's worth, it's done and uploaded.  Whether or not it will help you is another question, heh.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, just select unoptmised mode when you create a new map.  I didn't have time to make it so that an existing map could be converted to that mode.
<br/>
<br/>
The rules, well, you can only load one tileset...and you should make sure yourself that you don't load a texture larger than 256x256 or similar size combination that results in more than 1024 tiles.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For what it's worth, I'm pretty sure it's only sprites where you have to specify even tile numbers for 256 color mode, you can still access 1024 256 color map tiles. Not sure why the hardware designers weren't consistent with it. My guess is that it takes a little more circuitry to multiply the number by 2 for maps, but since it takes 600 tiles for a full screen they figured it was important enough to do it, but you can access all of sprite mem at once anyway, so they might as well make the programmers deal with that.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

I tried pretty everything you have suggested last time round such as resaving using 'save as' and flooding the empty areas with the transperent colours but still nada.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One thing that I mentioned in the documentation is that removing tilesets is generally not supported....mostly because of a bad scenario that can happen if you remove every tileset.  Not sure if this is what happened?  No biggie.
<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is, flood filling works similar to some (most?) paint programs I've used...if you try to flood fill an area with the exact same colour, the flood fill operation does nothing?  Same with mapEd...so, filling it with a different tile first is something you will probably have to do.  From there you can flood fill it back to the desired tile.  The thing to pay attention to is any area that doesn't get filled in even though you think it should....this happens because you can have duplicate tiles in your map at the edit stage...they look they same to you, but the editor doesn't really know they're the same at that point.
<br/>
<br/>
Something I'm thinking about, so hopefully I can come up with a good solution to fix this issue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
