    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello.  I am currently working on a little demo for the gba using the HAM lirbaries (which are awsome by the way :))  I have a drawn sprite which I have scanned into the computer and converted it to data usable in the game, but the picture seemed quite bland... so I edited it in photoshop and all, appropriated for the small 64x32 size and converted again.  This time, the sprite was very odd looking and not exactly what I was wanting to do.  I have struggled with this for quite some time now and have been looking for a good sprite editor to accomidate what I need.  I would be very grateful to anyone who could help me in this situation.  Thanks for your time!

<br/>
(www.cosmigo.com)
<br/>
If you are using a free version, then some of the save features are restricted. There's a tool on gbadev.org or devrs.com - that converts the 
<br/>
only save format supported (.spr) into other formats that you can process using your tools.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I like to use Corel Photopaint, mostly because of it's nice palette management. It also allows for the customization I like and a couple of neat tools I cannot live without. :) ProMotion gets alot of use though, and is nice and cheap. And there is always the trusty Paint Shop Pro. Hope that helps.<br/>_________________<br/>#gameart on EFnet. The pixel owns you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i prefer to use the Gimp. it gives you really full control over the palettes, what of course is essential when making gfx for the GBA. and the best thing: its free ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can find GIMP for Windows at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gimp.org/win32" target="_blank">http://www.gimp.org/win32</a>

You can find GIMP for Mac OS X as part of Fink at <a class="postlink" href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://fink.sourceforge.net/</a>

I swear by GIMP as a sprite graphic editor.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
