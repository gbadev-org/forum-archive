    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all.  I just recently posted a blip about sprite creation... and how I was struggling with it.  Then I was advised to use a program called Pro-motion, which seems to be an excellent program.  The only problem now is that I am a novice in this area of development and honestly don't have the slightest idea of how to begin making a quality sprite for the gba.  If anyone could direct me in how to start this process or possibly show me a tutorial on Pro-motion, I would be very grateful!  Thanks again!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh, I recently misplaced all my wands of sprite infusing, +2 vs coders, sorry. If you are looking for tips on good sprite creation, there are a few resources out there. <a href="http://pixelation.swoo.net/" target="_blank">http://pixelation.swoo.net/</a> for one. is a good place to start. My good friend St0ven wrote up some tutorials that you might like to study as well. <a href="http://www.spritedomain.net/" target="_blank">http://www.spritedomain.net/</a> Mostly, it's all about practice, and its a good idea to take a look at your favorite pro work magnified and try to figure out the elements that make up a good sprite. Good luck to you.<br/>_________________<br/>#gameart on EFnet. The pixel owns you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
