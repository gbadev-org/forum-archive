<br/>
<br/>
Just want to confirm that I'm not wasting my time. If tepples wants to use these I will do some more and send them in appropriate format.
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of approprate format, I am using the template provided by tepples, but it would be easier to see the pre-converted graphics. Then I can send them in the right format.

@tepples:
<br/>
<br/>
If you will work on luminesweeper for DS, can you make a folder where we'll put our skins and use then run .bat to add them? And also remove the ones we won't like?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are these designs copied straight from Bandai's Lumines? I don't want to use designs that are too similar because of legal concerns. Remember how none of the homebrew Tetris clones have similar backgrounds or block decorations to Nintendo's Tetris for NES or Game Boy.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the template, those 'pf' and 'bg' <span style="font-style: italic">are</span> the files that are fed into the skin compiler. The skin compiler rearranges the blocks into the format that the game engine uses. The only difference is that the skin compiler can only read .bmp, .pcx, and .tga files, and there are restrictions on the number of colors that go into one thing, with extra restrictions on the background in the GBA version. I should track down an Allegro extension to load .png files sometime soon.
<br/>
<br/>
And what are those boxes and dashes at the top?
<br/>
<br/>
MaHe: Yes, the skin compiler will look for all skin description files in a folder, just as GSM Player currently does.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I mean, some of your blocks look like the PSP version too, but not enough to warrant a problem. Also, I think that if you are making money from it there would be a problem, but since this is homebrew I think you would be quite safe. And what exactly can they make you do other than remove them from the game?

<br/>
I understand your concerns which is why I'm posting the designs before I do any more.

Well, <a class="postlink" href="http://media.psp.ign.com/media/704/704774/imgs_1.html" target="_blank">see for yourself</a> are they too much like the PSP version? Personally, I don't think so.

I really respect your work as well, I mean REALLY, but in all honesty it's not because of the color. It's because you have an image fromt he shining in the background that just distracts SO much from everything else and ruins the feel of the original game (I know you haven't played it tho &gt;_&lt;).

If you don't get the "shining" joke, then you probably haven't played the first level of challenge mode of Bandai's Lumines either.

I am aware of the fact they may need to be dithered down to 15 color, which is why I'm using textured backgrounds instead of images. So that's fine, and I'm going to make some more when I get some time if you don't mind. As for the music, I have no idea, I guess I'll leave that up to you :) I'll post back here with some more designs done...

BTW: If you show me the original graphic format of the tiles you use I can give them back the same way. Otherwise, if it's easier for you I can just send the entire batch as photoshop psd's with all the layers etc. and you can convert them yourself.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Those image files (bg.png and pf.png) are the original graphic format. My skin compiler handles all conversion and rearranging of tiles. And no, I can't guarantee that I can take layered PSDs because GIMP has had trouble importing them.
<br/>
<br/>
Eclipse: Is there any other background associated with Kubrick's film or King's novel that would make the joke attractive?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Tepples, what I wes asking for was your actual graphic files before you convert them. That way I can be absolutely sure I'm giving you the right format. The templates are not really helpful since I have no idea what parts are the background and what parts are on different BG's (although looking at the maps in Visualboy Advance tells me it's just one complete background unless you OR in some extra stuff). And the other file is just confusing. I don't understand the numbers on the tiles, I don't understand which tile should go where etc. So if you give me one of your templates *with* the actual tiles used in the current version I'd be greatful.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW I have added some more levels.

nah, i took it down, as it is exactly the same thing as headspin's level4-bg, and i think people would rather have the made-from-scratch one anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Was the problem that you misspelled "pi<span style="font-weight: bold">n</span>o<span style="font-weight: bold">cc</span>hio"? That's a common error. If not, the problem might have been a misbehaving download manager. Some other folders on that server, which is connected to a roughly 256 kbps upstream, get DoS'd by misbehaving download managers that repeatedly try to download up to five parts of the same file at once. Most such download managers violate the spirit of the HTTP spec by making more than two connections to the same server. Too many connections result in a disconnection, repeated retries, and wasted bandwidth.

Currently, the falling speed is (2100 + 4 * n_pieces) rows per 65536 frames. I verified the 2100 against the PSP version, but I'm less sure about the 4. Have you compared the latest build of luminesweeper game left (skinner versions or later) with Lumines for PSP?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Perhaps Tepples could add an extra variable to the Lspec files to adjust the (2100 + 4 * n_pieces) formula, then you could have some ultra fast levels &gt;:)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
