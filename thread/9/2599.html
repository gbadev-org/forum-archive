    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="color: darkblue">I've used MapEditor Beta 4 (by Warder1) to build some maps. Every time I make one bigger than 256x256, the tiles get really screwed up when it runs on the GBA. It saves/exports correctly, but never displays what its supposed to. Does anyone know how to fix this? Is there a better map editor that can use .bmp tiles?</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyway, here are a couple you might try out.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="color: darkblue">It works, but I wanted to know how to fix the problem. If it happened to anyone before, searching would've returned too many results - I never feel like diggin through links</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Were you using TileMax? If you were then I don't think the exporter plugin works with maps bigger than 256x256 by default. I did make a 512x512 exporter once but it was on my old HD which crashed. Nevertheless i'm sure you could quite easily modify the source code to make one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
