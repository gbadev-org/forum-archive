    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to create a 3D fighter and I'd like to use some sort of 3d engine. I've looked and can't seem to find anything out there for free, but I was told that I might be able to find a pseudo 3D engine for free. Something like what Namco created for Tekken would be great. Any where I might find one of these? Or am I on my own on this one?
