    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello 
<br/>
<br/>
 I am working a car racing game and I made rendered pics using true space and then I used photo shop to create a black for transparency they are currently 480x640  they have lots black space around the model I plan to crop these pics and convert them to 32x32 cars. My question is how much space should I need around the cars, should I try to get as closes as possible to the car image or should I leave some some black transparency around the cars ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are using 32x32 pixel sprites try to fill up as much of that area as possible without exceeding the borders. If you make it too small then you are just wasting space that may be valuable later(as far as bits go).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are going to rotate them (e.g. top-view gta style game), you may want to leave a little blank space around the cars so that you don't have to put them in double-size mode.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
