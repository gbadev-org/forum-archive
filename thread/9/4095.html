    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I talked to LordGraga on #gbadev regarding 3D expert people, and he strongly recommended me to talk to you...
<br/>
It would be appreciated if you could help me out somewhat getting this camera transformation correct. I've been struggling with it for way to long and starting lose interest working on it... it's just bugging the hell out of me. I understand if you are too busy, but it would really be appreciated if you could help me out.
<br/>
<br/>
I only rotate around the Y-axis so this will make certain things easier.
<br/>
I first started out by rotating my vertice with
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
R_y =
<br/>
[cos(a) 0 -sin(a) 0]
<br/>
[  0    1    0    0]
<br/>
[sin(a) 0  cos(a) 0]
<br/>
[  0    0    0    1]
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
However as I plotted my &lt;X|Z&gt; one can see the frustum as it's full of the vertice, and it rotated along with the camera except double the speed...
<br/>
So I switched cos and sin in my rotation matrix.
<br/>
Now instead all vertice Z values are positive... and X varies from positive to negative values, like one can expect...
<br/>
<br/>
The coordinates are allready translated this is a side effect from my frurstum culling algorithm, so what I'm rotating is allready translated...
<br/>
<br/>
However when I try to convert my coordinates to the screen (x/z, y/z) and plot my vertice using &lt;X|Y&gt; I don't get anything that could make sense... as I rotate the camera the dots representing my vertice are moving horizontally rapidly without any pattern...<br/>_________________<br/>*Spam*

<br/>
I'm applying these calculations on the vertice... so I would guess that means I do it on the world...<br/>_________________<br/>*Spam*
