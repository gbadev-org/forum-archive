    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It seems like you're getting a pure binary RAW file from Photoshop, but you want something you can compile and link to your project. You talk about .dat files, which sounds like appended datafile Allegro talk to me. You'll have to compile and link that into your final ROM (you can only have The One Rom File as your finished thing) eventually through, either through making it an array, linking the binary data, or using something akin to GBFS to append it to the end of your ROM.
<br/>
<br/>
What I'd suggest (although in most circles this is counted as deprecated) is using a program such as Usenti - (http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/downloads.htm#usenti) to convert your graphics into const C arrays which then can be compiled and linked into your code.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SO im guessing Usenti saves things as something that can be compiled into my rom. But it's only for windows and i am pretty sure theres none of those for mac.  So let me rephrase my question so that it might be answerable.
<br/>
Does anyone know of the Mac port of the SGADE's so converter? or any soconverter on the mac?
<br/>
thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SGADE is abandonware as far as I know. You will without a doubt run into support problems and completion issues as long as you continue to use it. The Mac port was probably abandoned even earlier, so you'll just hit dead ends like this one sooner.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to code for the GBA on the Mac, you're going to have to learn how to code without the aid of an API. Even Windows GBA programmers rarely make it very far with the APIs that are out there (most notably HAMlib). Crack open any number of tutorials available online and start at square one; you'll be far better off in the long run.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright yah i knew it was my fate to by some cheapo windows box just for the good tools.  I knew someone ported it but the link is broken so yah.  but i found out sgade isnt abandonware because i emailed the creator  a few days ago and he said he was working on the chapter 6 of the tutorial
<br/>
even though it hasn't been updated since 2002.  So there is still some hope anyway thanks but i still would likea image coverter that works with sgade if it's out there</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">someone did a port of the image conversion tools over to mac. although he lost his copies,i still have both the versions he released. it seems like abandonware, but some of the head creators will still respond via the developer mailing list.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
