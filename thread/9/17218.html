    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How would I go about drawing a Bezier curve? Lines can be drawn by using a polygon with 2 vertices being the same, and I guess you can draw thicker lines with a quad of variable width, but what's the best way to go about drawing a curve? As a bunch of line segments one after another (with either a single polygon, or quad for controlling width)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Probably.  It's either that or drawing pixels on a texture / background in bmp mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cool, I thought I'd end up having to sacrifice a few polygons for it. The texture in bmp mode, do you mean by creating an image of the spline and setting that as the background, or in real-time actually checking where the spline intersects the screen pixels and colouring those pixels?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This will be in 3D with the camera moving around all axes, so I guess that rules out the texture on a background method!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Even in 3D mode, you have access to 2D bitmap planes external to the 3D system.  I was thinking something along the lines of a putPixel() type routine onto this 2D plane.  But if this curve has to sort in between other 3D polys, this will not work and you'll need to use polys.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
