Anyway, I'm trying to do some 16-colour sprites and do the usual - make some of it transparent. I've managed this fine with 256-colour sprites - have 0x0000 as the first colour, which it ignores and makes transparent.
<br/>
<br/>
And I've done the same with my 16-colour one - make 0x0000 first colour and, yes, it makes it transparent.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I've used gif2gba to convert the sprites. Now, this is all fine and whatnot. I'm using it on several sprites and the issue is the same. Let's say I've got a tall 32x64 sprite. The actual graphic itself is a shape which takes up roughly 20x40 pixels. What the conversion has done is, essentially, made the area OUTSIDE the 20x40 pixels transparent, but anything black INSIDE the 20x40 pixel shape isn't. Instead it just treats that as another palette entry (so essentially I've got two 0x0000s - one which is transparent and is the unused space, and another which isn't which should be transparent in the sprite shape itself).
<br/>
<br/>
Any help please? I'm looking at using this so I can make the sprites change colours using different sub-palettes (which I've figured out and got working, as soon as I alter my 256-colour palette to accomodate this) but this is just the last piece of the puzzle, as it were.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Can the mods please close this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
