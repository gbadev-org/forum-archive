If necessary, post screenshots on some other image hosting service, and link to them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What gauauu said: we need to see some code to see what you are trying to do before we can help. Also, define 'not visible clearly'? It does show up but it's the wrong color? Too dark? Garbled? A screenshot of the result or even the rom itself and the original pcx might help too. Some information on how you're converting the image to a GBA format could be useful as well, the name of the converter with possible conversion flags.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could use my favorite pixel editing program, Graphics Gale. You can make a canvas the size that you want it, turn on snapping, and set the snapping grid to the size that you want(8x8, 16x16, 32x32, 64x64), but is you want something like a final fantasy 2 battle sprite(16x24) then the grid doesn't really work. Then I believe you can just take the grid off and it will snap to your previous sprites. It is shareware, but the complete version is less than $20USD and well worth it. Probably not what your looking for, but yeah.<br/>_________________<br/>ahsan</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
