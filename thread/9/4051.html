What do you mean flat? If you wonder if they can change shape when rotating, yes they can...<br/>_________________<br/>*Spam*

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We have practically no information, and 3D engines are not simple.  Any number of problems can come up.  If you run into a problem that you find unsolvable, take a step back and consider a new approach.  Most importantly, be willing to throw away code.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you have the engine working on PC (or your native system)?  You might do that first, so you'll have access to your native debugging tools.  It will also encourage a cleaner coding style (though your code may be fine in that regard).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do not use mode2. you need to use the bitmap modes 3, 4, 5</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I tested my render and it render completly correctly on the exact pixel!
<br/>
Thank you very much for your advice, but I'll use mode2...<br/>_________________<br/>*Spam*

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Mode 0/1/2 renders are possible to do, but I thought they'd be slower do to char boundary issues.  It's nice having the extra planes though :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
