    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the only real way to get good at drawing is by doing it. Just get yourself a pencil and paper and start trying to copy your favorite styles and stuff. Personally I draw much better using sketchy circles/ovals as guides before actually drawing a character, that way I can focus on getting all the curves and wrinkles just right without losing track of the big picture.
<br/>
Oh, and the best place to find lots of other artists and get all the critiques you want is oekaki boards (sort of like message boards, but you draw pictures and then people can comment on them). My favorite board is <a href="http://bakaneko.unixdaemons.com/oekaki_menu/" target="_blank">http://bakaneko.unixdaemons.com/oekaki_menu/</a> but <a href="http://www.oekakicentral.com" target="_blank">www.oekakicentral.com</a> is probably the most popular. It's kind of hard to draw with a mouse though, but you can still do some pretty impressive stuff once you get used to it. But if you really get into it you may as well buy yourself an art tablet, which is a flat thing with a pen that you move around on it to move the cursor on the screen, and if you touch the tip of the pen on it, it's like clicking the mouse, so you can draw lines.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know any good art tutorial sites offhand, but there are plenty around. They can be helpful sometimes, but usually not as much as just studying other people's pictures and/or just pushing yourself to improve with each big picture (doodles are good too, but generally don't bump your skill up very fast)<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am also an *semi* accomplished manga artist but have run into one problem. After drawing my image and scanning it, I went into PSP 8 (just downloaded the tutorial) and when I tried coloring it with the fill bucket, I saw a lot that it didn't color in near the lines in the picture. So I went in and colored EVERY single pixel near a line. And the picture had a very high resolution!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Is this how professionals do it? Because that process takes a VERY long time to complete and there is too much room for errors. 
<br/>
<br/>
And thanks a lot for the site superx. Too bad it didn't show how to color a scanned image.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In Photoshop you would open your scanned image, create a new layer, set the layer option to "multiply", and simply paint underneath the pen/pencil lines with colour. This way you never mess up your original artwork.
<br/>
<br/>
Your way is very time consuming and destroys the subtle shading from the scan. Doing the above way, you will never turn back. I'm pretty sure professionals colour comics this way these days.. don't have to "paint within the lines"!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">actually, I never thought of doing it that way as I didnt know wtf multiply meant (I'm not the type to read a manual or anything, I learn best through trial and error- otherwise, I tend to forget things).
<br/>
all I used to do was make sure the image was huge, select the area I wanted to paint, cleared it, and then did the bucket fill.  if it came out a little pixely looking after deselecting it, I'd usually smudge it a little or blur the area, or both.  after I resized the image to a smaller one, it would usually look alright.  Remember, there's always Ctrl-Z.<br/>_________________<br/>"Two wolves are fighting. One wolf is all evil, hate, jealousy and discontent, and the other good, love, happiness and is content."
