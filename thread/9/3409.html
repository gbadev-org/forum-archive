    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
The engine has been optimizes since, and new features are available
<br/>
, such as particle systems (explosions, whirpools etc...)
<br/>
<br/>
here are some shots (you will have to - right click on the mouse , and
<br/>
save target as)
<br/>
<br/>
-please notice, that this is a zip file with 10 new interesting pics,
<br/>
 I'll be happy to answer questions, and to work on projects with whoever
<br/>
 wants, and I need an ASM kick-ass programmer
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What is this white background? What format do you use for levels? All quake2?
<br/>
<br/>
I know asm programming, but i doubt that I am a "kick-ass programmer" (I am against violence in programming) :P
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it looks interesting, you should try to make sth real out of it (eg. game demo).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The models are MD2 - quake 2 models.
<br/>
the level was designed by me, and the white background seemed
<br/>
nice specially with the particle systems, so it might look like an
<br/>
arena of fighting. But still alot is to be done. this is a 4 months
<br/>
project, which I attend and improve within my spare time.
<br/>
