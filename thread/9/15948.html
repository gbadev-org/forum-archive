    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Given map A, made from tileset A, and bitmap B, an upscaled bitmap version of map A, is there some tool that can create tileset B, the upscaled verson tileset A?  My guess is no, especially given that there may not be a 1:1 relation of low res to high res tiles depending on how you do your scaling.  (Although taking the first high res tile in a given map would be acceptable.)
<br/>
<br/>
I mucked around with MapED (import bitmap as map feature), but it didn't seem like it could easily do the job.

~16x16 pixel metatiles are being upscale to 32x32 pixel metatiles.  The palette is also being reduced.  When directly scaling a tileset, seams appear and directly scaling ~256 or so tiles individually is a pain.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, blurring from nearby tiles isn't necessarily a bad thing, so long as the tiles fit together.  A ground tile and a water tile do not fit together, so the blurring is bad.  But, if two different water tiles are next to eachother, the blurring actually helps them fit together.
<br/>
<br/>
It may just be that reworking tile art is laborious, and there is no easy way to get the job done.

(Reason I'm asking is that if it's something straightforward, you might be able to do it all as a photoshop batch job. If photoshop is in indexed color mode, it'll upscale nicely without any blurring, yielding a pixel-perfect upscale.)

Thanks.  Scale2x seems pretty fantasic.  I'll see if it is helpful.

I'm looking to produce GBA compatible art, regardless of my current target platform.

There was a Metal Slug test image distributed with "scale2x", so I'll continue with that theme.  Starting with a <a class="postlink" href="http://sennue.com/files/abstract-gba/MS.png" target="_blank">normal graphical presentation</a>, the goal is to upscale the graphics and reduce them to 1 bits per pixel, <a class="postlink" href="http://sennue.com/files/abstract-gba/MS-BW.png" target="_blank">like this</a>.  So far as I can tell, the GBA and DS do not have subtractive blending, so the only way to darken the spots in a game world is with normal alpha blending (will not work too well), prerendering (not an option, given the goal), or with a screen.  The result will look <a class="postlink" href="http://sennue.com/files/abstract-gba/MS-CO.png" target="_blank">like this</a>.  (Yes, this particular 232 BG may not actually work as is.)  The GBA does support additive blending, so by using a simple screen for the BG, sprites can be added using the blending hardware, <a class="postlink" href="http://sennue.com/files/abstract-gba/MS-SP.png" target="_blank">like this</a>.  You can actually use a range of alpha values by doing this, so part of your characters can be semi-transparent. (I don't actually like how the sprites turned out here, but this is an illustration and it is not really important.)  The layered xcf can be found <a class="postlink" href="http://sennue.com/files/abstract-gba/MS.xcf" target="_blank">here</a>, if anyone is interested in playing around with it.
<br/>
<br/>
The advantage of a 1bbp target is than any source art (say, photos) ought to work, and it should basically jive stylistically with any other art (the free tile art that can be found in various places).
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>ScottLininger wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">(Reason I'm asking is that if it's something straightforward, you might be able to do it all as a photoshop batch job.

<br/>
I did not know that.  It is nice to know.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is, this conversion is not straightforward.  Converting scenes to 1bbp requires a human to pay attention to brightness and contrast levels.  Losing details is the point, but you can't lose so much that the scene becomes meaningless.
<br/>
<br/>
Converting tiles is even harder.  Upscaling tile pages creates seams.  Blurring tile pages before squashing to 1bpp creates seams.  Overlaying layers, and adding 1bpp dithered art with non-dithered art works just as well, although there is no context, so it is hard to tell if you are doing a good job.
<br/>
<br/>
Really, what I'd like to be able to do is create a scene with the original tiles, make the scene work in 1bpp and then derive a tileset from the scene, because working with the tiles directly is major pain, especially when you are dealing with relateively large tilesets.  I'm not sure if this is the best approach.  So far as I can tell, there is no straightforward way to do all this.  If anyone has any ideas, I'd be happy to hear them.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The graphics card I?m using (NVIDIA GeForce 8600 GT 512M GDDR3) has support for up scaling video to 1920x1080i resolution.
<br/>
<br/>
Setup I have is dual displays with one being DVI from graphics card to HDMI in on my LCD TV. However, would love to be able to work out how I can up scale SD video content to 720p.
<br/>
<br/>
Done a bit of searching but come up blank, most is about DVD players that have up scaling to HD support.
<br/>
<br/>
The player I mostly use is BSPlayer but can?t find a way there of switching SD content to a higher resolution.
<br/>
<br/>
Any tips on where to look to enable this feature on SD content playback?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bugfreegames.com" target="_blank">Download Games</a>
