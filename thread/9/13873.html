    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just discovered the program I commonly use to convert GIF files "irfanview" is not converting them to legit GIF files but mimiced GIF files displaying
<br/>
"<span style="font-weight: bold">This is not a gif file</span>" message when I use it with etc program.
<br/>
<br/>
So I did search on the error message and found out the reason for PCX and
<br/>
PNG usage.

<br/>
<br/>
So I am requesting if somebody can give me a free program that can accomplish this or direct me to a program that will convert to the correct file type. Maybe something that was used early when the ineternet was wide spread during 1989 or 1990.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I have been trying these programs and have been installing them but I need something that will convert to a <span style="font-weight: bold">REAL </span>gif file type.
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly I am looking into SNES developement being the system I grewed up with and have seen as the limit. The reason for that is the SNES is being emulated on many systems, computers, and even hand hedl PDA devices even the GBA and NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading assembler commands every now and then making an attempt to make a self users guide for myself. I will tell you more about this when I get everything more organized.
<br/>
<br/>
The SNES unlike the Gba that use <span style="font-weight: bold">PNG</span> use <span style="font-weight: bold">GIF</span> files for bitmaps and other sprites. The <span style="font-weight: bold">PNG</span> format replaced <span style="font-weight: bold">GIF</span> files due to licenesing disputes.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe an earlier graphics conversion program from early 1989 or even 1991 that will convert anything it can read to a true GIF format. I fear I might end uo buying an Apple II original in order to achieve this.
<br/>
<br/>
Generally a program from the first days of the Internet.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Super NES doesn't use GIF files. It uses tile data, just like the PC Engine and much like the Game Boy, Sega Genesis, and Game Boy Advance. The <span style="font-style: italic">emulators</span> might use GIF files.
<br/>
<br/>
But by now, the LZW patent has expired worldwide. You can use GIMP to save GIF files, which as far as I can tell have a conforming LZW pixel stream. I used GIMP to save GIF animations for my two Tetris-related YTMNDs (<a class="postlink" href="http://infinitespin.ytmnd.com/" target="_blank">infinitespin</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://tetrispwned.ytmnd.com/" target="_blank">tetrispwned</a>).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Then what compressive format that is high in resolution would I use to convert to Spirte data that is usable in a SNEs game???<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're writing your own Super NES game in 65C816 assembly language, you can have the sprite cel decoder process just about anything that doesn't need more than 64 KiB (half the Super NES's main RAM) to decompress, and you can make the conversion program accept any common image format (BMP, PCX, GIF, PNG).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
