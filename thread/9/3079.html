No real problem to download it. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'll test it batblaster but I don't think I'll be able to post my opinion till the next &gt; holidays at moutain ;)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I finally manage to test it.
<br/>
It seems that it will be a very nice Editor!
<br/>
<br/>
"will be" cause, correct me if I'm wrong, but many options/functions don't seem to work (or are under construction).
<br/>
<br/>
It's the case for palette viewer (all is black) or, more blocking, when I load a tileset (my .bmp is right for 16 colors bg map) I also have an all black tileset...seems to be not loaded in fact.
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't have test all the editor.
<br/>
<br/>
Could you tell me if these are unreleased features cause you didn't mention if this software was still in development
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks ^^
<br/>
Great -all included- tool anyway ;)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
RE-EDIT: After uninstallation of OFFICE2003, your editor works.
<br/>
I'm on XP PRo Service pack 1, and each time I wanted to start GBAWorld I had 5 messages from Office, and thus these black bugs I spoke before.
<br/>
<br/>
No that's it's gone, GBAWorld seems to work good.<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The editor work only with 256 color mode...
<br/>
<br/>
if you load a .bmp on tile editor do not forget to save with a different name because the program will change some on the file when save...
<br/>
<br/>
The palette work fine on my computer and the computer where i work..
<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft XP , Processor AMD Video Card G-Force 4 in mine and built in on my work...
<br/>
<br/>
The program is in English in all the parts , i do not remember if there is some in Italian but i don't think so...
<br/>
<br/>
For any question write me, i will put online the docs as soon as possible...<br/>_________________<br/>Batblaster / 7 Raven Studios Co. Ltd
