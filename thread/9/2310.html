    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using Paint Shop Pro 7, I've just finished some of the animations of my character for a GBA game. The problem came with the last two frames: the palette isn't identical to the other ones.
<br/>
<br/>
The skintone of the character is yellow and on the last two frames it switches to white (wich is not intended), if I look at the palette it differ from other ones because the yellow color switch places with some of the greytones.
<br/>
<br/>
The thing is the palette is different for almost every frame but it only screws up with the last two. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna change the palette that is loaded in the GBA, but I don't think that will help.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope somebody understands my crappy explanation, and can give me some advice. Pherhaps there is a function in PSP to get the same palette for all my frames. Or some other program or whatever. Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Easy. Just paste all your cels into one file, then have your paint program assign one palette to that file.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
