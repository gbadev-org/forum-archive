On the GBA, yes, the priority system behaves as it did on the NES. On the Nintendo DS, no; Nintendo "fixed" the behavior.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Isn't Dwedit asking about that weird NES trick where the low priority sprite was masked by transparent areas of the higher priority one?
<br/>
<br/>
What behaviour has been fixed on the DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, and the trick works on the GBA in the same way as on the NES. The compositor in both systems can be modeled in the same way: render all backgrounds to one buffer (sorted by priority and storing the priority of each pixel in a Z buffer), render sprites to another buffer (strictly front to back, using priority <span style="font-style: italic">only</span> to fill the Z buffer), and combine the buffers according to Z value (with sprites winning ties).

<br/>
Martin Korth's GBATEK (DS edition) states that in DS mode, the 2D compositor now sorts the sprites by Z before rendering them to the buffer.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you sure it applies to the DS in both modes?  A good way to test it is Mario 3 in pocketnes and nesds.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In PocketNES I had to use the blending to get the exact behaviour of the NES, Loopy changed the sprite priority for nesDS so he could use the alpha-lerp scaling.<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
