Mode 5 is nearly useless.  It's possible to use stretched mode 3 for 99% of everything that one would use mode 5 for.  You can even do double buffering in stretched mode 3: just use pixels 0-119 as the first buffer and 120-239 as the second and then switch visible buffers using the BG2 affine register.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Background: The GBA has three bitmap modes, which can be scaled or rotated using BG2's affine registers.
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>Mode 3 has one 240x160 pixel buffer at 16 bits per pixel.
<br/>
</li><li>Mode 4 has two 240x160 pixel buffers at 8 bits per pixel.
<br/>
</li><li>Mode 5 has two 160x128 pixel buffers at 16 bits per pixel.
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
Mode 5 fills the screen if you rotate it by 90 degrees (to 128x160), stretch it by 2 horizontally (to 256x160), and cut off some pixels on the side (to 240x160).  Mode 5 is useful if your graphics data is naturally column-major (such as if you're writing a wolfenstein style raycaster engine) but not for much else.
<br/>
<br/>
Myth: "Mode 3 doesn't support double buffering. Among bitmapped modes, mode 4 and 5 do."
<br/>
<br/>
Mode 3 fills the screen.  If you stretch it by 2 horizontally, it covers two screens.  Then by setting the X base register appropriately, you can get two 120x160 pixel buffers.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have VisualBoyAdvance, look at the "Beyond the Limits" demo by Vivid Design.  Though it uses mode 4 instead of mode 3, it uses the same sort of stretching I described to get two effective video buffers (both on buffer 0) and one temporary buffer (on buffer 1).[/list]<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
