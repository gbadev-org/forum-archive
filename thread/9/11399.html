    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I need to do something very specific. I have around 100 64x64 16 color PCX type images that I need converted into C code. I need them to all end up in the same file, and since they all share a common palette I need the palettes ignored.
<br/>
<br/>
I can do this to some extent with usenti (in which I made the images) but since I can only have one file open at once, it poses a bit of an issue. Is there any way to batch process using usenti\'s exporter? If not, is there a tool that will let me do so with 16 color images?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in DS.

<br/>
<br/>
I've got a pcx 2 c converter I've written.
<br/>
<br/>
It currently works on 1 pcx image at a time, but could probably be converted to work on a bunch of files at a time.
<br/>
<br/>
Would you be interested in the source code for it? I'd be happy for you to extend the program and feed the changes back for inclusion in the main code.
<br/>
<br/>
the program gbatile, at my website, is probably similar in terms of code.

<br/>
<br/>
or if you are interested, I can look for the other program, and make it available.
