<br/>
Hello, I tried to do a start menu to my game.
<br/>
I've tried to use background pictures, and variables:
<br/>
show background 1 where 1:st option is selected, variable x=1,
<br/>
press down to:
<br/>
show background 2 where 2:st option is selected, variable x=2,
<br/>
etc.
<br/>
<br/>
the two first went all right, but when i added all my seven backgrounds, i got errors when compiling.
<br/>
something about the ewram(or if it was named some other way).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any better ideas how i should do it? or....  yeah.. anyway, I need help with it.<br/>_________________<br/>yeah, well, maybe... or? anyways.... eh...  what was i talking about??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're compiling for multiboot (-specs=gba_mb.specs), all code and data goes into EWRAM, which is 256 kb in size. If you have, say, 7 mode 3 backgrounds, that's 7*240*160*2 = 538 kb, which wouldn't fit. If this is the case and gcc complains (does gcc check the section sizes? If so: cool!), be happy for that: compile-time errors are better than runtime errors.
<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of solutions for this. You could compile for ROM code. ROM is much bigger, but you wouldn't be able to test on hardware with just an xboo cable. Other solutions are the use of tile-modes, which can be drastically smaller if you have repeating tile patterns; or compression. The better conversion tools should have compression options. If yours doesn't have them, consider switching.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think it might be that multiboot problem.
<br/>
Umm, how do I choose how to compile non-multibooting? (if i can't find it myselft) 
<br/>
and im not using a xboo cable. I'm using a flashcard, so it's all good.
<br/>
Only limitations are 256 Mbit, which I think is more than enough for my simple game. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help!
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I think i found out how to compile it normally:

Otherwise, try looking in your makefiles/batch files (depending) to see if there is a specification there.

REG_KEYS is low-active, meaing that the bits are <span style="font-style: italic">set</span> when they're up. the "if(REG_KEYS)" will run unless you press all the buttons.
<br/>
<br/>
The effect you're trying to avoid is called key bounce, and there are plenty of threads on it. If you want a simple solution, <a class="postlink" href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/tonc/keys.htm#sec-adv-keys" target="_blank">tonc: advanced key handling</a>. Even if you don't need to check for bouncing, using some sort of key polling is preferable as you can get rid of that annoying low-active stuff by flipping everything at the poll. You also wouldn't have to read the contents of REG_KEYS every time you use it; it's volatile, remember? Using bit-ops rather than logical operators might make more sense too: that's what you're really checking for anyway and you can check multiple keys at once.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#59043 - Cearn - Fri Oct 28, 2005 11:18 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The basic issue here is that you need to compare the current keystate with an earlier one, so you use two variable to store these states in: <span style="font-style: italic">key_curr</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">key_prev</span>, respectively. Once per frame, you read in the frame's keystate, and save the old state. That's whay <span style="font-style: italic">key_poll()</span> is for.
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">void key_poll()

<br/>
    key_curr= ~REG_KEYS;    // get new state
<br/>
}
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Note that I'm flipping all the bits of the key register to get the more familiar high-active state, i.e., bit is set when button is down.
<br/>
<br/>
After this, you can simply use your knowledge of boolean logic and bit operators to get what you want. If you want to know the bits that are down now AND NOT in the previous frame, use <span style="font-style: italic">key_curr</span> &amp; ~<span style="font-style: italic">key_prev</span>. Then AND with the bits you want to actually check for. Same thing if you want to know which keys were down in the previous frame AND NOT in the current one.

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">// down now, but not before

Everything in computers is binary, so yeah :P
<br/>
But more to the point, each button has its own bit in REG_KEYS. Whenever you see something like (1&lt;&lt;<span style="font-style: italic">n</span>) in #defines, the <span style="font-style: italic">n</span> is the bit that the define is about. For example, KEY_L is bit 9, so you'd use (1&lt;&lt;9). You can also write it in hex. As there are exactly 4 bits in each hex digit (that's why hex is often used), KEY_L can also be written as 0x0200. You can still use decimal, of course, in which case it's 2^9= 512.

From binary and hexadecimal you can easily see which bits are set and which are not, but that's not generally true for decimal. Which is why the first two are preferable for bit defines ... admittedly at the expense of newbies.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
(I know how to use the binary system, i just wondered if it was that you used it :P I was tired when i wrote it, so it came out wrong.) 
<br/>
so I know Binary and decimal.. and I think I understand hex now too..
<br/>
<br/>
and just to see if i understand:
<br/>
bit 4 can be written as 2^4 = 16... = 0x10 (1*16^1)?
<br/>
<br/>
seems logical to me :P
<br/>
<br/>
now I will read through this a few more times, and check your tutorial, to adapt it all to my game :)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot!! (oh, and if you want to suggest me to read / practice some stuff, please go ahead and tell me!)<br/>_________________<br/>yeah, well, maybe... or? anyways.... eh...  what was i talking about??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hmmm, cearn, I think I need some help in how to implement all this you thought me into my own code.... it would be really helpfull...
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
Hey hey hey! I got it now!
<br/>
working all fine, just had problems cause i didn't define key_curr and key_prev as u16...
<br/>
<br/>
thanks anyway!!
<br/>
<br/>
But, now I have more questions to ask this time graphic related again...
<br/>
<br/>
I have many many many sprites and backgrounds... now, will i have any problems with my pallettes or something?? or are there ways to avoid that?
<br/>
<br/>
and how should i.... insert the sprites as sprites? and... how to count the memory things to put it all and.... you know.. basic stuff.... 
<br/>
<br/>
and... i will look through your tutorial.. but just if you want to explain something special, that you maybe assume i will need help with or something.. Thanks!!! &lt;3<br/>_________________<br/>yeah, well, maybe... or? anyways.... eh...  what was i talking about??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
