    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to update a sprite in the OAM and move it at the same time. As soon as i update the sprite, the modifications are visible in the game...so the result is that we see the sprite change before it moves (i could do the inverse, but then the sprite would be at the good location but will display the last frame for a short time...same problem).  
<br/>
<br/>
What i want is something to do all my OAM update and sprite move before a refresh.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How are you doing your update and moving code? You may need to show us because your saying you can't get the two to work together within the same frame (from what I'm getting out of it). Usually when you call them within the same frame, both should change, but we don't know how your code is set up. Are you making changes directly to the OAM (where the attributes are held), or do you have a similar temporary structure that holds the updated data until your ready to just copy it over into OAM?
