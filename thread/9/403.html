can be sprites be used in mode4?<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, sprites can be used in mode4. They function the same no matter what mode you are in.<br/>_________________<br/>- RegularKid</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When using a bitmap mode (3-5) the extra vram taken overlaps the obj ram therefore you have to skip the first 512 entries.

Mode 4 - Bitmap graphics on BG2 with sprites.

The ROM works fine in the Mappy emulator but not in Visual Boy Advance.

<br/>
Is it Mappy being lenient and ignoring my bad programming! :)

I'll probably use Mode 0 and convert my backgrounds to tiles. This'll probably save some memory too.

It is? I'll have to look into that...
<br/>
I use a few macros to simlulate a linear bitmap...
<br/>
It could be practical, as well as increase performance, to make it a "real" linear bitmap...
<br/>
Is suppose it is possible to make a even larger bitmap? 240*160 is impossible, I know, but you can get very close...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hello all,
<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean, the only solution for a splash screen in mode 0-2 is to display 600 different tiles ??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#9649 - tepples - Tue Aug 12, 2003 5:57 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, you need 600 tiles to cover the entire field with unique tiles, but you don't always have to. Look at NES games. Their title screens typically use about 100 different tiles to cover 896 map spaces. Key is that they were drawn such that tiles would be re-used often.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
