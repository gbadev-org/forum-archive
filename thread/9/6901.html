    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, I have 10 sprites I created (numbers 0-9) that are black and white, literaly. The nubmers are black, the background is white, they are being drawn an a white screen. Why don't they show up?
<br/>
<br/>
All of the other sprites in the game I used are 256 colors. These should be exactly the same way.
<br/>
<br/>
I read somewhere that the first color of the pallate is used for transparency. If this color is black, it might have something to do with that issue. How do I go about changing the transparent color without re-convertnig the sprites?
<br/>
<br/>
Better, yet (mode 3) how do I turn the cute little transparency thingy off?<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You cannot turn transparency off; the zeroth index of a sprite's palette (whether it's index 0 of a 256-colour sprite, or index 0 of the 16-colour set being used by a 16-colour sprite) will always be transparent.
<br/>
<br/>
Your converter might have a way to specify which colour is used as the transparent colour; try reading your converter's documentation.
<br/>
<br/>
Or write your own tool to do exactly what you want, as most of us usually wind up doing anyway, and can be done fairly quickly if you are familiar with any scripting languages (Perl, PHP, Python, etc.).
<br/>
<br/>
The GBA doesn't care what colour is the transparent one - it could be hot pink; if your converter winds up putting it in index 0, it won't ever be seen. (Exception: colour 0 of the 256-colour background palette is used as the backdrop colour when there are no sprites, BGs, etc. to display.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, so if I put hot pink as the first color in the pallate (thus replacing the black color) does that mean I can't draw with black anymore? 
<br/>
<br/>
Would a possible solution to the problem be to draw the numbers in the 1st color of the pallate? (say insteaqd of black, a very dark grey?) It's not like the difference would be noticable at all...
<br/>
<br/>
The way my code is designed, I use one pallate for everything. (all my sprites backgrounds etc. are in 256 colors.) It's easier for me cause I don't have to go about changing the palatte every time I load a new sprite.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can have the same colour in more than one palette entry. So you could, for example, have hot pink both as the transparent colour and some other colour in your image.
<br/>
<br/>
If your converter can't tell, though, it might combine the two into a single palette entry. Read the documentation for your converter.
