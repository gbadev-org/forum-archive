you can all grab a demo of the engine in the main page.

any suggestions/ comments are welcome, or further ideas for new

<br/>
the zip file contains:

1) ROM

Hello Tomer, I hope all is well.  I examined the engine, it's pretty good. A lot of work went into it I can tell.  I assume there is 
<br/>
<ol type="a">No Illumination
<br/>
No Lightmaps
<br/>
No Collision
<br/>
No Gravity</ol>
<br/>
Those things can be added I know (LOL).
<br/>
<br/>
What do you need to complete it?
<br/>
How much ROM space is used by the QUAKE level?
<br/>
Are you using the QUAKE level directly?
<br/>
What are you looking for in help/assistance?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">HI dude!
<br/>
<br/>
actually there is dynamic lighting, you can check the screenshots.
<br/>
I am not loading the level into memory, as it takes too much, although
<br/>
it is possiable. the level is in rom, and contains data about the bsp.
<br/>
<br/>
currently, I don't want to continue with this project. I am now halfway
<br/>
through with a new renderer, that is inspired by the brilliant architecture
<br/>
of tomb-raider2. that should be super flexiable + an editor I plan to
<br/>
write. this is all will be for Windows CE.
<br/>
<br/>
I thought maybe for the contest doing a deathmatch arena like in the demo. 
<br/>
Another problem arised -&gt; my compiler configs aren't well. My engine
<br/>
compiled code is not fast enough, although the algorithms are super fast.
<br/>
weird, but I know it could get 3 times faster, if the right hand handles
<br/>
compilation configs.
<br/>
<br/>

So you are depending on CE graphics subsystem for handling the rendering? (IE DirectX)
<br/>
Is it possible to port to a GL like interface?

The GCC compilor is a bit odd for optimizing things at times.  I noticed a few things. The WRAM wasn't touched. (Not a big suprise but..) IRAM was heavily used, but did you place functions in IRAM for tighter rendering coupling or was this just data?
<br/>
<br/>
I've thought of a few 'simple' ideas to gain better use of the ROM however I doubt this is the appropriate place to discuse it. Your primary problem will be with ROM usage. As you are at 4megs now and the game competition critera is for a much smaller 'volume' of space (4mbit), space is your biggest problem for that.
<br/>
<br/>
A death match requires a few things, not an easy idea to implement, and it's requirements for the other consoles might be equally interesting to deal with.

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.

Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
