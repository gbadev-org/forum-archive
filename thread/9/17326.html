    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Create a cartoonish palette and use a photoshop type program to convert to that palette?  It'll get you close, but you'll need to hand edit it to get it right.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That process will not make it look like anime though. Photoshop CS5 handles the cartoon effect really well so download their free 30 day trial and exhaust it until it runs out. Once that's run out you can try using GIMP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'd say tracing it in a vector program would give you the best results. It would give you a much cleaner result than simple image processing. I'd suggest Adobe Flash if you have it. Photoshop is easier and more 'automated', but it'll be more 'western cartoon' than anime, if anything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
