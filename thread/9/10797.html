    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have created a background image and I have saved it as a bmp in Photoshop with 8-bit Indexed Colour and have used Usenti to convert the file, I tried using gfx2gba but the picture was always garbage, I'm probably not using the right options, anyway, the image works in emulators but not on my DS, any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
Just for the record to make sure I'm doing it right, I open the image in Photoshop, make 256x192, then Image&gt;Mode&gt;Indexed Colour, then Image&gt;Mode&gt;8 Bits/Channel, then save as..., save as Bitmap, select Windows and 8-bit, save. 
<br/>
<br/>
When exporting in Usenti I select bitmap for the image, use 16bpp then save as a .bin
<br/>
<br/>
Does all of this sound correct so far?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unless I'm greatly mistaken, you're doing too many steps. You don't need to use gfx2gba if you have usenti, it will export the c file for you. gfx2gba, unless I'm greatly mistaken, is designed to convert a bitmap image (.bmp) to the gba format, which would certainly explain the garbage if you gave it a pcx file from usenti.
<br/>
<br/>
Or did you do those seperately? In which case, I'm not quite sure. If it works in emulators, but not on a real DS, there's a good possibility you have a flag set wonky somewhere. I noticed that a lot of emulators seem to struggle with this issue, making many games look, odd...

I have tried using the star background included in Pataters Manual, I'm not following the tutorial, just using the background, anyway, that works fine on the DS but when I try and my background on the DS it doesn't work.  I setup a bit of code so it would switch depending on pressing A or B, but my background is just good old plain black.
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone who can get backgrounds and other sprites write how they do it?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We'll need a little more info than that. What's the exact command you used with gfx2gba? How does the code to display the background look (which mode is used, which background and how the background is initialized)?
<br/>
<br/>
A screenshot of the broken image and the real image would also be useful. And, how is the size of your converted image compared to patater's (in bytes)?<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
