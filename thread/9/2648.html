Don't mind the sarcasm, but there are some things that you have to do before we can help you. The search function is always pretty useful.
<br/>
<br/>
Mode 4 is good for most pictures, slow, but useful. 
<br/>
<br/>
In the announcements section, there is a topic that tells about a set of tutorials that has been converted to english (I think it was started by NeoGeo). He has a really good tutorial for writing just 2 pixels.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And google.com is your friend!!!<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry , Maybe my expression have some problem. I am not just ask you to do the C homework for me.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually I seen the tutorial in PERN Project and the Doc in gbadev.org.
<br/>
But I have many question on that, and I found that it seem most of the example are using Mode3, and just a few use mode4. And in PERN Project tutorial day2, it said we need to flip the buffer, however in one of the example of using mode 4, it didn't include the code to flip the buffer. 
<br/>
As we know, Mode 4 is use 8 bit pixel, when we convert the some pic to gba, what should we change?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I also want to ask, when I use imager converter , I can convert a pic to a 240X160 u16 in the header file, is pcx2gba can convert a pic to 120X160 u8 header file?
<br/>
<br/>
I know my question is quite stupid, but i am a very very beginer for gba display, so hope all of you forgive me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
