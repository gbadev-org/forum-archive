<br/>
<br/>
BG0 - BG3 is clear, but "backdrop"?  What is that?  Is it simply the empty solid color that is shown if, for example, all the BGs are disabled?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">afaik yeah it's just the backgdrop colour as you described it.  Then if only one BG is turned on you can still use the effects with it and the backdrop colour.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The backdrop, called by some coders the "sky" after its use in 8- and 16-bit games, is any area of the screen not covered by a non-transparent pixel in an active background or sprite in modes 0, 1, 2, and 4.  It is drawn in color 0, and you can blend against it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yep - as mentioned it is a background full of colour 0. It's what's shown when you do a fade out or don't set a background.
<br/>
<br/>
Remember to set colour 0 to black in your code (if you're doing fades) otherwise it will stay at whatever colour the boot menu sets it too, if you're running via the flash card boot menu. I've had screens "fading" to blue before now :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
