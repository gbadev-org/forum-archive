    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if i use 256-colours for the images in a GBA game, can i use more than 256 as long as they are not on-screen at the same time?? i dont know if this is possible or if you has to load a new pallete or something, and what affect this has on the rest of the game and if it would compromise other features, or not?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yep that's definately possible. Loading a palette at any time is absolutely fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sounds good and will allow for extra flexability and creativity without making images higher colour depth and take more space. thanx for the info</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A-ha! I bet that's why the colors on StarTropics were screwed up on the earlier NES emulators. (Good game, BTW)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I guess that if I build my sprites with individual 16-colour palettes, I can change the palettes in different 'rooms' and reuse the same sprites? Interesting idea....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Of course you could also do the same thing <span style="font-style: italic">within</span> a room.  You could have a couple of different 16 colour palettes loaded at a time and have sprites using the same pixel data but a different palette.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
