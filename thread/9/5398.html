Found it a bit difficult to get to grips with at first, but that could be just because I'm new to 3D graphics.<br/>_________________<br/>--

No seriously, I prefer Milkshape myself, if I ever -do- 3D stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As for blender I have it I just haven't used it. I suppose I should update it since i installed it.  Does anyone have knowledge of tutorials that exist for it? I hate the trial and error method of learning something myself.
<br/>
<br/>
I've got more experience with gmax but it like most every other bit of software has a bit of a learning curve. Rhino 3d I've heard is quite good, but it's a comercial package.  I suppose if you need to slice objects and create 2d surfaces from a 3d surface then it's better than most everything else.   It's good for making models of planes actually.
