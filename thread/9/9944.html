    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For the project I'm working on, I'll be using a lot of 64x64 sprite frames for animation.  I'm not having any trouble getting the sprites to work, or the animation to run.  The problem is, as I was putting in more and more animations, my background tiles were getting messed up.  I took out some of the extra graphics files, and the background returned to normal.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a limit to how many graphics data the GBA can hold?  My problem wasn't that I ran out of room in the VRAM (I was rewriting the a single sprite every loop to save space and tiles), but it seemed like the background array was being overwritten.  Is this what was happening, and if so, how do I fix it?  I'm planning on using a lot of backgrounds and animation frames, and if I'm stuck with only one background and a few frames, I won't get very far.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The theoretical limit to the amount of graphics data on a GBA cart is 32 MiB minus the size of the game engine. Are you making sure to declare your sprite cel data arrays as <span style="font-weight: bold">const</span> so that they are kept in ROM rather than being stuffed into RAM?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, I have been doing that with all of my arrays.  I deleted some extra maps, and I guess that cleared up more room.  So if I keep declaring &lt;b&gt;const&lt;/b&gt;, I should have as much room as I need right?  I was getting worried because my ROM is only about 200 KB.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Is that the 2 lines that go at the top and say something like:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">#define MULTIBOOT int __gba_multiboot;
<br/>
MULTIBOOT</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
If so, then that could be my problem...
<br/>
<br/>
And I'm not using a GBA movie player to test the code, only the emulator and a SuperCard SD.  I'll try taking out those 2 lines and see if I have any more problems.  Thanks for the tip!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
