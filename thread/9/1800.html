    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've just started working with Modes 0 through 2, and can't get them to work correctly. As far as I can tell my coding is correct (after comparing it with three or four other sources), so I'm pretty sure the tools I'm using aren't what I need (or I'm giving the wrong parameters).
<br/>
<br/>
Could someone recommend a (file format)-&gt;tiles &amp; palette tool along with the parameters I should use?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why not try a graphical tool like Kaleid or gbAmp to avoid having to deal with cmd line stuff?
<br/>
<br/>
Also gbAmp's gui will tell you what cmd line it's using, so you can use it to work out the cmd line for your makefile.<br/>_________________<br/>---

What do I use to get the palette from the same pic?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are loads of palette tools in the Tools section, I'm sure you'll find a cmd line one there.  And to get things going you could use Kaleid to start with.<br/>_________________<br/>---
