    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What's the point of the normal sprites (non-RS ones)?  I mean, can't you just flip them h/v using the scale registers?  Or is that slower?  For example, have the RS0 = normal, RS1 = fliph, RS2 = flipv, RS3 = fliph+v, then you get RS4-RS31 for other effects.  Why would anyone NOT use the RS for a sprite?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">there are 128 available hardware sprites

there are only 32 slots for unique rotate/scale settings.

<br/>
rotate/scale sprites use more hardware resources to display!
<br/>
<br/>
rotate/scale can look pretty rough - if you're using small sprites, you're best to create a new graphic for each direction you want it to face.  
<br/>
<br/>
Rotate/scale will obviously rotate/scale any highlights/shadow in your graphic design which can totally mess things up...
<br/>
<br/>
Rotate/scale is great to have in the hardware, and for some things - eg - mode7 backgrounds - it is the only way, but for most normal game issues you should look for a standard sprites solution and save your r/s slots and your hardware rendering time for when its the only way.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The horizontal flip doesn't work correctly in RS mode.
<br/>
if you set the H-delta to -1 instead of 1, it will read an empty pixel before the real graphics and thus shifting the sprite and missing the last pixel.
<br/>
And they eat more resources too.<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Does anyone have some stats to back that up?  I've heard people say it but I haven't heard any "you can display X sprites without RS, Y sprites with RS".

<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if you understand... if I don't want to rotate/scale something (which would be most sprites), I just set the RS field to 0, which in the RS array slot 0 I'll have pa = 0x0100, pb = 0, pc = 0, pd = 0x0100.  So it'll technically rotate/scale it, but it should display it as normal.
<br/>
<br/>
The missing left pixel sounds like a good reason though.  What a gip.

According to the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.work.de/nocash/gbatek.htm#lcdobjoverview" target="_blank">documentation of the dead no$gba emulator</a>, you can display about 1210 pixels worth of sprites on a scanline, or 954 if you allow writes to OAM during hblank.  A rotated or scaled sprite takes slightly more than three times as much PPU power to draw as a normal sprite.

Which is not efficient in PPU time.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
