    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm working on some tile and palette conversion and editing tools designed for multiple target platforms, designed for use in my programming tutorials. Currently, I have plans to support at least the following tile formats: <ul><li>1bpp (often used for fonts) </li><li>nes (1bpp+1bpp) </li><li>gb (2bpp interleaved) </li><li>vb (2bpp packed) </li><li>ngpc (2bpp packed in a different order) </li><li>snes3 (gb+1bpp) </li><li>nhl (3bpp packed) </li><li>snes (gb+gb) </li><li>sms (4bpp interleaved) </li><li>genesis (4bpp packed) </li><li>gba (4bpp packed in a different order) </li><li>snes8 (gb+gb+gb+gb, used for some snes title screens) </li><li>8bpp (planar, used for mode 7) </li></ul> Are there any other tile formats you'd like to see?
<br/>
<br/>
And what about palette formats other than 5-bit BGR little, used on Super NES and GBA?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe support for higher bit modes, perhaps to support the DS's fancy new hardware?  I imagine that the 2D hardware, though not the main focus, will still be more impressive than any 2D we've seen on yesterday's consoles or today's handhelds.  Maybe 16 and 32 bit modes, or if you're ambitious enough, have plugins to support custom bit depths, tile sizes/attributes, etc. so that you can always add to it in the future?  Maybe even support writing to common PC formats such as BMP, PCX, RAW, GIF or even JPG?  (Though those last two seem unlikely to be of any use)
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Also when reading 4 colour bitmaps conversion tools usually look at the palette in the order it appears, rather than illuminosity; giving you odd graphics.
<br/>
<br/>
And also an export to a *new* *standard* for tiles and maps; I'll help you define the standard if you want, but I think we do need one. Then when someone wants to make their new map editor they can choose the standard for their format :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So does mine. It ANDs each color index with e.g. 0x03 in GB mode or 0x0F in GBA 4bpp mode, assuming the artist knew what he was doing (artists who have completed my tutorial will know).

By "multiple target platforms" I meant that the tool can be used to manipulate graphics to be displayed on several different consoles. Use of C with the cross-platform Allegro toolkit means that the target can also run on multiple <span style="font-style: italic">host</span> platforms. Compare use of "host" and "target" terms in cross-compilers; for instance, DevKit Advance is MinGW hosted and GBA targeted.
<br/>
<br/>
Owners of machines running native GCC on a platform other than Windows can help by doing the following: <ol type="1"><li>downloading Allegro 4.0.3 <a class="postlink" href="http://alleg.sourceforge.net/wip.html" target="_blank">here</a>, and </li><li>downloading <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/pc/#ted" target="_blank">Pin Eight NES Tools</a> and trying to build the tools from source on Mac OS X and Linux host platforms. </li></ol><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Just did an install of Allegro 4.1.14 (seems to have better OS X support than 4.0 does), and everything compiled fine.  But, when I tried to load a .gba file, it completely hung.  When I hit ctrl-c at the command line, it spit out "Bus Error".

you can build up 'brushes' from your tileset that can be used for painting your objects. It also has a 'rubber stamp' mode so you can use sections of your map as brushes.

Yeah, I knew that -- I'm using 4.0 on the Linux box with no issues... it's just the OS X support in 4.0 is very much lacking (no sound, X server only).  Honestly, I don't consider it an OS X version when it requires an X server to run.  It's a Darwin port that happens to also run on OS X.
<br/>

BTW, the incompatible APIs are still there in 4.1 -- it just flags them with warnings during the compile.<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't know about MinGW or wxWidgets, but I do use SDL under Linux, Windows, and MacOS X.  I haven't had any problems, and it pretty much just works for what we're using it for.

Kinda a sensative question there... ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I spent an whole morning trying to get the gcc with cygwin to work when I finally broke down any bought Visual C++ .net for $99.  On all of the other platforms, I had absolutely no problems with using gcc.
<br/>
<br/>
To toss in another wrinkle, I'm also loading code from a DLL.  The DLL code is compiled with gcc under cygwin with no problems (so far -- been working fine for 6 months now).
<br/>
<br/>
So, I'm pretty sure that using SDL and gcc under Windows is possible, I just haven't been able to get it working myself.<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
