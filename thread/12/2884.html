    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Updated; it's been over a year since I last checked this forum :P
<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime I've racked up working experience in GBA, DS/PSP (I group them together because the projects I've been on were targeted to both, heh) and just oodles of other mobile/wireless devices.  
<br/>
<br/>
Two things that have changed is that I have a tiny bit more to show pixel-wise (these still don't reflect my current ability though.. I'll have to do something about that :P) and that my email address has changed: 
<br/>

<br/>
short background:
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a pixel artist with experience in backgrounds/tiling, sprites, animations, splash/cut screens, pretty much every part of production pixelart, although people tend to have a preference for my background work (possibly because my samples don't show much else, oops).  I started out with Amiga, moved on to PC hobby games and started landing my first handheld jobs just in time for the first round of independent DS games to start development, rode the GBA/DS/Mobile boom for a while, and well, I'm one of the ones that survived :P looking at some of my colleagues after the last year or two I guess that makes me lucky :)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by superghost on Thu Jun 23, 2005 7:40 pm; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

Not true.  I'm using Firefox and it works fine (and I like your work).
<br/>
<br/>
In general, if there's a scripted link that doesn't appear to work with Firefox/Mozilla, click it a couple of times.  It's usually the auto-popup blocking that gets triggered by mistake.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank everyone for the positive replies I received in this thread, and via pm/email, and also the offers.  I found a couple really fun projects to jump on and this seems like a good crowd.  Sorry I couldn't help or respond to everybody, but now, a year and a half later, I'm ready for another go.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
