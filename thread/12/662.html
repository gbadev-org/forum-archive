    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently looking for work as a GBA artist. I've got lots of experience designing for low spec platforms like the c64, amiga, and mobile phones, but no real GBA experience. As I really want to break into this market, I've tried to tailor my portfolio towards GBA development.
<br/>
<br/>
So please have a look at my portfolio and let me know what you think:

...and, obviously, if you like what you see, please feel free to contact me. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I like them, they would nicely with GBA if the characters were a tiny bit smaller, and the level with the war was a little bit bigger and detailed. And like said before, maybe more colors.
<br/>
<br/>
Nice work, I like it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would you be interested for designing low poly models and levels (also low colors : 256). I'm working on a 3D engine in ASM and I would like to present it for the compo; I've already done a 3Dengine in C for GBA, so if you wanna check it out send  me your mail.

<br/>
See ya !

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all,
<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, thanks for all the good feedback, both off and on the forums. It's a real confidence booster, although I'm still looking for a permanent position, so I guess I've still got some way to go...
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I've updated the site with some more projects: basically, after looking at  the feedback I've had I decided to broaden the range of work a bit. (And no, I haven't added more colours.)
<br/>
<br/>
So if you've got some spare time, please visit...
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
...and as always, any feedback - or indeed job offer - is very welcome!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
