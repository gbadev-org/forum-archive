<br/>
<br/>
    I noticed there is a competition running at the moment. I am keen to do music for one/some of the entries. :) Preferably an RPG, but I wouldnt mind taking a look at a game in another genre. (I will work for free).
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a sample of my work: <a href="http://geocities.com/chrishmusic/sample.mp3" target="_blank">http://geocities.com/chrishmusic/sample.mp3</a> (copy and paste into your browsers address bar.)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, let me know.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Ack, the link doesnt appear to be working at all now. Stupid geocities. :P I will see if I can upload it somewhere else, sorry for the inconvenience.
