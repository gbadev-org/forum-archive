Just looking for something to do in my spare time while my wife steals my DS, so if anyone is really desperate for some help and doesn't mind explaining lots of things then let me know.

For what it's worth, I'm a professional .net developer and webdesigner. I'm handy with photoshop and enjoy doing graphic stuff just as much as coding.
