    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not so sure who is in charge with all of this because I'm too lazy to check.  But I made a quick logo that I liked a lot and I thought you guys might like it too.  It's for the DevKit Advanced web site, of course.  Check it out:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wanna' know why did my post get moved when this other graphic designer posted a topic just like mine and it's still there.  Kinda' weird.  And I don't understand why this was moved from the graphics forum to this forum.  Most people will go to the graphics forum for graphics, no the help offered forum.

EDIT:
<br/>
And wtf is up with not allowing people to post images.  You aren't even allowing signatures or avatars.  Wtf kind of crap is that?  Forums are for avatars and signatures! lol!  Stupid...just simply stupid.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://lan-con.com/ea/downloads/sig/goodandy_iris_sig.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You're entitled to your opinion, of course, but most users feel this forum is about asking questions and getting answers, not demonstrating your design abilities. Your link does a much better job of that. 
<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, you wouldn't call any of the moderators stupid if you met them face to face, and if you accidentally did they would deserve an apology.

If you bothered to read the types of posts in the graphics forums you would realize in perhaps one or two seconds it is generally not a forum for artists, but for the technical aspects of graphics, both hardware and software related.

This is a developer forum, and the last thing I and most others want to see here is the place littered with avatars and sig images - this is exactly what would be <span style="font-style: italic">stupid</span> in a forum such as this.

<br/>
Great public relations job in a developer forum, buddy.  You've made yourself out to be a 'tard.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The work I've seen from you is pretty good.
