    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm a college graduate with a BA in English and Psychology who would like to branch out my writing skills into the video game industry.   Preferably, writing  background stories/concepts or dialogue for a game.   I'm open to any genre, from RPG to simple action/shooter.   
<br/>
I'm hard working and have ample time to devote to any project that I might take on.
<br/>
I have been an avid gamer since I got an NES as a kid, and have seen and played huge number and variety of games on many platforms.
<br/>
As I'm new to this area of work I'm not looking for monetary compensation (although I wouldn't turn it down) so much as just getting my name on something out there.
<br/>
<br/>
I can be contacted via email at "bldaniels@charter.net"  or often via AIM at "BaronVonHotPants"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
