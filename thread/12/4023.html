Haha, i used to walk past every morning on the way to my van-driving/warehouse job and dream of working at acclaim. Now i just take a different route to work. :/
<br/>
<br/>
Hadn't realised they moved out though(?).
<br/>
Will take a peek and see if they are there if i'm going past, or delivering to dukes92.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yikes!  Good luck.  The only reason I'd start a game company today is to be bought out by a bigger company and make some bucks.  WIth all the consolidation going on right now, the little guys are really getting squeezed.  I'll invest in Real Estate for a bit instead.  A bit more hands off :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
