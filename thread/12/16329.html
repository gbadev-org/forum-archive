Hey Gauauu,
<br/>
<br/>
I am interested in all game ventures. Although, I still need to make a 
<br/>
living and payed work is top priority. With homebrew, pro bono, work, I would have to carefully examine
<br/>
the game and the team's track record. If my schedule permits and the 
<br/>
project is kickass, I would be interested.
<br/>
<br/>
I would say if you are anyone else reading this post is interested in my
<br/>
services, send me an email, no matter the budget and we can talk about
<br/>
possibilities.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
