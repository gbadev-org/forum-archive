    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If anyone is currently working on a DS homebrew project, and wants some QA done on it, give me a shout. I have a DS Lite with an R4, and several months of QA experience at Electronic Arts Canada. Coincidentally, I also have time on my hands, and an interest in independent DS development.

<br/>
Like I said, give me a shout if you want some testing done.

Cheers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
