    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have taught myself C++, HTML, DirectX, ActiveX, Photoshop 6, Paintshop Pro 7, and Fruity Loops (an audio creation app). My knowledge base is wide (especially with science, space, and ancient Asian cultures), so I could contribute to story perhaps. I have been a gamer since the days of the NES, and I have played literally hundreds of games.  I am friendly, hardworking, a fast learner, and I am very willing to spend all of my time (aside from school) on any given project. I have some work I could send to you if you are interested, ranging from sprites to sound to source code.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I have officialy moved out of programming, sound creation, and some image stuff. I am now STRICTLY web-development. I know HTML, XHTML, XML, CSS, and am learning some javascript. I can create proffesional quality (definetly coding) websites. So if any of u guys want a spiffy website, I would be willing to help, and even more willing to help out if you are on a seriose project with possibilites of payment. Contact me if your interested. I create all graphics and code for sites by myself. I could do some sprite editing, but thats somewhat unlikely. The best example of my work would be:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://kuria.org/~tsunami/blogblog/" target="_blank">http://kuria.org/~tsunami/blogblog/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
That is my best website at the moment, it also has some sprite examples if you look around.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
