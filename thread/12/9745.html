Official Nintendo approved Developer for GBA and DS available for contract work. I own both official dev-kits both from Nintendo, and am looking for freelance (fulltime) contract work as an Engineer (coder) on either platform. I only accept paid positions and job options. Stock, equity, partial ownership etc. is not of interest. Please PM for resume and sample code. I am based in California and available on SKYPE and MSN also.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
