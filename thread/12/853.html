    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been dealing with music in different ways (first computer composing, lately more onto playing guitar/keys/drums) for about 5 years, so I know my scales and what notes fit together :)
<br/>
<br/>
a compo example:
<br/>
<a href="http://hem.passagen.se/tenner/spanken.xm" target="_blank">http://hem.passagen.se/tenner/spanken.xm</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I prefer to use fasttracker 2, which saves files in .xm &amp; .mod format (although conversion to s3m is not impossible)
<br/>
<br/>
So what i can offer you, is music, in .midi, .xm, .s3m &amp; .mod formats, and I enjoy making such "simple" music as the ones needed for smaller format games (how about saying chipmusic). I'm not afraid to try another program/interface
<br/>
<br/>
This I'd do for fun, nothing ?berprofessional and nothing I'd take money for (unless you'd be making a million of a possible production :)
<br/>
<br/>
However I have almost no knowledge/skill on howto actually put music into an in-the-work gba game, so no programming skills here whatsoever.
<br/>
<br/>
As I said, I'm not afraid to try new stuff when it comes to actually creating the music (and then I mean interface, not new stuff musically), and as I understand it, the easiest way to get music into your game is to either make it play mods/s3m's/xm's, or maybe using the Boyscout tracker (seen some topics about it though and the importing possibilites doesn't look good), or lastly, make an interface of your own to create the music. If creating such an interface is possible, than I'd be more than glad do try it out, as I bet it would speed up/help the gamemaking process (or whatever u have in mind to do, I'm not just gonna help people desperate of making GAMES :)
<br/>
<br/>
Well, enough rambling, if you have a suggestion or wanna hear more of what I've done (musically) then shout!<br/>_________________<br/>current signature: 7/8</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">nah I don't have a website.. I don't really know what to "show" as my work.. I've done so many different things, but I can give it a shot
<br/>
just gonna look thru my stuff.. 
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://hem.passagen.se/tenner/rasandesolen.mp3" target="_blank">http://hem.passagen.se/tenner/rasandesolen.mp3</a>
<br/>
just a short cover of house of the rising sun, made in a few minutes, not really interesting at all when it comes to composing game music :D
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
this is another compo song (for demoparty in sweden), not as "good" as spanken (in my opinion), but has some nice time signature changes
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://hem.passagen.se/tenner/bolj2.xm" target="_blank">http://hem.passagen.se/tenner/bolj2.xm</a>
<br/>
a very old "classic" (for me :), rather repetetive but it's highly appreciated among my friends so try that out too
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://hem.passagen.se/tenner/ninjai.sid" target="_blank">http://hem.passagen.se/tenner/ninjai.sid</a>
<br/>
I gave a shot on making some sidmusic in a pc sidtracker, and this is one of the songs I made, not that spectacular at all
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://hem.passagen.se/tenner/dimension.sid" target="_blank">http://hem.passagen.se/tenner/dimension.sid</a>
<br/>
this is a cover of a song called another dimension, by a experimental group called "liquid tension" (with 3 members from dream theater in it), the original song is like.. 12 minutes maybe? and it's rather advanced so it's quite impossible cover it completely (unless you work for veery many hours with it)
<br/>
since it's 12 minutes (the original), it's not even near finished, mostly fun if you've heard the original (download it, it rocks!)
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://hem.passagen.se/tenner/ODD.XM" target="_blank">http://hem.passagen.se/tenner/ODD.XM</a>
<br/>
another unfinished song, but this one I really love, it's the opposite of uplifting music, but it's quite wicked and one of my favorites, you may not like it :)
<br/>
<br/>
I've got more stuff but I don't know what to post.. well, give it a listen!
<br/>
<br/>
edit:
<br/>
btw my host doesn't support mp3 that well, you have to rightclick &amp; save as, can't leftclick (works with .xm &amp; .sid though :)
<br/>
<br/>
also this song:
<br/>
<a href="http://hem.passagen.se/tenner/bailando.sid" target="_blank">http://hem.passagen.se/tenner/bailando.sid</a>
<br/>
it's what the title says :)
<br/>
btw you better have a sidplugin to your winamp or a standalone sidplayer
<br/>
search for sidamp, if you need it<br/>_________________<br/>current signature: 7/8</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
you are aware that what I'm offering is musical support? and not that I'm in need of a 3d enginge? :D

if you are.. then I don't know what to reply..

quake-style music.. I can do that<br/>_________________<br/>current signature: 7/8</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you have anything that you feel might be appropriate for quake-style levels?

Was the previous message that oddly worded?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#4295 - tenner - Wed Mar 26, 2003 6:55 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">heh well.. it was just a few words and by looking at the site I got the impression that you thought I was someone who wanted to make my own game and you'd set me up using that 3d enginge.. :)
<br/>
<br/>
hehe well yeah I can do pretty much anything/everything, with varying quality of course, I don't think I'm a super R&amp;B producer or so.. but melodies that would fit a quake-style game, is a no-sweater
<br/>
more of a problem is implementing music into the game itself, but I've read around some more on this forum and it seems there's a good option for playing mods, so that might just work out fine<br/>_________________<br/>current signature: 7/8</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah... no, I figured you did music/sound and was basically saying "if you've already got something that you think fits, we'd love to hear it!"
<br/>
<br/>
Based on your first post, it looked like you did a whole bunch of different stuff, and might already have something that would work well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
