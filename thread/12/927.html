    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, could you post a few examples of your work?  I could probably use some help with our current project, Land of Relics.  It is an RPG for gameboy advance.  We do not currently have a programmer, seeing as we want to finish the design and most of the graphics beforehand.  But yea, if you are interested in helping, we can send you the design doc and script.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, our main website is <a href="http://www.divinus.net," target="_blank">http://www.divinus.net,</a> and the website for the game is <a href="http://www.landofrelics.com," target="_blank">http://www.landofrelics.com,</a> not currently complete.
