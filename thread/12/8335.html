    <h4>#69363 - keldon - Mon Jan 30, 2006 8:56 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am currently on my third year of a four year Computer Science MSci course in Queen Mary's University of London and am seeking a summer internship or work experience.
<br/>
<br/>
Being a member of the QMUL programming team and a skilled programmer, I believe myself to be a valuable asset. In the second year software engineering project I took the role of the main programmer, creating much of the main structure of the cluedo game - and creating the intelligent AI and working alongside our graphics programmer on much of the user interface and graphical features/effects. I am also a talented musician - demos on request.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a game small demo for the gameboy and am currently working on a more complex demo to show my skills. My current demo is a game and watch type game which recieved a 6th place in PDRoms 2.5 (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.pdroms.de/file_details.php?fn=2359&amp;r=10" target="_blank">Sabinov by Keldon Alleyne and David Kirkland</a>).

I would like to know what level of complexity my demo should be at for me to be considered. Please ask any questions on key areas you feel need clarifying.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by keldon on Fri Feb 03, 2006 12:19 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>
