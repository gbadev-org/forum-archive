    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there.. I have a few things I can offer to the DS Homebrew scene.. I'm by no means a coder.. but I used to program c=64 basic (don't laugh:), commodore amiga c, and visual basic 6+ but i couldn't sit down and code something now.. what i CAN offer is:
<br/>
<br/>
- I have used a computer to produce various kinds of electronic music since i was about 14 (i'm 31 now) everything to drum n bass/jungle to trip hop and acid jazz stuff, experimental etc.. i can "build to order", create loops for menus etc. if you are coding something that needs some audio and it's gotta be funky.. or not.. either way.. i'm your man ;)
<br/>
<br/>
- I have done a lot of graphics over the years for various purposes.. I'm photoshop-able. I don't have a portfolio perse &lt;- (did i spell that right?? - purr-say) but if you have an idea of what you'd like, shoot me some specs and i'll give it a shot.
<br/>
<br/>
- I was big into gaming.. FPS's mostly.. ie quake 3, halflife, halflife 2. I got into mapping and made a few maps for halflife back in the day and then again for halflife 2 a couple years ago. I don't do it much anymore but i did enjoy it..
<br/>
<br/>
- Testing. I have tested games and applications alike. I'm also pretty good at coming up with ideas. For the last 3 years, I was part of a software project that unfortunately never got finished (we had only 1 programmer and he was severely over-worked), it recently closed down.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been heavy into the DS since I got it a few months ago, it was the homebrew that got me into it mostly.. I'd really like to get involved in a project for the DS.. 
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you think I'd be able to help out on anything..
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!
<br/>
<br/>
PS.. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/v/MxHUXQK-1yk" target="_blank">here</a> is something i did when i was bored just messing around that shows off a couple skills i guess.. i did the video, the graphics, the map for halflife 1 (non-finished stage) and the music..<br/>_________________<br/>/ . <span style="font-weight: bold"> o 0 avid 0 o </span> . /

I've had lots of volunteers to help with music for my current game, but nobody that has followed through with anything.  I can provide more details in a personal message if that sounds remotely interesting.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>

"Per se" is two words; A Latin phrase meaning "by itself", directly translated its "through itself".
<br/>
Yay Latin! :D<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
