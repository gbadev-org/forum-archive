As an independent developer or small studio you are working around the clock at this time of year to complete the final levels of your game demo for the Game Developers Conference in March 07, right? Although we are only still in November, the conference is not far away, and the major investors and publishers are already planning their meetings. As a game developer you are very well aware that without a good looking game demo, a proper design document, budget, bio and profile, no publisher or investor will sign your game and fund the development cost! Timing could never be better and specialist help is available if you need representation in terms of negotiating a deal or generate awareness in terms of PR &amp; Marketing ? now, during the conference, and after the conference!
<br/>
<br/>
We are a duo of industry veterans with extensive background in the gaming industry, and we attend the annual Game Developers Conference with the exclusive objective of getting YOUR game a signed contract! We can demo your game in private sessions to the global press and investors and publishers; we can hand out PR packages (even write them), distribute your corporate package, and get you editorial coverage in all the major gaming magazines not only on a national but on a global level! But we do much more! Like a Recruiter hunts down talented people, we hunt down investor and publisher deals for your game! We currently have weekly meetings with selected publishers, investors and major studios pitching games for submission and our negotiations will continue until, during and after the GDC; we make it our duty and pleasure to show off your game demo, convince investors and publishers you have a killer game with the ultimate objective of securing funding for your project.
<br/>
<br/>
Your objective is to do what you do best - create a great looking demo, and let us deal with all the logistics! We can write your press releases, your company bio, your team profile, help with your business plan, your budget and all the "other stuff" that typically steals valuable development time; and best of all, you don't need to spend your limited budget on expensive hotels and flights; stay in your office (or bedroom), complete your demo and let specialists represent you and your product on a global level; after all, to succeed in this industry today it is not enough to have a killer game, its about knowing the right people, at the right time.
