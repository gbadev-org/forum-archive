    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, everyone!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm offering to teach some game programming (or general programming) to anyone who can afford a measly $10.00 USD for an hour lesson.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm in the US Central timezone, and am generally available from 10am until 3am mon-sat.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have something you want help with, or have questions, or just wish to learn to program in pretty much any programming language, then please contact me immediately: <a href="mailto:ccpsceo@gmail.com">ccpsceo@gmail.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
If you are seeking to perfect your programming skills, or learn some new ones, then this is an opportunity of a lifetime.
<br/>
<br/>
If you question my ability to tutor, I'll happily give a free lesson, before you commit to paid lessons.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If you just need a problem solved, I'll consider doing it for $20.00 USD flat rate.
<br/>
<br/>
If you've got a project and are looking for an affordable programmer..I don't think you're going to get any other paid coder for less than me.
<br/>
<br/>
So thats the deal.
<br/>
<br/>
Any takers?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
