<br/>
To say that you have much of the content created, and then expect a coder to take them all and get an engine running is, simply put, ridiculous. Unless everyone on the team knows of the capabilities of the target platform, and designs the content around that, then you will expect the coders to be "less than fully trained." In fact, how can you even say that when yourself know very little of coding?
<br/>
<br/>
If you do plan to get someone to code the engine, then everyone else needs to make the effort, and start at the same position as the coder; at the beginning. The "finished" content can be used as a reference, and the engine may lead to using that content, but you can't expect anyone to use them right at the beginning.

We kind of figured that we could convert/redo the content to fit the game. Since we didnt have a playable game, we decided to go as far as we could.

There is no point in deleting the topic.  First of all, your coder is not psychic.  If you can't tell them exactly what you are looking for, they can't make exactly what you want.  A "3D engine" could be anything from Pokemon Snap to Pokemon Stadium to 3D Zelda to Smash Brothers to Final Fantasy Tactics.
<br/>
<br/>
Just keep in mind that a commerical level game engine is a big deal, and if that is what you want, you will need to reassure your potential coder that you have an otherwise commercial level team.
<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, if you don't want a commercial level engine, but you want an complete engine, you will need to reassure your potential coder that you are dedicated to completing your project, that you add something concrete to the project, and that your project is interesting.
<br/>
<br/>
Shrouding your project in secrecy, either for fear of it being stolen or for lack of organized presentable material, is a sure way not to get help.  Right now you need to give as much information about your project as possible so potential help can know A) what you need, B) if they are qualified, and C) if they are interested.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Without an engine or anything close to it, you have absolutely no idea what the DS specifications are.  Even here, each game is able to handle many different quality levels of models depending on what else is going on in the game.  It's an overall CPU/num polys rendered thing.  I shudder to think how much work in the blind you guys have put into a project that may need something completely different than what you have.  Engine Programmers / coders are the first onto a team and last off for good reason.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Correct me if I am wrong but I think that what Miked0801 wanted to say here was that he would be more than happy to join the project as that coder.

And technically, a coder was the first thing on the team; we just need another one.

I have deleted my first post because I believe there is no point in keeping it; it would seem to have brought me with little success. Also,  we have found several experienced C Coders, and have directed them towards various DS coding guides. I know this wont be the same as having a truly experienced coder, but it will help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
