    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am need of money and occupation and thus wonders if anyone is willing to pay me to do some sprite-drawing. Licenced developers and regular salaries are of course prefered but I'm willing to work for anyone and even for royalties.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been working with the GBC and GBA for some years now, though only for personal projects. I and have always done everything myself in my games, so I can do coding as well and am willing to offer my services in that area as well. I would however prefer to work as an artist as I'm not quite as confident in my coding skills.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, check out my latest project "the Tragical Historie of Rodion and Rosalind" at <a href="http://gbax2003.gbaemu.com/" target="_blank">http://gbax2003.gbaemu.com/</a> and if you're interested mail me at <a href="mailto:dunderbertil@hotmail.com">dunderbertil@hotmail.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, uh, I've got a project goin' but my developer is out o' town.  Once he gets back, I'd like to have your assisstace.  I'm sorry, I can't offer money or royalties as we will not be selling the game.  What I *can* offer you is free hosting.  I've set up a deal with some people so everyone who's developing for me can/will have some really nice hosting in return for their services.  You can contact me one of these two ways:
<br/>
<br/>
1) By MSN Messenger at <a href="mailto:Lybib@hotmail.com">Lybib@hotmail.com</a> (Prefered)
<br/>
<br/>
or
<br/>
<br/>
2) By E-Mail at <a href="mailto:lhall@sti.net">lhall@sti.net</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else who wants to help is earged to contact me as well.  Thank you and I'll look forward to hearing from you.
