    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi! :)
<br/>
<br/>
First of all, sorry for my poor english...I'm french
<br/>
<br/>
I'm searching for a motivated programmer who is searching himself for a designer.
<br/>
The type of game I would like to participate is a simple "Point and click".
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a designer on some famous 2D/3D series. (I will let you know later what I've worked for as i don't want the names of the series to be mentioned in public) I'more for 2D. And all in a Cartoon network/UPA style. I can adapt to different styles but I definitly take pleasure  with this toony style. I'm not a pro of video games as i passed most of my carreer working for Animation shows.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm an old player. My favorit games are "DOTT" , "Monkey isand", "Larry's leisure suit", and all those little funny games you have to resolve stupid enigmes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me kow if you are interested to develope this type of game.
<br/>
As me, it would be without any money, just for the fun, during spare time.
<br/>
The aim: just to have fun time doing it, the pleasure to see result and to share it with people. And if it's a succes, why not a second chapter...
<br/>
<br/>
My dream is to see my designs behing alive in a little funny game.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm opened to all type of univers, but the game I would really like to do is a kind of a "larry's leisure suit", with sexy pin up you have to meet, discover, understand and find a way to put them in your bed! :D 
<br/>
All this with a lot of Humor, colorfull Backgrounds, and a "kiddish" mood.
<br/>
Too much games of violence lately. Where are the "point and click" games you do something else than killing? Games that you play just to see beautifull things and read/listen funny jokes, 
<br/>
<br/>
If you miss those games, let me know.
<br/>
<br/>
I will draw for you! ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

People are unlikely to respond to this offer unless you show some example artwork so they can be assured of your skill level.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
