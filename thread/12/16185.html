    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone! I'm new here, but not to the world of Homebrews.
<br/>
I am an amateur graphic working with a friend on a 3D NDS Homebrew. Since our development is going quite slow (due to limited programming skills of the coder), I have enough free time to join another project with someone else.
<br/>
So, I'm looking for a coder who would like to start an amateur 3D racing game on the DS, something like Speed Racer, Wipeout or F-Zero. It's intended to be just to have fun and to improve our experience, since I am in the way of learning.
<br/>
Still, I am capable to create low and mid poly models that just fit perfectly the DS, may they be human figures or starships.
<br/>
I use the following software to create my graphics:
<br/>
-SketchUp (low-mid poly modeling)
<br/>
-3D Studio Max (model optimization, scene setup, UVW Map, Biped, Bones, Animations, export)
<br/>
-Photoshop and Illustrator (texturing and whatever else)
<br/>
I'd like to work with someone that can already develop a 3D engine with collisions and a decent number of polys visualized, without wasting weeks only to get an engine to work properly (consider that our loader can hanlde about 6000 polys at the same time, at 30 fps, but we have to check collisions).
<br/>
If someone is interested, please send me a mail or contact me via msn, the address is in my profile. I will be very happy to start as sooner as we can!
<br/>
<br/>
PS: My site is currently messed up. If you want, I can send you some of my 3D works via mail.
<br/>
<br/>
(And long live SketchUp! Say what you want, but when you need low-poly modeling, SketchUp is always the best! :P)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would you have any interest at all in a GBA project?  A team of 4 coders are in need of some 2D graphics (both backgrounds &amp; sprites) to make a game for Yahtzee.  2 of us have been talking about moving on to the DS, so it won't be a waist of your talent, &amp; might make for some good proving ground on both sides...  feel free to send me a PM if interested.<br/>_________________<br/>-#2pencil</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
However, I found a coder just today, so, for the moment my request is no longer active. Sorry for No2pencil, but good work with your game!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
