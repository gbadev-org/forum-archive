<br/>
IsoCity is a fantastic idea! And looks stunning.
<br/>
I've been playing with a iso, multi-layered platform game engine which is almost complete. I'd love some help with graphics. (ok, I'd prefer someone to do the graphics for me....)
<br/>
Demo in progress at <a href="http://www.multiedge-net.co.uk/gba/demo.gba" target="_blank">http://www.multiedge-net.co.uk/gba/demo.gba</a> final working demo to be posted to <a href="http://www.multiedge-net.co.uk/gba/finaldemo.gba" target="_blank">http://www.multiedge-net.co.uk/gba/finaldemo.gba</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else interesting in making use of this iso engine?
<br/>
See my post under coding for latest progress. I would love to see some nice graphics and a good map for this....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello.
<br/>
I can't say I like the Iso stuff, but that's because yours are ugly, but because I hate the style. Iso pixel art should be drawn AoE/Cossacks style. Anyways, I love your Kid Icarus stuff, especially the rock in the background and the picture of Icarus on the banner (I like the other sprites too).
<br/>
<br/>
If you'd like to work on a top down fly-around-in-a-spaceship-and-kill-lots-lof-big-bosses-to-save-earth style game, look no further, for I am developing one for the DS!
