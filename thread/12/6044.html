Most of it it way to high poly for the GBA/DS consoles but under Game Development\Vehicles you can see some very low poly stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Holy shite dude!  That's amazing!  Why don't you mess around with Flash and Swift 3d.  You could make online cartoons and stuff.  Then sell merch an people would buy it.  Hell, I'd give you a free web site and everything.  I would spoof up your portfolio if you wanted it.  If you are interested in anything, PM me or something.  Gosh, your work is amazing.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://lan-con.com/ea/downloads/sig/goodandy_iris_sig.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
