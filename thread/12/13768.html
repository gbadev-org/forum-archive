No. If it's copyrighted under all-rights-reserved terms, such as a commercial GBA ROM or parts of the official Nintendo SDK, then you're not allowed to distribute it on gbadev.org.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

No one here wants the official SDK or help from those that use it...this is a homebrew site, and homebrew developers use homebrew devkits, like DevKitPro/DevKitARM.  I doubt anyone here wants to hire anyone else either, as homebrew releases are usually released for free, many times open-source.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

dscoder is not offering to distribute the official SDK or any part of it.  He made a professional post.  There is nothing wrong with that.

Clearly dscoder is not a homebrew developer.  You may not know this, but a fair number of professional developers hang out here.  (As far as I know, most of them are homebrew developers who went pro.)

It might sound crazy, but official developers have been hired through this forum.  There is nothing wrong with dscoder letting people know he is available right now.  That is what the help offered forum is for.

The rules state no such thing. Maybe <span style="font-style: italic">you</span> should read <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9484" target="_blank">the rules</a>?

<br/>
That said, there was nothing wrong with the post he made. Had he been a user with good intentions the post would have been fine and exactly what this section of the forum is about. However, this person seems to create new accounts frequently and seems to delete all the posts made by him once he starts to post under a new nickname.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think calcprogrammer1 was quoting from <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=6770#6770" target="_blank">"The basics" in the GBA beginners' FAQ</a>. Is that section now inaccurate?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Its not really relevant in this case because the beginner's FAQ is not the forum rules.
