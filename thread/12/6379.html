    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, people of earth.
<br/>
<br/>
I have little less than 10 years experience with trackers and composing music with computers and I've been thinking about getting some sort of small job from gaming industry, but so far all I've had is some sound effects and music in two series60 mobile phone games.
<br/>
<br/>
I have lots of experience with making soundtracks to demos, but of course having something in couple of games is never a bad thing in cv.
<br/>
<br/>
So here is my offer: I can give you music and sound effects for free for your freeware/open source/whatever freely distributed game and all I want is some sort of proof that I have made something for your game. In most cases this would mean only a rom from your production. If you want something produced by me for your commercial product, then I don't 100% quarantee that I'll give it for free, but we'll negotiate about it.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not very experienced making sound effects, but if you don't require super hyper professional sounds, then I can handle them as well.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some short examples (not full songs) that I made today:
<br/>
<br/>
I have not mixed these any way, they should sound just like the original .s3m's and Krawall should play them fine. All my mods are 100% by me, they don't contain ripped samples or anything.

Background music to puzzle game or maybe some platformers hi-score screen.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
And finally the company that has used my mods in their two games. Unfortunately they don't have any information about their games at that web site, but if you really want something I've made for them, I can send something to you by e-mail.

I'm also usually hanging in irc, but don't get frustrated, if I don't answer immediately. I have screen 24/7 online (usually) and I work 8 hour days and have to sleep sometimes :)

I can send you a customized build of <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/lu/" target="_blank">Luminesweeper</a> using your music if you let me use it in the final version (which will be open source; right now the source is closed because it's in the stage where the cathedral model produces better results).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hah! Nearly identical post to the Audio forum. Tepples, we might just need to stop being so nice. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Sauli, I'd be happy to compile your s3m into any of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.thingker.com" target="_blank">my games</a>. Just let me know if which (if any) you'd prefer.
<br/>
<br/>
You can PM me or email scott (zat) scottlininger.com

Cheers,

The offers by mantrakid and sauli are the same: "I'll let you use my music in your game if you give me a copy of your game with my music." Best case: Some video game developer must be hiring musicians, and this sort of offer is common among musicians looking to break into the game industry. Worst case: <a class="postlink" href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/S/sock-puppet.html" target="_blank">Sock puppetry</a>.

Benefit of the doubt where appropriate is a good way to win friends and influence people.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
