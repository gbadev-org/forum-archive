    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you know Pascal, C and C++, maybe you can be of some help in a little initiative we having brewing over at PGD(Pascal Game Development).
<br/>
<br/>
We are trying to add a GBA target for the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.freepascal.org/" target="_blank">Free Pascal</a> compiler. It already has ARM support and with some more work and interest the author is willing to add the ARM7 support aswell once we have something workable. I have done minor work myself and gotten as far as to make some tweeks adding the actual target to the compiler, but being as I do not know the compiler too well and some aspects of the conversion are beyond me, I could use the help of others.
<br/>
<br/>
I will be creating a page shortly for all of this and even to host the source/port of FPC for GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
You can visit <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pascalgamedevelopment.com/" target="_blank">PGD</a> and read about our efforts in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pascalgamedevelopment.com/viewtopic.php?t=1668" target="_blank">this thread</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The idea is to make a native Pascal compiler that supports the GBA platform.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
