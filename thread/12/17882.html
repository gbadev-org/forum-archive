    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Orange Graphics team is looking for 3d modeling/texturing work, preferably concerned with non-organic modeling/texturing (vehicles, props, architecture) and rigging/animation (Max, Maya). 
<br/>
We can allocate up to 10 artists for any game project.
<br/>
Each of our artists has got 3+ years of game industry experience and is working in next programs:
<br/>
3dMax or Maya
<br/>
Zbrush
<br/>
Photoshop
<br/>
Other tools, including UDK
<br/>
We prefer handling art for massive and long-term projects and can produce everything: characters (limited resources), props, weapons, architecture, environmental objects, vehicles. Prices depend on complexity of work and it's urgency. 
<br/>
Feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@orange-graphics.com.ua">info@orange-graphics.com.ua</a> to request bid for your projects or learn more about our team.<br/>_________________<br/>Bogdan Gursky</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think you have officially moved from a useful help offered advertisement to being a spammer. I wouldn't work with you, and I recommend that others don't as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Mods, can we do something about these guys?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
