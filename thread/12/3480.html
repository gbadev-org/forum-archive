    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm going to be unemployed for the next couple months so I figured now would be a good time to have some fun with gba. I haven't really done anything with the gba but I see a lot of people have done a lot of work to document it and make it easy to develop for.  I've been comnig to this site every once and a while for the last couple of months and wishing I could get involved with something. Well, now I have the opportunity. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a fairly competent C programmer but I've been studying arm assembler a little and would really like a chance to practice it. I'm comfortable with the gnu toolchain so I won't need any coddling to use devkitadvance. I don't have any experience programming games, although I do have a lot of experience playing games. I've already read most of the gba docs and have looked at source code, so I feel I have a pretty good grasp of the gba internals. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for a pretty relaxed group that doesn't mind a newbie gba programmer joining. As I'm unemployed I have a lot of free time to devote towards catching-up on an existing project. I'm not too particular on what type of game, though I am partial towards rpgs and "tactics" type games.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't mind, I wasn't let go from anywhere. I had a job in lower management working in retail. A couple months ago I was rear-ended in a car-accident, but fortunately I wasn't seriously hurt. I did receive a nice chunk of settlement, equivalent to 3 or 4 months pay.
<br/>
<br/>
Together with my previous savings and frugal living, I can comfortably spend the next 6 months unemployed. I'm taking this time to try things I've always wanted to do, such as this and maybe try my hand at freelance writing. I'm also going to be evaluating my life and figuring out exactly what I want to do when I rejoin the work force.
<br/>
<br/>
Anway, I remember how much fun I used to have in high school hacking around on muds when I was first learning to program. It was pretty cool to be in a group like that.
