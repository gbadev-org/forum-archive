    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I used to create graphics? for the fun of it, and I ended up working in the games industry for about 4 years (and know how much hard work it can be ;)
<br/>
<br/>
At the present time I have a lot of time on my hands and I would love to be involved in the creation of a racing game on a GBA. You could say I have a vision of a game that I believe would be very playable and could be created on a short`ish time scale.
<br/>
<br/>
As well as having the ability to design the game and create the graphics I also have a wealth of knowledge with regards to playing games (I know what they are about).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So if you are interested and up to the job drop me an email:

...abit of a chicken &amp; egg situtation really, coder can`t code without graphics, artist can`t draw without knowing the limits (texture size, map size, scale, etc, etc...) - i still might put something together though. At the moment i`ve been messing around with a FP`Shooter editor which is fun.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, my idea isn`t so much an original one, it`s simply an old idea being done in the way i would like to see it done :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the only problem that approaches chicken-and-egg status is that people don't want to join your project unless they see a good demo, and you can't produce a good demo without a good artist and a good programmer.
<br/>
<br/>
Coders can draw stick-figures if they want placeholders, and artists (depending on the approach) can create very high-resolution art that can be downsampled later.  Check out that "Orn" demo for a good example -- the author used Maya for all the actors.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
