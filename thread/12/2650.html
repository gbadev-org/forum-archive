    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a musician and I'd love to make some music for the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
I already have professional experience in video game music composing, and I'm a demomaker (coder/musician) on Amstrad CPC (an old 8-bits computer from 1985, quite famous in Europe). I even coded a soundtracker (STarKos) on this machine. So yes, I know trackers very well (MOD, S3M, XM, IT...), and still continue tracking professionally with Renoise.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT : I've now worked on one commercial FPS for GBA, using S3M format. You can listen to a medley of the songs I did :

<br/>
<br/>
EDIT2 : Now a second GBA game, a great sci-fi RPG. A medley is on my website.
<br/>
<br/>
You can find songs I did from my previous projects on my website, from orchestral to electronic stuff :

<br/>
Thanks for your attention.
<br/>
Sincerely,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Very impressive work!
<br/>
<br/>
Especially "Incubator" sounds great to me and would fit right into my Game Concept's Atmosphere.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortuantely I'm in a very early state, so it will take its time until I'll have a running Sound engine.
<br/>
<br/>
If youre still interested by this time, I would really apprechiate your skills in my Project :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would you be interested in doing tracks for a demo? The music player is very limited, but you can use and MOD tracker you wish.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, just let me know, and I'll tell you what limitations you have.

<br/>
<br/>
We're currently on a project for doing a racing game to enter the next gbadev compo, and we are searching for a sound artist. 
<br/>
After listening to your previous compositions, I found them really good and it would be cool if you could join us for being the sound artist. Please PM if you are interested !
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Jeff.
