I want to make a multilingual RPG.  In each town in the game, the NPCs speak a different language (English, French, Japanese, etc).  If you have a party member that speaks that language, they can translate the message for you.  If you can read multiple languages, you won't need the in game translation to understand the information.  Clearly this is one of the best ideas ever.  I don't know why anyone has never done this before.  Any takers?  Private message or email me if you are interested.
<br/>
<br/>
The above paragraph is both 100% sincere and 100% sarcastic at the same time.  I expect between zero and two responses.  The idea isn't a joke; I'm using it to try to prove a point.  I <span style="font-weight: bold">would</span> be happy to work with someone on this project.
<br/>
<br/>
I also challenge anyone to top my idea; probably with the super secret idea they have that they don't want anyone to steal.  I'm fairly sure it's not as fantastic as they think it is.  For that matter, feel free to rip my idea apart or point out who beat me to the finish line.  Criticism is a good thing.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My idea was a quasi-MMO, but then guildwars came out and everybody just said "oh your idea is basically guildwars... and that game sucked!"
<br/>
<br/>
But it's a tad different, but I am not sure how the mass appeal would be.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically you'd gather your party, either from a friends list or from random people in chat ("Hey guys, anyone interested to complete the lich-quest?") and then depending on the mission / quest you pick, it takes 30-90 minutes to complete. No stupid timesinks "Oh let's all travel to the dungeon for 20 minutes in real time!" as in MMOs, since it's not a persistant world, you're where the action is right away. Of course there is a chance for some random event or to run into other players to satisfy the multiplayer aspect of it all.
<br/>
<br/>
The quests would mostly be dungeonhacks, unless I can think of something clever here, but missions would go out of date and new ones would be added over time to provide some variety. Also, they would be quick, 30 - 90 minutes as I said, to complete, so that regular people can have fun and then log off without having to log in for at least 3 hours on end to accomplish something.
<br/>
<br/>
There would also be special quests that are tied to the main storyline of that quarter year. One season might be dedicated to some undead king and his minions invading the world and unless the players work towards the goal of stopping him, cities will eventually be razed and the world might end (complete character deletion for everyone). These main storylines would have CUTSCENES, which is something painfully lacking in MMOs. As for the cities being destroyed - this is something else that bugs me about MMOs: They claim to be so fantastic and involving, yet everything you do is undone a couple of seconds later, when the monsters you have just defeated are respawning. If you have a big game world with thousands of gamers, why not allow people and / or events to change the world?
<br/>
<br/>
Unique items would actually be unique, meaning that if player A has the sword of backslashing, nobody else can have it. There would be some sort of mechanism to lose the uniques in order to get some rotation.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally I would like to have either some diminishing returns, so that eventually you're more likely to lose things than to improve your situation or even a progression curve that declines after a peak: Every quest of 30 minutes might take 3 month in game time, so that eventually your hero dies of old age after roughly 200 quests.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So would each message be stored in each language? If this is the case, you'd need a lot of people (more than "between zero and two") to help you write the scripts.

I disagree about the "unfair" advantage. Most people wouldn't like to play a game they can't understand anyway, but it might provide an incentive to actually learn the language for some people (bear in mind that I learnt most of my English by watching American cartoons and playing games as a kid).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, even if we assume the advantage is unfair, then I still think the world would be a better place, if we would aim to help the people at a disadvantage, rather than to drag down people that have an advantage.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Of course.  The message API is:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">void message(int pLanguage, int pMessage, int pParameter)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
The parameter is used to print things like numbers and player names.  The conversion routine is stored with the parameter.  More than one parameter can lead to localization mix ups.  ("<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">The tree</span></span> kicks <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">an apple</span></span> and <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">his</span></span> falls on <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Jack</span></span> head.")

<br/>
"Between zero and two" refers to PM help offers on GBAdev.org (still at zero).  Hired help (translation) is a completely different category.  Most people are happy to help if you pay them.  I don't think there are many professional translators on this forum.
<br/>
<br/>
Scripts would be written by one person, in English.  After that they would have to be edited and proofread.  Then they would have to be translated into a number of languages.

Good for them.  Putting real skills to work in a game is a good thing.  Who knows, there might be a disproportionate number of sales in Switzerland, where people can understand most of the game.  =)

Everyone has preexisting skills.  Mario vets bring those skills to new action games.  This really isn't different.

If you know French, you could explore Francetown without bothering to recruit a character that knows French and English.  It's only so much of an advantage.

Sure.  "Hello" and "good morning" become interesting messages if you are in a foreign town and you have a real life basic language book.  "The prince was assassinated by the late necromancer's daughter" might be a little more work.  =)

Then you could allways hire people for concept and script writing. Like me for example. Asking for ideas for games is like asking people to write a book.
