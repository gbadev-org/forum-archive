    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In general, why you say "I can do X", you should be able to provide a sample of X.  Do you do background art?  Animated Sprites?  Can you make a 4 directional isometric character walk cycle that animates at 12 fps?  How about a side view animated stick figure?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can do stick figures easy as ****. LOL and I can do animated sprites without actually making them move thats usually up to the coder am I right?
<br/>
I can do backrounds but I find that lame because I'll also do any effects like smoke dust,  vapor, trails, and others. I need to know what do you want me to do for you though. sadly I don't know how to animate an ISO :(<br/>_________________<br/>eat more potatoes! its starch! yay starch!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
