    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
In a couple of months I will  have some freetime, but I would like to get some brainstorming done before then.
<br/>
<br/>
I've done some Pixel work, but I'm really interested in doing some 3D HomeBrew GBA games.
<br/>
<br/>
Possibly a platform game similair to spidermanDS  or a fighting game would be fun.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the Pixel work I did for the Alloy gba game:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.mindchamber.com/downloads/ALLOYGBA_rom.html" target="_blank">http://www.mindchamber.com/downloads/ALLOYGBA_rom.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
and here is a 3D game Im currently working on:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.mindchamber.com/Botz.html" target="_blank">http://www.mindchamber.com/Botz.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
there is a demo of it in the download section..
<br/>
<br/>
I would love to try my hand at some 3D GBA, Or 3D DS
<br/>
<br/>
just simply give me the texture restrictions, and polycount limits and let me at it. :)
<br/>
<br/>
thanks again.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, I like your style of the GBA games..
<br/>
Im going to make a sidescroller platform shooter for GBA as a school project this autumn (but i will start as soon as possible).
<br/>
Im not going to use the game in any competition though..
<br/>
But anyway, I am really bad at making human looking sprites.
<br/>
And if you would like to, you could give me some help.
<br/>
I'd be really happy if you could, but i cant offer any payment, since I only do this as a hobby / school project.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, think of a hybrid between silent hill and super mario. Dark mysterious horror sprites (monsters (not really zombies, but human-like monsters) and a human main character).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>_________________<br/>yeah, well, maybe... or? anyways.... eh...  what was i talking about??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

hey  sounds cool.
<br/>
as long as I can offer at my site for free Im down..
<br/>
it would be good practice for me since I rarely do humans..
<br/>
<br/>
any examples on the GBA you can give me interms of style?
<br/>
like you want the human sprites to be as cartoony as Mario, or closer to silent hill?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ooh, well, as i havn't done anything yet, i cant give any technical examples.
<br/>
But more silent hill than mario. It's supposed to be a little bit scary, but since it is on a gba, it would be hard to make it all too scary, so maybe some cellshade-ish silent hill..
<br/>
You get what im thinking about?
<br/>
<br/>
Like the Alloy game you linked to, but more silent hill style. horror. scary..
<br/>
<br/>
hard to explain a feeling and a thought :)
<br/>
<br/>
I am very thankfull you know! :D<br/>_________________<br/>yeah, well, maybe... or? anyways.... eh...  what was i talking about??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, Im kinda writing a note to myself now too hehe:
<br/>
<br/>
The map is like Klonoa, but more like a square.. or grid system, or a maze...
<br/>
<br/>
on level 1A for example, you can only complete it in one way, get to the finish, and after every level, a save point.
<br/>
then you can choose to play the level again to gain more ammo or something. 
<br/>
Then on level 3B, maybe you get a special key or something to unlock a locker in level 2C, and in that locker there is a little object to solve a puzzle on level 1A, to go further to level 8D and so on... so there is like a sidescrolling survival horror game.
<br/>
<br/>
*NOTE* Oh, The gameplay style might be like Splinter Cell for GBA! */NOTE*
<br/>
<br/>
the surroundings / backgrounds should be like the houses in your Photoshop tutorial (thats a great tutorial by the way!)
<br/>
But a little bit Darker and dirtier... (maybe a noice filter over it all would be neat?)
<br/>
<br/>
That's my plans for now.. as a little frame of the idea.....
<br/>
<br/>
