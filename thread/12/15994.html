    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am a composer looking for work of any kind at the moment particularly for DS games either aimed for retail or just kicks.  I can do music in any format you need because I've gone from platform to platform and format to format for several years now exploring each and every one thoroughly before moving on to the next.  I have writte and completed a soundtrack for one DS game which is currently in the process of being published.  Also have done numerous PC games and a few web based games.  You can listen to some mp3 samples of my music at <a href="http://www.zackparrish.com" target="_blank">www.zackparrish.com</a> which will tell you nothing about my ability to compose under extreme restrictions, so if you would like to hear some lower quality samples feel free to ask.  I have over 400 MIDIs I can throw out to you.  I did have several module files but a HD crash about half a year ago whiped them out.

Thank you for your time.
