    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there, GBA Game Makers!
<br/>
<br/>
My name is Christian Andersson and I write music for Video Games and Indie Games, game promo videos, etc, using some of the most powerful tools on the market. I'd like to see more GBA games with some really great music, which is why I offer my premium songs very cheap 
<br/>
(much cheaper than the professional music agencies that sell my songs for more than double the price than I offer here...).
<br/>
My music is focused on classical music rich with melodies and feelings. I work 100% with music writing. Right now, I have an album with a full game soundtrack that would fit for Fantasy/RPG/Aadventure/Strategy and War games. If you have a game where you need some music, you can license my music, 100% legally for a very low cost!
<br/>
<br/>
I put a lot of energy and effort in making these tunes, and I hope that it could empower some really hard core game dev enthusiasts like you to use my work in a nice game.
<br/>
These are my sites where you can listen to and license my music.
<br/>

<br/>
Site : <a href="http://www.youlicense.com/Artist/ChristianAndersson" target="_blank">http://www.youlicense.com/Artist/ChristianAndersson</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Here is my "Knight's Tale 3" album:
<br/>
1.  Rejoice in Triumph
<br/>
2.  Tales from the Forgotten Monastery
<br/>
3.  The Desecrated Sanctum
<br/>
4.  Catacombs of Unrest
<br/>
5.  The Sacrificial Chambers
<br/>
6.  In the Halls of the Dead
<br/>
7.  The Ghastly Crypt
<br/>
8.  The Great Adventures of Winterfall
<br/>
9.  The War March
<br/>
10. Victory and Peace
<br/>
11. Wonders - a Hymn to the Creator
<br/>
12. Night Walk in Sleeping Town
<br/>
13. Reaching the Enemy Lines
<br/>
14. Lonely Halls
<br/>
15. King's Market at Noon
<br/>
16. Knight Roland Rides at Dawn
<br/>
17. Audience with the King
<br/>
18. PoorFishermansHut
<br/>
19. BuccaneersSong
<br/>
20. Curse of the Djinn
<br/>
21. The Treasures of Ra
<br/>
22. Little Girl Picking Flowers on a Meadow
<br/>
23. Bard in the Valley
<br/>
24. Bard in the Castle
<br/>
<br/>
All my songs can be re-worked, re-mastered, changed, improved, prolonged and cut - free of cost! New songs will be composed upon request. It is easy for me to cut out and rework short snippets from my full songs, e.g. if you want a Quest Complete from my song "Victory and Peace" or a Game Over snippet from "Day of the Great Battle". I can do these adaptions for no extra cost, and the snippet will then be much cheaper.
<br/>
<br/>
All songs are described with detailed instrumentation, moods, styles and genres. Hopefully you will find something in my web shop that can enhance your game.
<br/>
You don't have to use the default Quick License prices on YouLicense for video game songs. I will accept much lower offers. Just choose 'Make an Offer' in the shop.
<br/>
(To license music for a web clip, it's already super cheap: 8.25$!)
<br/>
You can make manual offers from YouLicense, and I will accept much lower figures for indie game developers, even down to 10$-100$ for complete songs.
<br/>
<br/>
I am also available for hiring for part time / full time or for a project work do complete game sound tracks.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have a MIDI tune that you want to enhance with higher quality, I can do a remake for you really cheap, using top-of-the-line professional tools.
<br/>
<br/>
No matter what, you are always welcome to my site to enjoy all my music, completely free for private listening. Maybe it can inspire you to make a great game! :-)
<br/>
<br/>
My most recent projects include:
<br/>
- In-game tune for a coming FPS game (August 2010)
<br/>
- Dark ghostly song for promotion of an RPG related book (August 2010)
<br/>
- Dark gothic, aggressive style song for the promotion video of the board game RPG Stregoneria (July 2010)
<br/>
- Fantasy title song and in-game tune for an indie game, released for iPad (July 2010)
<br/>
- Music (fantasy/baroque style) for a 3D lab visualization of the city of Malmoe year 1692.
<br/>
- Music for a museum exhibition of a 3D visualization of of a stone age grave
<br/>
- Title music for online horror casino game
<br/>
- Theme music for online game with mafia and James Bond themes.
<br/>
- Music for a Video Promo of a flight simulator
<br/>
- Music for a World of Warcraft horde recruitment promo video
<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards and Best of Luck with Your Games!

Hello there, kusma. Sorry about that. I am not 100% familiar with the GBA requirements on sound formats.
<br/>
When you buy a song, you will be able to download it in raw WAV 44Khz format. This format can be converted to many other formats. 
<br/>
If you don't have the conversion tools, I can help you do the conversion. Note that WAV -&gt; MIDI is not a trivial conversion. 
<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For GBA, the only real practical compressed streaming audio format is GSM.  Playback uses 50% CPU usage.  One minute of audio is 221k.
<br/>
<br/>
If you allocate 8MB to the music, you can fit about 18.5 minutes of audio in a game.
<br/>
<br/>
But GSM is a low quality format.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I see, and thanks for letting me know about this.
<br/>
<br/>
I checked my tool chain, and I have the possibility to convert the raw WAV format to GSM format, as you mention.
<br/>
<br/>
What is the "normal" sound/music format for GBA? If I understand you correctly, GSM is not the optimal music format. Maybe MIDI is the most common format on GBA, then? 
<br/>
<br/>
I was just assuming that the GBA was capable of rendering very high quality audio (e.g. like most modern handsets can nowadays render highest quality mp3 with gives a really good sound experience), but I guess that is not the case yet with GBA. Maybe it will be possible in future versions of GameBoy.  In that case, my sincere apologies. Let's save this thread for the future, then. :-)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">normal music format for GBA is Protracker or one of it's many descendants - XM, IT etc. DS is similar and, being honest, prerendered audio in portable games is a bit of a cop out, whether or not the machine can handle it.
<br/>
<br/>
For incredibly good use of game background music have a look at de Blob on the Wii. The music there progressively builds up as the game proceeds, based on the actions of the player. The Wii is powerful enough to mix a number of mp3 channels in real time so that's possibly how it's done there. For lower spec systems like Nintendo's handhelds you'd have to do that with a multi channel sequenced format.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow... so the ProTracker is still alive, that's really cool!
<br/>
<br/>
I was actually writing music for the demo scene during the Amiga 500 time (NoiseTracker), but also on ProTracker for PC. But that was long time ago. I had no idea those trackers were still used commercially, but I'm not very suprised. Those trackers can really produce some awesome music.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, then. Thanks for letting me know!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The official GBA developers mainly used the same playback library, MP2K (sometimes called "Sappy" by hackers).  Developers made a bunch of MIDI files for all the songs in the game, then one MIDI file for each sound effect, then also provided instrument samples and sound effects samples.  Then all the MIDI files were run through a converter into a more compact format, which compresses the music data very well.
<br/>
Because it's including its own set of samples, it is very similar to MOD format music, but when you look at the data itself, it resembles MIDI more than MOD.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah...  Well, I guess that using my music production software and hardware worth 4000? to produce orchestral music for this kind of small handheld devices is maybe a bit overkill, then... ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the information you have provided here. I have learned something new, and I was also reminded about the good old Amiga 500 MOD-times, which was nice. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the good work, guys!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My handle was "Craze" or "Craze the King". However, I was not famous or anything. I was mainly the assembly coder in a small unknown Swedish group. We did some small intros. My best "scene contribution" (if you can call it that) was probably a little shooter-game on the Commodore C64 where I used some really great tunes from Jeroen Tel and Matt Grey and used them with my game. :-)

The good thing with this game is that you could easily build your own maps.
