<br/>
<br/>
I am foremost a graduate of the IADT ( International Academy of Design and technology ) .... but to hell with that! I love games and I want to work on expanding my portfolio by working on more low polygonal type work so I'm looking to dive into ds development titles.
<br/>
<br/>
I have more spare time on my hand so if there's a serious developer
<br/>
out there who's willing to make a good game and spark my interest
<br/>
then by all means don't be afraid to drop a line! I'm a friendly guy and
<br/>
can't wait to hear all your great ideas and even if i cant help you out 
<br/>
a lot I can always help a little maybe! Just be sensible!
<br/>
<br/>
Payment is negotiable and some of my work can be seen here :
