    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I am a 3d designer that is particularly interested in modeled for low end hardware! I just love the challenge and when I stumbled across these boards I thought it would be cool to work on an actual project where my models come to a good use! ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Here is some of my low-end work:

I'd really like to join a game project with you if you:
<br/>
A) Need a 3d artist
<br/>
B) Are a serious programmer, dedicated to finish your project(dont want to work with script kiddies hehe)
<br/>
C) Would like to cooperate with me, and are patient enough to do so(Im guessing I will need some training to get an actual model in game hehe).
<br/>
<br/>
So...... send me a PM if youre interested! :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unfortunately I have many weeks of my DS development time dedicated to the current project, but if you're still around when that gets finished I'll definitely hit you up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey, spoon. Since you are a low poly graphics artist, you can probably answer something i have been curious about (sorry, is offtopice, but, oh well)
<br/>
How much can you reduce the polygon count on a 3d model of a humanoid character and still make it appear ... well, humanoid?
<br/>
:D

choice. from certain angles you will not see the shape of many polys. just look at psone games closely. they just pick the right polys in the rigjt place</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
