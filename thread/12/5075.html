For review I have created this week-end a small demo to prove some of my programming skills. Please keep in mind I am not a graphic artist. This is also why I think this small memory game proves more than moving a small sprite on a map ;). Here is the link to my demo:

Had little time today afternoon so I have created some effects and implemented some of them on the start sprite ;). Also worked to a small time bar class and soon I'll post another update. I don't have an GBA to test my code (only an DS but no flash card). So I could test my code only with some emulators. If you find any errors by running my binaries on real hardware please let me know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Had again some little time -the week-end has just started ;)- so I finished my time class and added it to the project.(mind the graphics please) Doesn't do much for now, just resets the tiles when it gets to 0. Also it should decrease every second and I calibrated it for 10 seconds. (I say it's precise 10 sec but ehh, you might want to chalenge me.) Anyway on this emulator is very hard to tell... 
<br/>
I'll work a little this week-end and add more tiles and a menu maybe. I want to start to work on a snake game also. Let's see how much I can do this week-end. 
<br/>
For the ones that can't find the link in my first post here it is again:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think very many game companies cruise this web site. Your best bet is to find out what companies exist in the areas you want to work in, and apply to them directly. EA is out in Vancouver, Ubisoft in Montreal, and there are a bunch in-between. 
<br/>
<br/>
Try googling "Canadian game companies"; <a class="postlink" href="http://www.magma.ca/~dhlf/gamejobs.html" target="_blank">this list</a> came up when I did, but it clearly is far from exhaustive. I recall there being a Japanese company with an outpost in Toronto... I forget its name, but as I recall successful applicants would work in Japan for a year before returning to Toronto, so that sounded pretty cool.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks a lot for your help.. I'll try to apply to some of the companies you provided. However I dont' think I can go to Montreal since my french let's say just isn't at desirable standards. Also Vancouver it's a little to far from me. I'm on the East Coast.
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile I just cleaned up a little my code and started developing levels. Finishing the first level in time will provide access to to next one.. Not much anyway but I've started also work on my snake game :).

Word up. Plenty of anglophones living in Montreal. I'm sure it would sweeten the deal with Ubisoft if you were billingual, but I wouldn't expect it to be a deal-breaker either.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus, you don't know if they'll hire you or not, but you can pretty much be guaranteed they won't consider you if you don't apply.
