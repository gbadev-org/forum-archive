    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a skilled and dedicated sound designer and composer looking to create bespoke sound and music for a new DS or GBA project, and to lend a hand wherever i can. After playing through some homebrew titles, it seems to me that something most could really benefit from is some detailed sound effects and composition work. Sound work can drag a player straight into the game world, or send them running for cover, I'm here to do the first one!
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br/>
I'm looking to work unpaid on a homebrew project primarily, though of course million dollar contracts will be considered ;)</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a huge RPG fan, but would love to work on any project with an enthusiastic dev or team who want to make the best game possible. I'm familiar with various next gen console midleware ie. I understand the rigours of developing.
<br/>
<br/>
I've developed Neochip which emulates the NES sound chip as a VSTi plugin: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/hipotion" target="_blank">www.myspace.com/hipotion</a>

Here is my game influenced dance/rock music: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/neogear" target="_blank">www.myspace.com/neogear</a>

Here is my singer songwriter work: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jgharding" target="_blank">www.myspace.com/jgharding</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I also create video at work, mostly simple animations and the like, but this and my GUI skills may also be usefull on a small team. Here is a link to some video work: <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/jgharding" target="_blank">www.vimeo.com/jgharding</a>

<br/>
All the best,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not currently working on any projects, but would like to say that I like your music - singer/song-writer and 8-bit electro-rock. It's interesting and you seem to be quite talented.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi anonymous coward! Good name!
<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks for the compliments! Do add me up if you have a MySpace, as i'm releasing a record in November which will be on Spotify etc and i'll bulletin when it's up.
<br/>
<br/>
I wish it was the day job!  At the moment i do a lot of after effects animation and sound, so it's not bad, but I have been trying to break into game sound for a while as an in house sound guy, as it's much more of a passion than TV. I'm always turned down on experience, despite the portfolio, so i really need to get working with someone on a project!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm really passionate about scrolling shooters too, and i'm a big Nobuo Uematsu fan, as well as a geek for sound effects! Surely someone must be making a good scroller out there that needs some killer booms and tunes?!
<br/>
<br/>
All the best,
<br/>
<br/>
