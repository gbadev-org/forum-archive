 I would assume that the 18 years includes MIDI. And he is merely stating that he has 18 years of experience in creating music.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Turning .ogg into .mod or any other tracked format is called a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version" target="_blank">cover version</a>. For one thing, where did you get the .ogg file, and do you have its multitrack source code?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The sentence I quoted clearly stated 18 years of experience in a series of audio-formats. I find that quote to be inaccurate and most importantly misleading. I would suggest it to be rewritten.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The point of the post is to say I have way more than enough experience backed up by a solid portfolio. I am not a newbie, I do this stuff commercially for a living.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're inexperienced each format is different. To me XM or S3M or IT to me is the same thing, just slightly different effect commands. Really for me  the extensions are meaningless. I've had enough experience writing in all formats to switch between them seeminglessly. I've written in excess of 300 tracked format songs, and probably in excess of 160 midi tracks and have tracked in all the listed formats since they've been out.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The only one which is slighly different is 4ch .MOD format. Commercially it's the worst format to use, and I don't know any developers using it any more. I would seriously recommend a developer use the native GBA or DS Nintendo audio drivers than use a 4ch .MOD engine.
<br/>
<br/>
"Porting" an .OGG into a MOD format is not magic. I have done it many many times. It is really time consuming process to make it sound similar. Not only do you need to create each instrument so they are similar sounding to the originals, but then having to convert by ear note by note, and manually keep track of channel restrictsions. It's not a cheap way to do things. The only customers I have had that want porting done are ones who do movie or TV based titles and need the original music and have adequate funding to cover the process.
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly you need to have licensing rights to use the original music.<br/>_________________<br/>DS &amp; GBA Audio Professional

<br/>
Do you have the multitrack source for this .mp3? If not, then how was this .mp3 created? It might be cheaper for the OP to turn it into a mod/s3m/xm/it if you have the multitrack source.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
