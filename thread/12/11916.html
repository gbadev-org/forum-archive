    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi.
<br/>
I would like to get in contact with a developer or a development team that is programing for a game or a application for NDS and in need of graphics (GUI, ingame elements, characters, illustrations... basicly anything).
<br/>
I find the NDS platform extra interesting for developing. It's not so far along and still have alot of potential useful applications and good ideas for gaming.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm attaching this images, although it's far from perfect, but in my oppinion it's a good idea for a application. This is not a request though, see it as a application for a job. I'll probably add a few illustrations soon aswell.
<br/>
<br/>
So if you need a graphical desiger who has a lot of time on his hand the next following mounths, send me a PM.
