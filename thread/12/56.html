Offering to freelance help on a project ("virtually" of course), as long as you can live with my learning curve. I have already compiled and run my obligatory "Hello World" so am past that. Currently working on my own project to port a w9x game to GBA.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey,
<br/>
<br/>
I just recently became interested in helping to develop or developing myself anything to do with the GBA.  I am 12 credits away from recieving my BS in Computer Science, but unfortunately do not know anything when it comes to the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
I have started reading some of the tutorials offered on the website and am interested in helping any way possible.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a strong programming backround in Java and C/C++ and it seems to me that most everything is done in C++ so I may be able to help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
