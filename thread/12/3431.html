    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Eh, what the hell. I'm a somewhat experienced GBA programmer if there is any freelance/hobbiest game developers out there. I'm, again somewhat, knowledgable in C and C++ as well as the GBA platform. I'm not looking for work or anything, I was just wondering if there is anyone who wants to get together and make a game just for fun. Like I said what the hell, maybe there's someone or two out there that has an idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">IT's kind of odd to see a programmer offering his services :P If you look in the help wanted section it's all "Programmer needed!" and in the offered section its "Artist/Composer/Prositiute Looking for work" :P 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I'd like to talk to you in real time on aim or MSN or a chat program. My Aim is Draffurd and It looks like my msn is listed. I've got a duffle bag ful of ideas that my coder friend and I have thought up yet he doesn't want to put any effort into coding them. Anyways I'm a fairly experianced 2D artist and Composer so you won't have to look far for one of those. In fact The Toronto Jazz Orchestra Just Played one of my Latin Bigband charts I wrote last year. :) So email/Pm me and we'll talk.
<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to disscussing this further with you perhaps working with you in the future.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know that this isn't the intended subject of this topic, but I am also a programmer interested in leisure gamedev. My experience is mainly programming for GBC/GBA, although I do posess some modest art abillity. 
<br/>
My main problem is a lack of predictable free time from my job, making it difficult to finish projects. I'm looking perhaps to collaborate with another programmer/designer, and lighten the load when I can, but not feel pressured when real work predominates my time. I'm usually able to find some programming time a few days a week, it's not like I'm tied up for weeks on end, it's just difficult to predict in advance since my work schedule is so erratic.

PS- The Toronto Jazz Orchestra? That must be quite an honour!<br/>_________________<br/>I'm just off to Hartleypool to buy some exploding trousers. Cluck, cluck, gibber, gibber, "my old man's a mushroom", et cetera.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
