--- Comments ---
<br/>
I figured I'd give running a contest a shot.  The rules are above.  They were written in the standard one sided manner that makes things simple for the organizer.  Much still needs to be figured out and clarified, but that will come with time.  I'm certainly open to questions, concerns, comments or suggestions.

The contest is off to a fantastic start with a generous prize donation from Keith Epstein, the engineer behind the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.kionix.com/gbaccelerometer/" target="_blank">GBAccelerometer</a>.

Excellent.  There are now two judges, including myself.

Or maybe three.  =)  If you are a judge, you can enter, but your entry will not be scored (ie, you will not be ranked, so you can not win any prizes).  If you just want to make something and don't care about prizes, judging would be a fantastic way to get a GBAccelerometer.

<br/>
If you want to help out <span style="font-weight: bold">and also</span> enter a scoring game/demo, you could become a volunteer organizer.  I assume the first five judges who need GBAccelerometers will get them in time for the first status update ranking, but that is up to Keith.
<br/>
<br/>
If this contest goes well, I might have a GBAccelerometer Contest 2 so everyone who gets the hardware can continue to use it.  =)

You can judge or volunteer.  There is nothing for volunteers to do at the moment, but that may change.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I'm interested!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm interested in becoming a judge for the competition, but I have absolutely no experience with a GBAccelerometer.  How the judging is going to work?  I saw on the site something about tallies and scores.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the page doesn't quite work on AOL... I've had it open for at least ten minutes and it's still trying to load images.  When I first opened it, it wouldn't let me scroll or do anything until the background loaded.  Although it might have something to do with me being on dail-up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The GBAccelerometer plugs into the link port on your GBA.  Software properly programmed to work with the GBAccelerometer will "magically" detect tilting/motion if the hardware is there.

<br/>
Every submission will get a score.  The one with the highest score will win.  The exact scoring scheme has yet to be determined, but I think points will be awarded for: quality, open source and quantity of reasonable entries.  If someone can pull off fifteen quality entries and everyone else only does one or two, that person will probably win.  Then again, if one of those one or two is clearly better than everything else, it will win.

I can't get the online version to work with IE6.  This is funny because the offline version works fine with IE6 and the online version works with every other browser.  I'll try to fix the page and prepare a downloadable version of the rules.

    <h4>#130957 - The_Perfection - Sat Jun 09, 2007 5:37 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I gathered that GBAccelerometer worked as such, as I have played with a Wii-mote which I gather is similar - to an extent.  If I remember correctly, the Wii-mote has silicon springs attached to a small weight placed between them.  Based on the current between the springs, a direction can be determined by combining the different axes together.  (So much for "magic"...)  Now - I have no idea if that's how the GBAccelerometer works, but if that's the case (or something similar,) I think I have enough knowledge to be a judge of this kind of competition.  I'm also one of those people who, if there's a glitch, will find it.  In many of the comercial games I've played, I've found at least one.
<br/>
<br/>
If it's okay with you, sign me up to be a judge.
<br/>
<br/>
So the points would be cumulative per person, if they send in more submissions, correct?  I like the idea.  I don't quite understand the open source part of it though.  Would they get points for it being open source or should there be another requirement along side it?
<br/>
<br/>
And I got back on the site again and was finally able to see what a GBAccelerometer looks like.  (Last night it was so streched out, all I could tell about it was that it was purple.)
<br/>
<br/>
I only have GBAs, no GBA SPs, but they are both in working order, including the link-port.  One of them has a sticky right button, but that shouldn't be much of a problem as the other one is in excellent condition.  I also have an EZ-Flash II GBA flash cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is still going.  The rules need to be clarified/finalized.  The current rules need to be split into 3 or 4 documents (entrants, judges and other).  After that is done, the rules may be translated to French (time permitting).  There has been a shocking amount of links to the contest rules from French pages.
<br/>
<br/>
Life has put some high priority things on my plate right now, but the contest will come to a conclusion and all entrants will be judged (even if all the judges bail and I have to do it myself =).

...speaking of which, another contest similar to this one is being planned.  Anything that could have been entered into this contest will be a valid entry in the next one.  If anyone was working on something that for whatever reason was not submitted this time, it is probably worth finishing and submitting it to the next contest.

This certainly was not abused this time, but for the next contest this will need to be changed to:

1 point <span style="font-weight: bold">per complete game</span> submitted by the same author
