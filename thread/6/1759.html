    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I do not understand why you can sell a portable MP3 player but not a flash cart on ebay.  It is a double standard in my opinion.  How does everyone else feel?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You would have to agree that despite our "fair use", the majority of flash cart users are just interested in playing the latest commercial rom on it. Ebay don't want to get into that whole grey area, so just ban the lot.

Plus Nintendo are a lot more likely to get shirty about you selling one of these than the record companies are about an mp3 player. After all, I have an mp3 player here that's made by Sony. Are Sony going to say "hey, your harming our record sales by using mp3s!" and then sell you an mp3 player a week later?

What I wish Ebay *would* crack down on is the selling of pirate game carts. I know that we know what to look out for (shipping from Hong Kong, box but no instructions, too cheap to be true, etc) but I'm sure a lot of regular folk have been burnt recently. Seems like half the carts on ebay are pirate ones at the moment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have a funny story related to this.  A while back my brother bought some Japanese Pokemon carts (Gold and Silver) on eBay.  They arrived, and I think everything but maybe the clock worked properly.  At any rate, the SRAM didn't work on one of the carts.  The seller sent us a new cart.  It didn't work, and by that time the sram on the other cart had died.  We contacted the seller, and were sent a couple more cart.  One of those didn't work.  At this point the seller stopped repsonding.  I think the SRAM on one of those carts still works... I'd have to ask my brother.
<br/>
<br/>
Later his friend ordered a couple more Pokemon carts.  They didn't work for long, if at all.  That seller was not as nice.  At any rate, I don't get my games on eBay anymore.  (Nor do I get DVDs from online stores.)
