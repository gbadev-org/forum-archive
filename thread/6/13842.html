    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think this is a great compo theme.  It will be interesting to see the entries, especially how the differences between DS and GBA are handled.
<br/>
<br/>
One possible way to "emulate" the DS touchscreen on the GBA is with a method like <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=13781" target="_blank">Ant6n's</a> where he uses the tilt of the GBA to move a cursor.
<br/>
<br/>
How will people handle having only one screen?  Are we going to see games with a split screen?  If you rotate the GBA sideways, then split the screen, each section has the same aspect ratio as a DS screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Considering most ppl don't use the FULL potential of NDS homebrew, it should be pretty easy - the only part is converting stylus control to regular controls - in fact I don't see any problems with this at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Let's see how people will like the topic - so far I did not had any proper comments, which is pretty much a pitty... oh, and if anyone has connections to put those news on matching scene-sites, please do so :)
<br/>
<br/>
I will try to increase the amount of prizes, currently writing mails to other potentional sponsors.
