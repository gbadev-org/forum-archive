    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello Everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to announce the Bricks-OS project. Bricks-OS is an operating system for game consoles.
<br/>
<br/>
The list of currently supported game consoles:
<br/>
<ul>- Gameboy Advance
<br/>
- Nintendo DS
<br/>
- GameCube
<br/>
- Playstation2
<br/>
- Playstation Portable
<br/>
- Wii
<br/>
- i386 PC (not really a Game Console :-)</ul>
<br/>
The list of current features include:
<br/>
<ul>- Preemptive multitasking (even on the GBA and NDS)
<br/>
- Message passing
<br/>
- Hardware OpenGL implementation (on some consoles)
<br/>
- Software OpenGL implementation (for all consoles not supporting hardware 3D)
<br/>
</ul>
<br/>
Binary versions of the latest release (v0.0.3) can be downloaded, demonstrating a Software OpenGL implementation (GBA, GC, Wii, PC, PSP), and a Hardware OpenGL implementation (NDS, PS2). The source can be downloaded using SVN, hosted by sourceforge.net.
<br/>
<br/>
Please take a look at my website for more information, screenshots and downloads:

<br/>
<br/>
This is my first release, so please let me know whet you think.
<br/>

How do you plan to respond to today's IOS changes that block installation of fake-signed channels?

There are multiple definitions of "game console".
<br/>
<ol type="a"><li>Computer primarily designed to play interchangeable video games. </li><li>Computer primarily designed to play interchangeable video games, and having enough controls and a large enough monitor for more than one player on one machine. </li><li>Computer primarily designed to play interchangeable video games, and having a lockout mechanism to block the use of video games made by indie developers. </li></ol>

The market failure of the past couple decades is that nearly all B are also C.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I don't know about that, but Bricks-OS is only provided as a .dol file for the Wii, I'll leave loading the file up to a loader.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
