    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all, i guess you have all seen the GBAX compo news, and i thought of some things....
<br/>
Normaly the ones that wins is the ones with the best graphics and sound (and gameplay, of course), but this year you can also submit emulators, so i guess that a SNES emulator would get at least a 3rd place in the compo....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here are some questions for anyone involved in running the competition:
<br/>
<br/>
What is the legal position regarding the ownership of competition entries?
<br/>
<br/>
If I enter, will i retain complete ownership of my game, Or will the organisers retain all rights to distribution (or even possible sales)?
<br/>
<br/>
I have a game demo, thats in no way complete, but i'd like to have the freedom to develop it further without worrying about ownership issues.
<br/>
<br/>
Do they want an open licence for the game, or a licence to freely distribute only the version that I send?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
cheers

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After your entry has been judged and the winners etc have been posted on the site, your entry will be available to the public to download.. we will not sell or make profit from any entries. After this time you can do whatever you want with the entry, release new versions with improvements, sell it, whatever :)
<br/>
<br/>
I hope that answers your questions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
