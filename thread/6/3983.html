    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just out of curiosity it seems that many will enter and many will not. I am just wondering around how many the entries will be.

(I might 50%, but it still would be good to enter another game just in case. Any coders avalable?)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Too little space, seems to prefer an action style game with a heavy tile/sprite reusage rate.

I will be impressed if someone can make a full RPG with an ending that isn't of the dungeon exploring variety</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I might enter but only if I coincidentaly make a game that qualifies. Like I'm playing with a 2D space adventure game right now, if it's up to scratch I may enter it but I'm not gonna be too upset if I don't.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">wow that little entering so far? I wonder if this will be a compo or whoever just has a game. Also I see many can not do it because of time well then maybe you should make another game that is not so time consuming. :|
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a suggestion for the compo. How about if we take away one big game and replace that spot with many mini games? You know like Tetris, small casino games, puzzle games etc. Just a thought.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My team is in. And yes, you will see an RPG with an ending. It won't be twenty hours of gameplay or lots of cutscenes, but it will be a complete story arc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No? hmm well over a billion people in the world so that is a lot of no?s. lol Well I get what you mean, but you can edit it and put a no right?
<br/>
<br/>
Also how do the poll results look like to you? What if only 4 people enter then what?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
(Not that I'm entering... I don't have time. But if I was entering I don't think I'd bother with the poll.)

<br/>
maybe "lack of time" means insufficient spare time to work on anything for a compo as opposed to having an idea that will take longer than the time allotted for the compo.
<br/>
<br/>
For instance I'd consider tidying up Super Snowfight if I had a couple of weeks spare but I currently have other commitments.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
