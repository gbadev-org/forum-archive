Suspecting that Kojote does not actively read this board, I tried to sign up for the official pdroms.de board, but I can imagine how some people would have a problem signing up. The registration requires correctly answering a visual CAPTCHA, with the notice:

The visual cofirmation is a security thing for me and the users of my webboard, btw the GBADEV.org webboard has exactly the same visual confirmation if you try to sign up. please understand that this adress i gave is readable by possible emailspiders and i surly will not give a my adress into that field. It's easy to find out my regular e-mail adress. It's on my page, you can do a whois on pdroms.de/.com and will also get a valid email adress back. i wonder why are beeing so agressive just because i want to protect myself from spam.
<br/>
<br/>
btw abscissa is right :) as eg the snes is in category 2 too along with gba and gp32 it would be unfair that gba and gp32 users could use "real" 3d while it would be a bit hard for snes coders to do the same. they would have to put much more effort into their code... that's why everything should be 2d. just imagine what kind of nice 3d stuff you could do with the dreamcast which is also in category 2.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Kojote</span>

I looked five minutes ago, and forum.gbadev.org does not have a CAPTCHA, but that's beside the point.

In that case, one minor modification to the phpBB code, namely linking "Administrator" on the form to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pdroms.de/staff.php" target="_blank">the staff page</a> rather than to a useless address, would satisfy everybody.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT:</span> Now the e-mail address has been changed to "webmaster(at)pdroms(dot)de" which works better. Thank you. Now that that's sorted out, I'll take further issues there.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Dang Graga, thought you learned a thing or two at tUM - it's all about FUN, and not about warfare.

<br/>
Anyway, guess there'll be an entry for the PDROMs compo by us again, if I make it in time. We want to create something quite sophisticated, but I'm rather busy at work and with moving to a new flat, and the amount of required graphics will be really immense.

You should be able to use sprite scaling. I think the point on this subject of "3D" is that maybe you can use 3D, but the gameplay cannot be revolved around that (kinda like Ikaruga, which was 3D, but it was really gameplay on a 2D perspective). I've never played it, only seen screenshots, so what I just said may not be completely true, lol.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Using audiolibs is perfectly okay

<br/>
About the 3d things...
<br/>
you can have "fake 3d"... that means it looks 3d but is basicly maybe 2d animation... didn't iriodion hat real 3d sequences in it? i just don't want to have a _real_ 100% 3d game. dreamcast users could surly do more if they use real 3d, and gba users probably not. this rule has just been made to secure judging is even more fair. a little bit of 3d faking is okay, but no real 3d :-)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Kojote</span>
