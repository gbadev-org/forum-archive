    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The devkitPro windows installer has been released. This application will allow you to selectively download and install components of the devkitPro toolchains and later update them as required. The installer/updater even checks for updated versions of itself and will download and run the new installer. It doesn't get much easier than this.
