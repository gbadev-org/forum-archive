    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After 3 years, I have finally finished my action-adventure gba game, Anguna.
<br/>
It is a zelda-esque adventure game, with 5 dungeons and a large overworld to explore.
<br/>
<br/>
Screenshots, downloads, etc, are available from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tolberts.net/anguna" target="_blank">http://www.tolberts.net/anguna</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
To promote it, I'm also having a contest:  the first person who can find all the powerups in the game will get a free copy of Anguna on a flash cart.  Details about the contest are also on the Anguna website.  If you download it and play it, please let me know if you have any comments or feedback!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
But so far it seems like it's kind of missing a real story ... (quite like the first Zelda)

To give it more "depth" - I think it really needs a story, so the most simple and still good thing would be to add a "journal" which now and then automatically pops up and has some text to read...
<br/>
And if there are people here anyway playing the whole game, they could contribute to it...
<br/>
<br/>
Just some ideas (I won't have time to really play it .. :-/ )
<br/>
<br/>
So really nice work, keep it up to give it more depth and it will be better than MOST of the commercial games - it's already better than a lot !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's definitely missing a real story.  That was by design -- the goal was to make a game with the older style of gameplay typical back in the day:  exploration, no hand-holding, no pesky story getting in the way ;-)

Doesn't matter, as long as you don't "cheat" (defined as rom-hacking, reverse engineering, etc).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'm updating the contest page..I found a minor bug that makes a certain powerup harder to find than it should be, so go ahead and email me if you get above 95% completion :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
A couple more glitches I found (I have had plenty of time to analyze the early parts of the game, as they are all I can play right now)
<br/>
<br/>
-Possible issue for ur contest (maybe u have been informed): if you find a powerup, but don't take it (I don't wanna say where it is.... eeeh!) and then leave the screen it is in, when you come back it is no longer there. I can pm u more bout this one if you don't already know.
<br/>
<br/>
-Other thing I noticed (very small glitch) is that in some side facing doors (maybe just left facing?) you can walk into it so that you are partway in the wall next to it. Nothing major.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i found a heart powerup by shooting a bush with an arrow, and did not have the dynamite needed to reach it. i made a mental note of the location for later. now that i have found where to purchase dynamite the powerup is no longer there.
<br/>
<br/>
this means i have to start over now to 100% the items, correct?
<br/>
<br/>
i guess you can't really call this a bug, because i did not get it. perhaps you can think of it as though someone else happened along and did get it. if anything this makes 100%-ing the items that much harder. was this design intentional?
<br/>
<br/>
a few suggestions i have so far:
<br/>
in options select the map then exit options, next time you enter options it should be at the map. leave it on the last thing the user looked at.
<br/>
<br/>
item percentage display.. so we know how we are doing =)
<br/>
<br/>
bugs:
<br/>
sometimes doors don't shut and when i walk into what appears to be an open door i get stuck. i can't always reproduce it but it did happen a few times in the tomb dungeon.
<br/>
<br/>
hobgoblin sentrys will sometimes pause and then go into their pattern of movement when first entering a screen. i'm not sure if this is a bug or something intentional.
<br/>
<br/>
the item shop south of treasure cave, walking back up towards treasure cave following the water closly i get stuck just below the area where the bolder was blown up. right when the screen transitions and the water line sticks out with two small bits of land to my right and two grates under the rock infront of me. i am unable to move or get out of this area, it does happen every time as well.

Hmm...that's a problem. You say you are playing on your DS with micro SD?  The save feature is designed to work with gba cartridge saves, I have no idea if that's compatible with what you are playing on.  (probably not? -- unfortunately).
<br/>
I'll have to look into seeing if there's an easy way to make a build that can save correctly in that case.  If anybody knows a good way of dealing with this, I'd love to hear it.

Hmmm...it wasn't entirely intentional, no.  I realized the behavior was there, (and didn't spend the time fixing it because I figured that if the player wasn't going to grab the item, it was his tough luck)...but I forgot about the case where you were blocked from getting the item, so it'd be gone when you came back.
<br/>
I guess it would mean you'd have to start over to get 100%.  But I'll tell you what...if you're above 90% when you finish, and that happened to you, send me the screenshot at &gt; 90%, and tell me where that item was, and I'll count it for the sake of the contest ;-)

That's intentional...they don't start running around until they've "seen" you (faced toward you).

Don't worry about photos of those two spots, but if you find others, yeah, photos are great.

Thanks!

Nope..the things that count are the life/attack/armor powerups, and having found the bow/arrow, traps, boots, dynamite, and ring.  The quantities of keys, potions, arrows, and traps don't matter.

<br/>
<br/>
good job to the winner! =)

gauauu: i wrote a review of your game for the weekly "temper post" over at gbatemp.net. please read it over and if any information is incorrect let me know so i can get it corrected. i hope the review brings you many more downloads!!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
bug report:
<br/>
the area i said where i first got stuck by the water, near the grates south of where you blow the rock up, i've found 2 bugs.
<br/>
<br/>
the first is the tree all the way to the left just below the rocks has no trunk, it is just the top half!
<br/>
<br/>
using the magic boots if you walk up towards the grates you can walk up under the rock. not sure if this is intentional.
<br/>
<br/>
in addition, by the desert at the bottom of the map where the river spills off screen between the cliffs, using the magical boots you can walk under the cliff towards the next screen. i thought at first that something might be hidden there but now i think perhaps its just a collision detection bug.
<br/>
<br/>
cheers!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GBA homebrew usually doesn't need to be patched with the Supercard patcher.  In this case, you could have simply used the "QPC Method" to save, and I would have suggested that earlier if I had known you were using a slot-2 Supercard.  In essence, the QPC method is used to save the contents of GBA SRAM to a *.sav file on your card by using the Saver tab of the Supercard menu.  Save the game, turn off the system, quickly turn it back on <span style="font-style: italic">in GBA mode</span> before the SRAM is lost, press Right to get to the Saver tab, navigate to the *.sav file, and hit A twice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
-On side facing doors you can walk partway through the door frame, placing yourself within a wall a little (not as bad as one I found in a *commercial* lotr game for the gba, where you would get stuck in place if you didn't move out of the door fast enough, or get stuck outside the wall.)
<br/>
<br/>
-you can see your sword on the other side of a wall on the bottom of the screen and slash. small, but it is there (maybe just a super strong sword?)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For now, other than Anguna bug fixes, yes.  I'm currently working on porting anguna to DS (Which should be pretty straightforward, but I don't get as much coding time nowadays as I used to, so it's not quite as fast as I'd like).  After I finish that, I don't know what's next -- I definitely haven't given up on the GBA or anything, but there's so many other interesting things to work on, that I don't know what I'll end up spending time on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
