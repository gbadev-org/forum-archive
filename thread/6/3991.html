LOOOOOOOOORD GRAGAAAAAAAAAAA PRESEENTS:
<br/>
<br/>
==============================
<br/>
Lord Graga's sexy GBA example.
<br/>
==============================
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This example should clarify a few things just a bit, to make you more sexy and
<br/>
boost your coding karma. This will definetly give you greater skills and make
<br/>
you better with the ladies.
<br/>
<br/>
Smooth features:
<br/>
<br/>
- How to use interrupts
<br/>
- That makefiles are sexy, and that they help you organize your project. The
<br/>
  makefiles here will automaticly include any C and S files in the directory,
<br/>
  which is a very sleek thing to do.
<br/>
- That you should should use a SWI call to wait for VSYNC, else everybody will
<br/>
  slap you with a showel and call you a fool.
<br/>
- How to have multiple C files in one project, using headerfiles (located in
<br/>
  the h/ folder, because that's sexy too).
<br/>
- How to make a .lib file from many .o files
<br/>
- How to write a 1337 raster effect, or, how to copy my code
<br/>
- That Graga is very smooth and sexy
<br/>
<br/>
You will require:
<br/>
- DevkitARM + MSYS, probably set up. Don't ask me how to do it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks goes to:
<br/>
<br/>
WinterMute, a man with great karma. I snapped some stuff from his libgba. These
<br/>
things was: the IWRAM_CODE #define, the SystemCall define, the inth.s, and some
<br/>
other misc stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The code itself is straight forward and very sexy. You should have no problems
<br/>
understanding my sexy tap-tap. It is so very sexy that it is not commented at
<br/>
all (because good code doesn't require comments, at least not when it's such
<br/>
a small piece of code).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Questions? Don't ask me, ask in the GBADev.org forum. It's not like I'm a
<br/>
friggin FAQ (or fag, just to make that clear).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't write e-mails to me unless you are a sexy/cute/yummy and inteligent lady.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You have my permission to use this project for everything you want, with one
<br/>
exception: If you may not copy the raster effect, without at least making VERY
<br/>
significant changes to it. I mean, you are free to study it, but if you just
<br/>
copy it, change a few lines, and say that you wrote it, then you will lose
<br/>
serious karma, man.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This sexy piece of work should compile when you type 'make' in this directory,
<br/>
out of the box.

I respect your choice of licensing terms, but it appears to me that you mostly want credit, and a slightly less restrictive license could give you the credit you ask for.

It's true.  All you have to do is follow Graga's tutorial and your code will be sexier, you'll have more confidence, and hot chicks will want to have sex with you.

I'm joking, of course. But still, ever since last wednesday these boards have totally changed. People are just flaming other people out in the open and stuff. It's not cool.

I suggest that we do not allow people to post anywhere but in the beginners section (they should not be able to make replies to other sections either), before they were APPROVED to post in other forums by a moderator. This *would* require many mods, but let us face it: Not everybody is super smooth and sexy (like me) when they come here. It takes a bit of time to understand the "cultural laws" of the internet, i.e:
<br/>
<br/>
- You need to learn how to behave in different hard situations (flamming, etc)
<br/>
- You need to learn how to make good topics with clean, welldefined questions, using a good grammar without shorthand.
<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of other stuff that I want to write, but I have class, and I need to concentrate.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Plus it almost funnels more posts into the beginners sections from new members - I also think it brings the false idea that more posts equals a smarter member.
