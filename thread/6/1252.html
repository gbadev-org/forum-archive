    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am just a little stunned, are these rumors true?: <a href="http://www.gamecubeland.com/index.php?page=news&amp;news_id=742" target="_blank">http://www.gamecubeland.com/index.php?page=news&amp;news_id=742</a>

If they are rumors anymore, that was posted before SP came out which was a while ago. Has this been proven incorrect, or correct. If this is too correct, does anyone know with what langauge n64 can be programmed in? or what the sequel will be programmed in. Even if they did release a new one, they wouldn't make it 3d, then the screen would have to be bigger and it isnt getting much bigger and being called a handheld. I confuse.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The news says "Nintendo have today confirmed they're developing a successor to the GBA". I'd be more surprised if Nintendo had said they weren't developing a GBA follow up. I imagine that this is some sort of response to Sony's (so far vapourware) handheld. Either way, I doubt we'll see it for a few years yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I wasnt expecting one for a couple years too. But I read some more articles and got his exact sentence he said. Both the successers to GBA and GC are underway, GC2 is to be released at the same time as rivals around 2005-2006. But GBA2 is said to be very much into development and rumored o be released in a year or less. It is also said that the graphics will definetly be 3d, but the screen size would still be impossible to geuss. It is just shocking to me becuase I just started development on a game, I dont want to have a new system out half way threw the game. It has been a few years since GBA came out isnt it? and a few months since SP which wasnt a huge change.. I can see a new one coming out.

If anyone finds some real proof or article thats real let me know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
In fact Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft all admit that they start working on a follow up console as soon as the last one is released, or even sooner! Apparently the next gen Nintendo console to follow GameCube has been in development for ages.
<br/>
<br/>
For what it's worth, just buy whatever is the latest thing, you know it will be replaced sooner or later but for a few hundred dollars between games and hardware over a couple of years seems like a pretty cheap form of entertainment anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
One last thing - people seem to think an old console evaporates when the next one is released. You can still play them!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>
