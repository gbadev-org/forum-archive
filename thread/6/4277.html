    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, a bit of-topic but does spam-bots read the source or the rendered webpage? I suppose they read the source to find "click HERE to email me" with a href="mailto:mymail@myserver.com".

<br/>
Tepples, that unicode doesn't seem to solve anything that cannot be solved by using an image for the @ character, atleast not for me. I couldn't paste your unicode char into my mail-app, it converted the char to an "?".
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Ah, now I see that it isn't even supposed to be an @ character, it's an "a" in a circle. Silly me. :)<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Any security can be twarted.  It would probably be easy to scan for strings that contain the ⓐ or @ tokens.  I doubt ⓐ is in widespread use, so it's probably safe.

I seem to remember almost finishing it but it would be good if a few people could submit their stuff from it so I know if its ready to go live or not.
