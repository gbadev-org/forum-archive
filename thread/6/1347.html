I think that the controls is kinda hard, they aren't very good at all...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I really like the graphic style. And it's great, especially for a first try at GBA. While the running slow down is also a nice 'realistic' effect, it makes it hard to jump on platform, so you should either make the platform larger, or cancel the 'slowdown' when jumping.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

just a little more collision detection and your done.<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I agree, the collision detection needs work, has to do with my sprite not the engine...
<br/>
<br/>
"I think that it is a OK first demo, is the GBA your first platform? "
<br/>
no, I've done games for ps1,ps2,xbox,GC...all professional, this is my 1st venture into indie game console dev...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder why it hasn't been posted in the main page, I submitted the demo... :(
<br/>
is this the right email?

By the way, I like your jump physics, I can never get things to look like they are affected by gravity correctly.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

Most games seem to handle gravity by doing Euler numerical integration on the equations implied by Newton's laws. The resulting difference equations, translated into C, look something like this:</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">dy += gravity;
<br/>
y += dy;
<br/>
x += dx;</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
Looks, good! Why not port your shaman 2d scroller thingy to the gba (yeah I checked your website, cool stuff!).
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm...I only looked at the shaman screenshots (I didn't play it) and it reminded me of Abe's Oddworld, and I loved that game so that's why I mentioned it :-).
<br/>
<br/>
Ofcourse, the original Abe had no scrolling so it would be no problem to make something like that on a GBA (just store your gfx compressed in memory and you're done). 
<br/>
<br/>
Then again, in my opinion, the lack of scrolling was a weak point of Abe so right now I'm trying to do something like that on GBA but with scrolling.
<br/>

Grtz,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">next version will 'hopefully' use a dynamic tile engine...meaning HUGE levels, with little or no tiling... depends on weather the programmer I'm working with can do it, which I know he can.
