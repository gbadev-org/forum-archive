    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Before the DSLinux forums were hacked, I asked if anything could possibly be done to make that port of uClinux any more useful.  Pepsiman responded and said that there really wasn't any memory left to do anything at all, and that even running LS a few times was enough to use up all the available RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with the project though, hopefully you'll get better results.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
