    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey folks.  Just wanted to let people in on a project that I've been working on (off and on) for the last few months.  It's called Project Hazuki.  
<br/>
<br/>
Initially, I was going to create a game engine that allowed you to explore a little town via an overhead view.  There would be lots of NPCs milling about and they would be scheduled based on time of day.  For instance, you might see school children wandering around in the mornings on their way to school.  It was loosely based on the idea of implementing Shenmue as an overhead game.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I thought through the design and made several notes.  I've built up quite a bit of the engine, but got side-tracked a bit when I realized it would be cool to implement a SFII-like demo using the technology.  So I went about creating a SFII-like engine.  It wasn't that tough, really, as I had played around with the idea a few years ago and had looked into some of the design issues.   
<br/>
<br/>
I've gotten it to a very functional state.  You can move Ryu around the screen, do moves and interact with the opponent.  If you're interested, please check it out at this page: <a href="http://www3.telus.net/allenu/Wiki/ProjectHazuki.html" target="_blank">http://www3.telus.net/allenu/Wiki/ProjectHazuki.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
There's a link to the latest builds.  There are a lot of notes on the design of the engine, so if anyone is interested in how I did certain things, feel free to peruse the pages.

Just a question though. I have noticed in alot of games (including this one and pokemon etc) that when viewing the OAM entries, they grow upwards. An example is this game where one of the players is OAM 0 and when a fireball is shot it becomes OAM 1 and everything is pushed up etc... Any reason for this, is it something useful that I have somehow never learnt?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

Version 2.0 now up - guaranteed at least 100% more pleasing!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sprite priority is dependent on the OAM order - so if you want your fireballs to overlap other sprites, they must be nearer to the start of the list.

<br/>
more complete than before.  I have implemented energy bars, a

better background image, and a whole slew of other features.  Download
