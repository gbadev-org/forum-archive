Probably the overly big clear size I put in to prevent 16x16 sprites from having part of the old ones on top. This also killed the fog effect, so I lowered it significantly. Current builds shouldn't go there anymore. <span style="font-weight: bold">Probably resolved</span>

    <h4>#147830 - NAveryW - Fri Dec 28, 2007 8:48 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is quite interesting. I would like to know: on the official website it says there's a specific reason that the white is on top of the Pok?ball and must stay on top, but it doesn't say why. If it's for copyright reasons, that doesn't quite make sense to me, as it already uses countless trademarked Pok?mon.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'm assuming sound will later be supported? It's still a great engine, even soundless.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">NAveryW, ignoring the earlier babbling I published about copyrights and stuff, when you see the red-on-top ball, you tend to think of Pok?mon. White-on-top is meant to make people think of OpenPok? instead.
<br/>
<br/>
Sound <span style="font-style: italic">was</span> in, using Nintendo's engine. As you can see <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=14649" target="_blank">here</a>, I'm looking for replacements that are more legal.

<br/>
<br/>
* copy-pastes *
<br/>
<br/>
Open 
<br/>
? Running speed is equal to walking 
<br/>
? Frame's not right after startup ? might be strange SRAM contents. 
<br/>
? Type (dis)advantages are screwy 
<br/>
<br/>
Open and understood, but not yet fixed 
<br/>
? Paralysis is applied after fainting ? just that. Paralysis should check for fainted status. 
<br/>
? Help system doesn't set all things, so the cursor might be outside of the screen or the whole thing's a little darker. 
<br/>
<br/>
Unconfirmed resolved 
<br/>
? Writes in mirrored or invalid VRAM areas 
<br/>
<br/>
Resolved with a cheap trick 
<br/>
? Game freezes just before Cearn battle ? somehow, the dialogue box statemachine doesn't like very long strings. "Fixed" by cutting Cearn's lines in half. 
<br/>
<br/>
Resolved 
<br/>
? Things on the map sometimes use the wrong sprite ? randomizer gave weird results, fixed by using unsigned int 
<br/>
? Characters can move into the same spot when both are moving at the same time ? because the sprite collission checker should test the tile being walked to. Thanks to tepples for suggesting this.
<br/>
? When spotted by a trainer to the right, the player uses a "zapped" sprite instead of looking right ? facing = <span style="font-style: italic">(</span> facing + 2 <span style="font-style: italic">)</span> % 4. 
<br/>
? Helping Hand ? most enemy moves are now checked for sensibility. 
<br/>
? Growl, Tail Whip et al affect user 
<br/>
? Potions heal above max HP ? thanks, Cearn! 
<br/>
<br/>
Not bugs at all 
<br/>
? No Pok? Balls to catch with ? try pressing Right in the inventory screen. 
<br/>
? No weather effects ? only fog is implemented, and has no effect on battle. 
<br/>
? No sound ? sound has been left out of the demo to cut download size. Also, the engine used is illegal. 
<br/>
? Levelling up goes really fast ? done on purpose. You get triple experience for demonstration purposes. 
<br/>
? Backpics do not use chosen colors ? now fixed. 
<br/>
? Conversion failed ? effect missing. Conversion is just one of them. Missing effects auto-fail.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great game! I've been looking for a good Pokemon Advance clone/editor for a while, and this beats the pants off all the others!
<br/>
<br/>
Is it on purpose, for say, testing paralysis, that Thundershock causes the foe to be paralysed every time?
<br/>
<br/>
Walking seems a little slow, but while walking (and while not) the 'Route 105' - or whatever route it was- works fine and is very smooth.
<br/>
<br/>
Great work on the battle backgrounds, especially the forest one! It's better than the original game itself!
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I tested it on VisualBoy Advance, as I only have a GBAMP.<br/>_________________<br/>My favourite DS apps:

Okay. It's in the "additional effects" block... ah yes. Rand() shouldn't be ranged with &amp; but with %. Now what was it that Cearn said about "proper ranging"?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
