    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">With the release of Football Manager 2008 our company is giving away copies of Football Manager 2007 (to employees), so I figured that I might as well take a few that could be used for a competition.
<br/>
<br/>
Now as for a competition, how about this ... we create an AI football battle, all competitors will use the same API (quite like the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.csc.kth.se/contest/nwerc/2006/nhl/" target="_blank">2006 NWERC AI Hockey League</a> that I competed in) and will be set to battle other teams. It will take time, so it may require a group effort to define and develop the API, but it will be a great competition to have. If you look at the league table for the NWERC, you will see QMUL are number 2; had it not been for a stupid bug we would have actually won with AI that we created in about 20 minutes against some of the most sophisticated AI routines that probably took weeks of planning and thought!!!
<br/>
<br/>
The development of the API may take some time, so it will require a few, or maybe several programmers to develop in a suitable time - or possible little time. The competition could be targeted at the GBA or the DS, and to stop people over computing their team can have a penalty imposed for taking more than a single frame to process all players, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested I can possibly pick up a couple more copies, and who knows, this could be a big competition that pulls in programmers who were too scared to get involved in the GUI aspects of the hand held systems.
<br/>
<br/>
I have XBox 360, PSP and PC/Mac boxes - including the limited edition Czech one!!! I am no project/competition coordinator, and this was originally going to be a pm to Brendan, but then I ...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I understand correctly, it's a challenge where different people/teams write AI that competes against each other.  In this case, for a football (soccer) game.  
<br/>
<br/>
Is that the gist?
<br/>
<br/>
I always think AI competitions are fun, but the whole football/soccer doesn't really help the appeal.
<br/>
<br/>
And I have no idea what Football Manager 2008 is, so the prize doesn't really add an incentive for us USA folk.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, and I forget that in the USA that 'soccer' takes a back seat to American 'football', Basketball and Baseball. Well we can always have it with another sport, but it needs to be one where the AI is both challenging and doable. Besides is everyone here from the states? In Europe football (i.e. soccer) takes the front seat. In america it's called "Worldwide soccer management", of which I have a copy too.
<br/>
<br/>
Well I have the prizes, and an AI competition would be fun, or at least one where the competition involves everyone using a particular game engine and API.
<br/>
<br/>
Well if someone was planning on setting up a competition, here are some prizes! So let me know ASAP before they become someone else's prizes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
