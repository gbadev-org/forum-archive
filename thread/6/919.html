<br/>
I saw that people is pushing for new forums here, so that i'd like to ask
<br/>
u if it's possible to create a "For Beginners" area to avoid one day and one not someone to ask "Where to start with gba dev" stuff...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not against newbies but i think it's going to be noisy now...
<br/>
<br/>
Bye! :)<br/>_________________<br/>Federico "FNX" Nisoli
