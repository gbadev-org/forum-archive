Please give a guy a break and post about it on the site.  You'll find the game on my web site... just click the GORF logo.

It's really badly required to give a few people more rights here and get the main page flooded with the nowadays rare GBA releases. After all GBADEV was the main intention for the place :)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Kojote</span>

I don't remember receiving any e-mail letting us know about your game. If you did send a mail, please do so again. Every game or demo that people mail us about, we put on the main site.

I've checked my inbox and can't find any PM from you. What day did you send it?
<br/>
<br/>
I disagree that it's required to give more people posting rights on the main page. Every game or demo that gets e-mailed to us will be posted on the main page. The forum is meant to be separate from the main page so posts made here will not, and should not, automatically go on the main page.

To make sure that my mail is working fine I have checked to see how many e-mails I have received from you.
<br/>
<br/>
You sent the same e-mail 3 times with 1 minute apart (dec 15th 2009). I replied the same day and then you replied 2 times (same e-mail also with 1 minute apart). I saw no reason to reply to that e-mail. But yes, I received those 5 e-mails from you.

hi hihi ihih really?

i were talking about some e-mails i've sent you, one a lot of time before the one you answered, and two about the game i'm currently developing... but i can assume [b]I[/b]'ve got problems on my email account if you received multiple copies of those mails... :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I took a while because I couldn't really find any info about this GORF release. The only mention of the word GORF that I could find on the website was the download link...nothing else, and there was no info in the e-mail I received, and I couldn't find any screenshot to steal for the main page either.
<br/>
<br/>
But oh well, I did some copy&amp;pasting from the included readme and let's hope people start downloading the game.
