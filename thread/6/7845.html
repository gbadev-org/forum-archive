    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I just put online the current version of "otype" which is a try to reproduce old school shoot'em up (like R-TYPE) . At the moment there is just 2 different ennemies, a neverending level with poor gfx and two different weapons (B button to swap) with 6 levels of powerup
<br/>
<br/>
Don't expect a great playability as it is not my main preocupation now.
<br/>
<br/>
At a first step I want to focus on the "engine" of the game.
<br/>
<br/>
here is a link to my last build : (hope it works)

<br/>
<br/>
all the music and sound are taken from various sources, if a musician is interested to make an original score, he's welcome :-) 
<br/>
<br/>
also I only test it on VBA as I have no flash cartridge nor real GBA. hope it may change soon.[/url]

feedback welcome</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Nice looking game. It shows a lot of promise.
<br/>
<br/>
Do the enemies just come out randomly, or do you have some level making software?
<br/>
<br/>
It is similar to my game - <a href="http://shen.mansell.tripod.com/games/gba/sworld3/sworld3.html" target="_blank">http://shen.mansell.tripod.com/games/gba/sworld3/sworld3.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Nice backgrounds, and I see you have them loading dynamically. Does your engine just load the map, or can it load/manage tiles too?
<br/>
<br/>
Is this the first game you've worked on?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi kojote and shen3 , thanks for the feedback :-)
<br/>
<br/>
at the moment there is just a little algorithm to set up ennemies at increasing rate and a little random in the posistion
<br/>
<br/>
the next step will probably to construct a better level with enhanced gfx and more ennemies. for that I may need to program a little level editor
<br/>
<br/>
for the scrolling I scroll with hardware the 2 levels for 8 pixels and then I redraw all the layer. If I keep non animated background I will probably try to  just redraw the necessary tiles.
<br/>
<br/>
And shen3 i try your game and find it very funny :-) I love your graphic style.
<br/>
<br/>
For the last question, it's not really the first game I make. I like programming but the last years I haven't any time to make something apart some stuff on PC (realtime 3d). 
<br/>
<br/>
For now I make little progress as I try to set up a mini web site and try to enjoy christmas holidays</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the game is pretty good.  And being a fan of fast action games, I didn't think it was too hard.  I look forward to seeing more!
<br/>
<br/>
My one suggestion is eventually making the player's ship a little smaller.  It seemed a bit big and round right now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi;
<br/>
<br/>
Your way of creating enemies sounds almost exactly like mine.
<br/>
<br/>
Bounty Hunter X has a table of percentages for each level that decide how often each enemy should appear.
<br/>
<br/>
It also has an enemy spawn beginning rate, increase rate and max spawn rate.
<br/>
<br/>
Each level ends when the pre set kill limit for that level is reached.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest improvement (gameplay wise) would  be to have pre set levels, at least for some stages. But then again, the semi random levels give the game a lot more replayability in my opinion. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to your next release.
