<br/>
No sound yet, no menu yet, no title screen yet, no wallpaper yet, not even pausing, but it's fully playable with source. Let it go on record as the first true clone of Dr. Mario for the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
And for those who want link support: where can I find a free PC-hosted GBA emulator that can emulate two linked systems?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since your code is so compact and tiny (awesome!!!) you might consider using NO$GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
IIRC, it has full support for link in a variety of combinations.
<br/>
<br/>
Martin has since discontinued it (ugh... long and sordid tale of crackers and such), but you might try and ask him for permission to use the last version he released?
<br/>
<br/>
He doesn't host it on his site anymore (for obvious reasons), but given what you're doing, he's the kind of person who might reconsider and send you the last officially released version.
<br/>
<br/>
Then again, he might be so peeved that he doesn't really want to have anything to do with homebrew anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, it never hurts to ask!
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Bullhockey. It's 18 KB. Much more than this has been done in 4 KB.

Unfortunately, I have no knowledge of z80 assembly language, or I'd have already reduced the footprint further by making a GBC program rather than a GBA program.

I am a dirty pirate.  He doesn't want to deal with me.  Instead, he wants to deal with developers who have already signed a contract with one of the top 20 publishers of GBA software.  Somebody who has developed an exact clone of a program published by the maker of the console is unlikely to land such a contract.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

You're absolutely correct -- 18K is hugely bloated and fat.

Prior to 1.5 he made a version that you didn't have to pay for -- Unfortunately, however, it won't adhere to the more stringent requirements of "free" that you require.

My bad -- I was under the impression that link functionality was in 1.4c and earlier (There's a few options in the configuration dialog relating to link support as stated, but as I've never used it myself, I can't vouch for it's operation, or use.)

Based on your previous posts here (with the exception of the last one), I'd be very surprised if you weren't able to find suitable GBA programming work -- depending, of course, on your particular definition of "suitable", that is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And unfortunately, even if NO$GBA 1.4 was available at no charge at one time, it's still no longer available.  Archive.org's Wayback Machine is down as I write this, and I don't know whether or not it stores binaries.

I'm just assuming.  I have not tried contacting him because he has neither a public e-mail address nor a postal address in the United States.

For the record, the whole "dirty pirate" thing was sarcasm.

Martin appears to be the type of person who poured a lot of himself into his work, released it for free with a few restrictions, and got screwed over badly... not just once, or twice, but a few times.
<br/>
<br/>
I can understand his reluctance to not reveal his EMail address, and hence the reason I suggested you PM me (which still stands.)

I'm sure there are a few -- or at least there are those who would happily 1099 your services if only to avoid all the issues involved with a full employee.

On an unrelated note, is Fort Wayne anywhere near Gary?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
