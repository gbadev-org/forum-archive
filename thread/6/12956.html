    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">RomeR can now be run via the command line. Please read included documents for details of commands and their usage.
<br/>
<br/>
CLI mode supports the basic features you feed it the icon, .nds file and options and hey presto. Hopefully this will make it more useful to developers. I will include more command line options if they are required but i think the current setup should suffice for most users. Any feedback welcome.

**EDIT**
<br/>
new site online
