<br/>
EMUNITY plays every GBA Title in 2.5D.
<br/>
It is actually a "Libretro Front-End" yet much more.
<br/>
<br/>
Using a custom built / modified vbam_libretro render passes are separated and used as real time textures on simple "Quad" GameObjects (Layer Panels) within the Unity3D Game Development Engine/Studio.
<br/>
<br/>
This is only the beginning, with read and write access to the GBA Core's memory, games can be interpreted and modified through use of .js and .cs code.
<br/>
<br/>
The layout system allows you to clone each layer for Emunity's currently exclusive "Cemetery Effect". This is the effect of duplicating a layer multiple times, with the example of cloning a single row of grave stones, into a full cemetery on each side of the player.
<br/>
<br/>
EMUNITY detects Oculus Rift on start-up, and is an experience in VR.
<br/>
Non VR owners can press the D key to toggle 3D SBS Stereoscopic mode for display on 3D viewing devices, and NOT CROSSEYED LOL.
<br/>
<br/>
Camera perspective can be controlled by Oculus, Webcam Head-Tracking, PS3 Controller Tilt, or Mouse Movement.
<br/>
<br/>
Do NOT quit EMUNITY for a while after saving your game... It only actually saves your savegames once and a while! (YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED)
<br/>
<br/>
Oculus and Head-Tracking are NOT supported yet on Linux.
<br/>
Windows Head-Tracking REQUIRES "FaceTrackNOIR" installed and running, with the output module being FlightGear local network.
<br/>
<br/>
EMUNITY IS A LIBRETRO FRONTEND! IT IS MOSTLY BASED ON WRAPPER CODE BY RADIUS AND ALCARO @ #Libretro on FreeNode, THEIR CODE has been modified and extended to operate WITHIN Unity3D by MiLO83 AKA EMUNITY. GUI and Unity Code  / ENHANCEMENT CODE MiLO83 AKA EMUNITY. ALL UR BASS = EMUNITY.
