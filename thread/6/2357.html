    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've put together a variant of sprintf() targetted specifically towards GBA development. It has the following features:
<br/>
<br/>
- Very fast algorithm for printing 16-bit numbers plus sign (up to +/- 65535)
<br/>
- Still pretty fast routine for printing larger numbers, up to about +/- 500 million (takes about twice as long)
<br/>
- Can pad numbers with leading spaces or zeros
<br/>
- Prints numbers in hex as well (useful for debugging stuff)
<br/>
- Prints strings to strings
<br/>
- Hand-coded entirely in Thumb assembler - should be very efficient overall
<br/>
