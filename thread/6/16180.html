This is our second released GBA Game and it is by far our most advanced (sprite-wise anyway). We started work on this Pong Implementation around Christmas as a test for our now complete Sprite Library it is very memory efficient and flexible! This is a simple silly Pong game we coded for everyone to have fun with until our next release hope you enjoy it!
