It's using a 'rotational isometric' engine. I have code and tools (I developed specifically for it). There's a lot of ASM in there too, so it's all pretty efficient.
<br/>
<br/>
It'd be cool to put it in the public domain, I don't expect to make anything out of it. But would be great if anyone wanted to make a game using the tech (or even port it to DS).
<br/>
<br/>
What do you guys think?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks guys.
<br/>
<br/>
The base engine is all coded in ASM, and runs very efficiently. Unfortunate that I never did anything with it.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to make the tech publicly available, free, and open source (maybe I just get credited if anyone uses id commercially or something).
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure it'd be pretty easy to post to DS too.
<br/>
<br/>
I also have level editor tools, and a tool for placing the sprite objects on the map. Also, I played around with having 2 layers (BG2 and BG3) at different heights, which looked mega-cool.
<br/>
<br/>
The sprites are not re-used thought, so it's limited to displaying a max of 128 / frame.
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it's all 60hz, and plenty CPU time left after the engine has done it's thing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a massive amount of time to dedicate to the project, so if anyone wants to get involved, that'd be fantastic.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a pisser, you know when you go to all the trouble to create some tech, and it doesn't get used; I'd like to see someone use it. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think.

I'll probably move these on to my blog (once I get it setup); and include a whole lot more info and tech specs, and also details of the tools used in the creation of these demos.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking a really cool thing would be to get this tech. working on a DS. I know very little about DS development though. Though I'm sure it's not mega hard to convert this.
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully I can get some help and guidance with this mini-project from the community. :)
<br/>

All the best,

The DS is sort of an upgraded GBA. It has all capabilities/hardware the GBA has, and more. So it should be very easy to port to the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
BUT, since the DS has built in 3D graphics, this demo would probaby not be that spectacular on a DS.<br/>_________________<br/>Bricks-OS, Operating System for Game Consoles</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just out of curiosity, does the DS still have the same 128 sprites limit?

<br/>
The 2D engines, one for each screen, have the same limit of 128 sprites. But the 3D engine (one screen only, unless you want to forfeit half your frame rate and half your texture memory) has a limit closer to 1,500 quads.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I wonder if it would be feasible to apply the same principles (used in these GBA demos), but instead of working with GBA sprites, using DS quads?
<br/>
<br/>
Having 1,500 per frame, in an engine like this, could get some pretty cool results (with a LOT of pre-rendered 3d objects).<br/>_________________<br/>Qwak - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk</a> | Forum - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk/forum/" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk/forum/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hi FluBBa,
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't want to do sprite scaling, I figured with sprite scaling you get less sprites per scanline?

Yeah, I think it comes from coding in the old days, when you had very slow CPU's and next to no hardware support for graphics.
