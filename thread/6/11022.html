    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys,
<br/>
I've recently began work on a new zelda 3D fangame for the DS. You can check it out at <a href="http://www.extremecoder.co.nr" target="_blank">www.extremecoder.co.nr</a>
<br/>
I've got basic parts of the engine working, such as a move around in the overworld, the md2 loader, outlining of the models, and other tids n bits.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and BTW, I'm looking for some help on the game. check out the site if interested.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has Link's likeness been copyrighted? I know this has been done with Bruce Lee so that nobody can make something in his likeness without permission. Doesn't copyright only cover direct copies of the images and not images created to be like Link?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Non-literal copying is still copying. It takes a judge to distinguish non-literal copying (likely infringement) from appropriation of ideas (not infringement). <span style="font-style: italic">Capcom v.

<br/>
<br/>
Apply a texture so that the model doesn't look just like Link, and Nintendo will have to sue Rankin-Bass over its Christmas specials before Nintendo sues you.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe, but there is no reason to copy Link anyway.  I'm sure everyone would have just as much fun with a different character then to worry about Nintendo dropping an iron fist on a project because it infringes on copyright.
<br/>
<br/>
Could someone please explain to me why clones have to be copies?  I mean.. make the main character a girl.  We'll all be just as happy, and some might even be more happy.. if you know what I mean.. :P<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree with Lynx. Toan, the main character of <span style="font-style: italic">Dark Cloud</span>, a PS2 game that quite a few reviewers have called a <span style="font-style: italic">Zelda</span> clone, looked "different enough" from any of the incarnations of Link.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Anyway, I will probably at the end make it more of an engine. And didn't Lupi also make a zelda game? Ninty will have to sue him first.
<br/>
 And AFAIK, Nintendo isn't that strict concerning fangames about mario and zelda,though the case might not be similar with SSB(SSB:DS cease&amp;desist). Websites like <a href="http://www.mfgg.net" target="_blank">www.mfgg.net</a> and <a href="http://www.zfgc.com" target="_blank">www.zfgc.com</a> do exist.
<br/>
And if Nintendo does notice this project, we could easily redo it as an engine, with the ability to release maps and characters externally, or make another name and character.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
