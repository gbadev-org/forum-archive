    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just read the news that the IGF (Independent Games Festival) is hosting a mobile game competition, which includes DS.  Prizes are pretty big.  Details are at the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.igfmobile.com" target="_blank">IGFmobile website</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Please note - I'm not connected in any way to the IGF - I'm just sharing the news that I read.  It would be great to see some entries from developers here.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I checked with the competition organizers, and entries that use the DS Motion Pak are allowed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
