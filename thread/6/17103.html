<br/>
<br/>
This is the very first project I ever started fir the DS, I never finished it. I 'found' it back when I was cleaning my hard-disk and decided to complete it to share it with the community.  What is it all about? Just see if your EyeQ is as high as Einsteins IQ. Give it a try an improve your score. The more you play, the better you get ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
It plays better on real hardware, the stylus is just a bit quicker as your mouse :P
