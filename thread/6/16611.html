<span style="font-weight: bold">Hello GBAdev, developers!</span>
<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I'm sorry to write this for just introducing our game.
<br/>
Please regret for me and my super-terrible english.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a programmer from Korea, and I made a game for NDS in 2008. However, we didn't complete yet cause of another project we did.
<br/>
<br/>
... Actually we need more support.
<br/>
So, please give us your interest and support.
<br/>
<br/>
I mean- just your opinion is enough.
<br/>
(ex - 'Your game is so cool! but I didn't see it yet.')
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you :)

Thanks zazery. :) Actually, it's hard to say about development environrment due to the discontinuance of developing for NDS. (or NDS environment) We don't have any permission about that, anymore. But I say, our galatea engine, based on our game, is well doing for both. Long story short, let's talk about others.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you're right, we made four units for one stage. (Did I get your message right?) Hm.. exactly which parts do you wanna know about the game mechanics? We made our game engine, galatea, optimized for NDS rendering system. In addition, we just programmed hardly for many effects by our hands, because we didn't complete particle generator toolkit at that time. (Our new particle generator, based on Windows Forms and particle events, will be completed, but actually I like it programming hardly by my fingers. Toolkit is just for other programmers.)
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you twice for your encouragement.
<br/>
<br/>
ps. I believe, maybe motion-blur effect is here, GBAdev.<br/>_________________<br/>Hello World!

Oh thanks genecyst. :) Our characters! I like it so much, our characters- &gt;_&lt; Because it's soooo cute, just in my thought;;
<br/>
<br/>
Hm~ our gameplay- was actually changed, but it wasn't contained on that movie, because we stopped. It's casual action game- but in other game mode, there are a variety of game modes, like touch-last (Is it right expression?). We planned one game mode for arcade-mode, just fighting for becomming the best, 10 game modes for custom-mode, and at last, 7 mini-games + 2 ex-modes for ex-mode, we call fruits-mode. You can see it through the movie, but all custom-modes. We had a plan, but we couldn't put them all in that movie.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway we hope, our game could be published on Smartphone or else. Most of all, we are running in to our galatea engine developing for mobile-platform. See links below, and someday, we will open our technology a little about our galatea engine for nds when we can concentrate all on Smartphone. (I mean, we have a plan for some open-source.)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all,
<br/>

I mean, it really doesn't matter of your development environment. We develop the engine for game, and it (actually 'MUST') does work correctly for all user's environment, I mean, our clients. If you are an official programmer, then use Nintendo DS Official SDK. Or if you aren't an official programmer, then just use devKitPro. It's OK for everything. We are just concerning in standard of user's platform.<br/>_________________<br/>Hello World!
