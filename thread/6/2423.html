Kuju maps the future of GBA development
<br/>
Reported by Corey Brotherson 
<br/>
Open source development tools are now available as a free download to GBA developers. 
<br/>
<br/>
Development studio Kuju entertainment has released Mapster software as a download to help developers in making Game Boy Advance games. The tool supports different map building techniques and the ability to create large multi-tile brushes to paint with, on top of transparency and brush previewing utilities on Windows 2000/XP. The full source code is included in the Mapster download. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Mapster software has been created by Kuju's recently formed in-house Handheld Division, which is also working on several unannounced GBA projects.
