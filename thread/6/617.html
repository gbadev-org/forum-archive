    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's MS mobile explorer like it says. It started life out about 5 years ago as Hitchiker, a portable web browser and IP stack for putting on phones and any other things, like the PSION workabout.(basically a 3C but for indutrial use with scanner etc) At that time STNC was producing HitchHiker, HTML rendering ws working. WAP support comenced because Sony was a customer and wanted WAP for the Z5 presumably.
<br/>
<br/>
Approximatly 6 months after I joined STNC, we go taken over by Microsoft, and some months later Hitchiker became is renamed and becomes MS mobile explorer for feature phones with WAP, HTML and Email support. MS Explorer for smartphones is the WIN CE version, MS Explorer for feature phones is what this is. i.e. no Underlying OS, platform independant.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway after 2 and a half odd years out group was scrapped [and made redundant] since MS wanted to focus on the 'smartphone'. 
<br/>
<br/>
I took the .gba file off the website because I don't want to get arrested, since Microsoft might send someone round to see me. Like a layer perhaps. I'll see maybe I'll ask someone if it's allowed. I would say the GBA isnt realy much use for web browsing becuase it only has a few keys, so typing in an URL would be a bit tedious :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nokia made their source available to their WAP Browser unfortunately to developers only.

There are hooks for custom or platform input so a virtual keyboard could go in there. That still leaves the reason as to why you would realy want to browse with a gameboy. The demo code up there doesn't do any comms, the ipstack hasn't been built. Nobody would seriously write a browser for the GBA and expect people to use it would they? Everyone has a wap phone these days and some people don't even know it :-)
<br/>
<br/>
All those pages on the demo are actually HTML pages, I havn't got any compiled WAP pages to try it out on I don't think. I'd have to use something like the Nokia content toolkit to generate them, which is (or was) free. Maybe I'll try a few wap pages. Beats me why the wap standard ever came about. Hitchiker was rendering HTML pages about 5 years ago.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll see if I can put the .gba file up. I'll have to ask someone first about doing that sort of thing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's never going to support 'cables'. It's most of the web browser in there, but you can't tell so to you its just a menu. I am moving on to do other stuff, like looking for a job, so unfortunatly I don't realy want to start making cables up and writing serial drivers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What is an Xboot cable? You would probably have to dial up to you PC to surf the web, I don't think it's practical since it would take you all day to type in web addresses :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I should get a few decent web pages on it though.
<br/>
<br/>
I've got a flash linker cable, but I don't know what you can do with that in terms of output to PC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
