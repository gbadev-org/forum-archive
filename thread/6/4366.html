    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">UK - Coder's Workshop - Free UK Event for programmers, graphic artists and musicians!
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.codersworkshop.com/meet/" target="_blank">http://www.codersworkshop.com/meet/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
What will be of note to people on this forums is that the company hosting this is looking to get into DS development as they have a wealth of contacts within the videogame industry and can look to pitch products to key publishers globally. 
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a quick rundown of what is involved:
<br/>
<br/>
The event is aimed at all creative people, from programmers and graphics artists to musicians and designers. Whether your choice of language/platform is GBA/DS, ASM, Blitz Basic, Dark Basic, C++, ASM, JAVA/J2ME, Open GL, Direct X, PC/Mac, Pure Basic (or anything else) then come along...
<br/>
<br/>
So far on the night there's going to be:
<br/>
<br/>
* Videogame quiz - With three sets of prizes
<br/>
<br/>
1st prize latest Nvidia gfx card
<br/>
2nd Prize Top PC game.
<br/>
3rd Prize PC Games bundle.
<br/>
<br/>
* Open Q&amp;A session with development &amp; publishing staff from Idigicon (a well-established UK publishing company) including the Managing Director. Plus several experienced programmers from within the indie videogame scene.
<br/>
<br/>
* Videogame challenge; Prizes for the highest scores.
<br/>
<br/>
* Prizes for the best (previously unseen) game or demo, as voted by the attendees.
<br/>
<br/>
* A free raffle to win various (Top 10) PC games and video cards to everyone who pre-registers. All you need to do is send an email to <a href="mailto:george@idigicon.com">george@idigicon.com</a> with the heading Coders Workshop and your full (real) name and where you are travelling from. You will be given your raffle ticket on the night.
<br/>
<br/>
* Several PCs &amp; Macs for you to demonstrate your creations on.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus anything else we can cram into the night!
<br/>
<br/>
It's free to get in and there will be some complimentary food provided!
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's no set age limit tbh. It's a hired room within the grounds of a hotel. At the last event there was a few teenagers, sub 16.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, there is a bar, which sells both soft drinks and alcoholic.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well.. is about 13 O.K? :D 
<br/>
I don't think that any of my work would be good enough to show off really, bu I would like to go to see others (it's not just that free goody bag.. ;))
<br/>
I will bring an adult, i they let me go to Doncaster with them...
<br/>
At least it isn't a week-day, hey?!
<br/>
What time will it kick off? I couldn't see on the site.
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
Nick.
<br/>
P.S - London - Doncaster, 5 hours?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Hopefully next year, though, because she has an old friend in York to visit sometime or another.
<br/>
You never know, though. It might suddenly be cancelled (the concert).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is anybody going to this? Sounds quite good. I suspect there will be few (ex?) demosceners there also.
<br/>
<br/>
I probably will be going now. If anyone wants a lift from liverpool
<br/>
or manchester, I may be able to offer one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
