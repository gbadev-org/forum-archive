    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I started working on this project to help learn ARM Assembly and I ended up putting more effort into it than I intended.  It's a four octave synth that can play any major or minor scale that starts on the third through sixth octave.  It isn't anything fancy as it just maps the keys to the notes of the scale and lets you play but I've found it fun to play around with.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested in playing around with it you can download it and its source code <a class="postlink" href="http://wollw.drunkencoders.com/files/2009/11/SynthGBA.tar.gz" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
The source code is a bit of a mess but I really don't want to clean it up at the moment.  For what it's worth it does run in No$GBA with no errors.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I considered doing so with the wave output register at one point and if I find time/motivation I may still do so.  These days I'm pretty busy with school.

Thanks for letting me know it works on your Supercard.  I used an M3 Perfect Lite while developing it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
