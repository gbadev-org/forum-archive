<br/>
<br/>
krom and myself would like to thank all of our visitors throughout the years for making the site such a big hit. Even though gba development has slowed down a lot the last few years since the release of the DS etc, we hope that our site and forum will still provide a valuable source of information for those of you who still develop for the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone, it's been 10 really fun years for us!

I can honestly say that if it wasn't for this site and everything I have learnt through it, I wouldn't be where I am now (about to start working at Gameloft).

It's awesome having a whole community that is so passionate about handheld games and hardware!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
