    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure how rare these are, and how useful/interesting these might be to the homebrew scene, but a lot of GBA devkits, debuggers, and carts are currently going for US$100 on Ebay. The thing that caught my interest was that the GBAs can output video to a TV.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I had more dollars than sense, I'd buy an old-school GBA, glacier blue, with an Afterburner kit installed, NTSC output port, SNES controller input plug, and GBAccelerator.  Then I'd probably use it for a few months before deciding it wasn't worth the money, heh.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Big deal. So can the <a class="postlink" href="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?satitle=game+boy+player+for+gamecube" target="_blank">Game Boy Player</a>. ;-)

But still, that item has plenty of GBC and GBA systems. I'd bet some used video game store could make a tidy profit by buying those up and reselling them individually.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got one of those GBA2TV thingies. Or, more precisely, the GBA TV-Transverter (a similar product). Neat for capturing videos of my GBA demos, but the output quality is a bit poor - there's some pixel-glitches here and there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

All of which (well, except for one) needs to be modded to use batteries before any regular person would buy it...

True, but not AA batteries. What voltage of DC do they take? I'm sure some hobby shop that sells both radio-control cars (with their NiCd batteries) and used video games would figure it out.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
