    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I've been working on a BMP to GBA converter for the Windows platform. It converts any size BMP into sprite or tile data suitable for the GBA format. It supports 256 and 16 color formats. I plan on adding 16 bit and true color support soon. It works just fine for my needs, but I was wondering if anyone is interested in me developing a release version so others could use it. I looked around and I couldn't find a decent windows version of a graphics converter so I wrote my own. I know some of you say that people ought to just write their own, but some of us don't have the knowledge or resorces to do so. So, if anyone is interested, let me know. If not, it's all good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, it does. I use a front-end to make graphics conversion MUCH simpler. But the site is currently down. If you give me your e-mail address, I can e-mail it to you. It's pretty simple and easy to use.

<br/>
Then again, I don't know of many converters that handle 16 and 24-bit colors.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sent. I am surprised that this front-end isn't on the main page. It really is a great tool to use, especially when converting many images at once. Really good for the command-line impaired (like me!).<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just call the swirly-a-thing a squashed cabbage. Cause it sounds good. Oh, and they call it that in German as well. Obviously, in German though. So really, it isn't..... 
<br/>
anyway, until you get it up on the site, could you email it to me?
