    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cool.  i like the way different enemies require different types of attacks...and the way that big nasty yellow guy transforms and goes all ape on me.
<br/>
<br/>
A few initial thoughts:
<br/>
1.  is there a way to choose which enemy I'm attacking?
<br/>
2.  It could be more fun if it was faster paced...easier to take damage, faster moving enemies, less hits per enemy.   I feel like I'm just mashing the button, but there's not a whole lot of intensity in attacking and avoiding the enemies.
<br/>
3.  I'm not quite sure what causes me damage and when.  if it was more clear, it would be more interesting.
<br/>
<br/>
Good start!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
