    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi All,
<br/>
<br/>
I thought I'd share a Mode7 Demo I made in software for the GBA. Yeah yeah, I know, "Why not use the graphics hardware and do it that way, like Nintendo." The answer is two-fold, 
<br/>
<br/>
1. I wanted to see if I could make it fast enough for a game just using software rendering.
<br/>
2. If I wanted to later add polygonal objects I could, which I couldn't do with the hardware version.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the code is super optimized C (as optimized as I could make it without ASM). It includes all fixed point math and no divides. It's smoking fast. hehe.

You'lll notice the Mario Kart Track graphics look kinda crappy which is due to the fact I had to scale them down to get them to fit into RAM. hehe.<span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="http://jinrohdev.com/portfolio/Mode7Mode5Demo.rar" target="_blank">Download Here</a></span>

Later Guys.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I e-mailed both Simon B and Krom about it for news, but no reply to either e-mail.

Other than that, it's pretty cool. While I know that Mode 5 uses a 160x128 screen size, the tiles used for the Mode 7 seem to also be of low resolution. Was that intentional?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hehe, yeah I get a lot of complaints about that. I've got a quieter sound just didn't revise my intro yet. ^_^;

Yeah I mentioned that I had to scale down the source BMP so that it would fit into RAM. It was like a 2MB Bitmap. I just snagged a map PNG from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.snesmaps.com/maps/SuperMarioKart/SuperMarioKartMapSelect.html" target="_blank">here</a> and converted to a BMP.
<br/>
<br/>
Glad you liked it. ^^<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: gray">The lone Wolf howls, driven by pride he presses on. Knowing not where he goes, but only where he wants to be.
