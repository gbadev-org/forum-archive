    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Developers on the Game Boy Advance platform have often complained of clicks in their programs' audio output. These clicks tend to arise when the programmer chooses a sample rate such that the number of samples played per frame is not a whole number. There exist only a few "nice" sample rates on the GBA that will result in clickless playback when switching sample buffers in vblank; this tool searches for them.
