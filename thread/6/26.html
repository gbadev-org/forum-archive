<br/>
<br/>
Nice. Finaly u have done thinking about how it was to have an board..
<br/>
It was not sooo easy to find it because there is no link at the devgba.org main-page.
<br/>
<br/>
But however.
<br/>
<br/>
How u know (or mayb not) there some other gba forums into the web.
<br/>
Why do devgba.org dont work with other pages (i mean not english pages, too) together?
<br/>
<br/>
As example here this board. It is not realy difficult to install different Board-Text-Languages. All what u have todo is to say clear and direct that postings have to be in english.
<br/>
<br/>
On the board on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devgba.de" target="_blank">www.devgba.de</a> were not so far as build an gbadev only board like this. I think it is a good step forward for a bedder comunity. Do the next soon ;)
<br/>
<br/>
However ....<br/>_________________<br/>... but im just a <span style="text-decoration: underline">dummy</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">Newbie</span>

<br/>
latest post on gbadev.org, you would know why we dont have a link to
<br/>
the forum in the left frame yet.
<br/>
Other gba development sites can link to this forum if they want, they
<br/>
can also contact us if they want to work more closely together.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, its gbadev.org not devgba.org
