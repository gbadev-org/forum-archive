    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello!
<br/>
<br/>
     It has been a long time since I let you know something new about our game called ?Western Lords?. Nah, the project wasn?t dead at all even if it appeared to be. It?s just that my team and I were forced to work our fingers to the bone to enhance our skills in order to meet a professional achievement with our production.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you still have interest into our game project and that you will pay us a little visit!!
<br/>
<br/>
Here?s our official website; <a href="http://www.westernlords.com/" target="_blank">www.westernlords.com/</a>

You?re welcomed!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">oooh, this project grows more on me each day that pass...
<br/>
I really hope there will be atleast a scenario with loads of love... that's one thing i miss in games these days... Love..... maybe that's why I like FF8..
<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad to see you've taken some inspiration from Chrono Trigger, as it is my number one favourite of all time.
<br/>
<br/>
things I'd like to see is:
<br/>
Love,
<br/>
small but rewarding side-quests (a lot of them) like, i dont know, delivering mails from some people to others to gain a little gold, or experience, or something... eventually rare items perhaps?
<br/>
and unlockable "secret" scenarios, like those in chrono trigger for example. Those when you die at the last boss battle, when you can team up with magus etc.
<br/>
<br/>
damn, im getting all worked up and excited now *jumps around*<br/>_________________<br/>yeah, well, maybe... or? anyways.... eh...  what was i talking about??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, love won't be the main focus of our game, but yeah there will be a small love story between two characters. As for the main character some may think there will be a love story between him and Zilia, but no we don't want to go in that direction.
<br/>

    <h4>#59256 - Issac - Sun Oct 30, 2005 7:52 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah that's great!
<br/>
and no, love shouldn't be the main focus, but i still don't want it excluded totally, if you know what I mean hehe..
<br/>
<br/>
And I think that is a good idea too, that the main character-guy and the (in my 'opinion') main character-girl arn't mean't to be with eachother... Cause that would be very clich? (and I just noticed how bad my english got)
<br/>
<br/>
and to the side-quests etc. I read about the scoop-system.. seems very interesting!
<br/>
<br/>
and the battle system, with points to give the player more freedom. I think it seemed like the battle system in Unlimited Saga? right?
<br/>
then you set a number of points, and choose which characters you're going to use, and what combo you want...
<br/>
<br/>
how have you planned the experience system? any new and/or innovative way of leveling up? or the "old" and trustworthy system??
<br/>
<br/>
I am collecting ideas for my future game... not sure if I ever will make one, but that's my dreams, and I'm thinking of a little love scenario... BUT to be a little original.. im thinking of making it between two guys... cause that wouldn't be expected.
<br/>
One thing I've thought about, is to keep it secret, so It won't be reveled until close to the end, so many "homo-phobics" wont get apalled by that.
<br/>
What do you think of that?<br/>_________________<br/>yeah, well, maybe... or? anyways.... eh...  what was i talking about??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I?m not homophone but that?s not the kind of love story that?s going to appeal me? Or at least it depends how the idea is exploited. But I doubt that such a twist could appeal me. But yeah it could thrill tons of homosexual gamers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I guess it's somewhat original. If you're interested in how to depict love between two men you can check out Ang Lee's new movie Brokeback Mountain <a class="postlink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388795/" target="_blank">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388795/</a><br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hopefully yes. There?s still a lot of work to do though, mostly if we want to satisfy DS gamers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
