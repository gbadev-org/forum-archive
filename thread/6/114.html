    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My afterburner kit arrived like clockwork within 24 hours of ordering!
<br/>
Finally installed it - the instructions were not very clear in some steps and I found out later that it's probably best to go through all the steps to be sure what you are doing etc. I was expecting my GBA to die when I tackled this procedure.
<br/>
After install I shoved in a cart, turned the pot and the screen lit up!
<br/>
The colours looked washed out on full brightness and on the lower brightness I didn't really think it was worth the hastle.
<br/>
After a bit thinking and some forum posts (seeing some people moaning about the colours being washed out I have come to this conclusion)
<br/>
The GBA LCD colours are hard to see because of the colour response of the LCD.
<br/>
So lighting the display up will only amplify the original colour gamut, and not touch the contrast between the colours.
<br/>
So any device that lights the display up will still suffer from these problems.
<br/>
Correct me if I'm wrong on this reasoning.
<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion for me - buy a GBA SP and see what they are like...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought the color wash was a small price to pay for a lit screen I could see anywhere. I was quite happy with my purchase, of course would have been happier if there was a true backlit version that had vibrant colors, like some other handhelds of past. Can we say Lynx? :)<br/>_________________<br/>#gameart on EFnet. The pixel owns you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My afterburner works brilliantly - no washout at all that I can detect. Though the end result seems to vary from install to install.
<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure you removed every piece of protective film from the AB and the anti-glare film? There should be *four*. Over and over again people have complained about a poor result from the AB only to discover they left one of the films on. Not that it is always the solution (if only), but it is worth checking.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the install instructions aren't the best - it's a good idea to visit the Triton Labs forums before attempting an install - there are several improvements to the printed instructions that have been posted there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The perfect screen for the GBA would be a kodak organic LED display. Thoose babies is the future flat screen technology. Too bad they are still in the research stage... A prototype cost tens of thousands of dollars.
<br/>
They are very fast, consume little power, the pixels themself emitts light much like a CRT, and the colors are supposed to be fantastic.
<br/>
<br/>
Simply put it's a miniaturized version of a RGB LED matrix.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Booya! You tell 'em! ;)

Personally, I don't know why Nintendo screwed up the GBA screen so badly in the first place. I mean, didn't they ever *look* at the screen during testing? Correct me if I'm wrong, but the GBA screen is the worse implementation of a reflective color LCD matrix in the history of mankind.<br/>_________________<br/>Moron! You don't herd chickens with a shotgun!
