    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree with Sgeos, the DS was the unannounced next generation of gameboys, dispite what nintendo said when DS first came out.
<br/>
<br/>
Just as the gameboy advance was Gamecube's attachable buddy to unlock certain features of games
<br/>
<br/>
The DS is probably going to be Wii's attachable buddy and paired with the ability for the DS to turn into a writing tablet for the Wii to use, I would expect some really nice art programs.
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't be surprised if the Bob Ross game proposed for the Wii takes advantage of the DS as an alternate controller then using the remote for more fine art movements.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

At this point releasing handheld software in a non-DS card format would be silly, so I doubt a new "GameBoy" will be developed.  My guess is that slot-2 will probably be used for add on hardware.  Add on hardware generally sells poorly, so unless they stumble on something really crazy I think that GBA carts and slot-2 will phased out toward the end of the DS's life.

Some people sell their old systems.  (Selling quick before the price drops would be the way to go.)  Other people want to play games on the new system even if they own the old one.  Keeping track of one system is easier than keeping track of 2.  I use my GBA for playing GB and GBC games.  I play GBA games on my DS.

I tried this and it really hurt my eyes! GBA games tend to have the palette adjusted for the GBA screen, which as we know is quite a bit darker than the DS. Pok?mon Leaf Green, for example, looks all washed out on the DS, with no option to change the colours. Couple this with the weight of the DS (my skinny geek arms can hardly support it) and it means that I still use my SP for GBA games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Gameboy isn't dead yet. These forums still exist, and people are obviously still developing for it. (I'm one of them, of course.) Thus, in my eyes, the system is not dead. I will not hail it truly dead untill it's games are no longer playable on newer systems. Thus, though the GB and GBC are indeed dead, the GBA lives on, and that G part means that Gameboy still lives on.
<br/>
<br/>
With the added plus of the Wii probably allowing the download of the old games, it's possible that the gameboy games never die out. However, I do not doubt that the cart-playing versions will. 
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;/rambling&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
Just my take on the situation.

GBC is still playable on GBA SP (with new screen) and on GameCube (through an adapter), but it's still dead as to new commercial development (doesn't show up on warioworld anymore) and as to availability of homebrew dev equipment. NES (except for first-party games) is dead if you don't count emulators.

GB/GBC flash linkers don't help on Nintendo DS or Game Boy micro, which lack support for the GBC cart bus. Besides, they're not available for sale anymore even to people who own a GBC, GBA classic, GBA SP, or Game Boy Player.
<br/>
<br/>
Zzo was referring to Goomba Color, a GBA based emulator that interprets Z80 bytecode and translates writes to GBC hardware registers into the corresponding GBA writes.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I'd need a linker to pull games off my GB/GBC carts.  I'd love to be able to play them using a backlit screen (I own neither an GBASP or GB Light).  I'm not going to go ROM surfing.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds like it was just the reporter jumping to conclusions before, and they only meant they don't want to interrupt the DS's current popularity:
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/feature/?id=12748&amp;rp=1" target="_blank">http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/feature/?id=12748&amp;rp=1</a>
<br/>
<br/>
"BIZ: We recently read a quote from you in Reuters, suggesting that the Game Boy may be phased out. What does the future hold for the Game Boy line?
<br/>
<br/>
SI: No, it's not true after all. What we are repeatedly saying is that for whichever platform, we are always conducting research and development for the new system, be it the Game Boy, or new console or whatever. And what we just told the reporter was that in thinking about the current situation where we are enjoying great sales with the DS and that we are now trying to launch the Wii, it's unthinkable for us to launch any new platform for the handheld system, including the new version of the GBA... Perhaps they misunderstood a part of this story, but as far as the handheld market is concerned [right now] we really want to focus on more sales of the DS; that's all.
<br/>
<br/>
And of course, as you know, the backlit version of the GBA in the United States is still selling very well, so that we are continuing the production. "<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
