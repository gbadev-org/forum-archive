<br/>
This is a two-player game, there is no link support as of yet (doubtful unless somebody really shows that they are interested)
<br/>
<br/>
There is no computer AI to play against.  (Such implementation would be mind-boggling to say the least.)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a very amature coder so the code is weak, and the fence linking detection is horrible.  Not to mention red player can put fences over black's(blue on the GBA - easier to see) - even though you're not supposed to.  I'm to lazy to implement detection.  Besides, anyone serious about playing the game should know the rules and would easily be able to avoid/ignore this.  There is also no Win condition detection.  The players would have to know that they have won.
<br/>
<br/>
Regardless it is still a playable version of TwixT on the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in this at all please post here.

*EDIT*
<br/>
Here's a screenshot:
