    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've developed a new XBOO client that works in winXP/2000, for those who have problems with Martin's uploader. It works just as fast, but i have yet to implement BURST BOOT. Im working on that, but i know only a few use xboo, and fewer use BURST BOOT.
<br/>
<br/>
My goal of this project is to eventually implement a save file extractor, which i have'nt started on yet (I'll finish BURST BOOT first). Any help is appreciated. This program is open source.

Thanks to my good friend <span style="font-weight: bold">arundel,</span> who by the way works on a great XBOO client for linux, has found me a spot on the web for my files. <span style="font-weight: bold">If you use linux give his program a try.</span> He has helped me a lot, and we are still working together on this.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the program,
