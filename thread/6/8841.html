    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Pros:  The graphics rock.  Play control is really smooth. Feels really polished.
<br/>
<br/>
Cons:  gameplay is pretty repetitive.  After the first 20 seconds, I didn't have much to make me keep wanting to play the rest.  Using Halo characters means you could get eventually get smacked down by a cease &amp; desist.
<br/>
<br/>
Blowing up the doors when I'm too close to them hurt me?  That was weird.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank for the feedback Gauauu!
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, credits to the Halo Blood Covenant team for the graphics - they rock.
<br/>
<br/>
For sure the gameplay is pretty dull.  This was basically a one week project (every evening and all weekend!)  playing around with using multiple sprites for a character.  I thought it looked so cool on my gba that I had to make a game out of it - so an easy way was a time based game!
<br/>
<br/>
If I choose to continue with this, I will likely move to a health system, and remove the "2 seconds with no control getting hit" sequences.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also, you'd maybe want some other sort of movement/gimmick to make it more interesting.  Jumping would work, but the character is maybe too big for jumping around.    
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe something like including movement in the Z direction (like use L&amp;R to move to move "back and forth" (which would just move your sprite slightly left and up to simulate a Z direction, like a double-dragon type game))
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just an idea</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
