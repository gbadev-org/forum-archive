    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh :) that;d be cool, hopefully I'll be good enough to contribute :). When I play a game I always try to spot the 'gameplay cracks'. Let's see if that payed off :).<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I mean other stuff, just bad game design. Where for example a game has a lot of potential but because the creators made it too easy and stuff they don't tap into that potential. Or just other crappy little stuff that are irritating in the control.<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think this is a great idea, considering how little could be found about 2D/tile-based game design.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
