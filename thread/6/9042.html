    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just loaded up an old binary of a small game I wrote, works great. I found a couple minor errors in my game already, though they do not crash the game.  On top of that just going step by step through the assembly is really helping me learn how to program in assembly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
