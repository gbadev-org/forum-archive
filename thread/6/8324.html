Ok, today we're going to have a stupid competition. I didnt have anything to do (or rather, I had plenty to do but it was boring) so I came up with this time-wasting competiton.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Whats that cart?</span>
<br/>
<br/>
You have 1 week to try to figure out what kind of cartridges are pictured above. Click to get the full-size image (with numbered carts). There are 7 different carts and you have to tell me what kind of cartridges they are.
<br/>
<br/>
An example; If you think that cartridge #1 is an official GBA gamepak cartridge, and #2 is a wireless link-adapter you would write:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Official GBA gamepak
<br/>
2. Wireless link-adapter
<br/>
3. something here...
<br/>
etc
<br/>
<br/>
Easy, isnt it? ;)
<br/>
<br/>
The first person who can correctly identify all the 7 cartridges will win a nice prize.
<br/>
<br/>
Please e-mail your answers to <span style="font-weight: bold">simonb[a-t]gbadev.org</span> and be sure to include your gbadev.org forum username. Only forum users are eligible for a prize :)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by SimonB on Wed Feb 01, 2006 4:59 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

The best result was 6/7.
<br/>
<br/>
Correct answers:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Unlicenced/Pirate (see screw-hole &amp; color)
<br/>
2. Official Prototype/Pre-production GBA cartridge. Used only at Nintendo (in-house) before the GBA cartridge design/look was finalized. Hmm...I wonder why no one managed to correctly guess this one ;D
<br/>
3. Unlicenced/Pirate (see text on cart)
<br/>
4. Official GBA gamepak
<br/>
5. Official GBA development cartridge (early...)
<br/>
6. Official GBA development cartridge (early...)
<br/>
7. Official GBA development cartridge (current). A modified AGB-013 was also used for some games with an extra sensor on the cartridge (rumble/rotation/tilt/sun). Anyway, partial credit if you said it was a sensor cart =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
4. Official GBA Game Cartridge
<br/>
5. AGB 64Mbit Flash Card
<br/>
6. AGB 128mbit Flash Card  -  older
<br/>
7. AGB 128mbit Flash Card  -  newer

But yes, another competition, with a role-over jackpot?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Meh, 6/7 :(
<br/>
<br/>
I completly ignored #2 when I didn't see any patent text, just marked it down as a type of pirate I'd never seen before.
<br/>
<br/>
I guessed both answers on #7, first the 128 M flash debugger cart with swappable save boards, then changing my answer to tilt / light sensor pak when he posted about someone getting 6/7, thinking that was the incorrect answer, rather than it being #2.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat
