    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After three very long months my project is finally complete. For my senior seminar class I chose to make a game for the game boy advance. After going through a few excellent tutorials I was well on my way to making a great game. Gravity Ball Advance is a game where you fight gravity and avoid objects such as walls. There are a total of 9 levels with different environments such as reverse gravity, space, fans, and switches and three difficulty levels to choose from. At the end of every third level there is a boss you must defeat.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hahahahahaha, best intro ever =D Hope you are aware that the first screen(the one with the two scientists) disappear to fast, so you can't hear the last two words being said of the plot.
<br/>
But anyway, thank's for this cool game, which I, at the very moment, find very hard=P, But I think I will get used to controls in a while=P
<br/>
Have just only made it to the first checkpoint yet, LOL=P Haha, maybe it's I who suck, I don't know=) But I like challenging games alot^^
<br/>
<br/>
I tried it in "Visualboy advance" and it worked fine. However, when I tried it on my "EZ-flash 4" the game didn't boot at all. This problem was however easily solved with "GBATA", since it was able to correct the header of the rom because it was bad.
<br/>
<br/>
Wonder if it's possible to make a random map generator for this kind of game?^^ Like an endless mode of some sort, there you have to survive as long as possible=P
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you will improve this game further and good luck with the development^^
<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice day!
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Yey, I finished the game at easy difficulty=P It's was not that hard as I thought at first=P But it will probaly be much harder when there is a limited amount of lives as in the normal and hard settings of the game. I liked the level where there was some change of gravity=P
<br/>
An weird bug occured at the last boss, when I runned into him, strange because I did the same thing several times before and the bug  did not occured at the first time. The bug turned mr. Purple into a white square. Probably because the sprite which was supposed to look like Purple just disappeared, and left under it was only the dangerous square that you didn't want to hit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was actually going to add this as a bonus, but due to time constraints I had to cut that option out. I gave it a lot of thought, I think it is definitely possible, I would just need to structure it right. I would also have a counter to keep track of how far you went before dying and a high score. I might go back and add this in, but for right now I need a nice break from it all because for the last few months I've been working on it throughout all of my free time.

Actually, you guys might also be interested to hear that awhile ago I have made a very similar game to be played in a web browser. The game was called "Death Ball" (Because you seemed to die alot) and had the exact same concept. The differences are alot different physics of gravity, there is now a goal instead of a scrolling stage, and there are 8 stages and you receive a rank at the end. You can check out "Death Ball" here:
