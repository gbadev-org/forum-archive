    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">rooter: I think you forgot to include the actual .zip file and the screenshot of the game. If the game .zip file is several megabytes, please provide a direct link to it instead. But please include the screenshot in your mail.
<br/>
<br/>
We do try to post demos/games/news as soon as we receive them, but as we do receive a lot of stuff and have full time jobs it might take a few days. As we are also spending quite a lot of effort on the database and other functions of the site, demos/games might be pushed up til the next day...

Thanks!
