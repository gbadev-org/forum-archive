    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is a fully playable, if somewhat limited, game. It was intended as a demo to attract publishers  It is a quite clever puzzle/platform game that was originally inspired by the obscure Vic 20 game Bricks. The finished game was meant to have enemies of different behaviour but it still works as a game without them. A little bit like a reverse Mr. Driller. 
<br/>
<br/>
It can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.athleticdesign.se/theoldwell" target="_blank">www.athleticdesign.se/theoldwell</a> Instructions are inside the game. Dan Johansson programmed the game. Anders Hansson designed the game and made the graphics.
<br/>
<br/>
The demo was finished - way too late - in 2004. With no interests from publishers, we began working on a PC-version instead, which unfortunately also was abandoned later. However, it was partly included as a level of my recently released PC-game Lighthouse Lunacy at <a href="http://www.lighthouselunacy.com" target="_blank">www.lighthouselunacy.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by AHH on Mon Apr 16, 2007 12:05 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
