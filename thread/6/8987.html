    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Pet peeve: There is no "VirtualboyAdvance". There is "Virtual Game Boy Advance", an obsolete emulator by Marat, and then there is "VisualBoyAdvance", a more current emulator by Forgotten and kxu. I'll assume you mean the latter.
<br/>
<br/>
Usually if you see "unimplemented BIOS function 0x0d", you can safely ignore it. It just runs a checksum on the BIOS. Many programs use this to detect GBA vs. Nintendo DS vs. emulators so that they can work around emulator bugs or use a less-brightened palette on the DS's brighter screen.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
menu screen works fine. when selecting bengt, the screen disappears and some noise can be heared.
<br/>
<br/>
sounds like in the gold old days when I programmed on an atari st and the computer crashed while playing some samples.
<br/>
<br/>
the other games work fine.
<br/>
<br/>
is there any way to get bengt as a .gba file on its own? this would be a good solution.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's odd indeed.  I've got a 1 Gbit F2AU right here, and it works perfectly on mine.  I just tested it to make sure.  
<br/>
<br/>
=/ I'm not sure what the problem you're having is.  Have you tried erasing the cart and reflashing?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
