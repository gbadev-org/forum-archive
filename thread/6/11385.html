    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have removed the Visual Confirmation Registration from the forum and replaced it with a question/answer type of thing instead. Hopefully this will keep all the spambots out and give the visually impaired and others that might have experienced problems before an easier time registering.

I have also deleted ~850 members whos accounts were both inactive and had no posts to their name.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

While I can tolerate real people that spam (I usually get a few of those "Hey Bill Gates is giving out money when you forward this e-mail!" chainletters by e-tard friends of mine), I completely loathe spambots and the guys who programmed those. Thanks to the amount of spam I am prone to delete important mails by accident and sorting through all that junk (I don't trust the filters...) is time consuming. So yeah, thumbs up for getting rid of spambots.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This helps visually impared visitor how?  How many visually impared visitors does this forum get?  The blind people I know are disinterested in the GBA/DS for obvious reasons.
<br/>
<br/>
Will questions make things difficult for foreign visitors?

I had not thought of that.  Are the questions simple?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the main problem with the CAPTCHA system is that it doesn't work in text-only browsers.  As the only working homebrew DS web browser is text-only, it's ironic that a user can't register for the DS Dev forums using the DS homebrew browser.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, they have been doing so more and more frequently over the last few months. At most I think 5-6 of them have registered on a single day. Most of them dont post any spam but they do set their website to link to odd webshops etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It doesn't take OCR for a bot to break CAPTCHA. It's rawther common nowadays for sites to <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA#Cheap_human_labor" target="_blank">get CAPTCHAs from forums and use offers of porn to get horny men to solve them for free</a>. Consider it the equivalent of PassMe for spam ;-)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I knew about this phenomenon, but not how commonly in use it was. It stinks that they've been so successful with it.

I always thought that such a method could be used, even just having some crack one of these per may be enough.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
