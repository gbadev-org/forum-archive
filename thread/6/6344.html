    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To cover extra expenses for the compo game (and also to finance a secret project that will be of great help to you all), I am now selling the cartridges that I originally ordered for the compo game. I couldnt get them to work way-back-then but now they do. However, since the burning process is more complicated than it should be I cant sell them empty.
<br/>
<br/>
More info...
<br/>
<br/>
Cartridge size: 32Mbit
<br/>
Save function: SRAM
<br/>
Cartridge color: Gray/dark gray
<br/>
Price: 4$usd / cartridge
<br/>
Minimum order: 5 cartridges
<br/>
Shipping: 4$usd for 5 cartridges. 8$usd for upto ~15 carts. Insurance/tracking is 8$usd extra (if you really want it...).
<br/>
Payment method: PayPal (add 6% to cover fee's and exchange-rates). Bank transfer (to EU bank - in Euros).
<br/>
<br/>
Example order:
<br/>
5 cartridges (20$usd)
<br/>
Regular uninsured (airmail) shipping (4$usd)
<br/>
payment by PayPal (24 * .06 = 1.44$usd)
<br/>
Total: 20+4+1.44= 25.44$
<br/>
<br/>
Supply is limited so first come first served. Please reply here if you have any general questions or in a PM if you are shy :)

I haven't finished my game yet =O

I dont expect to finish it too soon, but progress is *really* on the way.. any suggestions?  Should I buy now and send them back for burning when I have completed the rom?  How much would shipping be to England?

This would be so great!!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Simon,
<br/>
<br/>
How much would you charge for a set of 24 carts AND the burner. I don't imagine you'll need the burner once you're all done selling them off. I can wait until the rest of them are sold off.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, 24 is the minimum I need. If you have more available, I can save you the hassle of selling to dozens of people and buy them all now. :)

I have no problem with that. I noticed you wrote cartridge and not cartridges though. Please note that the minimum order is 5pcs.

Well the game should be safe on the cart but Im not sure about the quality of the SRAM chip. I dont think it would be any big problem but I guess its a chance you have to take :)

So if I go ahead and buy 5 or 10 there is no problem with you having carts sold to me for quite a while while I complete the game I'm working on?

If you can confirm that it wont be a problem I'll go ahead and purchase some =)

I would rather burn the games in the near future but as long as its before the end of the year there shouldnt be any problems. Please PM me with exact number of carts, shipping &amp; payment method.

Even with a huge shipping fee that would be much cheaper then buying a flash card for a single use :p
