    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You have a flash cart from gba development don't you?  So you can use that and cut down on your number of steps.  It usually takes me about 30 seconds to go from build to test (including flash time).  That of course changes for large programs.

<br/>
Relying on emulators in their current state is also asking for trouble, especially with the fun stuff like 3D and sound :).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
This is something that puzzles me, there have been comments made about code behaving differently between FlashMe, WifiMe and PassMe but I've yet to see the evidence. Locally all the examples work the same way for me using all the methods I can currently use. If anyone has any samples which do behave differently I'd like to see them.
<br/>
<br/>
There are some problems with gbamp and G6 which need some modifications in their respective launchers afaict.
<br/>
<br/>
As for iDeaS, nothing I write that uses bios calls works with it so right now it's a waste of time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
