    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just want to announce that I have ported part of the Pstros MIDP implementation to the NDS. It means that you can run java programs for the mobile phones on the NDS. It runs upon the CLDC java machine from Sun (KVM) that was originaly ported to GBA by Torlus and lately to NDS by davr. More info and the binary is here: <a href="http://www.volny.cz/molej/pstrosnds/" target="_blank">http://www.volny.cz/molej/pstrosnds/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Excellent release!  I've been having a few issues running some games on hardware (when they work fine in iDeaS) but I'm guessing my installation is partially to blame.  I'll continue messing around with it.

Does it matter if I'm using JADmaker to create JAD files for releases that don't come with them?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The program checks only the MIDlet-Jar-URL: entry in the jad file, so I think any generic jad creator should work fine.  However the rest of the entries of the JAD file is available for a query by System.getProperty().

If you ecounter a bug which can be reproduced, please let me know (I know about a bug in the Form class during the scrolling - already fixed, but not released yet).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
