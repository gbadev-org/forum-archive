Don't know, but it involved making a linker script for each game that changed its starting address in ROM space.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are actually a couple of motives behind this competition.
<br/>
<br/>
A) Evidently, there are a bunch of GBAccelerometers collecting dust.  I thought it would be kind of cute to run a motion sensing competition.
<br/>
B) I think it would be cute to create a small publisher that can bring homebrew games to market, even if that is just direct to market/etail/auctions and not retail.  I think it would be fun to hold a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_auction" target="_blank">dutch auction</a> to sell the carts.  Carts would have numbered labels.  Naturally, each winning entrant would be sent a free cart (perhaps without an accelerometer, because they conceivably have one already).

This is a good idea.  I wonder what it would take to get a genuine ESRB rating.  More than likely a lot of trouble, but it is worth looking into.

You could map the arrow keys, page up and page down to the accelerometer.  The solution is horrible.  My point is that there is not good way of emulating the GBAccelerometer short of polling an accelerometer that is attached to your computer.  At least, I can not come up with a decent solution.  Using the mouse and the scroll wheel seems broken, but perhaps it is better than the keyboard?

<br/>
Correct.  In theory you might be able to connect a GBAccelerometer to the gameboy player, but using it is not practical; indeed, it is probably not a very good idea.  Due to the orientation of the link port, some of the axes are not consistent between the GBA and GBA SP.

Using the library, polling the accelerometer is simple.  Conceptually it works like this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">init_accelerometer(); // once

//...
<br/>
<br/>
get_x(); // every frame
<br/>
get_y(); // every frame
<br/>
get_z(); // every frame</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
There are a few more details in real code, but I was amazed by how easy the GBAccelerometer is to use.

I don't own supercard.  Probably?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is no soldering involved.  The GBAccelerometer is simple- you need the unit itself and a cart.  (As tepples mentioned, either GBA or GBA SP unit is also needed.)  The DS is a little more complicated- the motion card has to be swapped in after booting.
<br/>
<br/>
It seems like there is a little life left in GBA.  Naturally, I think that this is worth a shot.

If you make it a GBAccelerometer only, you reduce your final cart sales to those that either own a GBAccelerometer, or people that are willing to spend $xx on the game cart, and then an additional $xx on the GBAccelerometer.

Assuming this is a go, the final product will be a cart + GBAccelerometer bundle.  Winning entrants will be sent one free cart, but not an accelerometer; accelerometers are limited, but ordering a few extra carts is not a big deal.  One presumes that the developers already own an accelerometer.

Noted.  I don't know how big an impact this will have.  I am sure that it will turn a few people off, but I don't think that it is worth cancelling the compo due to this alone.  250 units is only 250 units.  I would be shocked if there was less demand than that.  The GBS/SP only situation worries me in so far as developers may be turned off to the compo.

You can always buy a used GBA/SP.  Ebay did not let me search for completed items, but I can't imagine that they are that expensive.
