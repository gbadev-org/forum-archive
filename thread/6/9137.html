<br/>
<br/>
I just finished ironing out most of the major bugs in my game, so I figured everyone else out there in Cyber-Land could have a go with it too!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Spider Solitair</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Most of you know the game from Window's Pre-Installed version ( which is what this is based off ).
<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, I love the game, and am quite pleased with the end-result of making it for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
So, without further ado...

Have fun, and don't hesitate to give any crit/feedback/praise for whatever you want!

Cheers,

[EDIT]
<br/>
Ps - Forgot to mention...
<br/>
- There are still elusive bugs! If you can pin-point where one happens, I'd very much appreciate it
<br/>
- If you want to start a new 'game' without restarting the entire ROM, hit 'Start' which will re-set everything for you :)

<br/>
Just a couple of issues I had when I tried on my DS:
<br/>
<br/>
Selecting cards in long, bunched-up piles can be a bit difficult/frustrating. Maybe some kind of zooming is needed to assist selecting the one you want. Also it's a bit too strict on where cards are dropped. It was taking me several attempts to drag things and get them to actually land where I wanted
<br/>
<br/>
The other thing... it crashed on me :( I think it was just when I was dropping a pile of cards somewhere. Can't quite make out the error message it dumped (obscured by the cards)
<br/>
<br/>
something like "Terminated called after throwing an instance of 'st?? out_of_range' ?hat(): vector::_M_range_check"
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps, and good luck with future versions!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Zooming! That's a perfect solution... Now, to impliment it :P
<br/>
<br/>
I too get the out of range error, but can't pin it down to anything in particular ( and I've played whole games multiple times without getting the crash at all ), so I'm not sure what's doing it... I s'pose I should put in a whole load of exception handling!
<br/>
<br/>
I agree that dropping the cards is a little strict - The only thing is, with the way it is currently, you can instantly see which pile it'll be landing on. It's just when you remove the stylus from the screen, you may accidentally drag it a slight bit, which moves it onto a column next to it...
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the feedback!
<br/>
It's good to know someone else can play it too ( even with the errors )
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,
<br/>
Jess.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice job, but I find it tough to differentiate between suits quickly.  Also, there wasn't a way to return to the main menu (to switch the number of decks) currently.
<br/>
<br/>
Zooming would be amazing: I showed the game to my mother, who recently became hooked on Spider solitaire, but she had a hard time playing because the cards were too small.  Maybe make it like Opera browser on the DS will be, with the bottum acting as a zoomed in view with the top as the entire board.
<br/>
<br/>
Non-touch control would be a nice addition, as would "ghosting" of picked-up cards so that you can see where you are dragging them.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the work, and thanks for keeping it open-source!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
A couple new features;
<br/>
SELECT takes you back to the main menu to start a new game of any type, or resume your current game;
<br/>
Uses both screens for displaying data on the top, and the cards on the bottom;
<br/>
<br/>
I've also implimented it so that selected cards have their black borders changed, but I ran out of sprite memory, so I have to look into a work-around for it when (if) I get time between Uni and my next DS project with my mates...
<br/>
<br/>
Have a bash, and have some fun :)
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,

Jess.

<br/>
PS.
<br/>
Oh, and the source code is a lot better documented now, so if anyone is wanting to disect it to see what's happening, you can actually understand it :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
