    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">how do you want to save the current date/time? I don't see any possible solution...
<br/>
<br/>
you could of course use sram to save the time settings, but the time would still have to move on when the rom is turned off, so you'd need something like an internal processor wich increments the current time stored on your rom.
<br/>
<br/>
An ebook reader for doc or even pdf files would be kickass! I suggest you to search for gbafs (gba file system), it allows you to store files on the gba, an "windows explorer" on the gba would be great :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
