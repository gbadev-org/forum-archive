    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's my latest (and by far the best) GBA demo from Breakpoint 2008, I hope you enjoy it. There are some syncronization problems that hasn't been ironed out yet, but it should be worth the watch either way! :)

This is a GBA demo, and a GBA has one speaker.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I really don't care about the GBA having only one speaker, but it was more of a question about performance and the amount of time that we had. Mono is faster, and the implementation we had wasn't stereo, so we cut the idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The 3D looks almost PS1 quality, and the effects aren't the stereotypical lens-table effects that everyone else has overdone.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
