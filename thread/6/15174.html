If they release it on the DS and a homebrew version is available for free, that's a totally different kettle of fish.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unlikely, unless you can think of a specific exclusive right that they might threaten you with. And the boot logo doesn't count, at least in the States; <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/search.php" target="_blank">search</a> for "accolade" to see why.
<br/>
<br/>
To "alien8r33d": Take all "Alien Breed" branding and artwork out of the game, and you can probably continue the development under a different name, as the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratagus" target="_blank">Stratagus</a> developers did.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You should talk to them, I always found Team17 a really good company to work with, and they have a great ethos. Only down-side is, apparently, they have a worms infestation...
