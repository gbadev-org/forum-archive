Heya
<br/>
<br/>
Been uploading a new no$gba update. And, I've a new email address (see above), the old address has been flooded with spam. Please do NOT put it online, do NOT post it into forums, I hope it'll remain spam-free for a while.
<br/>
<br/>
The main no$gba news is NDS sound emulation, emulates all sound channels &amp; sound formats, and the various combinations of mixing/rounding/clipping/routing towards speakers and capture unit, including for exact reproduction of all capture errors. While working on it, I've also fixed a bug on GBA sound ch3, and measured and emulated correct/clipped output levels for GBA sounds.
<br/>
<br/>
Aside from sound: Bugfixes for the ARM9 halfword-multiply opcodes, and for ARM9 q(d)add/sub opcodes, for accessing GBA-slot SRAM in NDS mode, for 3D GX "nop" command, and for 3D texture transformations. 3D Boxtest command (more or less) emulated. Wrapped 2D bitmaps emulated (which do work on NDS, unlike as on GBA). Plus a couple of curious CPU details: emulates ARM9 pre-armv5 mode, emulates stm/ldm with empty rlist, as well as rlist's with write-back plus base-inclusion, and the newly discovered dummy CP14 unit on the GBA/ARM7.

<br/>
- nds/sound: emulates sound-hold (freezes output until hold=0 or next re-start)
<br/>
- nds/sound: optionally mono output, optionally disabled, on machine 1 only
<br/>
- nds/sound: allows "dumb loops" when reading non-irq-timed sound status regs

<br/>
- nds/sound: emulates sound loop+length and high accuracy frequency timings
<br/>
- nds/gba-slot/bugfix: memadr_sram (instead nnn=0Eh) (thanks Chow Kim Foong)
