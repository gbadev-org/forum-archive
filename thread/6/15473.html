This is the best thing created for the on-the-go artist since the invention of premixed paint. I just traded one of my friends my PSP for his DS just for this tool.  If my art school didn't take every dollar I manage to scrounge up I would totally donate to this. Keep up the good work, and keep improving it and when I finally get a job I will make up for lost time haha.
