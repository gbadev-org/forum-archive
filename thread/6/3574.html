    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another coding compo organized by PDRoms...here comes the information:
<br/>
<br/>
Your goal is to greate a "Game &amp; Watch" style game, in fact a LCD style game, with leading intro! (An intro contains (scroll)text and a (moving) logo. Deadline is Sunday, 4th July, 2004 at 23:59 GMT +1. 1st prize is a NGPC with 7 games. Allowed systems are: Gameboy Classic, Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, GP32, Neo Geo Pocket, Neo Geo Pocket Color, NES &amp; Dreamcast! Click on the link below the get more information.

<br/>
Can these "static" elements overlap during the game? (i.e. collision) Or would a character be limited to one pose per location on the screen?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, If I understand the article correctly, a hypothetical GBA entry that used two colours as allowed by the rules, say black &amp; white, would also be allowed a shade or two of grey to AA out rough edges and whatnot?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I think that characters shouldn't overlap in any case.... remember, it's G&amp;W. Maybe one additional rule could be that the game should show up every character/sprite it will use at its beginning, for one second (like what you can see when your G&amp;W is somewhat broken, or if you play with battery placement :))<br/>_________________<br/>GBA,GC,NGPC,GP32,FPGA,DS stuff at <a class="postlink" href="http://torlus.com/" target="_blank">http://torlus.com/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You could also arrange the display like this:

<br/>
X X X X X X X X
<br/>
 X X X X X X X X</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Where "X" marks a character. In that way you could write a game using only "half" of the screen, and do any animation you want! ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What I've been doing is setting up each LCD "element/pixel" as a hardware sprite, and instead of changing x,y coordinates or doing palette changes, I just use the sizedouble flag trick to turn different ones on and off.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since these sorts of games are ridiculously easy to implement, I guess the challenge is in making something that really stands out.
<br/>
<br/>
Then again, the "intro" part of the goal might get all the attention, making the compo pretty much the same as all the others.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

G&amp;W screens are not big enough to display more than 255 "pixels".  If you have a larger screen, and a component you use over and over, then it becomes very easy to inflate the number of "odd-shaped 'pixels'" on the screen.  I have a design that uses 607 odd shaped pixels:
<br/>
Component A: 18 parts x 30 on screen = 540
<br/>
Component B: 8 parts x 8 on sceen = 64
<br/>
Misc: 3
<br/>
<br/>
The number counter on microwaves and digital clocks has 7 "pixels".  Have a field of four of those and you get 28 pixels.  Have more than one field, and...

Keep in mind that you can always split your dude/object into parts and activate those parts individually.  I could have an enemy and a sword "pixel" with one half to the right of the enemy, and one half to the left.  There is no collision.  I could also have a body a left foot and a right foot.  Always keep the body on, and switch the foot to display a different movement direction.

<br/>
<br/>
200 for the board
<br/>
8 for next piece (maybe only 7)
<br/>
5 misc ("LEVEL", "HIGH-", "SCORE", "LINES", and 2 colons)
<br/>
91 in "pixels" numbers (7 x 13 numberals)
<br/>

Total: 304  (maybe 303)

I'd love to hear the LCD component count if anybody has an LCD poker or anything like that.

"Only 2 colors are allowed at once on the screen... Black and white do count as colors!"
<br/>
<br/>
The way I read the rules, I could make a game that uses the entire LCD screen, and as long as I only have 2 colors on the screen at one time it is valid.  There is a vague "no animation &amp; smoothing scrolling allowed after the intro, only static movement".  I'm sure they would use that to disqualify the entry, even though the movement *is* static.  Each pixel
<br/>
is either "on" or "off".
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to see a limit put on the number of discrete LCD cells.  A discrete LCD cell can either be on or off.  1024 and 2500 both sound like good numbers to me.  Either one should be enough to implement a complex LCD game, and if somebody really wants to use those discrete LCD cells to implement a mini screen, I think they should be allowed to go for it.  Was it the pocket pikachu that operated using a mini screen?
