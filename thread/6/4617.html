    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I expected more from the compo entries.
<br/>
The majority of the games are clones, use copy righted material, or are below standard in art and design. One person decided to make strip poker for kids which would be rated M which would cut out the majority of the consumers.
<br/>
<br/>
A picture is worth 1000 words and the games that stick out on art and some originality are
<br/>
starfortress, ouzy, and spacewar,bsol
<br/>
<br/>
Another 3 seem are 1/2 decent but need more work. The games by themselves would not sell well, but selling them as a multi pack might have a chance. It is a good thing that the cartridge is being sold to break even or else there would be problems. If this does not sell well I still think there should be another one like this but with team efforts.
<br/>
<br/>
Aside form that the creativity and design is lacking. This is just an opinion. I commend them for getting something done unlike others.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Regarding graphics - I personally like the restrictions the GBA imposes. Gameplay cannot be judged by just a screenshot.
<br/>
<br/>
Just because the games are going to be sold doesn't mean that you can demand professional (read expensive) quality. I am assuming all the entries are by part-timers.
<br/>
Perhaps given a longer period of time graphics could have been more polished. We made the game, then 'fancified' the graphics.

Hehehehehehe, thanks for noticing. It's not for kids, by the way - you'd know if you *played* it. In fact, you can put an R in there, or maybe XXX, which could attract even more consumers. For me, I'll let the actual judges decide if the game needs a few black stripes, a full art rework or will be cut right off.

Couldn?t you have made another character? Good idea but I played a multiplayer pac-man before but as you said others might like it.

Many games get sell for how they look which is why they are on display. Even in other competitions just by viewing the images show that the games are not that good ?most? of the times.

Plenty of people offering and asking for help. You could make a good game within a week or two with good art. I offered art assistance and many others have in this and other art sites like the pixilation forums.

That?s a matter of opinion, and I always expect more. If you like all the games them better for you. ;)

I was being sarcastic and know it was not meant for kids. You could have changed the art and put fantasy art for a background so kids and women would appreciate it more. I do not think your game would get in and maybe if you edit the art then maybe it will.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
One thing is offering assistance, another is sitting down and doing the donkey work of drawing many quality frames and fonts and stuff. Most pixel artists that offer help just want to draw a few "cool backgrounds" and can't commit to much more.  I don't know if you've ever worked on a game to completion, but it takes yonks to get anywhere. A week or two seems a very short while for a part time GBA project. Perhaps you are thinking of PC devving, where size doesn't matter and there are several poweful games creation languages.
<br/>
Or maybe I'm just a slow coder who can't draw...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If I'm interpreting this correctly, you're saying they're crazy for how they've picked the games thus far? Based on them having played the game, and you seeing a single screen of each?

Have you seen "Star Fortress Dendron"?, it has an incredible professional look. Maybe it's short (like mine's) but we're speaking of fun and (this is my subjective opinion) cards/puzzle games are BORING.

What? No games have been selected to be on the cart yet. As it says on the compo website, the games marked with: "YES" = Has a good chance on getting on the cart
<br/>
<br/>
There are also 3 games that was very close and would be on the cartridge if they fixed some things. In your case it was the lenght of the game. I have already suggested to you to add a few more levels since it takes 5 minutes to complete the game, and since there is no real replay-value we would rather fit a few smaller games on the cart instead. Games that you can play for a longer period of time.

<br/>
<br/>
We have seen it and as far as we know the developers are still working on the game and will submit an updated version. If they do they have a very good chance of getting on the cart as all the judges really liked the game.
<br/>
<br/>
The third game marked with "YES/MAYBE" was GunKid, and we have already received a new version that is said to have fixed the scrolling problems. I have not had a chance to test it yet but if it works then it will most definitely be marked as a "YES" entry.
<br/>
<br/>
Several of the games marked with "MAYBE" also still has a good chance if they address some issues, like bugs or lack of sound.

<br/>
Sure the game is good but I finished it in &lt;1 minute, and considering the game is already 500Kbyte we did not want to include it in the cart. I think its strange that you cannot understand why a game that takes a minute to complete is not selected to be on the cart.
<br/>
<br/>
After January 5th when we have re-reviewed the updated games, we will have to decide which of the games marked with "YES" will be put on the cart. Of course not all of them will fit so we will have to weigh the pro's and con's like lastability and size againts eachother to be able to fit the most amount of good games on the finalized cartridge.

I did? When and where did I do that? I do however remember saying "nice and small games that you can pick up at any time and play for a few mins". Of course what is meant by that is that you can pick it up at any time and play it for a few minutes then stop...and then play again for a few minutes later etc. I havent said that you should be able to finish the games in a few minutes. How much fun would it be with a cartridge with 7 games that each take a few minutes to finish? <span style="font-style: italic">Playing</span> a game for 5 minutes and <span style="font-style: italic">finishing</span> a game in 5 minutes are two <span style="font-weight: bold">very</span> different things.

How about 2 player support with 2 AI?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
He may not have the time to make AI.  Even if it is only 2P or 3P on the the map, anything is better than nothing.
<br/>
Of course, this is the developer's call.  =)

The game multiboots to all other GBAs, you only need one cart 4 GBA units and a link cable.
<br/>
<br/>
2P and 3P works and maybe I could add a few perks like increased speed for the ghost or being able to see PacMan's position on the radar when there are not 4 players. I wish I could show you guys and get your suggestions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Do not rush yourself into adding last-minutes features. Your game seems great and I hope it's gonna be on the cart. 
<br/>
<br/>
There will be time to add new features once the game is released on gbadev.
<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents,
<br/>

With multiplayer games, it's always the more the merrier.  Less than 4P may not be as much fun, but "not as much fun" is better than not being able to play it at all.  My chances of being able to play a 4P GBA games are between slim and nil- closer to nil.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks Vince. I don't believe it'll get on the cart because it's in the MAYBE category due to the fact that it's 4 players only. I'll get it fixed up and possibly allow 3 players. It will be released on GBA Dev and anyone with a flash cart, 3 friends with GBAs and a 4-way link cable can then play.  
<br/>
<br/>
The reason I have chosen this is because of the way the game was designed - it just works in such a way that 3 player and 2 player just wouldn't work as the game is intended. You'll understand when it's released. I think it will work out better for everyone if it's free to download anyway although now my friends will have to buy a flash cart if they want their own copy - or they can just come to me. :)
<br/>
<br/>
When it's released I can hopefully get some feedback and then I can fix it all up in whatever ways that you feel necessary.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can take any videogame you want and play for a few minutes and then stop. Since that requirement is something superfluous I understood your phrase as the other meaning.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Five minutes won't even get you between save points in most RPGs, let alone through the opening cut scene, which has climbed past the 1 hour mark in many PS2 RPGs.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
