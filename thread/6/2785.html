    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's some nice stuff you've got there. Looks like the beginning of a good engine.
<br/>
<br/>
Might want to consider implementing variable-width text, though.

Dan.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> Yes yes, already planned. We've got a couple months of planning and preperation for our original game project and we're going to do a lot of rewriting and additions to the engine before then. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Exactly the level of dev I would like to reach in a first time of work ^^
<br/>
<br/>
The aim of my team is to create a mini RPG too ("mini" means not a big long main quest).
<br/>
So you don't put the code, but can I have the hope we should exchange our engine one day (when ours will work fine) ?
<br/>
<br/>
Great work ;)
<br/>
All in 256 colors but great anyway lol<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
