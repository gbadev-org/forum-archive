It says it's an official conversion, so I'm assuming it looks so close to the original is because they were given the assets and code from the original game to use. Compared to the SNES version, this version runs alot quicker, which is nice too. What I'd like to see (or actually hear) is the original music added to it. It really raises the mood. It would be nice if they made a program that converted the music of the SNES game to MOD, since they are using AAS.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But a sweet game, nonetheless. It's good to see such a faithful port (at least, as far as I've seen so far.)

<br/>
<br/>
The legal problem was due to the fact that Eric Chahi (original AW author) and Foxy (conversion author) were looking for an editor who would accept to release a GBA version of it. Since none was willing to do so, they released the ROM freely. This is why it is stated as the 'official GBA version'.
<br/>
<br/>
There was also a delay (originally they wanted to do the free release for Christmas) because Eric had to rebuy the AW brand from Adeline Software.

<br/>
<br/>
Most GBA studios simply do not want to take the risk to publish a game that will only appeal to a few retro gamers (no one would expect such a difficulty from a modern game).
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, it seems that, because of the GBA public, cheap movies/licences sell better than originally designed games (see the sucess of Pokemon, Harry Potter et AL).
<br/>
Releasing the ROM as free is the best way to satisfy everybody IMHO...

How to play:

Use DPad to move

Button A to run

Button B to interact

Select to enter a code

Start to pause/unpause the game

During pause:

DPad left &amp; right to adjust brightness &amp; contrast

But B-button is run/interact/shoot/make energy field(hold)/blast(hold longer) and A is jump. "down" on the d-pad can also be "pick up"<br/>_________________<br/>inspired.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In fact my first version was done, using the reversed 68000 code, but for the official release, Eric Chahi gave me his original source code to update/correct some few bugs. ;)

@Flaat: You're right, I forgot to update the file_id.diz between the first and the second version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
