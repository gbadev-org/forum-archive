    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there any way to allow us to edit immediately after posting?  On many occasions, I've noticed errors just after clicking "submit", but I cannot fix them until a certain amount of time passes due to flood protection.  I have to keep trying to submit until it goes thru, which is a waste of time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"a certain amount of time" should be 1 minute. Ill have a look see if there are any phpbb mods available to do this though. Another solution is to read the post carefully when you preview.
