Having never posted on the forum before, you still consider yourself to be an established member?

Perhaps I should have put that I have a feedback of 100 on eBay and currently selling my GBA and soon my DS on there so people would feel more secure dealing with me.

Anyway, with no way of advertising what is quite a niche item to the small amount of people who are likely to be interested in it and for so little money I have not much choice but to bin it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The guy is [probably] not a gba developer since he has not registered or posted here. The hardware was most likely bought for pirate games - not that I'm slating you or putting you down.
<br/>
<br/>
But whether you was planning on offering a fair deal or a bargain does not verify your legitimacy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

True and I had considered this, if there was an open source project asking for donations of this sort then I probably would, but again, this is now a low cost item so everyone involved will already have one.

I think the fact I'm selling all my GB related kit (I have an MBV2 as well laying around, but again how to sell or donate it?) shows I'm no longer interested in GB dev. My small amount of free coding time is spent on other projects and learning OpenGL.

Really can't see how this matters, but actually I am (was) a gba dev dabbler, you can even check out my only released game <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pdroms.de/file_details.php?fn=1392" target="_blank">http://www.pdroms.de/file_details.php?fn=1392</a>, made in a weekend so dont expect much.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well your demo may be a little bit of credability. Maybe you can take the reverse route of sending it to someone who will pay you when they receive it. That way you will have a trusted person, and you just need to trust them rather than them having to trust you [who has no real history].

In digitalaqua's defense (or maybe not), there is no way of knowing how long he has been lurking here.  How much do you want for the kit and what does it contain?

Edit:  Don't misunderstand me: This is not to say that I don't agree with the "established member" policy.  I'm just saying THAT should be the reason of the cancellation, not the possibility of verboten software having been run on the cart in question</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
