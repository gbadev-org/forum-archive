    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I've done several GBA demos and I'd like to release them here on GBADev (Thanks for the help during development, guys!), and get some feedback. The demos include platformer, puzzle, and RTS-style AI/pathfinding gameplay scenarios. You can check out the screenshots below.

But seriously, if you are still looking for someone to host the demos, I can do it. I have far too much space on my hands with FileFarmer, and would be pleased to know it was helping someone ;).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No problem.

Some feedback then :
<br/>
Platform Demo : I found the movement hard to be precise with, because of the 'sliding'.
<br/>
Also, when moving the text cuts in half way etc., and even when still at some points the score is only half way shown.
<br/>
<br/>
Puzzle Demo : Would have been nicer if you could see what was coming next, and if the things being thrown were slightly different to what was already in the pot. I found going downwards was a bit jerky, but playable.
<br/>
<br/>
Pathfinding Demo : It works well, but the tanks sometimes move around pointlessly and with no regard to where they should be going at points.
<br/>
Might have been nicer if everyone/thing kept to the roads until they/it had to cross grass, and foreseeing obstacles, so crossing lower down to avoid a tree from the road then heading up afterwards.
<br/>
<br/>
A good show of demos, certainly very purrty, and hope that sometime you release the source to see what your style's like!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You mentioned the text cuts out half way? It seems to work fine on the GBA hardware. What version of the emulator are you using? I'm using Visual Boy Advance 1.7.2 with default settings and the player movement and text works fine -- just like the hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the tank movement in the AI demo, the algorithm is based on a moving goal/waypoint system. So if there's an obsticle on a waypoint the tank will start to move towards another waypoint, which may cause it to move in strange ways.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Celeryface on Tue Aug 30, 2005 9:50 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Silly me, forgot to test that one on hardware!

Anyway, disregard what I said about the text, it's fine on my GBA.

Jumping and moving feels a little loose, but it's looks make up (nearly totally).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not sure if I can release the source code or not, mainly because the demos were created for a University project.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
My favorite was the pathfinding demo.  I always love pathfinding demos and if stuff can get blown up, well then all the better!!
<br/>
<br/>
I do have one suggestion though; Perhaps units that are in motion should not be considered as "blocking" by the AI when it considers its path.   
<br/>
<br/>
The way it happens now once a character enters the bridge the other characters do an about face and head towards the other (farther) bridge, even though the first character will be gone by the time the second character would have gotten to the bridge.
<br/>
<br/>
This is a minor point, but I bring it up because it causes the units to look confused and oscillate back and forth sometimes.  (Also it can cause them to take different routes to their target, depending on the kind of game this could drive the player crazy.)
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I like how the red army retreats when it's in trouble.  That's a nice touch.<br/>_________________<br/>-Andy L
