GBAtxxx.net is running a Homebrew Bounty for 2011. The deadline is May 31st. The bounty includes SCDS2 specific Homebrew, DSi-Mode Homebrew, Wii, NDS, and a special category (best of show). 
<br/>
<br/>
There is more than $5,000 already sitting in a bank account ready to be distributed to the winners.
<br/>
<br/>
The only rule is that the Homebrew project must be new or be an old project which includes significant updates.
<br/>
<br/>
Because the site hosting the bounty archives scene release information I am not allowed to link to the site as per the rules of this board. The last bounty I posted on here was allowed as long as the site name was edited, which I have done so above. Please Google for more information.
