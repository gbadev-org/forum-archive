    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is my first GBA game. Its based on an old computer game from BreadHill software. The objective is to find the keys then get to the exit. You will encounter a monster every couple of steps you take. If you pass the monster's challenge, you can move on.

I got bored of working on this project after only a couple of weeks, so I ended up rushing to complete it. Thats why there are only seven minigames and no audio.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Important note</span> - You should only run this game with Visual Boy Advance. For some reason, none of the other emulators that I tested it with would run it right.
