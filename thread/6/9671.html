    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We have been in the process of developing Terra Galactica on the GBA for some time now. For those that aren't yet aware of the project, it's a horizontally-scrolling shoot-'em-up that we've coded from the ground up. Anyway, over the past couple of months we've been hard at work on the game, completely overhauling the website, starting a development diary and releasing lots of lovely new screenshots and information for you. All the work has culminated in today's little release - the first trailer showing the GBA game in action.

Feedback on the game so far would be greatly appreciated, as we're striving to make this an enjoyable game for as many people as possible.

The only thing that I thought of was maybe make the power ups blink/flash, so it's easier to see it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unfortunately, due to the way the palettes work on the powerups, we can't do that - but we've added a rotating, scaling 4 triangles sprite to make it stand out a bit more. Thanks for that!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The first line would have been sufficient. Adding the next two doesn't really endear you to people like me, who weren't even around when this was first posted.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Of course not, but Keldon didn't say "get help", but "help". In this context it means JohnnyUK won't push his agenda of getting more people to look at it by handing out a blanket "you guys suck". Starting with an insult is not really a diplomatic way to get on the good side of others.
<br/>
<br/>
As I said before, simply stating being surprised at the lack of comments would have been enough - I for one did look at the pictures when this thread was bumped. After reading on to the insults, though, I don't feel like providing feedback.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now that I have seen the images, impressive; but your attitude can do a lot of good or bad for you. I don't believe that you know what help is available here, and you risk ruining it with your attitude.
<br/>
<br/>
I suggest you think about that, and this is not just about the internet. When you are operating in a working environment you will have to work WITH other people. And if you are, then you do not appear to be.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I work very well with other people in a stable environment. I just find it insulting that so much work (and many requests to the admin for a post on the main page) pass with such little interest.
<br/>
<br/>
As for you not being around when it was posted, this obviously isn't aimed at you then. And I didn't start with an insult, we started with information on game we've been working on for a year that passed by with hardly any interest, so that obviously didn't work either.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#105420 - Ultima2876 - Sun Oct 08, 2006 4:53 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh no, I've been hanging around here for about 2 years. I'm fully aware of what help is available =P
<br/>
<br/>
Johnny's one of the most capable team players I've ever met. I don't see how that's related to this at all; He said you guys suck because 
<br/>
I've literally been shoving this game in your faces (I've sent 5 emails to the news guys over the last few months, they just keep getting ignored ._.) and nothing, even though a lot of other similar (see, I'm being very careful here not to put anyone down) things get posted on the front page frequently.
<br/>
<br/>
I understand that the maintainers may be busy people, and that's fine, but I've even posted, asking how to gets news posted, and Simon replied saying to send an email to the same address that I've sent tons to. Not just that, but after posting about it we got one good reply.. and you said yourself that you didn't even see it.
<br/>
<br/>
So, you see, we're not so much starting here, and trying to get you guys to listen. That ship sailed - Johnny's merely expressing his feelings.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I digress, I have a design doc to be working on.
<br/>
<br/>
And thanks for the compliment =P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It could all be down to the choice of name. Now you may be aware of what help is, but Johnny's attitude did now express that knowledge, or group play. Sure we are just people on the internet, but we are still people, and I notice that people are quick to throw insults on internet forums - hence the large number of net flaming wars.
<br/>
<br/>
How you work with real people is how you work with real people on the net too.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could have titled it: "GBA Space shooter: Terra Galactica (Trailer)". The trailer might have been the keyword that is responsible for the lack of interest. It could be possible that people respond much more to a demo of something simple than a trailer of something complicated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for taking the time to clarify the issue, in that case your response is understandable. Since the original post is several months old, I assumed that it had been front page news back then.
<br/>
<br/>
If this is not the case, then yes, I can see where you are coming from. However, I don't automatically assume malice, my suggestion is to PM and e-mail Simon again and asking whether the trailer fits the content of the mainpage (it may very well be that they only want finished projects there, mind you).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Ive youve sent an e-mail then it will be posted. Its not like we have only posted 1 news on the main page in 9 weeks because we dont have anything to post about. Hopefully we will have some spare time left over soon (I pray for that to happen! ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
