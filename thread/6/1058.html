    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A brief note to say that my Barbarian game, which is a conversion from old 8-bit home computer platforms from the early 80's, is back under developement. Work commitments meant I had to shelve it for a year (it's in the demos section under Feb 2002). It is written in 100% asm and a new WIP demo will be released soon.
<br/>
 There's alot of very detailed info on GBA hardware now which makes things easier, thanks must go to those concerned. Also thanks to the author of Goldroad ARM assembler.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought Barbarian was an Amiga/Atari ST game from the early Psygnosis.  An awesome game.  I still remember it!<br/>_________________<br/>"I see dead pixels..."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In 85 or 86 (don't remember) appeared Barbarian from Palace Software, which was a fight (one vs one). It was on C64/Amstrad and later Amiga and ST.
<br/>
In 86 or 87 (still don't remember), appeared Barbarian from Psygnosis which was this time a platform game, on ST and Amiga !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
there was also a port of Psygnosis Barbarian on the C64.... in 88 (I've checked this time). But graphically it was very poor.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
