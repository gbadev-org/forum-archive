<br/>
<br/>
A friend and me finally got around to release an unfinished GBA side-project we worked on some years ago. 
<br/>
It is available for download here (binary &amp; full sources included):

You are Roby, intergalactic bartender, and with each succesful job at keeping the customers at bay you are promoted to more exotic, demanding locales.
<br/>
<br/>
The game is rip.. inspired from the classic arcade Tapper, released 1982 by Bally/Midway.
<br/>
<br/>
Features: broken beers, screen shaking, alien customers that behave differently, insanely difficult levels, disappointingly missing ending, and the coolest bartender ever!
<br/>
<br/>
ALCOHOL IN A GAME FOR A NINTENDO CONSOLE !
<br/>
(this is our best selling point)
<br/>

Hope you can enjoy it.
<br/>
Please note that the game is pretty difficult, and control pretty tight. There's various little way to improve your techniques. Kudos to whoever can reach level 7 in hard mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hah, I really like how it looks! Quite nice, though I have big problems recognizing when one of the customers is facing the other way--maybe if they got shadowier or something? It is indeed quite hard and sometimes very fast, which makes me wish changing between 'lanes' was instantaneous.
<br/>
<br/>
So it looks like a great project that's almost complete. You even have the graphics right there, won't you tweak the code a bit and bring it to completion? Of course it would benefit from some sound effects and maybe music too. Congratulations, either way, on your game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
