We've now spent a lot of time building the default arm7 core to the point where most users shouldn't need their own custom code there. This will make porting easier as well as allowing us to build more examples which previously would have required a custom arm7 core to work.
<br/>
<br/>
Unless you have a particularly pressing need for some arm7 functionality we don't currently provide I would recommend sticking with the default core. Avoiding custom arm7 code in favour of the default binary will also help us to improve the functionality it provides. i.e. if you really need something that isn't there then please ask, we'll see what we can do.

The rotation matrix in the libnds GL wrapper was transposed, basically this meant that some rotations went in the opposite direction to what you'd expect if you were used to GL on other platforms. Sorry, this is probably a fairly breaking change for anyone who's already spent much time with 3D. It does mean that GL on the DS now behaves pretty much as you'd expect.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the release, it's much appreciated :)
<br/>
<br/>
In regards to using the new default arm7, I noticed there's code for an actual full system sleep mode on lid closure. I'd prefer getting rid of my sleep routine and simply using this new non-custom default core from now on. However, I'm having difficulty getting it to work. Am I jumping the gun here... is it supposed to be functioning yet? Or perhaps I'm just missing some supporting code in arm9. I'll keep tinkering.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again guys.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  Nevermind, sleep works fine (I screwed somethin' up). Anyway, now I'm fully converted to this release and using the non-custom arm7.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Did you have many problems getting your code updated to work? We tried hard not to break existing libnds based code too much but there were some places where it was difficult to avoid.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, it was all very straight forward.
<br/>
<br/>
Changed to the new renamed reg defines, removed my powerON and irqInit things, moved my custom font/console code to the new API, updated the touchRead calls, fixed a few type problems in EFS lib, and finally changed all the trig LUT stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
I had some trouble with the trig changes at first. I didn't realize that calls to glRotate?i and the gluPerspective functions were using the new sin/cosLerp and I was passing values of 0-512 like it was done in the previous libnds version. Everything looked funny the first time I ran my rom :) All good now... needed to use 0-360 and degreesToAngle() with those lerp functions.
<br/>
<br/>
So, in short, I basically just checked out the updated examples for info and help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
