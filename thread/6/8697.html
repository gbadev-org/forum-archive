    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just thought I would introduce myself. I have already posted a couple of times, but have been lurking on gbadev.org and related sites for a year or more. Just now getting motivated to get started. Very nice site/fourm you guys have !

I have programmed games since grade school, but got out of it, and am now returning to it after a break. I always wanted to program for a console, now is my chance ! :-) I have used VB, Pascal, Basic (Apple IIe text game), and Javascript. Yeah, "lite" languages, but to an extent, once you learn one you have learned them all. In fact, I want to learn C while programming the GBA because I do not want to fuss with the OS. I think operating systems clutter the learning process for programmers lol.... (this coming from someone who leaned on an Apple IIe - horribly primitive, but it worked..... no windows handles, no sockets, no bizzare incantations just to get something to appear on the screen....)

Anyhoo, it may be a little while before I post/ask more questions/comments, but just thought I'd say hi.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But you also entered your program directly into the machine you were coding for instead of having to edit and compile on one machine, send it to another machine, and run it. Granted, it's easier with the GBA than with the DS because decent GBA emulators for PC exist and you can just have your makefile start VBA. But once you start using Chishm's file I/O code (which isn't emulated in VBA or in no$gba), you'll definitely want to prototype your algorithms on a PC first so that you don't have to waste precious seconds pak-swapping.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
