    Hey, I've been mainly lurking for the past three months but now I have
<br/>
my first small game to present.  It's still a Beta version, but there are
<br/>
currently no known issues and it runs well on the hardware, and on the
<br/>
emulator as well.
<br/>
<br/>
  The game is written in C pretty much from the ground up, making some
<br/>
minimal use of libc and libgba, but mainly just by bit-proding (I've put
<br/>
in a couple years writing microcontroller code for a living, so it comes
<br/>
pretty naturally at this point, or at least one the rust was dusted off
<br/>
that part of my brain).  There are three levels, each somewhat more
<br/>
difficult than the previous.
<br/>

<br/>
I haven't played it much right now, but might later on - why is it so big? Don't you compress your data?
<br/>
<br/>
This game really deserves better graphics.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Cool Edit gives the answer: 70 KB of sound effects and nearly 5 MB (4 minutes 32 seconds at 18157 Hz) of music as raw 8-bit PCM. Gleam had the same problem.

It might be my fault that I didn't make my Toast port (used in GSM Player and Luminesweeper) easier to reuse.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My audio data is indeed stored uncompressed.  Now that I've optimized some of the other aspects of the game there is probably CPU time to at least compress the music (the big boatanchor in terms of footprint is indeed the music) in some lossless way.  Any lossless codec suggestions? 
<br/>
(that is to say, that as I am cutting it down to 8-bit/18k anyway I don't want to lose much more quality in compression).  I suppose a CVSD-ADPCM solution might work if you gave it 2 bits per samle, that would be a 4:1 compression...  Still potentially lossy, but not too bad.
<br/>
<br/>
  As for the graphics, yeah, I am certainly no artist =:-&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#8ad" target="_blank">8ad codec</a> has a quick GBA based decoder.
<br/>
<br/>
And if you still don't have faith in lossy compression, go play <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/lu/" target="_blank">Luminesweeper</a> for a while.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, I have to say, I may be addicted to that luminasweeper game =:-)  It is tricky, and I'm a sucker for action/puzzle games ever since Rocky's Boots came out.  Hmm.  Maybe I should do a remake of Rocky's Boots, that was a bad-ass game...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
