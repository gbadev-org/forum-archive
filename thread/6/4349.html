    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all, this is Dan Bushman, aka MrMacabreman.
<br/>
Some of you may remember my idea for Round Table Development from about a year ago. I have been gathering contacts and information in order to actually make the site useful. Beyond that, work with my own projects has postponed it's opening. I am glad however to now announce that the site will be open soon and I am looking for a core set of development teams to sign up. For those of you who don't know what this is/means, let me explain.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What is Round Table Dev? *UPDATE*</span>
<br/>
Round Table Dev is a game development community for independent game developers that operates on <span style="font-weight: bold">three</span> levels.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Level one - Standard community member level</span>
<br/>
at this level you register in the community and fill out a resume of skills you have, examples of work, previous projects and the type of work you are looking for or people you are looking for (IE programmer, writers, spriters) to start your own development team. You may post in the forums to help other people with information, post to request information, request a job or request for staff. You also have access to tutorials and links on information regarding various aspects of game development such as copyrights, business contacts, where to begin and so on.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Level two - Squire  *UPDATE*</span>
<br/>
A squired team is a pre-established team of at least a few members that must currently be working on a project.  The squired team will be given access to all the development tools and information that a Knighted team has, but they will not be sponsored or endorsed by RTD in any way.  Once a team has proven it's fidelity and worth, they may be Knighted upon request and/or review
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Level three - Knighthood</span>
<br/>
Knighthood is granted to established development teams who are working on a project and have requested Knighthood membership and have been accepted after review. With Knighthood membership you are given access to the core site content including development management tools for your game, full access to all user resumes, a listing in the Round Table Dev Registered developers list which is given to publishers as well as 1gb of web space including e-mail and ftp accounts. If you choose, you will also be allowed a website at <a href="http://www.roundtabledev.com/your_teams_name" target="_blank">http://www.roundtabledev.com/your_teams_name</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What is the best part?</span>
<br/>
It's free! The point of this site is not to give money to receive a service, but to give information and support. How many of you independent developers have good concepts, a great team, but are unable to find the information you need (how to get licensed for example) or to be taken seriously when looking for staff due to lack of funding? Another more common problem is having skills but getting hooked up with a team that is going nowhere. RTD allows you to browse resumes, not to mention apply to teams that have been accepted into Knighthood status.
<br/>

<br/>
Thanks all

That is a screenshot of the registration page, so that you know what it involves.
<br/>
<br/>
We will be uploading the site with the next week and 1/2 to 2 weeks
<br/>
<br/>
Anymore questions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am bumping this because my site statistics are showing a considerable amount of users registering from this forum, and for the simple fact that the site is much closer to completion.  I have updated the post at the top with new information as well, and marked new information as "Updated"
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the interest!
