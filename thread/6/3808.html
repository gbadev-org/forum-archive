    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is my first GBA project, and the first time I've ever done any sound programming (except for MyPlug directx effects)... Just tell me what you think! It's a DDR style game for the gba, but soon i want to expand it into a basic music sequencer/instrument... Has anyone tried to make anything like this before?

Anyhow, you can download it <a class="postlink" href="http://spankyquinton.tripod.com/gba-beat.gba" target="_blank">here</a>.

I can't play the ROM at work, but it was probably worth recoding from scratch just to call it by a different name.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">a: zip it up and then you'll have no more of that problem
<br/>
<br/>
b: great idea, but try to have the music and the game speed synchronised otherwise it's just mentally confusing; and is pointless having the music
<br/>
<br/>
c: for your pattern sequence, it is best to create various pattern sets, such as up,left, down,right etc. Play dancing stage megamix enough and you'll realise that there are specific sequences that build up the song; that's why you can quite easily play a new song on expert and get a perfect, because the patterns come up in other songs.
<br/>
<br/>
d: as for the notes, I devised a smart way to create music using the joypad with this sort of games; basically rather than a key representing a precise note, the key simply changes the note relatively. When you  press up it will change it to the note 1 key down, so if the note was C3(64), then it will be changed to B2(64). Now the perfect arrangement of these alterations to the pitch are as followed, up=-1, left=+3, down=+2 and right =+8. This means that if you were to press both up and left at the same time, then the notes produced in any order make a nice sound, almost worthy of being called a song. But that's only necessary when your pattern features having two notes at a time.
<br/>
<br/>
e: oh, I've made something similar in my sabinov game; check it on PD Romz <a href="http://www.pdroms.de/database/files/compos/pdrc2_5-submissions.zip" target="_blank">http://www.pdroms.de/database/files/compos/pdrc2_5-submissions.zip</a>

It's the web server. The web UA determines what to do with a given file, such as whether to view a page as text, to open it with a helper application, or to save it to disk based, based on the Internet Media Type that the web server gives it. You can't put .gba files on a web server because there's no defined Internet Media Type for Game Boy Advance binaries. Try putting any downloadable binary file in a .zip archive, and everything will work more smoothly.
<br/>
<br/>
And for keldon's C: Yes, DDR and Beatmania do have stepcharts for each song. Try getting <a class="postlink" href="http://www.stepmania.com/" target="_blank">StepMania</a> (an open-source DDR simulator for Windows) and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/dwi/" target="_blank">some songs with stepcharts</a> and messing around with them.
