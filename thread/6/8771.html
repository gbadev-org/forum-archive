    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think there is a problem.   Sometimes the dude turns red and I can't move him anymore and then the bad dudes just keep smoking me till I die. :(

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey sumiguchi
<br/>
<br/>
Can i ask under what circumstances does that happen so i can fix it?  How you like it despite the bug?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I am not sure - but it seems to happen when I keep shooting and the bad dudes are right on top of me.  If I dodge them, it doesn't seem to happen.  Once I turn red - the main character slides to the left had side of the screen.  THis only seems to happen in main game.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally I got past the first few guys and got to the first main dude!  He doesn't fight back so I found him pretty easy - but died soon after (score = 145)
<br/>
<br/>
Again, I think it is a big improvement over the last version.  The bg graphics are better and the main screen and high score are nice.  When you transform "into something new" it changes the shot color and the hit color so I get the feeling it is "better".  Melee is very tough, 15 points is my best! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right ho
<br/>
<br/>
I'll get on that.  Just to mention on my website is a video of me playing the game, which should give you some hints and tips and how to get those highscores.  Also i cant tell you how much better this game is to play on the actual Gameboy Advance system, it comes into its own!  Not had no highscores submitted yet so dont forget everyone!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, every game is better played on real h/w.
<br/>
<br/>
The zip file with the video on your site is corrupt.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah that seemed to fix it. Is pretty good.  Not quite sure I understand the combo system.  So I target the guy buy holding shoot and then once I get him, I just keep shooting - how can I get a combo?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways - the more I play the more I like this game! It could use some sound though!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you sumiguchi
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah the combo system is just a scoring thing really.  Do as many of the combo hits (as you have just described) is consequtive order as possible to build your points up.  Thats all!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A small suggestion for this game.  When you die, it would be great if the screen froze for a few seconds to show the blow that killed you.  
<br/>
<br/>
Once the game over screen shows, force a press Start.  
<br/>
<br/>
There is quite a bit of button mashing to lay those combos and I find I die, and blow right through the game over, high score and menu screen and accidentally start a new game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey racarate
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry but im a bit confused, i dont think ive said this was gunna be a trilogy, and even I view this still as my first game so I'd still need 2 more full games.  Which I would do with pleasure if I knew people appreciated it and were enjoying it, cos that my motivation.  So what do you think of the game?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
