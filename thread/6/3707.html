<br/>
"Attempts to write into ROM"? I wonder what this will do to the people who test PogoShell or any PogoShell program that writes to the flash card ASIC's bankswitch registers in order to "exit to shell". I guess one would just have to be careful not to choose "Exit" during a No$ session.
<br/>

However, I'd propose using a different scale that fans of a certain popular dance game would be more familiar with: <ul><li>0 bugs/s: <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #cccc00">Perfect</span></span> </li><li>1-15 bugs/s: <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #00cc00">Great</span></span> </li><li>16-199 bugs/s: <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #00ccff">Good</span></span> </li><li>200-999 bugs/s: <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #cc00cc">Boo</span></span> </li><li>More bugs/s: <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #cc0000">Miss</span></span> </li></ul> This would distinguish between game logic bugs that happen a few times a second (<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #00cc00">Great</span></span>) and game engine bugs that happen once a frame (<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #00ccff">Good</span></span>). Then a "combo" counter would count the number of Perfect seconds since the last Good, Boo, or Miss.
<br/>
<br/>
If you really need a profiler, then build profiling machinery into your program at the cost of a few scanlines of CPU time. When optimizing my code for speed, I've been able to get away with just counting scanlines that a function uses or even just changing the backdrop color after each major step of a computation.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I just tested the free version, and yes it does support multiplayer, but its not so great for testing multiplayer code.
<br/>
<br/>
It seems to offer a 'perfect' environment where all the connected gbas run at the same speed and are in sync - thats not what you get with hardware !
<br/>
<br/>
maybe the full pro debugging version can emulate the syncronisation problems that real gbas have?
<br/>
(and simulate corrupted packets...)

The problems I have been having are related to the drifting (a)synchronisation - so i guess i'm stuck there.
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm really impressed by this emulator. Even just the fact that it starts up with realistic gba colours is enough to make it a useful tool. I wish i could afford to buy the full version :)

When (if) you seed your RNG with some version of time, calculate a fairly large random number.  Make sure that each unit uses a different number.  Each time you wait for vblank, generate a number from 0 to your big number.  If the result is 0 then wait two vblanks instead of one.  Not exactly drifting, but it will introduce unpredictable asynchronisation.

Or try to use the RTC which also requires writing to the ROM area...

Apparently my emulators generate a lot of other errors as well  ;)

Instead of using an extra vblank, you could just perform a few no-ops, or a short do-nothing loop using a small randomized number as the number of iterations.
