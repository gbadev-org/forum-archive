Also, what functions are available on the WinDS API? Will there be limitations in making an app under this sort of OS?

Here's the basic concept:
<br/>
You have your application, which is a class.  Your class opens up windows and those windows make controls, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
There is something called an 'appinstaller', which is just a fancy name for the coder's 'main' function.  The appinstaller tells WinS to 'install' your application(s) and to add their icon to the desktop.
<br/>
<br/>
That's about it.  No extra stuff needed to get you started.  I think that the form designer (beta) will be released when the compo begins, making it easier to make your windows (with visual aid).  The WinS examples helped me, expecially the Tic-Tac-Toe example, which showed multiple button handling.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">WinDS applications are directly linked to the core of the system. He have a tool chain from a visual designer generating initial source code and then to a lib containing the app and finally to a tool installing (linking) the lib into WinDS. This means that without writing a single line of code you can build a working mock up and see it on your ds. Then you can add your code.
<br/>
<br/>
WinDS is basically a windowing system. It does not feature a filesystem, but external ones are welcome for the compo apps. It does not force you to make apps in a window, even if currently this is not directly supported by the api. It is open source under GPL, so you can modify it if you want.
<br/>
<br/>
WinDS feature a virtual keyboard exploiting ds's touch screen.
