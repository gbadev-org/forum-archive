    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ive done some work on the site these last 2-3 days:
<br/>
<br/>
*Layout of newsposts now allow for longer subjects.
<br/>
*The Author column in the demo section now links to an author page that shows information about the author, such as website URL and previously released games &amp; demos. tools/docs/sources/newsposts will also be added soon. For an example check: <a href="http://gbadev.org/demos.php?year=04&amp;month=08" target="_blank">http://gbadev.org/demos.php?year=04&amp;month=08</a>
<br/>
<br/>
*Also finished the news submission script for posting general news. If anyone would be interested in testing it before it goes live, please PM me.
