    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
after a long time in development, our "little" adventure-game "The Last Seal" is finally done.
<br/>
<br/>
Originally, we wanted to go commercial with it and already were in contact with some companies, but after having run several market analysis, they decided that there wasn't enough money to be made with this kind of game on the GBA. So we decided to release it for free instead of letting it rot on our harddisks.
<br/>
<br/>
There still are a lot of bugs in it, but as you can imagine, our motivation hasn't exactly peaked when we made the decision to release it as freeware, so we didn't spend too much time chasing after all those bugs (there shouldn't be (m)any big ones, just tiny glitches here and there, it should still be playable)
<br/>
<br/>
Grab it from <a href="http://www.ancor.ch/tls" target="_blank">http://www.ancor.ch/tls</a> and have fun playing it ;)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
schoebey,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice engine. Impressive amount of work went into this.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there supposed to be a game? It's just a long cut scene.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got an error creating the savefile in an emulator, but Im yet to try it on hardware so maybe this is it. It does get past a cut scene to somnething where you are in a prison cell. I got stuck there, finding the spring and thinking it could be used to pick the lock, but not being able to do anything with it. Mind, I only played for 10 mins including all cut scenes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">apparently there was an error somewhere that got ppl stuck at some point, rendering the game incompletable.
<br/>
<br/>
it's fixed now and should work as intended again, so whoever downloaded the old version should get the new one in order to be able to complete the game.<br/>_________________<br/>to an artificial mind, all reality is virtual</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
