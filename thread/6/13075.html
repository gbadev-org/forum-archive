I mailed gbadev admins with the rom to be hosted here, it should be available soon I guess...
<br/>
<br/>
The game is already widely available on the net, just google "Motocross Challenge GBA".
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you'll enjoy the game!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Awesome game!  I just completed it, and it was a lot of fun.  Just the right difficulty - hard enough to make me want to keep playing, but not so hard that I wanted to give up.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for releasing it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
