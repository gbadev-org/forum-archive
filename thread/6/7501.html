<br/>
If my game requires the use of a custom piece of hardware (a homebrew cart with some "extra something", in this case), will the judges allow the submission if I can provide them with the hardware? I can also provide assurances that it won't hose up their console. :)

I plan to basically port a classic game engine and lay a christmas theme as I will be starting development too late to take the risk of creating a new concept - unless I manage to think up something clever. I do however hope/expect to add some conceptual constructs to spice up the gameplay.
<br/>
<br/>
Will this score poorly because of it or do you mean that that straight ports of classic games are not wanted? I am under the impression that you want a new type gameplay as you state, "originality and entertainment will be the main focus".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cant really judge it before i see it.  Yes originality is greate but I dont expect any major gaming paradigms to be shattered in the compo so you are probably safe if it is similar in game play to another game.  I think i mentioned that porting and existing game but redoing it with a christmas theme would be cool (I think i even gave an example of such on the compo page).
<br/>
<br/>
You will probably be able to tell yourself if the art feels hacked in.  Very few complete games make it into these things normaly so submitting one even if it is somewhat non-originaly will likely place near the top.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

certainly...any content is welcome as are any third part tools (map editors, pre made graphics engines etc..) Just make sure you are not using copyrighted material (ie ripping graphics or music from games).<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

EDIT:</span>
<br/>
I have no suitable backup - I only backed up from the dell not the ibm; well I will still have a look. I am quite upset annoyed because my dad should have told me - well I am sure I have it backed up somewhere other than on the laptop itself.
<br/>
<br/>
Well if anything ask for help here; it will not take you that long to get music up and running. I will be doing my sound sometime near 01/01/06 0800 GMT if I manage to get my submission up to scratch so I am not sure if I can help you at all.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok after some slight reading and a few hours of work i managed to create a simple sound player, it is a few beeps i managed to get it playing jingle bells in the background. Although it is very poor quality but it fits with the theme of the game.  
<br/>
<br/>
I am going to send it in now. i don't know if it works on a real GBA, i am away from my regular pc so i don't have acess to a parrallel ports so my xboo doesn't work.  Hopefully everyone enjoys.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT:</span>Ok i just posted my game on my web site if anyone would like to try it out it would be apriciated. i know it works on emulators i wanna know about the real deal.

<a class="postlink" href="http://tordre.t35.com/TXT.rar" target="_blank">http://tordre.t35.com/TXT.rar</a>

<br/>
It also includes the sources if you want.
<br/>
<br/>
I also guesse a small introduction would be needed it is a Text based adventure game for the GBA that it is entitled "You Save Chritmas". It also fits in multiboot so it is small. 
<br/>
<br/>
Well time for me to email it to dovoto. I wonder would you like the file or a link to my file.
