    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GNUGO is an open source Go Ai engine. As a learning exercise, I ported version 1.2 to the Gameboy Advance and gave it a pretty face. It's not the smartest Ai in the world, but you can give it whatever handicap you wish to make the game a challenge.

<br/>
This was a second project that I used the Krawall sound engine for, which I can't recommend enough. I used a couple of Skaven's excellent S3Ms for the background music. So if you're wanting to put music into your games, this might be worth looking at.

The game and source code can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.thingker.com" target="_blank">www.thingker.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
