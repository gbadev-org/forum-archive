<br/>
I really love Quake, I hope that this engine will develope into something VERY playable...and maybe even mod-able ;)
<br/>
It would be cool if I could use my own mods on that game....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
quake II would be even better, since that looks real nice.

But this is a great start, perhaps we can make a counterstrike mod :D
<br/>
and play it through the internetapter with our gba's.

Quake II didn't have the same "feel" as Quake. I would really like Quake a lot more than Quake II. But I guess that it is a question of taste...

It is mostly unlikely for that to happend, but if YOU try to do it, make the internet adapter first ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If one of the developper reads this posts, I'm just curious about the video mode you're using. It should be mode 3 or 4 by the look of the screenschots pixel precision(no scaling, nor rotation apparently).
<br/>
Are you doing a perspective texture mapping (division by z for the texture coordinates)?
<br/>
Anyway, gives me a lot of hope as the GBA seems really more powerfull than most of the coders think.
<br/>
You seem to be a great team of coders, keep on the good job ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The screenshots looked pixel-doubled horizontally to me. I'd say about 120x136 pixels, and the status bar is done with sprites.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

To have an idea on how it can be done, you can get my small engine source on my site, and compile it with mode 5 support.<br/>_________________<br/>GBA,GC,NGPC,GP32,FPGA,DS stuff at <a class="postlink" href="http://torlus.com/" target="_blank">http://torlus.com/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
