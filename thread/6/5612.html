<br/>
<br/>
My groups game is finally done!  I've submitted it to gbadev, and I thought I would announce it here too.
<br/>

<br/>
A little background: 
<br/>
<br/>
I was project manager for a team of 8 and then 5, and this is our year long senior software engineering project for our class at the University of Illinois. 
<br/>
<br/>
The game features 100 levels of puzzle fun, 7 themed areas, unlockable items, original artwork, and some custom soundtracks too. 
<br/>
<br/>
We did our best to make the game as professional as possible, and the game has been tested on the GBA hardware to ensure compatibility. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some Game Info: 
<br/>
<br/>
Basic gameplay is that you need to cover goals spaces with blocks of the same color. Blocks have different movement rules (i.e. press a blue, all other blues move the same direction). The puzzles develop quickly from quite simple to challenging, and some of the very hard ones take quick a bit of work to solve! More controls and instructions are availble in the README file included in the zip.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone enjoys the game, have fun!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
