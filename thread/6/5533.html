    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's your chance to pre-order a copy of the 2004 GBADEV.ORG development competition game. The game is expected to start shipping in late May or early June, but as only 500 copies are available we strongly recommend you to pre-order today.
<br/>
<br/>
First class postage is included in the price, but to keep costs down only orders of 5 or more are insured/trackable.
<br/>
<br/>
Since a BIG part of the cost is paypal and postage fee's, the price / game goes down quite a lot when ordering several games...

I suppose you could add 0.20$ and 3% (i think those are the correct paypal fee's) to the total (US) amount and send it to the US paypal address.

<br/>
<br/>
Last news post is Jul 18th...and you said you'd keep us updated!
<br/>
A month between updates is not what I call fast...
<br/>
<br/>
By my calculations (probably wrong), since you've had everyone's money for 4 months now, you would have made an extra ~$55 at 3% interest rate (i used the rate I have in my savings account).
<br/>
<br/>
I know this is something that hasn't been done before (homebrew gba carts), but you've had plenty of time! The compo ended in January! You shouldn't have taken everyone's money if you weren't prepared to deliver...the original promise was shipping in late May or early June!
<br/>
<br/>
Now it's mid august...2.5 months past the promised date. I'm surprised nobody else is complaining. 
<br/>
<br/>
Please, give us some updates. I'm starting to hear this voice in the back of my head saying "You got ripped off...he took your money and ran." I could probably get my money back through paypal fraud, but I'm still holding onto the hope that you'll come through and ship them off.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They've been understanding in dead silence since a month ago.  Their carts are four months late.  There's understanding, and then there's understanding.  Simon has made no attempt to communicate what's going on, and is currently selling carts off.

You misunderstood. I did not say that they were making a profit. I did not mean to infer that either. I said "gbadev.org isn't making some huge ungodly profit from the project". That does not automatically mean they're making a profit, small, medium, or otherwise. They aren't. Between the cost of carts, the cost of boxes, manuals, shipping packages and shipping itself, it is breakeven.
<br/>
<br/>
And as for Simon selling carts on the side, he's NOT selling the carts that are intended for the compo. He's selling ones that were originally going to be used for the compo, but were not working. He ordered a whole new set of carts to put the compo entries on. He later found out that the first set of carts were indeed working, and put them up for sale to recoup the cost of them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So not all of it is their fault.  Being pissy and threatening fraud when they told you it would take a while is plain crappy of you.  You were warned.
<br/>
<br/>
And maybe the status hasn't changed yet, maybe the box company hasn't sent the boxes yet.  Do you really want an update that states "Boxes still aren't here, no real update" ?  Or maybe other things happened in Simon's personal life that has nothing to do with us that might have delayed the carts.  Whatever it is.  He'll post eventually and we'll get news.

Either way, jumping to conclusions like that is pretty crappy.  I understand that we've all been patient for a couple of months.  So I dont really see that being patient another one will hurt.

Its not upto me anymore. Its a community effort and everyone has work/school/lives that needs to come first. I have done my part and am waiting on others to come thru. The box/manual manufacturer has been paid and we are currently waiting on the boxes/manuals. Joat is still working on the final compo build and sgstair is working on the intro. Yes, the compo did end in January but some of the compo winners did not get a chance to submit their final versions until May or similar.

Yes, I am selling carts but the OLD compo carts that did not work properly. I finally managed to get them to work but by that time I already had 500 new carts. Feel free to verify this with DuoDreamr as he has most of the compo cartridges ready to be sent to US "customers".

Yes, yes and yes. I have been away on holiday for 10 days so I have not had a chance to check up on the progress. I should be able to do so dhis comming week.
<br/>
<br/>
People need to understand (and I guess most people do as this is only complaint I remember seeing) that projects like this can take much longer than first expected. There are a lot of people involved and everyone has their own life. I am not going to ask them to make the compo project their first priority when we are doing this without any pay. If anyone does have a problem with this and wants their money back feel free to say so. We had to turn hundreds of customers down as we sold out so quickly. I am sure one of them would be happy to hear that they can purchase a cartridge.

For starters, Simon is in Sweden... not sure if they have any Kinkos there.

There are hundreds of packages to label, insert, seal, and ship. And you can't just drop off hundreds of packages at the USPS at once. Unless you want to pay several hundred for a mass mailer... in addition to postage.
