All the detail information you need will be public on 24th January 2008 at the PDRoms webboard, in particular here: <a href="http://www.pdroms.de/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=59&amp;t=405" target="_blank">http://www.pdroms.de/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=59&amp;t=405</a>

As PDRoms is a hobby project and I already put too much time and private money into it, there is just one prize this time, which is a brandnew GBA Micro console (without games). I wrote mails to a few companies who might add something up to that.
<br/>
<br/>
All I can say for now? ?4 colors are enough!? ? Spread the word and join the challenge!
