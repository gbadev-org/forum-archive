For those who followed Motocross Challenge GBA development a while ago, you might be interested to know that an iPhone version has been released to the AppStore last week. The game should be available this Thursday. 
<br/>
<br/>
The game plays in a virtual console and the controls and graphics have been updated to give a better experience on iPhone.
