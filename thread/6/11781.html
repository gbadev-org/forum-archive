    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I've ported my 2003 C64 game to the GBA. It runs by creating a stripped down 6510 CPU enviroment, where slightly modified C64 game code can execute. SID chip is also emulated in a simple manner, and graphics update, file access and rest of the stuff happens via "API calls".
<br/>
<br/>
I also did various improvements &amp; redesign that the original C64 version couldn't have because of CPU power, memory &amp; diskspace shortage. 
<br/>
<br/>
The game itself is a sideview action-adventure with story.
<br/>
<br/>
Should work fine with flashcarts with SRAM save, or emulators like VisualBoyAdvance.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, the original C64 game was worked on on and off during a period of roughly one and half years (2002-2003).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It turned out C was fast enough even for CPU emulation &amp; sound mixing, so I didn't have to venture to coding ARM assembly. You can check all the .C files from the source, it isn't even much code. (C64 side is of course pure assembly, and that's also where most improvements took place once the GBA side engine was in place)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
