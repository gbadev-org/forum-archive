    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At long last here's the release version of a game I've been working on for quite a while. <span style="font-weight: bold">Entombed</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
I first started on it in 2008, and recently went back and finished it.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a faithful remake of an old Atari ST game. It's a platform puzzler, a little bit like Rick Dangerous but one that requires more thought.
<br/>
<br/>
The game has 5 levels, and you're able to complete the first 4 in any order you like.
<br/>
<br/>
Since the Atari ST screen was bigger than the Gameboy Advance screen, I had to make a few changes:
<br/>
I had to shrink the title screen graphics in order to fit them on the screen.
<br/>
I had to have 2 screens for the level selector instead of one.
<br/>
I had to slightly modify some of the in-game text to fit it all on the screen.
<br/>
And most importantly, since you can see less of the level on the GBA screen at any one time, I had to implement a feature to 'look down' a bit so you can see what's below you.
<br/>
<br/>
Other than those changes, it's designed to play almost exactly like the original, except the graphics move a lot more smoothly than the Atari ST version.
<br/>
<br/>
I made the game purely from running the original game in a emulator, ripping the graphics and sounds, and designing the levels just from playing through them on the original many times over. I made various assumptions that turned out to be incorrect later on, forcing me to go back and make changes. But I finally got it all working mostly as it should.
<br/>
<br/>
Some other things to note:
<br/>
It's written in C++ using devkitARM and the tonc library.
<br/>
The level editor is written in VB.Net.
<br/>
I included instructions for the level editor, how to compile the game, the original game's instruction manual and a description of the GBA controls.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a couple of video links for the original Atari ST version:

Use L to scroll through the different ones, then use R to turn them on or off. Also, this will allow you to play the fifth tomb without needing to complete the first 4.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
