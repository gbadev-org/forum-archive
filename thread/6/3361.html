Under GBA development and projects: 'Metal Gear Solid 2D: Sensible'
<br/>
<br/>
This is the result of our third year project knowing very little about the GBA by yaustar and MGFox. A lot of effort has gone into it and the report is the actual 'meat' of the project rather then the actual game. 
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, we wanted to port a couple of levels of MGS2 from Konami and report on the process.
<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, we didn't even get close to our target of completion but we did try and in addition like to thank all the people here that helped us :).
