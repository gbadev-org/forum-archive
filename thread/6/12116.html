    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I went through an entrepreneurship program at my university where I got to boss around a bunch of underclassmen to have them do my dirty work. For example, one of my "virtual employees" put together our website; another one did market research.  Luckily this means any problems you guys find with my product, I can just shift the blame ^_^.  Anyway, my "virtual company" focused on developing educational software, and although we didn't develop this program nearly as much as I had hoped, it's still worth getting some feedback as to whether or not I should develop it further.
<br/>
<br/>
Total Recall is essentially a cramming tool. It allows for hand-written digital flashcards that can be reviewed at a later time. (This particular alpha release was used for a proof-of-concept demonstration in which we wanted each new users' session to overwrite past sessions, so decks can not be edited or expanded between quiz sessions at this time.)
<br/>
<br/>
Basic quiz operation: Top screen displays one side of a flash card. When you think you've "got it", simply tap the touchscreen to reveal the answer. The L button progresses to the next card. REACTION TIME IS KEY! As a cramming tool, the program keeps track of which cards you are slowest at, and these cards will come up more frequently. There is no way to indicate right/wrong response at this time... if you have absolutely no clue on an answer, just wait a long time so it knows you're unconfident.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the program is not suitable for long-term use, but if I get enough feedback, I might expand it, at least beyond this premature development phase. Oh, and I've only tested it on a DS-X, so I can't guarantee the FAT32 support is all there.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh, well... the name wasn't my idea. I wouldn't mind throwing Arnold in there to congratulate you on your cramming. Or maybe that pink jumpsuit guy from your link.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
