<br/>
<br/>
This is my first prog, an attempt of a 3D engine. Please have a look at it and tell me what you think :)

Some info about it :
<br/>
- It's written in C and ARM assembly, with the tools provided by Devkitadv 
<br/>
- It features convex n-gones, affine texture mapping, and z-buffering
<br/>
- Rendering is mainly wirtten in ARM assembly, but some critical parts (rotations) are still written in C. I plan to convert them to ARM assembly soon to improve performance.
<br/>
- It features a C API, but in a more or less object-oriented way.
<br/>
- It uses graphic mode 3, I also have a faster version using rotated mode 5.
<br/>
- For those of you wanting to run it on hardware, it's been compiled with multiboot option. Please ask me if you want a non-multiboot version. It also works on VisualBoyAdvance and BoycottAdvance.
<br/>
- The scene of the demo brings the equivalent of 180 texture-mapped triangles
<br/>
<br/>
For those who might be interested, I plan to release the source code within a month under some OSI-approved licenced, time for optimization, bugfixes, documentation and source code comments in english :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
