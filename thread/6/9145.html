It's a game that I am really hoping to have published, even with the limited days that remain for the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
There are 4 modes to the game, Adventure, Puzzle, Co-operative and Tilt and Roll.
<br/>
<br/>
One of the most interesting features as Keith mentioned (and is now implemented) is the Tilt Sensor, so if you are lucky enough to own a tilt sensor - developed by Keith <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9660" target="_blank"> (see accelerometer thread)</a> - then you can try out the crazy 'tilt and roll' mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Have a go and please add your comments!
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 This is a great game!  It looks like a perfect application for the GBA tilt sensor.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Rather than creating a new thread I have revised the old existing one.  In response to Keith's post the game is now featuring the mentioned tilt sensor.
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and please add your comments.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I played this game, I can't figure out all of the levels but is good game. I also think there aren't a lot of instructions. There is just one problem: When I tried to exit out of the puzzle selection menu I realized that the SELECT button has no function on that menu (it works correctly on all the other menus, though.)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi thanks for your feedback,
<br/>
<br/>
Was just wondering what specifically you found difficult to understand?  If you can let me know I will attempt to explain and maybe make certain things more clear within the game.
<br/>
<br/>
There is a manual for the PC version <a class="postlink" href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/crseast/hazardball/manual.html" target="_blank">linked here</a> but I havn't got around to the GBA manual yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently on holiday so I can not make any updates till weekend..
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,
<br/>
<br/>
