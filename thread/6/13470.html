    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SourceForge are currently accepting nominations for the Community Choice Awards. The prize for the winner is bragging rights and a framed certificate.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think it would be quite cool if devkitPro managed to at least reach the voting stage so, if you feel the same, please feel free to add your nomination.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">EDIT: Now that I've read the page you linked to a bit more in depth (ie: at all), I've noticed that you suggested "Best Tool or Utility for Developers" as well.
<br/>
<br/>
For what category should we vote? I've picked "Best Tool or Utility for Developers" because that made the most sense to me. Good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
