    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">... And, someone doing support for no$gba freeware users - if somebody would want to reply questions per email would be great, <span style="font-weight: bold"> or if somebody would run a no$gba forum on his server </span> - something that helps people whom want to use no$gba without knowing anything about computers...
<br/>
<br/>
Would this be possible here - it seems to be a pretty good fit and would allow us to request features/bug fixes much faster.  It would also bring some more professional GBA developers herre much more often :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Or just setup the forum and we'll start posting to it.  Google should pick up on that pretty quick and other no$ users will start filtering in.  I know quite a bit about the emulator myslef and can answer at least some of the questions that are bound to arrive.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
