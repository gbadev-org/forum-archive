<br/>
<br/>
I finally posted the homebrew project that I did for the Denver Art Museum.

For a couple years now, we've been using the GBA as an education platform for kids. Recently they reorganized the art galleries, and our tours, sadly, have been retired. Once that happened, I figured it was time to add the binaries to my portfolio site.
<br/>
<br/>
It was a very satisfying project overall. Kids and parents alike had a great time playing with the thing. Anyways, hope you enjoy it.
