    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are several perfect GBA picture viewers available, but they do not satisfy all my needs. So I wrote my own one. May be you will also find the viewer usefull.
<br/>
<br/>
Main features:
<br/>
1. Any image size
<br/>
2. Fast and smooth scrolling
<br/>
3. Zoom out to x2, x4, x8
<br/>
4. Hold pozition of the center while zooming
<br/>
<br/>
The ROM with pictures must be created with ROM maker (Windows)
<br/>
(bmp, jpg and gif are supported):

<br/>
Pictures are uncompressed in the ROM, and this is stand-alone ROM, (not plugin)
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I must say I like the zooming and scrolling features you put in. The file select system and gamma correction menus are really nice too. Adding features like previewing and resizing the images would be something to think about adding. If I ever need a picture viewer I know which one to use now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">add pogoshell support please ^^
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could manage to start the viewer whenever someone opens a picture in pogoshell and then give the possibility to display a thumbnail list of all images in that directory.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>
