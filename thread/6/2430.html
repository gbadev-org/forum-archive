<br/>
<br/>
I finally found enough time to put up a "GBA" section on my website, which now presents my main projects :
<br/>
<br/>
- Hearts Cafe, a card game presented at the Hearts competition of last year - with its source code released, for educational purposes (a good example of what *not* to do ;)).
<br/>
<br/>
- The Clarkinou Sound System, a sound engine I am currently working on, which is writeen completely in C and released under LGPL. It is able to play simultaneously 4 mono 8-bit samples with, for each, a given pitch, panning (yes it's stereo), and loop. I'm currently creating a modplayer over that basic engine. Check out its readme, it contains very useful information to understand algorithms and it has several links to useful resources for wannabe (like me) sound programmers.
<br/>
<br/>
(and of course, you can modify it to suit your needs... Or make some optimizations if you want :-))
<br/>
<br/>
Want to check it out ? The site is accessible at <a href="http://thieumsweb.free.fr/english/gba.html" target="_blank">http://thieumsweb.free.fr/english/gba.html</a>

I made a "Santa Lights" game for a Visoly compo a long time back.  That code was a mess.  I think I lost the code.  Not sure I want to find it again. =)
