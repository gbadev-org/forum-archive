    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just one question: What is the intention of this? Why do you render windows on a gba?
<br/>
<br/>
I really can't see any use for this... well, though it would be interesting to see this in an OS like pogoshell. The input system for the text box is a little bit strange (why don't you just display a small keyboard on the screen? You can also split the keyboard to A and B button)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1) I don't ask money nor am paid for that, so I make what I like, useful or not =). In addition, people seem to like it...
<br/>
<br/>
2) The K+ input system is MUCH faster then a simple on-screen keyboard and takes MUCH LESS space on screen (in a multi-window evironment this does matter).
<br/>
<br/>
I've just finished the coding of a puzzle game written over the WinS API and it will be up in some days. So the whole thing is useful if we can play with it, isn't it =).
