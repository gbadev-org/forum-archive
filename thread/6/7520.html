<br/>
<br/>
I finally released <span style="font-weight: bold">Tetrigram</span> 1.0 with more puzzles (thank's to Beno?t Japin who kindly provided several levels).
<br/>
<br/>
As a reminder, <span style="font-weight: bold">Tetrigram</span> is a puzzle game where you have to draw a shape with a constrainted number of tetris-like shapes.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Very nice game, thank you for yet another way to amuse myself.
<br/>
<br/>
The only complaint I have is that once you've placed a piece, the cursor snaps back to the center piece on the right.  For example, after placing the long block, I expected the cursor to go back to the long block when it really went back to the center piece.  It was just slightly annoying, especially when I was placing 3-4 of the same piece at a time.
<br/>
<br/>
It's still a fun game though.  Thank you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
