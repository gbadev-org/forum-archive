I would recommend making your race tracks from sections which you can add up like tiles, this will save memory!<br/>_________________<br/>*Spam*

Chris,
<br/>
<br/>
I went down the exact same road and ran into major performance issues in IE when you start dealing with large numbers of tiles on the screen at once. So on a whim I moved the code over the Mozilla and the performance is MUCH faster. If you're dealing with something where you are displaying a few thousand GIFs or something, you may want to consider Mozilla.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks, I'll bear that in mind.  Performance is/was the real worry for me as I've proved the ability to do all the individual tasks I wanted to do (select a tile, paste it in the map, flip it etc).  That and feature bloat and never finishing it (like a previous c#/opengl attempt).
<br/>
<br/>
I did a proof of a screen full of tiles and it was ok but that's only 600 tiles (I don't create the img object unless there's a tile there so empty tiles in the map are free).  
<br/>
<br/>
You guys'll be the 3rd (after my missus &amp; my mum! lol!) to hear about it if I get happy enough with it to stick it up on my website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
