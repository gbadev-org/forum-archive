    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A new version of VBAstep is available at <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4590" target="_blank">http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4590</a>
<br/>
<br/>
This version includes a faster core, improved gdb and gprof support, a new Tile Viewer, and improvements to the debug log.  Please test it and give me feedback and feature requests.
<br/>
<br/>
Planned features for the next release:
<br/>
* Sound support
<br/>
* Ability to launch and automatically connect to gdb
<br/>
* Throttling
<br/>
* Automatic palette selection for the Tile Viewer
<br/>
<br/>
Currently it only runs on Mac OS X. Linux support is on hold until 1) I have access to a Linux box with Gorm installed and 2) there's a demand for it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
