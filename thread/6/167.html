<br/>
<br/>
I have done a very short document for newcomers in the win32 environment, using devkitadv.
<br/>
<br/>
An Installation-and-getting-started like document...
<br/>
<br/>
It can be found on

<br/>
<br/>
I would like to get comments on the correctness/relevance of the information.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I just read through your document, and it seems alright. I didn't do the exact steps myself as I already set it up that way.
<br/>
<br/>
I am afraid though that such a document already existed for a while, perhaps more complete: <a href="http://www.gbadev.org/download.php?section=docs&amp;filename=NGGBA.zip" target="_blank">http://www.gbadev.org/download.php?section=docs&amp;filename=NGGBA.zip</a>

<br/>
Cheers!

<br/>
Oh, wait, I found it
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, that doc had a lot of information, I must say.
<br/>
My document had another purpose.
<br/>
Just to give the newcomer a minimum of information so he/she can
<br/>
get the environment up.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right before you list the crt0.s and lnkscript you have a typo: "Theese are:" should be "These are:".
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing, you might want to specify that the tutorial is not for Windows 98 (what I'm running) because I don't have an advanced tab under the My Computer-&gt;Properties thingy for setting up environment variables.
<br/>
<br/>
"When you copy theese files" goes to "these" again... section 3, paragraph 3.
<br/>
<br/>
"projekt" -&gt; "project"  (Section 3, paragraph 6).
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, it seems like an alright document.  I'd prefer a HTML over a TeX file mainly because you can use images and it doesn't require Acrobat to load, but hey, that's your choice.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the good work.  The more helpful docs, the better.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks!
<br/>
<br/>
I will change the document a lot, because I have found a way to do things more simply.
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, must correct the typos...
<br/>
<br/>
You can have images if you want in a LaTeX document. I only choosed to not have them.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Anli,
<br/>
<br/>
I read your doc &amp; it kinda helped me to set up for windows.
<br/>
( I like the way that you listed the order in which to install, as this isn't documented clearly elsewhere).
<br/>
<br/>
I think you should mention that you are setting up for the VISUAL C/C++ environment as this wasn't very clear from your doc. ( I guessed this from peebrain's response (environment variables, etc).
<br/>
<br/>
also I think you should mention GBA PROJECT APPWIZARD r2.6 - available at 
<br/>

<br/>
As this neat little utility really simplifies the setting up process. -check out this thread -

<br/>
<br/>
Also - I think it would be better as a plain text (.txt) file. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways keep up the good work &amp; thanks for the helpful doc.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello! Thanks for the feedback!
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I am not using Visual C++ and the documentation was not intended to be for that environment, but for plain command line usage.
<br/>
<br/>
There is also ways to make things simplier, so I will probably update the documentation. (When I get the time :)
