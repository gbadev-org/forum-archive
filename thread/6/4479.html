    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The forum is doing great thanks to the DS launch. Yesterday the forum access log was over 16MByte(!) and 860 IP's was logged.
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully we will be able to grow even further and add a few more DS sections. Though, no matter how popular the forum gets it WILL continue to stay 100% banner/advert free.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the chatter folks!

The raw access log is 16MB. Maybe you thought I was talking about the data transferred?

More DS sections...as in...divide it up a bit like with the gba sections.

Until the DS is cracked, I don't really see much need for more DS specific forums other than one about cracking the DS. Evidence otherwise?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
