    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone actually gotten it to work? My comp has a 2.4 Ghz Pentuim 4 processor with 256 MB of RAM and even I had trouble running 2 at a time. It crashed before I could get anything to link.
<br/>
<br/>
The emulator is going to have to be optimized to use less CPU power before most of us can use it.
<br/>
<br/>
You do open 2 windows right? And the linking process will just "work"?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is still in beta, and only a few [BINARIES - edit by mod] work with it. I have a P4 2.4GHz with 1GB RAM, and it was slow. It had an odd bug with [A BINARY - edit by mod] (which was the first game I tried) when stereo audio is selected and not mono, and that the audio ran very quickly with everything else running slow. It could just be the emulator and not the multiplayer plugin. Anyways...
<br/>
<br/>
I tried making a trade between 2 saves which were just copies of the same save (same ROM, but each ROM had a different name), but the connection kept having problems. It did notify me that it found the other instance of the game, but connection broke when trying to syncronize the two.
<br/>
<br/>
To set up multiplayer with the emulator, you just open one with the game running, then open the emulator again with the same game. In the upper-left corner of the emulator screen, and number is shown representing what that emulator is currently acting as in order, 0 being the master, and 1,2,3,etc being the slaves. When closing a multiplayer session, I'd recommend closing the emulators from the last to the first, or there may be the possibility of a program crash. When testing Pokemon, the emu crashed when I'd close the 1st of 2 emulator screens, then reopened another instance of the emulator.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't tried any of the selected games that actually work with it. I'd be careful with games that allow saving along both master and slaves, because they all may be pointing to the same ROM, which probably means they all are pointing to the same save. I could be wrong, though.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks for the info. I guess it will still be a while until it is stable, but at least there is some progress. Perhaps the author will release the code, and this might generate some interest for the author of VBA to begin work on serial I/O.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
