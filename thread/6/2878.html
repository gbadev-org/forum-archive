<br/>
<br/>
just to let you know that our new website is up and running ! Do not hesitate to have a look at it...

<br/>
You will be able to download Ximox, a C/C++ library to help in writing games since it wraps lots of GBA hardware resources. All our games were written using it.
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy and waiting for feedback !
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks
