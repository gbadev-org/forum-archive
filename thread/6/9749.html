Here's an old 3d engine I wrote a few years ago.  It's written using a defunct version of DevKitARM, so I can't get the source to compile.  It's written from scratch in C and ARM assembler, all the utilities are written in D.  My little brother made the robbit model and animation.  You can download it here <a class="postlink" href="http://assertfalse.com" target="_blank">http://assertfalse.com</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
