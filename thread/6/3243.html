    <h4>#19314 - SimonB - Sat Apr 17, 2004 1:27 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been thinking about if it would be a good idea to buy some flash kits (20+) straight from the manufacturers and then sell to users on this board and other developers for prices far below what they would have to pay at "real" online stores.
<br/>
<br/>
I have done rough calculations on prices for popular 256mbit flash kit
<br/>
sets such as the EFA and EZFA:
<br/>
<br/>
EFA:
<br/>
gbadev: ~80$+10$ for world-wide airmail shipping
<br/>
success-hk: ~108$+20$ for world-wide airmail shipping
<br/>
mwelectronics: 95$+20$ for world-wide EMS shipping
<br/>
<br/>
EZFA:
<br/>
gbadev: ~80$+10$ for world-wide airmail shipping
<br/>
jandaman: 100$+??$ for world-wide airmail shipping
<br/>
mwelectronics: 100$+20$ for world-wide EMS shipping
<br/>
ElectricBirdLand: ~150$+11.50$ for world-wide Recorded shipping
<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if there is any interest in this as I wouldnt mind
<br/>
having a go at it.

<br/>
I definitely wouldn't mind doing this. However, I would ask that lots of things be considered as well: warranties? returns? doesn't work? etc. Would you be testing the units as you got them and you handle the return if they didn't work? or would each person be able to return them to the original manufacturer? The idea is good, and I certainly buy one, just being devil's advocate here...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">jma:
<br/>
warranties: I would make sure warranty is given to match "real" gba flash retailers at the very least. If the kit is faulty and you live in Europe you could return it to me and if you live in the US I should be able to get a friend to accept returns to help lower the costs for the "customer".
<br/>
<br/>
EFA units are "sealed" but at the request of the "customer" I would have no problem testing his/her cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
Im sure it would be possible to get better discounts on smaller flash kits such as 64mbit and 128mbit kits as "non-developers" tend to buy the latest and biggest flash sets...
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the reply. keep them comming =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Though I have enough carts to suit my needs now, later on I will need to buy more for game testing purposes.  For anyone starting up a small studio, one linker and multiple small carts seems to be the most cost efficient option.  I'd recommend offering single 64mb carts as well as the kits if that's feasible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Getting a flash kit for ~20$ less then via the usual channels with the option of having it tested by someone who knows what he's doing (so that when total noobs to flash-kits like myself can't get it to work, we can be sure it's our own fault), hmmmm...
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yes plz. That would be very nice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think abilyk has a good point about cart sizes. It might make more sense from a developer vs. pirate sense as well. 64Mb kits are probably big enough for anybody doing development, but are less attractive to those who are pirating games. I doubt any of us are writing games that need a sunlight sensor or a realtime clock either...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think that it's a great idea. I would also suggest 64M carts however I personally would use 128 because that's the largest size cart used for comercial games to my knowledge. But I think 64M is suitable for gbadev.org members. Well if this works out I'll probably buy another one so I can try making some multiplayer games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">of course...20$ less than regular retailers was for 256mbit kits. Havent compared prices for 128mbit ones and the only 64mbit flash carts that are still sold are the flash2advance carts and they are quite cheap as it is. Ill look into it and see what I can come up with
