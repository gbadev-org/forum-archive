The official announcement of the release of this library was made on the top of the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbadev.org" target="_blank">gbadev</a> site, of course, but I'll repeat it here for any who missed it there:

I'd like to announce the release of a complete data-compression/decompression library compatible with the GBA BIOS's built-in LZ77 decompressor. My library's features are:
<br/>
<br/>
* Compresses data to the GBA-LZ77 format
<br/>
* Decompresses data from the GBA-LZ77 format
<br/>
* Can perform VRAM-safe compression
<br/>
* Can perform CRC-32 checksumming
<br/>
* Can compresses/decompress a validating data stream format
<br/>
* Clean, well-commented ANSI C
<br/>
* Should be very portable, and tested under multiple compilers
<br/>
* Includes extensive documentation
<br/>
* Fully open-source
<br/>
* Can be compiled thread-safe
<br/>
* Includes a command-line compressor/decompressor program
<br/>
<br/>
For more details, and to download the library, you can visit my web site for it: <a href="http://www.phantom-inker.com/gbalz" target="_blank">http://www.phantom-inker.com/gbalz</a><br/>_________________<br/>Do you suppose if I put a signature here, anyone would read it?  No?  I didn't think so either.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
