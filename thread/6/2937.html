    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Greetings All,
<br/>
<br/>
This is my game I've been working on for a little while now. It's in a fairly playable state, so I thought I'd let some people play it.
<br/>

I think it needs more action, or more gameplay drive. This could be added by putting in some new monsters. Also, if the player runs out of mana, then he's screwed. I suggest that you add extremely *SLOW* mana regeneration for the blue sparks.

<br/>
Good one :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">as for running out of mana, that was kind of the way I wanted it to be. If it's too hard, you can change it in the menu (press Start -&gt; Set diffulculty -&gt; easy). It's supposed to be a game where you have to think about how you use your powers, trying to conserve them etc, kind of a little bit of strategy involved I think. (and the blue sparks, heh, are supposed to be rain, that's why the bush grows, because of the magic rain)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
