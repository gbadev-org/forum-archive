    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">...As I am quickly running out of time to (somewhat) finish my game entry for the compo I started wondering this.
<br/>
<br/>
The competition document says this: "Please send in a .zip file with the following files included compo?gbadev.org on or
<br/>
before September 15th, 2003 (GMT timezone!)."
<br/>
<br/>
Now does it need to be emailed before september the 15th (GMT), or before the 16th (GMT)?
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone clarify this?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!
<br/>
