This build is set to have 80 objects, which it can handle while maintaining 60fps. It drops to 30 with much more than that.  I haven't tested it on hardware yet, so if you try it let me know how it works.<br/>_________________<br/>"Only two things are infinite: the universe, and human stupidity.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it's looks neatest when you zoom out and then multiply the speed * 3 or so. also, the objects don't seem to affect each other that much? i'm guessing their mass is much less than the 'sun' mass</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, the only object exerting gravity is the sun, the others have no influence at all.  If every object exerted gravity on every other object instead, it would become O(n^2) instead of O(n). Without serious optimization, it would only be able to handle about 10 objects before it started slowing down.

I do want to revisit this project, and there is still a lot of room for optimization, but I doubt I'll be able to get it running 80x faster.<br/>_________________<br/>"Only two things are infinite: the universe, and human stupidity.
