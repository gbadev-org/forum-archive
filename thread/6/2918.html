    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a href="http://negative0.net/jaycay/forum3/" target="_blank">http://negative0.net/jaycay/forum3/</a>  Here's a quote from my forum which explains the purpose:
<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the Gamemaker Collaborations Forum. This is where programmers, graphic artists, sound engineers, musicians, and people with ideas come together to collaborate on their game projects. 
<br/>
<br/>
So you might wonder why you should use this forum for collaborations and not your own forum. The idea behind this is that with this forum hosting many projects, the collaboraters can help with multiple projects and you will get more help this way. Also through several projects coming together in one forum, we can build a great community feel. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you have a project you are starting, simply pm me with a few details of your project and I will set up your own category and 1 forum for each game that you are making. I will then make you mod of your forums so you can enforce the rules however you want. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you are just feel like helping someone out with a project, then you can just simply go to a forum and start collaborating. Have fun!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
