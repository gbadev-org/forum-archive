    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dominator is a puzzle game based on the WinS API. Born as a test for the API it soon became a quite challenging puzzle, so I decided to make a whole little game out of it. I managed to solve the game in 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5 versions: can you do better (6x6 or 7x7)? =)

A tip: First press the dominator to see what buttons you are not allowed to hide :)
<br/>
<br/>
The game is really nice, but sometimes it gets a little bit slow :/
<br/>
Did you ever thought of using mode 3 for WinS? The 256 color background image doesn't really look that good :P
<br/>
<br/>
But still, nice job, i hope to see more WinS stuff (what about a pogoshell remake with windows, multithreading and stuff?)
<br/>
<br/>
it crashes if you try to close the window...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The version I'm currently working on is already in mode 3, with no speed penalties. The next demo will actually be in 32k colors.
<br/>
<br/>
The speed depends on the message spreading system that is to be optimized. It'll be soon better.
<br/>
<br/>
The Close button should've been just cosmetic , so I forgot to check its behaviour =).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
