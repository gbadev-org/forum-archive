    <h4>#32591 - Trey - Fri Dec 24, 2004 5:43 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i'm a newbie to gba dev, so as a learning exercise, i have written a yahtzee type game for the gba.  it was written in c++ using visual ham v2.8.  i don't intend on making money.  there is no sound and the graphics were done with MS Paint, but you can't beat the price.
<br/>
<br/>
i was wondering:
<br/>
<br/>
to play it on my actual hardware, is a flash cart the best (only) way?  any advice on which to get and where?
<br/>
<br/>
would anyone want the source and game?
<br/>
<br/>
finally, i noticed there were a few threads on an OpenGL type api for gba dev.  these threads were over a year ago (TinyGL, etc).  has something superceded it or is tinyGL done?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Or you can buy a PC to GBA multiboot cable, but only if your game is smaller than 256Kb. But you probably will want a flash cart eventually.
<br/>
<br/>
Go to the retailer's forum. There are links there to a variety of online stores with these sorts of things.

Absolutely! That's a major purpose of this forum: sharing games. Go to the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbadev.org" target="_blank">main site</a> and send an email to the news address... they'll post your game for all to see.
