<br/>
<br/>
Ive only tested it on M3 Simply hardware and emulators iDeaS &amp; the free version of No$gba.
<br/>
<br/>
Idea of the game is to collect cherries, to progress on levels, melons give more points. and as I make more levels the idea will be to solve puzzles, to get to them.
<br/>
<br/>
Start: pause
<br/>
Select: loose a life and restart the level (if you make a mistake)
<br/>
d-pad: to move
<br/>
a: to interact
<br/>
b: special (not implemented yet)
<br/>
x,y: just for debugging atm
<br/>
L, R shoulder buttons skip levels
<br/>
<br/>
All the graphics suck I know but I made them myself. And I know there is no sound, i havnt even tried that yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this is wrong place to post this, just wanted to show you what ive done since you kept helping me!<br/>_________________<br/>&lt;Robert Morley&gt;

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">looks okay so far, better you release step by step, rather than getting frustrated or feeling the urge to release a "complete" project at once, which could lead into demotivation.
<br/>
<br/>
i am pretty sure things will improve over time :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, got another update to the game, not sure if ill do another. Ive kinda been on the one thing a while and would like to try sommet different/new. So anyway I decided to upload the source code to.
<br/>
<br/>
I renamed the game to Red Temple, mainly because the other name sounded weird.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">CONTROLS:</span>
<br/>
<br/>
D-PAD:		movement
<br/>
START:		pause menu | continue
<br/>
SELECT:		suicide, lose a life and restart level
<br/>
A:		action | continue
<br/>
B:		use special | back
<br/>
X:		drop current special
<br/>
L-Shoulder:	prev special
<br/>
R-Shoulder:	next special
<br/>
touchpen:	only on titlescreen, for press start button
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Save/Load</span>
<br/>
The game will now keep a savefile. The savefile is auto updated after completing a level. You can load the savefile
<br/>
using continue on the start menu. Only 1 savefile is maintained.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Particles</span>
<br/>
I started writing a simple particle engine for some special effects, not done much yet but you can move
<br/>
the pen on the lower screen during the titlescreen to move the water drops.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Grabbing</span>
<br/>
* You can now grab trashcans and pull them. Grab one by facing it and press A. I added this because trashcans would constantly
<br/>
get stuck against walls. So now you can pull it away!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Bosses</span>
<br/>
* Boss 1 added to the game. Be careful of his bullets, turrets and suction move.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Screen Scrolling</span>
<br/>
Levels can now be bigger than the screen. Allowing for more possible designs of levels. Old level size is 16x12 tiles, new design is
<br/>
50x20. It could be bigger, but i dont want it to be so big it makes levels too hard. This should be enough.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Level Storage</span>
<br/>
I redesigned how levels were stored to try and reduce the memory needed for them.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Sounds</span>
<br/>
I added some sound effects, currently using maxmod, all sound effects are me being an idiot in a mic :) No Music tho :/
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Demonstrations</span>
<br/>
Demos are now in the options and are not played during the game. So if you dont know how to play
<br/>
you can watch the demos to learn some of the game ideas. Demos are currently disabled, if you dont know how to play
<br/>
you could play version 2 of the game, which has demos in it.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Item mixing</span>
<br/>
Having collected certain items in your backpack will cause them to mix
<br/>
* Potion + Map = Spell Powder. Spell Powder is used by clicking on a totem. It will teleport you to the levels starting point.
<br/>
* stick + rope = Fishing Rod. Fishing rod can be used in ice water to catch a fish.
<br/>
* Gun powder + Metal = Dynamite. Dynamite Can be used for destroying enemy spawn points.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Turrets</span>
<br/>
Both the player and enemy can stand on switches allowing you to take over a turret. Turrets fires at intervals bullets
<br/>
killing the opposite side. By pressing the turret switches multiple times will upgrade the firing speed of the turret.
<br/>
Turret levels are 0, 1, 2, 3.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Description Box</span>
<br/>
On the lower screen is a box will descriptive text may be displayed.
<br/>
Example: "Your invincibility wore off" or "You have been hit. 5 Damage."
<br/>
<br/>
* After taking damage the player will lose its vision, it will be restored over time
<br/>
* Medals are awarded per level instead of the entire game score, different levels have different requirements
<br/>
* Keycards and metal Doors.
<br/>
* Cracking Ice. Stepping on cracking ice will cause it to crack, not allowing movement over it. Basically you get one pass over
<br/>
* Short invincibility after taking damage
<br/>
* Spikes on floor will cause damage to you
<br/>
* If your carrying a totem you can press A in the middle of a blood circle killing all enemies.
<br/>
* Carrying a poison sample will allow you to pour it on keycard doors, opening them.
<br/>
* New healing item added, recovers some of your lost health
<br/>
* New Heart Item, granting a life to the player
<br/>
* Enemy Spawn Points - Continue to spawn enemies until destroyed with dynamite
<br/>
* Destroying Enemy Spawn Points will destroy all enemies created by it
<br/>
* Added a new invisibility item, making you invisible for a short period
<br/>
* Eye Doors will show up when you get close to them, blocking your path
<br/>
* When invisible the screen is shown as black and white
<br/>
* When invisible enemies cannot track your movement and you are able to avoid eye doors closing on you
<br/>
* Enemies will no longer stand on each other
<br/>
* You can now push trashcans where doors used to be
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">GUI</span>
<br/>
* Inventory is now only 9 slots in size
<br/>
* lives are shown as hearts and not a numerical value
<br/>
* health is shown as both a numerical value and health bar
<br/>
* level is also shown on the lower screen
<br/>
* Remaining cherries are shown
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">New Specials</span>
<br/>
* Fireball - collecting the fireball you allow you to shoot deadly attacks killing the enemy.
<br/>
* Rubber Gloves - having rubber gloves will allow you to collect poison samples from poison tubs. Poison can burn certain locks.
<br/>
* Fur Coat - stops you losing health on snow.
<br/>
* Shield - temporarly make the player invincible.
<br/>
* Invisibility -  temporarly make the player invisible.
<br/>
* Light - While holding this special your vision wont decrease.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Specials Changes</span>
<br/>
* Trainers will now in addition to allowing free movement on convayer belts allow passage through enemies (does not avoid damage).
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Interacting (Pressing A)</span>
<br/>
Pressing A on certain items when facing them may cause a description or some text
<br/>
to show on the lower screen within the text box.
<br/>
<br/>
Example:
<br/>
Clicking on a totem without the required spell powder will cause a description telling you
<br/>
what you need to collect.
<br/>
<br/>
When in doubt of what an item is, try pressing A, it may help you.<br/>_________________<br/>&lt;Robert Morley&gt;

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I updated the source code, I hadn't realised how messy it was before. I also posted the newest version 1.3. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.filefront.com/15044263/RedTemple-1.3.nds/" target="_blank">http://www.filefront.com/15044263/RedTemple-1.3.nds/</a>. There isn't really much difference, mostly code changes, few bug fixes.

I also made some videos so you can see the game without having to download it.
