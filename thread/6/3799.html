does that forum actually work for anyone?
<br/>
<br/>
It was working at one point, then the forum group seemed to vanish. This morning the entire cheatandwin site seems to be down.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To Keldon: I really think a nocash forum should be in these forums if it's anywhere</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Still, a forum here for registered users of the debugger might be useful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was about to say the same thing. Bringing that crowd onto this board would be err...bad

I got a reply from Martin today about that...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh, I am partly responsible for that embarassment known as CheatAndWin.com (more specifically, us hosting the support forums) - I think that the distinction between 'Freeware forums' and 'Developer forums' (or something similar) should serve to direct people to the right place. I for one would support the developer forums here (I've been visiting the site for months, just never have had a reason to post anything), I would be right in saying that this is the biggest online GBA development community? It would certainly make sense.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
