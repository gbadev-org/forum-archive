    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey people.  This is not another plug of my game but as some may be well aware I have been working loads on another version of Ex:Machina at <a class="postlink" href="http://exmachinagame.tripod.com" target="_blank">http://exmachinagame.tripod.com</a>.  I have taken everything into account what people said about my first attempt and have amended all the issues aswell as i could.  And so I am going to publish my new version very shortly and just thought id give people a last chance to change the game to make it better. I will then amend these and release the new verson to the masses which im sure you will all love.  Thank you to all those that have already commented!  Much appreciated!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I was playing it today, and all of a sudden I turned into a big yellow box.  I could keep playing, but my character looked a giant version of the adventure dot.  
<br/>
<br/>
Even after I died, I remained the adventure dot.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey I tried the new version and definately some good improvements over the last version.  Here are my comments:
<br/>
-&gt; I like the dodge move - looks cool - but when do I ever need to use dodge or jump, I can just walk past/through the enemy. (I seem to do just as well without ever using them)
<br/>
-&gt; I also like the transform - but don't really get the impression that I am a killing machine - I assume it takes fewer hits to knock down the enemy - but the hit effect looks the same. 
<br/>
<br/>
I played through to the dude that falls over then recycles himself and gets up again - after two or three times, I didn't turn into a giant yellow box, but I did become very disfigured.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways - keep up the good work!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
