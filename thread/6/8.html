    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to thank the initiators and all the users / helpers on this forum.  It is wonderful! People are courteous, helpful and kind to us NEWBIE's.  Not like some other places I have been on the .net.
<br/>
<br/>
As a Newbie, I tried to think of some way that I could contribute back to the forum and the community.  Here's my idea, feel free to shoot it down if it doesn't make sense.
<br/>
<br/>
As I read through many of the posts, I come across a lot of usefull hints, tips, tricks and helpful information for us newbies, and perhaps some verterans.  Is there some way we could consolidate some of that material into a "knowledge base"?  I realize that this will take effort, some probably manual, to help categorize and add keywords to various posts, and then to consolidate them by some type of Index / Keyword type categories.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have the expertise ( yet) to contribute to the technical base, I but I do have some time that I would volunteer to do some of the manual editing for cross-referencing "knowledge".  If the initiators of the forum want to give it a try, I will volunteer to put some time into helping the part of the effort that I can assist.<br/>_________________<br/>MysticX is The Defender</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's a great idea, notron! I find it's a little awkward to find information from the "Docs" section of gbadev, for example; if we could compile all of those and anything useful on the forums into a cohesive help resource it would make the learning process so much more convenient. We'd have to get permission from the writers, of course, and there would have to be a lot of cross-referencing and external linking; but I too would be willing to volunteer my time into its development.<br/>_________________<br/>(Works for me!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
