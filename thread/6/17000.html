I remember reading an article on IGN about Nintendo thinking of going full download, rather than selling games via physical hardware. This court case may push them that direction. That's not to say that it wouldn't prevent people from developing. Nintendo's purose in this case was to reduce piracy, and if they can do that while allowing anyone to develop on their systems, then I feel they will do it. Might end up having an app store like what Apple has with their devices, therefore allowing anyone to develop, but pay whatever fees required to go commercial on it.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Interesting opinion, I'd have to wonder how XNA would affect the decision in relation to Xbox 360 though.

<br/>
Most sites seem to be concentrating on the recent french case with Divineo - not that surprising in the case of Maxconsole since Divineo own it. There was another Spanish case with a similar result a few weeks ago.

<br/>
<br/>
France uses what's called <span style="font-weight: bold">civil law</span>. In civil law, decisions of judges, like this one, <span style="font-weight: bold">do not set legally-binding precedent</span> (unlike in some countries, notable England and Wales, and the USA, where judicial decisions become case law). Meaning that even without any changes in legislation, it's possible a future case brought would find these devices illegal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
