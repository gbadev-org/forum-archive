    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody,
<br/>
 I have been able to get TinyGL, an open source minimal subset of OpenGL, compiling and running on GBA emulator with an example spinning cube demo. The library and demo currently support rendering in mode 3 and mode 5. It seems rather slow on the emulator. The library itself is 117 KB in size. The demo is 199k so I am not sure if this will even work on the GBA.  I am currently using hamlib to render to the emulator, but I am sure this will work with other libraries too. This library is currently in pre-alpha stage.
<br/>
 Is anybody interested ? If anybody is interested please reply to this post and I will put up the source code and demo at some place.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You must have hamlib for the demo to work. I have not yet gotten devkit to work to try this out.
