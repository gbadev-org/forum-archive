<br/>
I have released Tetriz, a small a tetris clone that uses mode0. Nothing too fancy, but the interesting thing is that is made in pascal with freepascal for gba compiler ^_^
<br/>
Yes, It lacks sound and score saving, I know...  :)

Being a tetromino stacking purist, I'm notorious on this site for giving suggestions for the next version, with the missing features that annoy me most listed first:
<br/>
<ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Two way rotation:</span> B button should rotate the falling tetromino backward by one step. </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Sideways autorepeat:</span> Left and Right should move once, wait about 15 frames, and then move once every 1 to 6 frames until the player releases the button. </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Soft drop autorepeat:</span> Down should move downward once every 1 or 2 frames until the player releases the button. </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Rotation positions:</span> J, L, S, T, and Z should rotate inside a 3x3 block bounding box, not a 4x4. See <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tetrisconcept.com/wiki/index.php/Image:SRS-pieces.png" target="_blank">illustration</a>. </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Name:</span> If you're not affiliated with The Tetris Company, don't call your tetromino stacking game "Tetriz". You wouldn't call a platformer "Maryo", would you? </li></ul> And for the version after that: <ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Entry position:</span> Tetrominoes should enter the playfield in hidden rows above the visible part. </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Wall kick:</span> If rotation overlaps something, try moving the piece one square to the right. If that still overlaps, move the piece one square to the left. If that still overlaps, fail. </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Shadow:</span> Every time a piece enters the playfield or is moved or rotated, compute where the piece would land if allowed to fall, and then draw a faint piece at this position. </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Hard drop:</span> The Up button should move the piece directly to the position of the shadow. </li></ul> And if you still feel like working on the demo: <ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Multiple next pieces:</span> Display 3 to 6 coming pieces. </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Hold piece:</span> L button moves the piece to a space called the "hold queue" and moves the piece that was in the hold queue to the top of the playfield. </li></ul> You don't <span style="font-style: italic">have</span> to add these features, but with The Tetris Company's recent <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tetrisconcept.com/wiki/index.php/Tetris_Guideline" target="_blank">standardization of the behavior</a> of its tetromino stacking games, player expectations have become stronger.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Urgh... It's only a small demo! :D
<br/>
In fact I have made it to see if fpc4gba worked fine
<br/>
<br/>
Jokes apart, I'll try to implement someone of your suggestions, thanks ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://itaprogaming.free.fr/" target="_blank">My homepage</a>!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
