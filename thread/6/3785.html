    <h4>#24022 - SimonB - Mon Jul 26, 2004 7:50 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been thinking about that, instead of having money etc as prizes for our next compo, we would take the top 5-10 entries and make a "multi-game cart" and produce, say 500-1000 real cartridges and boxes etc (Read: an unlicenced gba game).
<br/>
<br/>
Why you ask? Because it's a fun and exciting project! I'm sure there are many people on the boards wanting to have a published GBA under their belt.....now they can...just not a licenced one :P
<br/>
<br/>
A 32mbit cartridge is probably the most viable option so: 32/ 5-10 and you know what the game sizes will be. I will look into prices for 64mbit carts because it would be nice to be able to fit more stuff in there...
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking we would sell most of the copies via certain online shops to recover the money spent on the manufacturing. Either so we just go even or the price could be raised with say 1-2$ and the developers behind the games on the cartridge can split the profit.
<br/>
<br/>
Please post suggestions and ideas in this thread.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're going to publish a cart, I think it sets a whole new level of expectation for the quality of a compo game.
<br/>
<br/>
Games that are just proofs-of-concept or have no sound won't cut it if you're asking someone to part with money.
<br/>
<br/>
Ripped graphics, sound or title may fly under the radar in free forum such as this, but once you start charging money for it, you'd better be sure it's all original work or you, the publisher, might have lawyers knocking at your door.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That said, I think this is a really interesting idea.  I don't know how much a manufacturing run like this would cost, but if I were running the show, here's how I would structure such a compo:
<br/>
<br/>
1. 3 month minimum development window, to give new projects a realistic chance.
<br/>
2. No restrictions on using previously developed code.  If a kid in his bedroom has been working on a game for the past year, let him have a shot.  It should not be about speed-coding, it should be about recognizing talent.
<br/>
3. No genre.  Write the best game you can, without being restricted.  Put a judging panel together who can appreciate all genres.
<br/>
4. For people who use Apex or Krawall, try to get a license from the authors to cover the compo.  Maybe an advertisment splash screen or cut of the profits.  Do the licensing work for the entrants.  Sound is hard, but mandatory.
<br/>
5. Same for HAM and Dragon BASIC.  Do it all up-front, so people know going into the competition what licensing has been worked out and what hasn't.
<br/>
6. Make all entrants sign a disclosure statement, affirming that they have not used copyrighted materials or unlicensed code in their game.  Entrants must be 18 or older.  This is CYA legal crap.
<br/>
7. Winners must sign a notarized disclosure and release prior to publication.  This is CYA #2.  You might want to dispense with (6.) and combine this CYA for winners only.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the kicker:
<br/>
<br/>
Top prize, if the judges agree that the game meets a certain level of quality and gameplay so as to be able to stand up alongside professional efforts, is a marquee cart release.  A solo run.  Your own game, published in its cart and sold.  Not a combo release.
<br/>
<br/>
This is at the judges discretion, so it's not a promise.  It's giving someone a solo shot:  if the winner is a real gem... if a real talent emerges, then they get something really really cool.  But if the winner is just a ho-hum compo-typical creation, they get first billing on the combo-run with the other runners-up.
<br/>
<br/>
The marquee winner, if there is one, decides whether they want to be on the combo cart as well as the marquee cart.  That's a choice between standing alone as a star example, or getting the exposure of more carts.
<br/>
<br/>
There should be at least 3x more marquee carts than combo carts.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, try to get in touch with an editor from a GBA related print magazine and try to get a story on the home-brew GBA scene.  Send them the combo and marquee carts.  The marquee winner should feature prominently in the article.  This is gravy.  It would be so cool if it happens.  You think having a 1000 carts published and sold through on-line retailers is cool?  How about having your face in print?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Those are my thoughts.

<br/>
I don't think people on this board will be buying carts (what's the point of that?).  Selling through online shops, and perhaps getting some press to generate interest, means the public are the customer.
<br/>
<br/>
Not using existing titles as a basis means no Sonic, Rayman, Mario.  No Spiderman, Pokemon, X-Men.  No Final Fantasy.  No Donkey Kong, Asteroids, International Karate or Pong.  Excellent clones like Arkanoid, Elite, Thrust and Nebulus are not allowed.
<br/>
<br/>
This raises the bar compared to previous compos considerably.  Coming up with a unique game, with graphics, sound and (if appropriate) music, intro, high score, saved game all polished to production quality - that would make YOU buy it, is a real challenge.
<br/>
<br/>
It's an opportunity to prove that homebrew development is more than blocky sprites moving around a screen with mozaic effects and pseudo-3D sheer transformations.  More than scroll text with music playing.  More than walking through a raycaster demo.
<br/>
<br/>
It's very exciting in theory, but it's up to the talent on this board to bring it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So who is going to pay for this? Would there be an entry fee?
<br/>
<br/>
It's a cool idea from a developer's point of view, but unless there's some secret manufacturing alternative to buying $30 EZF carts I'm not aware of, I'd say there's a funding problem with the proposal.
<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention a legal one... but we've all had that argument before. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
And ol' Mumbly is right... I doubt that the membership of this forum would generate more than a handful of sales, so you're looking at a big marketing challenge to reach an audience outside the homebrew community. I'm not saying it's impossible. I'm just predicting that finding someone to do the considerable amout of work to "make it happen" simply won't, uh, happen.
<br/>
<br/>
But the core questions you raise are great ones: 
<br/>
<br/>
1. What kind of creative compo could one come up with that would really raise the bar? 
<br/>
<br/>
2. What kind of prize would energize people to really try something big? 
<br/>
<br/>
3. Could such a prize ever materialize within the considerable fiscal constraints of a loose, not-for-profit group such as ours?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I created an original concept for PD Romz; so it's not completely impossible. But people need to work as a team; we need a few artists working on more than one project so that we can all benefit from decent graphics.
<br/>
<br/>
I think we should prepare for at least a few months; and just make it homebrew public. So on all GBA homebrew pages we have a link to the main info and make it stand out on your page.
<br/>
<br/>
We should also provide information on how to make a successful game; in terms of peoples job roles and what is the minimum required for a successful project.
<br/>
<br/>
I think a few tools need to be created for a few genres, such as beat em ups so that we could have an animation editor that can cater for various different sequences from a finite state perspective. Maybe when we have the appropriate tools we can begin to create great games. I personally hand wrote the music for Sabinov because there were no sequencers, some people don't have my musical talent to do so.

<br/>
Could be done but the minimum run for the carts are 500 and 1000 for the manuals and boxes so that would mean 500 carts for the best game and another 500 for the multi-cart. Also, unless you want to use the same box for both titles, it would mean having 1000 + 1000 made. Im not saying its a bad idea but the investment would be...err...double

What prizes? In case the carts are sold with a small profit and shared between the authors I don't expect them to get much more than 100-250$

each so we're not talking about anything huge here...having your game on the cart is the real "prize". I would rather sell the game so we break even, because Im sure people would rather want to sell as many copies as possible rather than make a few $$$ as this is all for fun...but if you disagree feel free to leave your opinion right here.

The carts will be regular ROM carts like any published real gba game, not flash rom carts. I'm expecting the end-customer price will be 10-15$usd complete with box and manual.

If you own the rights to Carmaggedon I can't see any problem doing that. You only have to comply with the compo guidelines.

Could be done but the minimum run for the carts are 500 and 1000 for the manuals and boxes so that would mean 500 carts for the best game and another 500 for the multi-cart. Also, unless you want to use the same box for both titles, it would mean having 1000 + 1000 made. Im not saying its a bad idea but the investment would be...err...double

<br/>
If the marquee winner's entry is 3-4mbit and thus able to fit on the multicart I think it would be a little bit unnecessary to put it on it's own 32mbit cartridge.
<br/>
</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
The marquee cart idea is the grand prize, if a game is good enough to stand alone.  It's not a case of a 3MB game fitting on a 32MB cart, it's an outstanding game deserving its own cart - with its own packaging, being sold as a single - because it has earned it.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know the odds of actually getting a compo entry of that quality.  Looking at the archives on this site and others, I know that there are people out there who have the talent, but a lot of talent is manifested in remakes and clones.  The technical ability to write working software for the GBA is a very different to the ability to design a fun game that someone would spend $15 on, or to create graphics, or to create sound.  I read reviews in print magazines every month with games from obviously talented people getting slammed because, whilst technically well implemented, bug free, polished and functional, they just aren't worth playing (or paying for) because they're not fun.  They're not differnet enough.  Just another platform.  Just another shooter.  Just another Tetris.
<br/>
<br/>
I also see the financial side.  If it's going to cost you $5K - $7K for a 1,000 cart run (that's a guess - I'd be interested in knowing the real number), then that's a fair chunk of money considering that the carts may not sell at all.  That's very different from a compo where the prizes are semi-donated from the vendors as a promotional thing.
<br/>
<br/>
I think I may be promoting an unrealistically grand challenge, and maybe the prudent thing to do is to limit the scale of the 2004 compo to, as you said, small games you can pick up and play for a few minutes, and if the carts sell this year, then that itself is a proof of concept for the future.

</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
I've got something to say about the future...
<br/>
<br/>
I believe that the GBA is a games platform in the style of the old Commodore 64 and other machines of that mid 80s era, in that it's available to a generation of homebrew coders and the programming and art requirements are such that the it's possible to realistically produce games on par with commercial efforts.
<br/>
<br/>
I was a teen when the Commodore 64 was around, and my friends and I used to write games in 6502 assembly language.  Little things, nothing commercial, but it was fun and we learned about machine code, raster interrupts and sound.  It was a great time.  We were excellent programmers, but we never considered the possibility of being able to actually release something.  This was in England, before the Internet, and the games market was a mystery.  We were kids in school.  We could code, but we didn't know anything real.  Now, of course, we're all in our mid-30s with careers outside of games, but out of nostalgic interest I wonder what we could have done if we knew the right people, or had access to an audience.
<br/>
<br/>
Back to the plot, what happened then, after the Atari STs and Amigas was the VGA PC.  Then Doom.  Quake.  The whole FPS genre.  Then 3Dfx arrived with the first hard-core 3D accelerator.  John Carmack wrote glQuake to run on it.  Then nVidia came along, and 3D has proliferated everywhere.
<br/>
<br/>
Modern game producers spend more money on artwork (models, levels, sound) than on programming.  Most teams are predominantly artists.  Homebrew kids in their bedrooms and dorms don't have a chance, and now the best opportunities lie in the Mod community (e.g. Counter-Strike for Half Life).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I see things going the same way with hand-helds.  I think the march of technology is inevitable.  3D is coming big-time, and with it the art volume and the production costs are going to grow beyond the homebrew crowd again.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The GBA, and this generation of homebrewers, may be the last time such a community comes together with a real ability to demonstrate talent at a commercial level.  As such, a compo like this is a real gem.  It's an opportunity to raise the profile of a handful of really talented kids who might want to get into the industry.  And if we can raise a bit of press (as I said, like a print magazine article), and get the best recognized, that would be truly outstanding.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm really coming at this with hindsight of an era long gone, and thinking about what sort of competition would have made me salivate when I was a kid.

The 640 KB joke came in only after I divided the cart size by 5 (4096 KB / 5 = 819.2 KB), rounded the result down to a nice round number (800 KB), and cut off the size of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#tod" target="_blank">my own flagship multiboot game</a> (800 KB - 160 KB = 640 KB).

I think Scott has a point here, so I have an idea. Personally, I have no interest in making a full game for the contest. (I'm not that terribly imaginative, and for the most part I have no taste in gameplay. ;) ) On the other hand, I would not mind writing something that could potentially benefit everyone like say, a sound system. All I'd ask for is a little bit of recognition and possibly a few bucks if we get any profits. :P

<br/>
<br/>
If the point of the cart is to put glory to the GBADev scene, then it should not be based on some compo entries, but selected entries from many different places, compos or noncompos. This means that we could pick out many goldnuggets from the scene, and then after the selection, these games should be polished up. An example could be if Neko the Cat (the last compo winner, I forgot it's name) is picked, more levels should be added, the GFX should be updated, and the game should be 100% welltested before it went through to the cart. This could take many months.

I would personally put in my vote for 2) since, as Lord Graga says, we want quality games on the cart. With enough time frame for the compo stunning games can be made from scratch equally well, though, so all homebrewers have a chance of getting famous. :)
<br/>
<br/>
I say, at least 3 months and even better 4 months of time frame as most of us have study or job to take care of also.<br/>_________________<br/>In a world without fences and walls you will never need gates and windows.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm going to agree with keldon on point #2 there.
<br/>
<br/>
I think that 3 months is too little to get a real GOOD game developed.  I probably speak for a lot of homecoders over 18 when I say it can be hard to create a full game and carry a job at the same time.
<br/>
<br/>
I have four ideas for the time issue:
<br/>
(1) Make it 6 months - allows for a real polished game
<br/>
(2) Allow for complete working games that need graphical and music facelifts (within limits), then allow some extra time (a month maybe?) for the work to be completed
<br/>
(3) Have 2 categories: #1- Multiboot, one person coding only, #2- ROM, team of at least 2 or 3 people
<br/>
(4) Poll the people who are SERIOUS about entering as to how much time they would like.  By serious I mean, take the poll and you're basically signed up.
<br/>
<br/>
I also think that on a poject of this magnitude, there should be a entry fee.  This could discourage people who have little ambition from sending in their garbage and wasting the judge's time.  If these games are published, we want them well tested AND judged, and I don't want to rush judges from testing a game I made with sweat and blood, taking more hours in the day than I have just so they can test someone's idea of a joke that they threw together in a week.  Maybe poll on that?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm only talking ideas here, I want to contribute.  I also want to join.
<br/>
<br/>
SimonB, is there some idea you can give us as to when you were planning to start this?  I ask you 'cause it seems to me you'd be hosting this whole shindig.

<br/>
I like mymateo's idea of allowing "mostly" complete games. That would allow feedback from the judges and some time to really clean it up and test. 
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a "semi finalist" selection (8-10 games) could be made after 2-3 months, then the winners get chosen a month or two after that, based on improvements suggested from the judges?
<br/>
<br/>
One more idea: since not everyone is going to "nail" the size requirement down to the byte, it might be nice to allow the final winners some time to create an extra level or two if the cart space allows.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm 100% behind you guys on this one.
<br/>
<br/>
There should be a system of knockout rounds where projects are submitted to the judges (and possibly the forum) for evaluation by a certain date. The most promising of these could then be selected to progress to the next round with an additional month or so before re-submission for the following round. This would allow fine tuning of game play etc. based on feedback, and would ensure only projects which were obviously progressing and likely to be finished on time would be considered.
<br/>
<br/>
As well as tweaking of game play etc., this approach would also be an opportunity for teams/individuals who have potentially good games but with weak graphics or sound to get assistance from other community members with the relevant skills.
<br/>
<br/>
I really believe this kind of approach will produce a better, more polished end product. Some of the best games of yester-year (I'm thinking C64/Spectrum here) had almost embarrassing graphics and/or sound, but the game play won through. Allowing entries from those who are able to design and implement a good game concept which can then be enhanced with the help of others is also likely to result in more original games.
<br/>
<br/>
Another point raised earlier in this topic was that of which libraries/tools to allow. If we're talking about producing something to showcase the homebrew scene, there should be no restrictions as to the libraries used. Existing developers will already be familiar with their preferred toolset, so restricting their use would be unfair. I personally have registered versions of HAM(lib), VisualHAM and Krawall, but aside from the HAM intro and the inability to use MODs (I use S3Ms anyway) the same features are available to non-registered users.
<br/>
<br/>
There would certainly have to be an agreement in place with the developers of these popular libraries to allow their use for this project as this kind of falls between home and commercial use, but I suspect they would be quite open to discussion regarding this.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't see any reason to limit entries to those written within the time-frame set aside for the competition. I think it perfectly legitimate that someone who has already put a lot of time into writing a good game could submit it for consideration. The idea is surely to make a compilation cartridge that is worth owning, so why make it a "this is the best we could do in 3 months" affair?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm quite excited about this, and have a few already fully developed ideas which I'll be whittling down to one at some point very soon in readiness. Might be looking for some help with the graphics and sound side of things though. I can put together what I need and am usually very happy with it, but it takes me way longer than in would someone with better skills in these areas, and my time is probably much better spent on the coding side of things. Any offers?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by ciw1973 on Tue Aug 03, 2004 9:19 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I don't really mean to beat you up, dude.

I just don't think artificial constraints should be placed on a competition that might discourage people from trying.  GBADev is a community, and we should support everyone who wants to try out, no matter what their level.  If your entry is as good as you think it will be, then you've got to trust that it will be judged well, and it will score what it deserves.

I prefer to have a fixed date for submission. If you have previous feedback from judges, it sounds like they're telling you what to do to get in the cart. What if they tell you "Sorry, kid, you're beyond any help"? Or, if you see a lot of feedback for a specific game, and none for the rest? It might work, but it's too complicated to work seamless. Judges shouldn't be involved in the process.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead, I think people should be allowed to post topics (if they want help and don't mind having their projects "revealed") about their on-going projects in a specific session of the forum dedicated for the compo, and only in their threads feedback will be allowed - and "not" from judges, but from everyone else.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also concerned about the categories chosen to evaluate these games. If we're going to make a cart with great games, I don't want people giving less points for this game because it used hardware timers instead of Vblank, or didn't use some nice algorithm for image compression or was made in Cobol or anything like that, considering that the game runs smooth. The game is what matters: graphics, sound, gameplay, that sort of thing.
<br/>
<br/>
And every game should be tested and evaluated ONLY IN THE REAL HARDWARE, thank you very much.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As far as having the carts ready for december 15, I think the compo would need to start now.  Do you know how long it would take, after the games were chosen, to make the box and maual for it, then wait for production?  We'd probably have to start THAT now.  PROBABLY.  I could be wrong.

I'm assuming that you don't want to spring for carts with SRAM.  That means single session games or passwords.

I think this is a fantastic idea for the compo.  If it works out, this could be a pilot project for future low production run compilation carts.  (ie a bunch of people pool funds)

As far as quality control goes, there is 32 Mbit of space on the cart.  This will be filled with the best 32 Mbits the community has to offer.  Quality control will take care of itself.

Stopping the compo? Not at all. They won't try it either. Manufacturing will take place in China so even if they wanted to stop that they would have a hard time trying :P Selling the games in the US might be a problem though. But I don't think it's anything to worry about...

I think it could be wise to limit the number of entries, yes, but since it shouldnt take long to see if an entry is worth play-testing more or if it should be dismissed at once, I think we could set the limit at 5 entries or something. Yeah?

I have been in contact with several manufacturers willing to produce the cart and one of them have been willing to sell empty ROM carts. We could buy 500 of those and burn them "in-house".

It's like trying to sell food to someone that comes out of a restaurant.
<br/>
<br/>
2) Would it be ok to enter a remake of a game that was entered in another compo? For instance I entered once a strategy board game for the GP32 called gamasumo, so if a coder wants to port it to the GBA and change is a little for this contest will it be ok?
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: green">On a side note</span> to just think about maybe have it that everyone that wants to enter has to present in writing a small design doc to you to say what kind of game it is, and the top 10 designs will be accepted to be made. The point of this is because some say they don?t want to work on something for a long time to just have their game scraped, but I guess that?s the point of a compo to get eliminated. Maybe this thing can help make bigger teams so that the games get made faster and better before Christmas which can boost sales and recognition to the independent games. This is just a thought.
<br/>
<br/>
PS ***Since more than 1 game is allowed, if any programmers do not have a winning game idea then drop me a line. Hey I see programmers in all compos that make clones and clones won?t cut it in this compo.  Why I say this is because I was supposed to enter other compos but some coders seem to miss out.

Risky. Some good games may be scraped right off because of a bad design doc (which is an entirely different subject), while good designs might not turn out to be nice games.

In the subject of docs, I don't know if these are already the rules, but I think that everyone should be responsible for sending the manual for their game and a JPEG for the boxart along with the ROM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes and no.  Christmas is going to suck for many commercial developers this year.  I've heard specualtion that competition is going to be so great this Christmas that the Sims 2 is only game that will safely sell.  Everyone else is at the mercy of the competition.  Some good commercial retail games will not even see shelf space!  (Kind of hard for mom to find something that isn't on the shelf.)
<br/>
<br/>
In the retail world there is a holiday after christmas that that marks when people start spending money again.  Does anybody know what it is off hand?  I think it might be Valentine's Day, but I'm not sure.  I think that might be a better time to release the cart from a tactical standpoint.

Why do so many want to put artificial limits on the entries?!  There is no need for this.  There are only going to be 32 Mbits on the cart.  Competion for space will be very high.

If a run of 1000 boxes is done, there is only going to be one cover design for the whole compilation cart.  Even if somebody lets us use their nifty high quality printing equipment and we can print different cover designs, they would have to represent a compilation cart.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is all starting to get a bit heated, silly and non-productive. SimonB is offering everyone in the community an opportunity to see their work distributed in the form of a proper cartridge, and it's rapidly turning into a bitching session. Everyone is entitled to express an opinion, but only those that are sensible enough to gain general approval are likely to be considered, so let's just play friendly.
<br/>
<br/>
My earlier post was basically suggesting that there is a monitored development schedule for all of the proposed entries, and I still think this is going to be very important.
<br/>
<br/>
I've a number of ideas already, and could produce a detailed spec and some basic proof of concept stuff which would (IMHO) look great on paper, but be unrealistic in the time-frame that's likely to be available.
<br/>
<br/>
A close eye needs to be kept on the progress of each game as individual projects can quickly fall behind schedule, and the whole cartridge idea starts to slip before you know it.
<br/>
<br/>
Having read through all the recent bickering here, I'd suggest that rather than leavnig things open to the entire forum, SimonB select a small group of judges to help him make decisions about which projects are selected and to check that things are progressing as planned.
<br/>
<br/>
For this to happen, each developer/group would need to submit a basic schedule for the project and provide assurances that it was realistic in the time available. Almost every project takes longer than anticipated, and having someone else review it may help identify possible issues in advance.
<br/>
<br/>
As the groups themselves are going to be busy enough developing games, it may be useful if someone externally were allocated to each project to help manage it. It's always handy to have someone keep an eye on things from the outside.
<br/>
<br/>
It may sound like I'm proposing a good deal of "unnecessary" admin, but with more than 20 years coding experience, having been involved with and managed some pretty big projects, and now running my own company, I know that once a project gets bigger than one or two individuals working together it quickly falls apart without good planning and management. There's no reason it should be any less fun, but it will help ensure our overall goals are achieved. If nothing else, this is what you'd be doing if you were a professional game developer anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding a release date and marketing of the final cartridge. It would appear many people are forgetting this is not going to be a commercial product. There will be no major chain-store distribution network, more likely a number of specialist internet shops and direct selling to the community. As such, the seasonal buying patterns of the general public are of little concern.
<br/>
<br/>
I know everyone will be keen to have the cartridge released ASAP, but a lot more needs to be established before a release date can even be considered. Let's see what games are likely to be available, it may be worth allowing more time than is being proposed at the moment to get the best games possible. I do think that to help keep everyone focussed, 3 or 4 months would be more desirable than 6 or more, but let's see what the general consensus of opinion is. Having a shorter timescale may also encourage individuals to work together which is usually a good thing.
<br/>
<br/>
Something which was mentioned earlier was a menu, and as it's the first thing anyone running the cartridge will see, it's going to be important. I think it would be an ideal opportunity for those on the homebrew scene who aren't interested or haven't the time to write a full game. Aside from some bank switching code needed to change games (which could be added later anyway) and maybe keeping an eye on the overall size, things should be pretty open.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ciw1973, I agree with what you said. Especially the last bit. I could make a new game if i had to, but I have other PC projects at the moment and stretching on! I would, however, be able to put together a nice little selection screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Talking of those projects, I'm sure this won't interest any of you, but yesterday I made a nice calaculator on PC(took hardly any time, good project for a beginner c++-er(not me!)), and, just for a laugh, port it to GBA soon. I'll only run it on an Emulator (can't afford any cartridges at the moment, never have, hopefully will) and was wondering what you think I should do for it (v. simple I know, but..) Should I:
<br/>

A close eye needs to be kept on the progress of each game as individual projects can quickly fall behind schedule, and the whole cartridge idea starts to slip before you know it.
<br/>
<br/>
Having read through all the recent bickering here, I'd suggest that rather than leavnig things open to the entire forum, SimonB select a small group of judges to help him make decisions about which projects are selected and to check that things are progressing as planned.
<br/>
<br/>
For this to happen, each developer/group would need to submit a basic schedule for the project and provide assurances that it was realistic in the time available. Almost every project takes longer than anticipated, and having someone else review it may help identify possible issues in advance.

I say that we should make this an ordinary compo just like the others held here. By taking it "too seriously" we loose the basic idea of finally having a "homebrewers community" for hobbyists; that is, many of us, as I can tell, have been around since the C-64 and now we have finally a chance of getting published without beeing professionals and "into business".
<br/>
<br/>
This (the GBA, as said earlier in this thread) may be the last chance for us hobby programmers to create small but interesting games in our spare time without using too much energy but having fun. Let's not scare too many people by making it too professionel. All should have their chance.
<br/>
<br/>
I think that we should use this chance, not abuse it. :)<br/>_________________<br/>In a world without fences and walls you will never need gates and windows.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

From reading it, all I can be sure of is that there will be a compo this year. Everything else is still being speculated.

Some people want it to be a "professional"-like compo with all the bells and whistles while others prefer one with relaxed rules and such.

I agree.  What is wrong with setting a deadline and letting entries trickle in?  If an individual or team wants to do things in a "professional" manner, nothing is stopping them.  If somebody else wants to enter something simpler, fantastic.  The more merrier.  The "pro" project will probably do better- thats ok.  People should be free to do whatever they feel will give their project an edge over the competition.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't care if people talk big.  I do not want to see the compo restricted to people who talk big and/or produce paperwork.  What next, ISO certification?

I thought that online stores would try to market the game to their clientele.  My point is that Christmas may not be a good time to release the cart- it may even be one of the worst times.  People only have so much money.  I'm not sure if the community is the target audiance or not, but I suspect that members of the community who plan on buying the cart will do so regardless of when it is released.  I doubt others will.

I got a little carried away, and took things a little too personally.  dagamer34 makes a good point, this is for fun, not profit.  And if we (should I say "I"?) try to take the fun out, there's nothing left.
<br/>
<br/>
I therefore take back everything I've said, and contribute my newest thoughts:
<br/>
<br/>
Let's have fun.  Let's wprk together.  Whoever gets their games picked for the cartridge wins becuase they did well.  Whoever doesn't get their game on the cartridge still wins because they tried and/or had fun.  The only losers will be people (like me before today) who get uptight, and take things too seriously.
<br/>
<br/>
All I can say now, is that I am excited about entering, and I will be happy if I can make a game, and delirious if it makes it onto the cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Spill da beans, man!! Spill 'um!
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was thinking about this yesterday and here's my idea.
<br/>
<br/>
First, we have a regular compo, just like last year's. This one would allow anything to be done on the GBA, as long as it's your work. When that is done, the entries that are in the top 12 or so are given the chance to fix the bugs in their entries as there will probably be some and can re-submit them again for a "cart" competition. The entries in this one would probably be more restricted to actual games and such, demos are pretty to look at but probably won't interest the consumer as much as a game.
<br/>
<br/>
This way people who don't have 1+ years experience on the GBA can still have a productive showing at the competition, and those who have slaved hours over the computer to actually have something published will get their chance. Sounds good?
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
But having a far deadline doesn't mean we should all spend a LONG time coding; it means that many newcomers have a chance to learn GBA; and gives us a longer time for people to see the project to take part - par example I did not know about PDRoms 2 until 2 weeks before.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am personally very excited about starting this compo, but I need some rules to follow first!  (Well, that's not true.  I've already kinda started)  But I'm eager to hear the final word about when, where, how etc. and what I'm allowed and not allowed.

I don't want to pressure you Simon, or anyone else, and I hope I didn't sound demanding just now.  I'm just anxious!

However if I get my game finished and before the deadline, and hopefully enters the cart as well... Consider me a very interested to but a few carts for myself... My only concern is how to do this? I mean I'm not in Asia well perhaps I am in Asia, I'll be an exchange student this year. However my current location is Europe. So how do I get it, I mean would it retail or how would it be sold? I sure would like to get a few carts on my own and have at least one for myself and perhaps even distrubate to others through either auction site or selling to friends nearby.
<br/>
<br/>
How will the supply last if people would like to do as I would?
<br/>
Perhaps those can make a pre-payment for additional carts to be produced.

Then again, would it be legal to sell them either through an auction site or to the friends?<br/>_________________<br/>*Spam*

That's what I get for having an RPG in the wings. Something like a 2-D shooter is easier to make small. Besides, Simon is probably right that smaller, pick-up-and-play-for-five-minutes games are a little better suited to this compo.
<br/>
<br/>
But hey, I wanted an excuse to learn more about compression, so it's a good thing, too.
<br/>
<br/>
I do think that "10" is a nice number for the total games on the cart. Makes it seem like you're really getting your money's worth. With 5 256Kb multiboots, that eats up 1280kb right there. That leaves 2816kb, or 563kb per ROM-based game.
<br/>
<br/>
We could get more space by allowing fewer games into the winner's circle, but then the end customer might miss out a some really nice games.

Nevertheless, it's a small space, especially for us modern kids who are now used to test games in our gigantics 256 and 512MBits flash carts (not to mention emulators). I remember a time when programming for the GBC, when I had to study my .map file almost whenever I had a new idea, because I couldn't afford to even model anything that could go beyond those horribles ROM MBCs. I had nightmares, I tell you that.
<br/>
<br/>
With the GBA, I confess that I got a little lazy with ROM size, and I need to do some compression badly. BUT, I think some current designs, not only my own, will get severely cut because of this, and the play value - which is what the compo is about (?) - will suffer. Things like "Aw, can't have 3d morphing blocks in my Tetris clone because I got so many sprites for animation. Well, I'll just cut out a dozen and it will fit. The animation will be ruined, and the precise innovation I thought about will not exist, but it will fit." will surely happen. These games will then be judged by what they are not - crap. We'll have posts like "you should have checked out the FIRST version - it rocked!"
<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, I don't think smaller, pick-up-and-play-for-five-minutes games are directly associated with ROM size. That's the concept, but if you want to use mode-7, doublebuffering, 256 colors everywhere and maybe some nice cartoonish animation because it will give you the best tic-tac-toe people has ever seen, it's a valid point to make its ROM bigger than the average ZeldaDX. I looked at the sizes of the GBA ROMS I have, and all the smaller ones are 32Mbit, including FZero - as a game that once fit in 4Mbit. Either I'm not the only one who got a little lazy from then on, or the GBA offers more should one afford the space needed.
<br/>
<br/>
And all that to make this point: we need this size limit confirmed as soon as possible, so we can use the spare time to redesign what's needed, instead of cut our games at the last moment. Nobody wants to be left out, and it's indeed a nice incentive towards good design. But if there's some chance that this size can be increased, then we shouldn't dismiss it right off just because it's possible to fit some game in there as it is.

As far as I see it now, there is a lot of interest in the compo. I guess SimonB has quite some usefull feedback on his idea to set up the rules and once they're there it is up to all of us to decide to compete.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I just await the final compo rules and then decide what idea I'm gonna go for and tailor it to the set of rules. Be creative, that's what this is all about? 4MBit? Compress your graphics, make 'em stylish 16color, use chiptunes instead of big samples, generate levels, etc.

Even if I had never heard of the homebrew scene and saw cart with 7 games for 10$ I'd pick it up out of curiosity.

Anyways, my question is: Is there a plan in place just on the outside chance these carts do sell out?  Like another production run, only this time for a profit?  
<br/>
Will this be the first unlicensed game for the GBA?  If so, there could be potential media coverage of it.  A bunch of indie developers trying to swim with the big fish, a real feel good story.

I think a poll is a good idea.  I'd only include options you (Simon) are willing do.  I'd list the options something like this:
<br/>
$10 (2 dollar loss)
<br/>
$11 (1 dollar loss)
<br/>
$12 (break even)
<br/>
$13 (1 dollar profit)
<br/>
$14 (2 dollar profit)
<br/>
<br/>
Using the actual figures.  Nintendo has less reason to be bothered if fewer carts are produced and no profit is made.

If the cart's price will be at break-even nobody is making a profit (except maybe for the cart manufacturer). Is is considered non-commercial then?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A registered version of HAM allows for commercial use, and having had a look through the details, a single license would allow SimonB (or anyone else) to recompile all entries written with the non-registered version thus getting rid of the splash screen.
<br/>
<br/>
This does however seem rather unfair to HAMs author, Emanuel Schleussinger. I would therefore suggest contacting him and the various other development kit authors to get their opinions. Maybe purchasing a license for each kit specifically for this project would be acceptable.
<br/>
<br/>
Whilst falling somewhat short of what most people would consider commercial use, there is money involved, so it would be very much a matter of personal opinion as far as each author is concerned.
<br/>
<br/>
My thoughts are that credit should be given even if there is an agreement that library splash screens are not required. Possibly a single bitmap "made using" screen displayed once on startup showing the logos and web addresses of each development kit and library used. This would also help promote the superb software tools available for homebrew GBA development.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
As long as there is an agreement in place, games could be fully developed with the non-registered libraries and then simply recompiled for the final cartridge. This way individual developers need not pay the licensing fees just for this project.
<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, it is entirely up to the original library authors whether they allow the use of their tools, but as this is a community based project, I would like to think they'd be behind it, and maybe make an exception in terms of licensing.
<br/>
<br/>
As soon as you get backing from commercial sources the distinction between community and commercial use starts to get somewhat blurred, which could be dangerous with what's being proposed here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can have a look see. If I remember correctly it will add another ~4$usd to the total cost. So, if we would break even at 12$ with a 32mbit cart we would instead break even at ~16$usd. It would also mean having to send an extra 2000$usd upfront to have the carts made.

If the games are good and theres ample space they could be included. It will be a tradeoff I guess....give more space to the selected entries or add a few small games. It will have to be decided on a case by case basic I guess.

That's precisely "it". By making them smaller you might come to a point where main features have to be cut. If one wants to do a DDR game with 28 musics, because the main feature of the game is to change the tempo in between, but he can only fit one or two musics in that ROM space, he might as well just not do it. "Oh, but the game would be so fun!". Well, too bad, if prices drop for bigger carts next year, you can try again. Your simple solution sees the problem of fitting X into Y, without considering what X stands for as a whole.
<br/>
<br/>
If that's what you're trying to say, then I agree. The rules are there, and one must go accordingly. The problem is that you and tepples share this vision that you can fit anything in 4mbits - just cut some limbs and "re-desing". It's not like that, some things simply don't fit in. Commercial games sometimes get cancelled because main features should be left out in order to make them fit - it's a documented fact, and as good as an argument as "F-Zero fit in 4mbits". But if the general notion for GBA developers is that everything should be either Small and Simple or cut right off - because anyone that tries it differently is plain wrong, newer programmers will never go beyond this virtual limitation. Haven't you ever done anything that actually needed more space?

Revisit your design. Programmers do it all the time. If you don't want to have to do that, then plan better. In your example, a well-designed poker game ought not to be broken if it turned out to have more assets than could fit.

With tracked music using waveform instruments he could potentially fit several hours of music. Or less if he wanted something fancier. A central feature that inherently requires a lot of storage space is probably not the wisest choice for a compo like this one, but part of any design is making those tradeoffs: a DDR game with tracked synth music can easily be more fun to play than a DDR game with CD audio if it's better designed.

Sure I have. But they weren't designed for a compo with a size limit. If I were to enter this compo, I would not try to submit the 70-hour RPG I am creating.

A text-based poker game would be inelegant on the GBA. Fortunately, elegance is not something that requires vast amounts of storage to create. Just a keen sense of design. Do you really think you will have a better shot at winning by bloating the size of your game with fullscreen uncompressed images?

You're absolutely right. People should complain right away instead of researching what it is they're complaining about or exploring alternatives. How incredibly misinformed and offensive of me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Part of the challenge here is to write a good game within the criteria of the competition rules. As in this particular case one of the criteria is that the entire game must fit in 4Mbit, then that's where at least part of the challenge lies.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have it in mind to develop a DDR game with two dozen unique pieces of music causing the resultant ROM to exceed 4Mbit, it simply won't qualify for the competition and if you don't discover this until you've neally finished the game, then you should have given it more thought to begin with.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, SimonB has suggested that any unused space could be allocated for use by the games which have made the grade. If for your final game you had to leave (or take) a few nice-to-have features out to fit it into 4Mbit, then it may be that they could be included in the final cartridge, but it's not worth relying on having more space from the outset.
<br/>
<br/>
It's entirely possible to produce superb looking and great sounding games in 4Mbit, but size must be a consideration at all stages of the design and development. OK, so the super-duper, graphicaly rich manga-style RPG masterpiece you have it in mind to write and prove your design and coding genius to the world will probably never fit. Cut down the number of static cut screens and stick to the core of the game you may just be able to do it, but you'd probably be best just coming up with another idea.
<br/>
<br/>
Whilst not wanting to get involved in the little spat that was taking place earlier, I agree with cappeca that you can't simply optimise any game to get it into a specific footprint, and that trying to do so may in fact result in a game which falls well below its potential. That said, I'm certain (coming from an Amiga background, where disk size and memory juggling were often design factors) that all of the ideas I have could be implemented within the 4Mbit limit, whilst still keeping space available for the tweaking (and possibly extra eye candy) that will no doubt be needed after it's been thoroughly tested. 
<br/>
<br/>
I was talking over a friend's game design last night, and to illustrate a couple of points, I downloaded Mayhem In Monsterland and Creatures 2: Torture Trouble for the C64 plus a copy of the VICE emulator to run them on. Both games are great examples of good design and implementation, with very effective graphics, superb presentation, sound and music. Anyone feeling they simply can't manage a good game within the competition size limit will no doubt find inspiration in these and many more old 8 bit computer games. Whilst I know we're talking about entirely different platforms, with vastly different capabilities, the examples I've given each fit on two 180k floppy disks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<span style="font-weight: bold">1. Will the compo judging be done on an emulator or on hardware?</span>

I'm wondering about which gamma to target. (And since parts of my game use mode3, I can't just do on-the-fly gamma correction... it's too slow when you have to do it for every pixel.) Obviously, if my game were chosen I would correct for hardware, but for the initial judging I'd like my game to look as good as possible.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">2. If judging will be done on an emulator, which emulator?</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm testing thoroughly on VisualBoy Advance and on hardware, but I'd obviously like to test on the judges' emulator.

<span style="font-weight: bold">3.  If the judging will be done on an emulator, will you be using an LCD monitor or a CRT monitor?</span>

My fonts are sub-pixel rendered, which means they're hard to read if not targeted for the correct type of monitor. Again, I just want to make it look the way it's "supposed to look" on hardware. Can you tell I'm a graphics guy? :P

Exactly. That's why for testing I just swap out my font. I'm not dynamically calculating the subpixel values... I simply use an RGB font for LCD testing on my PC and a BGR font for hardware. Now that I know the target test platform, I'll submit the BGR version. :)

I'll probably do this for the main game screens (mode0), but my equipment, dialog, and status screens are all mode3, which means I'd have to apply a brightness adjustment to every pixel as I draw it. Too slow.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Simon,
<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I think needs to be added to the rules are who holds republish rights for these games. I'm assuming that all rights are retained by the creators, but I'd like to know for sure.
<br/>
<br/>
In other words, are winners allowed to pitch their game to publishers, if they thing they're good enough? Do creators retain copyright on content and "trademarks" in their games such as characters, worlds, etc.?
<br/>
<br/>
For example, if the carts sell out and there is a call for more, does GBADEV reserve the right to do a "reprint," perhaps this time with a pricing model that allows for profit? Or if GBADEV wants to do a reprint with the same pricing model, can a winner demand that their game be removed from the 2nd cart for any reason?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this seems anal, but I'm working through some intellectual property stuff with another company right now and these sorts of clarifications can save a LOT of headaches down the road.

<br/>
<br/>
The rules state that entries must be 4Mbit in size. They also state that extra rom space may be given "if you need it."
<br/>
<br/>
My team is submitting an RPG. The main storyline fits into the 4MBit space, but there are multiple side quests (and cool bits, such as a fancy start screen) we'd like to include if space permits.
<br/>
<br/>
So should we upload the "main storyline only" version, then add in side quests and foofies during the tweaking period (assuming we're selected)? Or should we submit the full version then trim it down if cart space ends up to be at a premium?

I've already burned *huge* amounts of time working on compression for this project.

The crunch peroid was manic, we had so long to do sound but decided to leave it to the last day, (do I regret that decision).

Seriously, I will buy the final cartridge not just out of idealism - the idea of a handful of good games at a low price is also something which makes it tempting.
<br/>
<br/>
I sincerely do hope that this might form a precendence case of homebrewed catridges for the GBA, not unlike those of the Atari systems (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.atariage.com/store/" target="_blank">www.atariage.com/store/</a>). The greatest motivation of homebrewers is that their games are played by others - but having them "sold" on cartridge can only help, as well. And who knows - hopefully some good press can be made so that people who never visit gbadev.org or play homebrew games might buy the cartridges due to their low price, and introduce them to a new video game scene. I certainly hope it for the developers.

And as I said, I can't wait to play the games myself. And as to commenting on them, I will try to do my best to do so in the future. :-)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I too am interested in the compo cart, and would like to support the scene. I can also appreciate that contributers don't want to be patronised, so I'll only buy the cart if it's any good!

(I assume that there are independent reviews of the games planned?)
<br/>
<br/>
Fairly new to the homebrew scene myself - and having contributed a few months ago to my first competition (albeit on another forum!) - I also think that competitions like this really do act as motivation to get the games finished - not just a 90% working engine, but a start-to-end finished game.
<br/>
At the end of the day, I want people to play and enjoy my games and hopefully tell others about them. 
<br/>
<br/>
So can anyone tell me what to expect from the compo cart - are the games any good?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well... "full story" is a relative term. 4MBit isn't a lot for an RPG. It's story is way too limited right now. I'm working hard on finishing the thing properly, regardless of whether I'm lucky enough to make the cut.

Custom LZW-ish compression and metatiles. The dialog box is all Mode3, but its blitting engine can handle graphics of lower color depths. So if there's a graphic that needs only 64 colors to look good, that's what will be stored on the cart.

I started working on the Star Fortress Dendron engine and tools over a year ago. It's just been a side project, so I've had big gaps of time where I wasn't able ot work on it. Our team writer, sgeos, put together the basic world and story last April. 90% of the content was created in the last two months... it wasn't enough time. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is that the project started out as me wanting to see if one could create web-based authoring environments for the GBA. Form there it turned into an RPG engine.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you guys are interested you can learn a little more about the project <a class="postlink" href="http://www.thingker.com/IMPBuilder" target="_blank">here</a>.

We started working on Bengt - Swinger of Longarm almost as soon as we heard about the compo; sonetime in early september it must have been. We had to ditch our current project (an overambitious RPG) which we felt no chance of completing in three months and 4 Mbit, but I'm atually much more entusiastic about BSOL than I ever was about that project.
<br/>
<br/>
We had an extreemly oversized team (7 people in total) we're a bunch of classmates, except our musician who was actually picked for his talent. But most of the members had lives and stuff so most of the games content is done by myself and some bits here and there by the others. and of course there were a lot of discussion before any decisions were made.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Still, I agree it was quite a feat just fitting all the map data and text in those old games, and I'm sure you could do it on GBA too, if given enough time and a person willing to deal with the level design limits imposed by an object-based editor or whatever (although I would almost argue that limits are an advantage in level design, pushing you to be more creative)<br/>_________________<br/>___________

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.

Seriously, though. Your point is well taken. As I've said before, this whole compo experience gave me an appreciation for what it takes to finish a commercial ROM. I worked my a** off for months, and I'm still a long way from game that I'd call "100% done." When you look at what a lot of the classic games did with their limited hardware, it's pretty amazing.

For the record, the GBA CPU is more powerful than the NES CPU and can do better real-time tile decompression, so one might be able to fit 8-color tiles in the space that the NES used for 4-color tiles.

My take on it is that we didn't have enough time.  Our "game", although high quality was quite unfinished when submitted.  It really serves as more of an engine demo.  Scott did a fantastic job with the compression.  I'm not convinced that space was the limiting factor so much as time.

We only did a simple game because the 2 of us that worked on it are trying to juggle uni work and going out as much as possible. The crunch week was stressful to try and coordinate everything and we seemed only to be in alternate days. Although we blitzed through everything on the sunday fixed major problems like sound, and minor problems like score validating when reading from memory etc. We even had time to test it quite throughly (*fingers crossed*)<br/>_________________<br/>"A lecture is a process by which the notes of the professor become the notes of the students without passing through the minds of either" - R.

Unfortunately mine is only 1 player. If I didn't have a job I would have for sure made it multiplayer. Like so many people on the forum I have lots of plans for development but have to fight for time to work on them:) Maybe I will make it multiplayer for a post contest release .

GASP! (submitted by CJ though) its another simple puzzle game, maybe a bit frustrating at times but i still play it on and off. (usually after writing something i never wanna play it again, so its an improvement :))

Just wondering, who is still working on their games for the updated deadline? We're working on both of ours, and Switch has received a bit of a huge update to counter the judges criticisms. I go to the States tommorow though, so everything's got to be finished today. I haven't packed or anything yet!!!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">*edited, rephrased*
<br/>
<br/>
I think the thing that really frustrates me, provided that any of these games are actually just clones of other games, is that game design entails three main functions: game design, content generation, and programming.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, regardless of the specific legality, appropriating someone else's design does two things - 1.) It gives you a base to work from that has been tried and tested, and 2.) It removes a huge chunk of what makes game development difficult - the uncertainty of creating something original.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem with the first point is that you've essentially appropriated thousands of hours of someone else's investment, in development, and testing, and are now using that as a base to work from. That gives the person appropriating the design a tremendous advantage, because it requires no (or very little) innovation. Rewarding an appropriated design, however legal it may be, creates an atmosphere where imitation and duplication are not only accepted, but *necessary* to compete within the limited resources that we're all given. Innovation is essentially punished, because it requires such a tremendous amount more work.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I understand that the judges can make their determinations however they want - and that I haven't played either of these two games. They may be tremendously original, and interesting - and if they are, again, awesome. I don't mean to accuse someone else of ripping off someone else's design - I'd just like to know whether they are, or aren't clones.

<br/>
<br/>
I think there's a difference between taking *parts* of ideas, and taking whole  executions of ideas.
<br/>
<br/>
(caveat: I'm not accusing *any* of the games in this to be ripoffs. I don't know - I haven't played them. No offense intended, and my sincere apologies if this is offensive to someone)
<br/>
<br/>
Say the game of Risk - it's not an idea, it's an execution. The execution is the completed set of rules. Creating a board game about world domination is the underlying idea. If I take the rules of Risk and re-implement them, I'm not taking the person's idea - creating a game about world domination - I'm actually taking the person's work - the execution, balance, tuning, revision, time involved in creating the system that is the final rule set of the game Risk.
<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the *idea* of say, Doom, is, "Let's make a first person shooter that takes a player to hell." The level design, the weapon design, the execution of the code involved, the technical engine itself - these are all the execution - the "work" of Doom. If you take the final game, and make a ripoff with the same weapons, the same levels, you're taking part of the end result, not just part of the ideas involved.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this how it is defined legally? I have *no idea*. I'm not a lawyer. But let's say puzzle games. Tetris is a "puzzle game," right? One of the first, I think, if not the first really successful one. You've got pieces dropping from the top, which creates a problem that you need to solve immediately. So, a game about creating continuous spatial puzzles that need to be solved in some time frame. Pretty apt description for Hatris, Magical Drop, Puyo Puyo, blah blah blah. You could even say some of the details of the execution are extremely similar, and the original idea might even entail puzzle pieces dropping from the top of the screen, and *filling* a screen, even. Pretty detailed. But the execution of that idea, the mathematical work that Pajitnov did to figure out what pieces were optimal, and what would create the most interesting set of problems, is unique to Tetris, and *I* don't believe that a game can use those details and *not* be Tetris.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Seppo, I think the idea of including these puzzle type games over others is not one of "let's make a cartridge with a load of ripoff games". The gbadev.org guys wanted to make a cart with games you'd play more than once. Personally, I think Switch is a better game than Snackman but you probably wouldn't touch it again once you'd completed it. I think they went for games that were fun and playable, and they just happened to be tried and tested game designs.
<br/>
<br/>
This is probably why Star Fortress Dendron didn't make it. I think it looks absolutely awesome, and it is probably a great demonstration of gba homebrew. But if it only lasts 5 minutes and you'll never play it again, then why would you buy a cartridge with it on? I think they've tried to make the compilation appealling to non-developers, and I think it was probably the right thing to do.
<br/>
<br/>
So... when can we get our orders in?
<br/>
<br/>
And when will the losing games be released? Before or after the cart?
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers Simon, and may I be the first to say that you for all of the time and effort it's taken to run this competition. It's much appreciated, I've learnt an awful lot, and it's been great fun working on these games. I can't wait for the next compo now! :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Seppo, I support every, every, every word you wrote in your posts.
<br/>
<br/>
I must say that I also really am a little bit dissapointed with all of this going on, but I'm also aware of the following sentences from the compo rules :
<br/>
<br/>
"To keep everything going smoothly and within the timeline, myself [Simon],luna_s and krom will be the only
<br/>
judges. This might seem odd to you but if you have hosted competitions such as this before you would
<br/>
know it can take a long time for some judges to give you their results. Sometimes you don't even get that...
<br/>
I can trust myself [Simon], luna_s and krom to be fair judges, and I hope you can too. In the event that the three of
<br/>
us can not agree on which entries should make the cartridge, I [Simon] will have final say.
<br/>
"
<br/>
<br/>
This is something that all competitors accepted on the day they entered competition. Nobody asked, at that moment, about judging criteria and what TCRs entry has to satisfy. Now we don't have right to make complaints about it. It is too late.
<br/>
<br/>
That is what I think.
<br/>
But at the end it was interesting experience after all. 
<br/>
<br/>
If all other entries, who didn't make it, will be published on the site, so that other people can try them out, that would be nice.
<br/>
<br/>
I also hope that many of that other people will buy final cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
If they will be dissapointed with the winning entries..... well imagine what's like when you buy $40 title in the store next to your doors and after two hours of playing you get angry because somone judged wrongly what should and what should not be on the market.
<br/>
<br/>
So who is wrong? You or Them ?

<br/>
<br/>
Even Doom had its predecessors. And lots of people have built on that concept.  id even licensed the engine for some of their games.  
<br/>
<br/>
Tetris, Tetris Attack, Columns, etc.  Those are all similar, but they aren't the same.
<br/>
<br/>
Galaga, Gorf, Gradius, Space Invaders.  They're all the same concept. 
<br/>
<br/>
Look at how many Super Mario Bros type games have been made. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have only played one of the compo entries.  The one I made, but just looking at them I don't see any blatant ripoffs.  I see familiar concepts.  Krakman is the most obviously similar one. It has the ghosts and even Pac(Krak)-man. But it looks like you can go into multiple rooms and the power-ups in the screenshot look different.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think Simon and the other judges would have selected games that violated copyright laws.  It was part of the rules.  So, until we play them, all we have to go off of is one screenshot.  And that isn't enough to criticize the games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This would only happen if all developers of the selected games agree to do this...and of course if we wanted/had the time to make it happen. NO additional cartridges will be manufactured if YOU, the developer of a selected game, do not wish to manufacture additional cartridges.

Given that the cartridges <span style="font-style: italic">have</span> sold out (I discovered this compo late, would have liked to have bought one), my recommendation would be that you now put the winning games online individually so they can be downloaded by those of us lucky enough to have a flash cart, or unlucky enough to need an emulator :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I strongly recommend that if you do this again next year, you put something in the rules that allows this (and also allows subsequent cartridge builds) without requiring you to go back to the authors to ask each time.  (However I do approve of only getting non-exclusive rights and allowing the authors to also distribute their own games in their own way - that's as it should be, as is the non-profit way you've handled the carts.  It would have been easy and tempting to stockpile a dollar or two extra to have some funds to kick-start next years competition.  I'm glad you resisted the temptation).
<br/>
<br/>
By the way if the author of PanzerPanik (which I'm hoping is a BattleZone clone) is reading and wants to release his game separately, that's the one I most want to play :-)
<br/>
<br/>
If you run the competition next year I'll be there with an entry - something retro and probably vector-based!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what I understand, the games will be released when the cart is finished.
<br/>
Honestly I think they shoulda released the games already and let the carts be cool in themselves ^_^
<br/>
Cuase its a freakin unofficial cart, its freakin cool as is.
<br/>
<br/>
But still, waiting is alright. Though its already getting close to the date this compo actualy started O-o
<br/>
<br/>
I think I woulda liked to pay more to help the next compo if they decide to do this cart thing again, wich I hope they do, cuase its awsome :p
<br/>
<br/>
Though I expect it to  be better next time, seems like alot of mistakes were made with some companys who didnt pull through. Im sure they were learned from. 
<br/>
<br/>
But still, they are almost done with the whole thing, and I hoenstly am very anxoius to get my cart :3 abd I cant wait to see what the next compo will have :p Compo Cart or not</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you paid, we will send the game(s). I assume you have been emailing Duo who is doing the US orders so I cant comment on that. Id say there is a big chance of the email(s) Duo sent to confirm US addresses went to your trash, so you might not have seen it.
<br/>
<br/>
We will not email after we have sent the parcels, but we will of course make a note to whom we have sent the game to (for our use).

Ill let you know when all US carts have been sent. If your game has not been received a week after that then you can start to worry.

Gotta say it was worth the wait. :3
<br/>
Game menu was surprising awsome loooking.
<br/>
Box looks great too xD
<br/>
<br/>
The front of the cart casing seemed to be a little off and stuff, I tried unscrewing it and realigning it but screwing it back in just puts it back the way it was. Any tips on fixing this? Id like the cart to have a smooth top like all my other carts. Im thinking of maybe replacing the screw or something. Maybe even glue it shut instead. Though it still works great so I dont really need to do that anyway.
<br/>

Really well done cart and games, again it was worth the wait ^_^
