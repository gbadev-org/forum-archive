    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Greetings,
<br/>
My name is Dan Bushman.  Pleased to meet you as well..heh.
<br/>
I am the production head of an independant GBA development team working on an action RPG called "Lucitoth: The Uprising."  As one who has gone through the hardships of pulling together a development team for such a project, I often asked if there was a better way to go about it.  If there was a place that fostered a developer such as myself.
<br/>
<br/>
Now that I have my development team together, I have an idea.  This idea is for something I have entitled "Round Table Games."  Basically the idea behind it is to create an enviroment that will help <span style="font-weight: bold">serious</span> GBA developers to grow and get the help they need.  What I am proposing, and willing to offer services for is a double purpose site.  The primary function of the site is as follows.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are working with an indepent development team for a GBA game, you can go to the site and view the "Membership Criterion."  What this will be is a certain set of criteron which your team must meet in order to apply for membership.  If your team does not meet the criteria needed for applying, there are links and information on every step to meet those needs.  These things would be for example copyrighting work, furnishing a certain amount of proof of development, age and things like that.  If your team <span style="font-style: italic">does</span> meet the standards, you are then able to fill out a membership application.  This application is then reviewed by the production heads of each team, and then voted in or out.  If voted in, you will be given your own dev team account, which will be protected so that members of your team are the only ones allowed to view it.  So when you go to the site, you click on the dev team member link and then there will be a page that has links to all the teams sections that are part of the round table.  You click on your team and enter your user/password.  At this level there will be something similar to this:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ex/frankjaeger/RoundTable.gif">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the very, very basics of the structure for only one section of the site, but this will be the most often viewed portion. Here's a general rundown of what is going on in the picture.
<br/>
<br/>
1. The top is where the links to the development team's different resources will be. This page and the pages linked can only be viewed by the development teams memebers and will be able to be edited by anyone person on the team, or a select few if needed.
<br/>
<br/>
2. The content will go into the larger of the two boxes. It will most likely consist of an iframe and will likely have a band on the bottom allowing members to edit the page without having to go to a control panel.
<br/>
<br/>
3. The smaller white box is where your logo will displayed, along with links to the other team's information page. These pages will be able to be viewed by everyone. Random logos maybe implemented to increase interests in other projects.
<br/>
<br/>
4. The bottom section will contain links to the homepage, the public forums, etc.  There will also be links to things that other teams have contributed from knowledge they have gained.  Every team has their "knowledge holes", and this would help to fill them.  All members will be encouraged to add to the resources pool.  Information on websites for all different aspects of GBA development, and places to look for people to join your team.  This will include information on publication processes, and info on attaining an NOA developers license.
<br/>
<br/>
Each team will be given 150 MB of space, which I will give from my server.  There will be uploading tools and news tools.  Things you would generally need to actually use the site to help development.
<br/>
<br/>
The second draw of this idea is the general public forum.  Since the application criteria list is publically available, people looking to work with an independant game development team know that the members of the site that are looking for work have at <span style="font-style: italic">least</span> verifiably fulfilled those needs, and can feel much more save than when looking into joining a random development team that could be run by a 13 year old for all they know.  So it helps serious GBA dev job seekers to find good teams.  Secondly, this helps the members of the Round Table, because better project seekers will seek out and post applications there.
<br/>
<br/>
The last point I will make is that when your team signs up and is accepted, you must agree to include a Round Table splash screen at the beginning of you game in the event it is published.  This automatically gives exposer to all teams that have worked hard enough to get into the table.  It is each teams way of giving back.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, also, each team is given the option of posting information on sub-site that is for publishers to view.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, that's more or less it.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in this idea and/or would like to help the development process of this community, please post contact information here, or e-mail me at <a href="mailto:danbushman@eg-games.com">danbushman@eg-games.com</a> and include something in regards to whether or not you would like to help develop it in any way, or if you would just like to be informed of when it is finished.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you would like information about the game I am developing, you can check out some small stuff I have released in a help wanted ad at the pixelation forum: <a href="http://pixelation.proboards12.com/index.cgi?board=pix&amp;action=display&amp;num=1069831701" target="_blank">http://pixelation.proboards12.com/index.cgi?board=pix&amp;action=display&amp;num=1069831701</a>
<br/>
I don't want to make any more information regarding my game readily available for all to view, so that's all you get for now.
<br/>
<br/>
I have several very good looking teams that have agreed to be a part of this already.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know, and I thank you for your time.

<br/>
<br/>
However, I am only 15, and my GBA development skills is probably not grown enough for such a great project (St0ven rocks).
<br/>
<br/>
But I support it a lot ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
