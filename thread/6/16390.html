in my opinion there wont be any harm from a gba version and considering it's 85% done, it should be 100% done. once team 17 changes their mind, it can be still pulled out. would be a waste to stop at such a high development level anyway.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Kojote</span>

i think your decision is great, but please also take care of yourself and avoid a lawsuit. this could be all turning out pretty much demotivating for you. but again i think the gba is economical dead, so a free version wont bring them too much harm... a free gba version could be seen as advertisement anyway, probably just a way how you present everything.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Kojote</span>

 The way I see it, any forthcoming release from them will not be a conversion but a 3D first person shooter (possible exception being the DS platform). We're talking about a game first released in the 90s. Alot of gamers may not even be aware of AB or the Amiga and if my conversion gains any notoriety at all (which is unlikely), it can only benefit Team17.
<br/>
 Just to be on the safe side though, I am thinking of going underground like the A-Team. For example, I don't live in Cambridge anymore, I'm a ghost.... I am going to martyr myself to the casue of that special breed of computer geek, the homebrew coding enthusiast..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
as you said on your own it might only benefit them - package it nice, ask them to not go after you. they do not need to support you officialy, just a confirmation that they wont sent you a lawsuite is probably already more than enough. there must be always a way, who makes both parties happy.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Kojote</span>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got a C&amp;D from Games Workshop when I released a beta (80% complete) version of my Talisman board game conversion to the GBA (see <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mywiferocksproductions.com" target="_blank">www.mywiferocksproductions.com</a>)
<br/>
<br/>
I too said that the version would only be playable by homebrewers and that the GBA was on the way out.  GW legal claimed the version could be played on the DS with hardware and on the PC with emulators.  It was a damn good game too - worked on it for over two years.  There are other on-line and PC conversions of the game that they haven't shut down... I guess mine was just too complete...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was told to halt working and distributing it as well as any other GW properties.  When I removed the download, they also made me take all pictures and references to the game off-line (I have censored images up now...).  After all that the game is still downloadable from a number of sites via Google search... just should have waited till it was 100% completed.
<br/>
<br/>
I now get permission for the games I convert and have a number of projects ongoing...  just know that if you aren't a "corporation" (inc., ltd., etc.) they can sue you for your personal money if they prove copyright infringement, loss of profits or trademark dillution...

interesting, this is why your game disappered out of nowhere. i tried to check if i had the latest version in the pdroms archive etc. after reading the c&amp;d stuff in your message, i've disabled the download on pdroms - but the game is save, even if others can't have it.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Kojote</span>
