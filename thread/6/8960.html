    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">have a looksee if you want. Incomplete but I thought I might as well get it up and running and sort the smaller stuff as soon as I have some spare time =)

Feel free to contact post suggestions on features etc KEEPING IN MIND THE SITE IS NOT FINISHED ;) Ie the demo/game section is severly crippled atm. And yeah...you probably know already that I like to keep things simple (design &amp; images) and easy to navigate. Fast loading times will hopefully be a side-effect.

Oh and on a side note, I appear to have accidently blocked all visitors to the forum, except those visiting from my IP. I wondered why I was all alone browsing the forum ;D

The new one looks very 'I just learnt HTML'-ish, but I'm sure that you will improve it!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">On a browser smaller than 1024x768, it  adds a horizontal scroll bar, which I'm not a fan of.  (I always prefer dynamic resizing to fit everything on the screen)

But thanks for putting the work into it! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
