    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i was surfing the internet and i found this VERY interesting project...
<br/>
<br/>
is a new generation videogame console, but it has one little thing that i like...is totally open to developers!
<br/>
<br/>
here's the text in the main page...
<br/>
Gamix is a revolutionary concept who's time has come: An open videogame platform specification.
<br/>
<br/>
Open to anyone and everyone, Gamix offers a superior gaming platform without restrictive licensing costs.
<br/>
<br/>
 It is our passionate belief that by giving developers and hardware manufacturers a completely open market, creativity and innovation will thrive. The business model of large companies with proprietary systems controlling the profitability of independent game developers will not be able to compete.
<br/>
<br/>
So what exactly is Gamix? Gamix is simply the technical specifications for the videogame system of tomorrow. And Gamix is the marketing behind the platform.
<br/>
<br/>
 To advertise Gamix compatibility, participating hardware manufacturers contribute $1 for each Gamix machine sold. Participating Gamix peripheral manufacturers can affix the Gamix logo for $.25 per device. Software programs may advertise Gamix compatibility and use the Gamix logo at no charge.
<br/>
<br/>
Gamix maintains an open book policy. Every dollar paid by participating manufacturers is used to promote and advertise the Gamix platform. Income and expenses will be made publicly available to maintain the highest confidence in our commitment to build the market.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope that by visiting our web page, you begin to see the possibilities we see. And I hope that your enthusiasm for our project helps make this vision a reality.
<br/>
<br/>
Please do not hesitate to call or e-mail for more information. Awareness is the first step towards a new tomorrow.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Standardized hardware in a mass-produced console makes it easier to justify developing on a given platform. The big difference from a console is that it's not subject to a subsidy enforced through a lockout mechanism. On GP2X and Gamix, you get the predictability of a console with the openness of a Linux box.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I don't see people designing their home computer to meet the Gamix specs..   I still think PC games are 10x better then console based games.  But maybe that is just me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This venture involves a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification_mark" target="_blank">certification mark</a>. Other examples of certification marks include are "UL Listed". If you can back your certification mark up with a marketing budget in order to get manufacturers to build to your spec and license the mark, then you might in fact be able to make a bit of money off the deal.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

first of all, the specs are totally vague. if i want to develop games for a console, i want an sdk. and i want an os for that sdk to run on top of. and i want to know exactly what cpu i run on. and i want to know the ram-speeds. and the dvd-rom speeds. all they offer is "some 3.2ghz x86-cpu and a dvd-rom".
<br/>
<br/>
another BIG issue is that the X800-interface is not open, so i would most definatly have to either run this on some minor linux-distro with the mega-shitty ati-linux-drivers or buy one license of windows xp for every single copy of the game. no thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
oh, and then we have the issue of input-devices. how on earth do i program them? they specify nothing else than "8-Way, 6-button USB Gamepad". wow, that says a lot.
<br/>
<br/>
the entire solution smells a lot of "hey, i wanna be mr managment-guy, let's start a technology company without any engeneers. they only cost money anyway! i know better than them, because i've built my own pc!".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It does if you have a joystick device in the kernel that knows how to talk to USB human interface devices.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
