I've also included the full source code for anybody interested.  I have it broken into two areas - my own libgba and the minesweeper game that uses this libgba.  My libgba has a bunch of utility functions and offers advanced sprite management.  Feel free to examine it; I have Doxygen documentation on the website as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
