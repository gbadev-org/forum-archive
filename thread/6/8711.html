    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You don't know C/C++, but you want to write some programs for your DS?  Well, learn <a class="postlink" href="http://www.lua.org" target="_blank">Lua</a> and write scripts to run using DSLua!  Here is version 0.1 (preview build) for you to play with.  Version 0.1 supports some basic text functions, and functions to read dpads/stylus input.  Currently it will only work with devices support by Chishm's FAT driver (devices like GBA Movie Player and M3 CF) though.  Enjoy!

Thanks!  I am a Lua novice, but from what I have seen, it sure is very easy and very powerful.  :)  What people are doing on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.luaplayer.org/gallery/index.html" target="_blank">PSP's Lua Player</a> sure look like fun.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The on-screen keyboard idea sounds fun.  You'd probably want to make a crash-proof version of the DS IO library so it could stop and print an error message instead of locking up.  Wouldn't want to lose all your code every time you make a mistake.  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmmm, that sounds like a great idea!  I will put that on my to do list.  I was thinking once I implement the file read/write functionality, a simple editor written in Lua would be a quick solution.  :)

I agree about removing technical restrictions, and the problem is not LUA or the homebrew created, but rather the sites making it big head lines, eg."Screen Test v0.1" etc. Besides, LUA reminds me of Visual Basic for the windows platform. If that is a good thing, I rest my case.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry to keep you all waiting, work is kickin my behind at the momment...  :( I planned to release 0.2 after I get more functionalities in, so hopefully something t this weekend.
<br/>
<br/>
Small update of what's coming in 0.2:
<br/>
- implemented the GBFS file handles, so SD folks can use that for now
<br/>
- with GBFS working, you can run DSLua on DeSmuME :)
<br/>
- better error reporting for some crashes
<br/>
- remove the START key wait after script is executed
<br/>
- misc other small fixes
<br/>
<br/>
Chishm's has released a new FAT driver, so I might integrate that in as well.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, DSLua.com had a face lift, hope you guys like it. ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
