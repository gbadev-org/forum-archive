Our friendly plumber Paul is in trouble. Fatarse Fritz just ran to the outhouse, and the pipework isn't done at all! Will you manage to help Paul before Fritz flushes his giant load and causes a terrible mess in the pit? 
<br/>
<br/>
Connect the start of the pipe to the end point before the timer runs out. Once the flush sequence has been started, no more pieces of pipe can be placed. If you accidently set a wrong tile, you can remove it by pressing the B button, but this will take some time. Your progress is saved to cart automagically. If you play the game again, you can select your starting level up to the one you reached. Please don't turn off your Gameboy Advance while the floppy disk icon is visible, otherwise your progress data may be lost and you have to start over from scratch again.
