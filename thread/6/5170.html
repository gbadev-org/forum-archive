So some of you might have noticed I've been working on a GBA hentai game and stuff, and I've been thinking about posting the Roadmap and Tech Demo. So here it is. 
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://helmetedrodent.kickassgamers.com/kawass.rar" target="_blank">Catnip Dreams Alpha - The Tech Demo</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas, suggestions? 
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">New demo coming up this weekend. It'll be good.
<br/>
<br/>
- Actually different room images, just to show it's possible.
<br/>
- Pick up items and take them with you.
<br/>
- Various bug fixes and optimizations
<br/>
- SPrintF use. I'll explain then.
<br/>
- Added sounds that fit the game's genre, if only to make Cait think twice about tapping it. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
And I hope to find new assets from Tony and Erika this weekend, but that'll be too late to actually integrate in time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As promised, an explanation on SPrintF:

I don't have a standard C library and found an implementation once written by Linus Torvalds in the Socrates library. So I stole it.

The fact that I know nothing of homebrewing, but I'd expect the same sort of features from a prefab game maker.  And how when you get to the ends of parts it doesn't crash, it gives you that nice screen that tells you what's goin on there.  That's all. :P

-Richard-</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">Thanks. The first two things you listed are intentional but might require some explanation.
<br/>
<br/>
1) That's on purpose. The waste basket's description is "Insert description here", literally.
<br/>
2) The demo mansion is in a plus shape. In a new game, the south end is a bare room with just a light. After talking to me, you'll find a bed in the room.
<br/>
3) That one's new to me, thanks.

As for your other post re: game makers; I did that myself, however prefab it may seem. However, I'm not really sure whether to take that as an insult or a compliment. [/ltcmdrdata]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I set the name to UUUUUUUU
<br/>
The name error I was talking about is in the main intro
<br/>
"Greetings, my name is <span style="font-weight: bold">Keitaro</span> Takagawa, age 19"
<br/>
^that line totally reminds me of Golden Boy "Hi, I'm Kentaro Ouai..."
<br/>
one way to fix that would be to add in a part that says "My friends call me [NAME YOU TYPED IN AT THE START]"
<br/>
<br/>
That's actually the only place I've noticed the name thing happen.  Also, if you end the name with an !  (ie: Keitaro!) you'll get a weird black box after your name.  Not too sure what would cause that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for the prefab thing... Take it as a compliment.  It's looking really professional, and I do like how the unfinished parts have been "capped" with that error screen as opposed to just causing some sort of crazy infinite loop or w/e.

The exact line used in the JESUS script was "Greetings, my name is Keitaro Takagawa". It should've been "Greetings, my name is %s Takagawa". Easy fix.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Next version will have a multiplayer trade system, so you can, for example, get money from another player.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yet again, another new version has just been uploaded.
<br/>
<br/>
Fun fact: I couldn't find any multiplayer code that wasn't also multiboot. The trading idea is postponed.
<br/>
<br/>
Genuine fun fact: A quick check in No$GBA (Gamer's Edition) shows an absolute ZERO on bugs. No$GBA itself calls Catnip a "technically perfect rare masterpiece. Congratulations and best wishes to the author". One bug is triggered upon softreset, and several per second during the failed DS Test.
<br/>
<br/>
What's the DS Test, you may ask? Somebody suggested I'd add a debug menu instead of using button combos. DS Test is one of the functions seen therein. The answer's no; you can't read the DS user settings or special registers from GBA mode. Or so it seems.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
