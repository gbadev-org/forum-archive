    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looks pretty good, although it's harder to tell without being able to play a demo.
<br/>
<br/>
It does look a little slow though...like excitebike only slower.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, we tuned the physics since we made the video and it is a little more fast. 
<br/>
<br/>
Excite Bike is of course the main reference in side scrolling motocross games. I think that there as not been another good game of that kind. One major improvement we bring is the possibiliy of doing tricks to obtain boost that will allow you to do best times. And the tracks environment have much more variety and deepness.
<br/>
<br/>
And sorry to not be able to give a playable demo, it's part of the "try to ge published" game !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey there!
<br/>
<br/>
It's about time some people created an excite bike game!  
<br/>
<br/>
I'm surprised, I would have guess a topic like that would have alot more posts. I mean, when was the last time there was a 2d moto game that's not just for kids?
<br/>
<br/>
Take care all!
