I agree.  I think this might help people form dev groups for various projects.  I'm not entirely convinced that a distinct groups need to be made commercial and homebrew.  I do think, however, that separate help offered and help wanted groups would be nice.  I did not checked to see if equivalent groups had been created before posting this.

Was the word job intended to mean 'not necessarily for pay'?  If so, that word might be a little misleading.  This is the first definition listed by <a class="postlink" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/" target="_blank">dictionary.com</a>:
<br/>
<br/>
A regular activity performed in exchange for payment, especially as one's trade, occupation, or profession.
<br/>
<br/>
Then again, I'm not really sure that I can think of anything better to replace it with.  Service was the best word offered by local folks.  "Project help wanted?"
<br/>
<br/>
This concludes my neurotic nitpicking exercise.

Hehehe... my family consists of people who constantly send eachother to the dictionary.  First thing I did was check the dictionary definition.  At any rate, the most important thing is that it exists, right?
