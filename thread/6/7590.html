Well, probably not, but in any case you might be interested in hearing that the first games were sent out customers today (Thursday).
<br/>
<br/>
(at least we managed to send them out before xmas!)
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you will enjoy playing the game as much as we have.

I haven't gotten mine yet.  Should I be worried?  Or just patient? (I live in the U.S.).

I dont think all the US carts have been sent yet. Ill let you know when they have all been sent, and if it hasnt arrived a week after that, then you can start to worry.

<br/>
<br/>
I got my carts today (and I live in the US).
<br/>
Great job on everything.  Very professionally done.
<br/>
<br/>
Great job also by all the developers.  The games all look good and they are very fun and challenging.  I know how much work went into my game, and can only imagine the long hours everybody else put it.  &lt;applause&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
@thos_thom:  I'm the guy that did swish-it (big ups to Tepples, for the music).  I appreciate the feedback.  My girlfriend was the main tester of that game, maybe I subconsciously made it so girls would like it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So it's been over two weeks since you started shipping US carts, and you haven't sent them all yet? Just want to confirm -- you said you'd post once you shipped them all.
<br/>
<br/>
I am going to be out of town for 2 weeks starting friday. Originally I didn't say anything, as you said you'd be shipping to US on Nov 28, so that's almost 3 weeks total. I don't want it to get returned to sender, or sit on my doorstep for 2 weeks, so can you tell me if you've shipped mine yet? And if not, can you contact me to make arrangements?

Please contact Duo on the e-mail address that you originally sent the compo payment to, to verify if your game has been sent or not. Its quite possible that your compo cart was already sent but was lost by the post office, or will be delivered in the next day or two.

All the 100 carts I tested in my DS worked fine, and it should work in yours too. Please check if the game works in a regular GBA and then send an e-mail to the address where you originally sent your payment to, describing the problem.
