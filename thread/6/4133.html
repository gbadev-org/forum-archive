    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have read the next compo rules, and one thing that bothers me
<br/>
is the rule, that commands us to send the source code of the project.
<br/>
Why is that?
<br/>
I can compile my own engines myself, and send the compiled ROM.
<br/>
what's wrong with that Simon?
<br/>
<br/>
And two more things: 
<br/>
1) Simon, I think it would be really cool, if you open a new page
<br/>
    on the site about the compo, and every potential competitor will
<br/>
    send his screenshots, and describe a bit about his project, so we could
<br/>
    all be anxious, and of-course guide each other(if wanted)
<br/>
<br/>
2) I've been keeping up with DS development, and it seems, that
<br/>
    no software could easily emulate the 3D chip features.
<br/>
    I've heard that hardware box will do that.
<br/>
    so, what exectly can you tell us, that we might not know?
<br/>
    any developers licked info? or maybe homebrew projects?
<br/>
    anyway i'm excited to see it in action, although I am quite 
<br/>
    sad, that no software rendering will live these years (shame, cause
<br/>
    I spent alot of time learning the core functions by software). But,
<br/>
    I guess, that now good programmers will be measured by other
<br/>
    3D algorithms (VSD, HSR, Quality etc..).
<br/>
<br/>
3) and I demand you to keep GBADEV.ORG alive no matter what
<br/>
    happens in the potable gaming industry. these little GBA machines
<br/>
    are like the best thing, that fell in my hands. Unlike most of 
<br/>
    GBA programmers, I'm developing 3D for the GBA, and I hope,
<br/>
    that soon enough I will release a mega 3D project for all of you.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx in Advance, you are all great
<br/>
Cheers,  Tomer!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hardware rendering isn't necessarily easier than software rendering. The more complex things in 3D engine development are still there. Writing polyfillers and camera math is pretty easy but it's the engine structure which needs a lot of thought. With hardware accelleration that part is still there. Additionally, 3D engines have become far more advanced since we can program our own shaders now. 
<br/>
I think most good 3D engines for next generation consoles or PC are many times more complex than any GBA software rasterizer one could write since there are less boundaries. 3D engines on Gameboy Advance require a lot of dirty/smart hacks/tricks but that doesn't make someone a good programmer. There's more to explore in hardware acceleration right now, there are already many documents on software rendering and the most amazing things have been pulled off on the amiga for instance. 
<br/>
<br/>
I may have misunderstood your point ^_ ^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The rules doesnt <span style="font-weight: bold">command</span> you to send the source code of the project. Only <span style="font-weight: bold">if</span> your game is selected to be on the cartridge must you be <span style="font-weight: bold">prepared</span> to send in the source in case we ask for it.
<br/>
It is possible that we will not ask anyone to send in their source code but if it will help in the integration of the games we just might. Also, if we suspect theft or if we need the source for any other unknown reason we put it in the rules.

There isnt anything wrong with that and nor have I said so. its exactly how you should do it. You compile the game and send it to us.

Thats a good idea. At least we need to get up a proper site for the competition and your idea wouldnt be hard to implement at all.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually is not necessary any .o files. Just like we are used to compile any project with a starting address of 0x08000000 the only requirement to make a multigame cart would be to compile every game with starting addresses of 4Mbit space between them, i.e.
<br/>
<br/>
menu 0x080000000
<br/>
game1 0x080080000
<br/>
game2 0x080100000
<br/>
game3 0x080180000
<br/>
...          ...
<br/>
<br/>
Next you create the rom using something like
<br/>
copy/b menu.bin+game1.bin+game2.bin+... multigame.gba
<br/>
(of course every rom has to be 512kb in size)
<br/>
<br/>
And the menu code must only jump to the code of a game with something like "b 0x0800xx0000" to execute a game when is selected.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
