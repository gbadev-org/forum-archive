    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody,
<br/>
<br/>
I needed a break from compo work (will it never end?! ;) So I pulled this old <a class="postlink" href="http://www.thingker.com" target="_blank">ThingPONG project</a> off the shelf, cleaned it up, and added it to my site.
<br/>
<br/>
Why bother playing a stupid pong clone? Here are its dubious selling points:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Play vs. linkcable or vs. a fairly smart AI.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Novel scoring with "things" rather than points (uh... it's hard to explain, easy to understand once you play.)
<br/>
<br/>
3. Your paddle can move in 2-dimensions rather than one, and english works both ways (so you can charge the net, fade away, etc.)
<br/>
<br/>
4. Source code is available for all to abuse.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you see any bugs. Unfortunately, it doesn't have any music, so I recommend humming the Three Amigos song "My Little Buttercup" or possibly the underwater chiptune from the original NES Mario Bros.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can go ahead and use the humming source, but please note that I cannot be held responsible for any damage it might do to your PC, Gameboy, or social life. Use of it is entirely at your OWN RISK.
