As Gba programming is becoming increasingly popular, the forum seems to be getting flooded with these types of questions and it would make the forum a lot cleaner if it wasn't cluttered with millions of trivial posts.
<br/>
<br/>
I agree that people should read the previous posts before posting these types of questions but they don't.
<br/>
<br/>
So if you could please make some 'STICKY' posts (this may require a new phpBB hack but a lot of other forums have them) and do some 'spring cleaning', the forums would be easier for everyone (amateurs and experts).<br/>_________________<br/>---------------------------------------------------

<br/>
<br/>
Q. I'm new, where should I start.
<br/>
<br/>
A. Start by learning a programming language of your choice.  C and C++ and portable and good to start with.  Make some *text based non-gba* programs first to get the hang of the langauge and programming in general.  This way you won't create a borken program due to something you don't know about the gba.  *Next*, read the hardware details about what the gba can do, *then* start writing programs for it.  You'll know you are creating really nice code when you can get it to run in a text based program *and* on the gba.  I suggest the curses API for making really nice looking text programs.  Again, before you start making really nice looking text programs, make some basic ones that use only the standard library.

    <h4>#4674 - sgeos - Sun Apr 06, 2003 8:46 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lord Graga uses complicated save/load functions.  These are mine:
<br/>
<br/>
void save(unsigned char *data, int length, int offset)
<br/>
{
<br/>
  int ctr;
<br/>
<br/>
  for (ctr = 0; ctr &lt; length; ctr++)
<br/>
    *(unsigned char *)(0x0E000000 + offset + ctr) = data[ctr];
<br/>
}
<br/>
<br/>
void load(unsigned char *data, int length, int offset)
<br/>
{
<br/>
  int ctr;
<br/>
<br/>
  for (ctr = 0; ctr &lt; length; ctr++)
<br/>
    data[ctr] = *(unsigned char *)(0x0E000000 + offset + ctr);
<br/>
}
<br/>
<br/>
Usage.  This ought to work, although I usually calculate sizeof myslef:
<br/>
  unsigned long data[32];
<br/>
<br/>
  save((unsigned char *)&amp;data[0], sizeof(data), 0);
<br/>
  load((unsigned char *)&amp;data[0], sizeof(data), 0);
<br/>
<br/>
I think the short answer for save load is- read from or write to 0x0E000000 one character at a time.

I just used an array and a for loop, not a struct or memcpy().  At any rate, whatever works.

-Video memory must be written 16 or 32 bits a time. (not 8bits)
<br/>
-In text mode, <span style="font-style: italic">Tiles</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Map</span> use the same address space. If you're both copying them in the same area, you'll overwrite your datas.

----Copy your Maps at position 31 and (and down)

-There's 1024 Tile's positions. (0-1023)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I humbly propose that a Novice (I am not a great fan of the term newbie) and a FAQ forum should be created. 
<br/>
<br/>
These two forums should be located in the ?News? portion of the forum index.  They would be the first forums folks would see. People who ask relatively basic questions in other forums should be kindly directed to the new forums.  No forum should be allowed with the title ?Please help?, or ?Newbie question?? or titles along these lines.
<br/>
<br/>
I would eventually like to see various FAQs, each one dealing with specific areas of the GBA (i.e. development enviornment, graphics, sounds, etc).
<br/>
<br/>
Note to self (and others): should help/contribute to such cause? perhaps we should use Tepples' FAQ as a baseline.

<br/>
I hope the FAQ proves helpful.
<br/>
<br/>
But if the beginner forum takes off, the FAQ will get pushed down. I'd suggest making it sticky.
<br/>
<br/>
And because there are now two documents called "FAQ" on forum.gbadev.org (the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/faq.php" target="_blank">phpBB FAQ</a> and my FAQ), and beginners may get confused wondering why there aren't any gbadev specific questions in the document linked to at the top as "FAQ", I guess it'd be useful to insert a link to my FAQ post in the site's phpBB FAQ page.
<br/>
<br/>
To sgeos: Step 1 of my FAQ seems to imply that if you've been coding for three days, you should stick to text-based programs and bring up issues in forums dedicated to text-based programs. (edit: comp.lang.c FAQ link added.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
