    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, the deal is I have to make a project, but has to be within our carrer profile...
<br/>
<br/>
I think of this, a CD with all of your homebrew games (first though was to burn GBA cartridges, but the financial analysis was very bad, so I need something cheaper...
<br/>
<br/>
this is when you come in...I need permission from you guys to put your homebrew games in my CD(giving you some credit, of course)
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for your help...
<br/>
<br/>
I need the URL for download the game, and your entire name for credits..ah and if you can make a little guide and send me some pics of your games, thaty would be great!
<br/>
<br/>
bye, for now<br/>_________________<br/>All human wisdom is summed up in these two words, - 'Wait and hope"

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My tone demo, scale rotate demo, and sgedit can all be thrown on your CD.  Nothing fancy.  They can all be found in the gbadev archives (probably under "sgeos" or "Brendan Sechter").  I have a "Santa Lights" game as well.  I believe it was distributed with the visoly carts, as I submitted it to their competition a while back.  It really sucks, but you can use it too.
<br/>
<br/>
I worked on "Elements of Darkness" and "Space Fortress Dendron".  I don't care if you put them on your CD, <span style="font-weight: bold">but other people were involved </span>in those projects.  <span style="font-weight: bold">You'll need their permission</span> as well if you want to put them on your CD.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, first of all, thank you for sharing your games-demos.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking in making a CD with all the homebrew GBA games I can get.
<br/>
<br/>
maybe you ask something like, "why don't use a flash linker and cartridges?", but the reason is because is has to be cheap, coz the more products I sell, more grade for my project.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I want payable demos or games. any game, any project you might have.
<br/>
<br/>
the due date...I guess...mmm...May 15...
<br/>
<br/>
so, we still have plenty of time...hope you can help me :D
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For one US dollar (which I won't bother to collect, but a CD would be cool) I give "ghost Leinad" permission to sell:
<br/>
<ul>my tone demo

my scale rotate demo

sgedit
<br/>
"Santa Lights"</ul>He can sell them from March 1, 2006 to February 28, 2007 provided he tells me how many CDs he sells.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">no, of course is not for a real sell, I need to justify my project economically and using cd's give me the chance :D
<br/>
<br/>
and even if the teacher tell us to sell it for real it will be for just a few hours, is not like I will make money with your games :D..even so, I don't think the teacher will ask for this...
<br/>
<br/>
so what do you say???<br/>_________________<br/>All human wisdom is summed up in these two words, - 'Wait and hope"

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you find any GBA program under GNU GPL or any other free software license, you already have the OK to distribute copies for a fee as long as you provide complete corresponding source code on the disc. TOD is such a program, and so are most of the rest of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/" target="_blank">my programs</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Watch out: some programs are free but come aggregated with unfree assets. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/lu/" target="_blank">Luminesweeper</a> can be free if you make a set of free skins. The same applies to a slideshow program built around Burton Radons' permissively licensed JPEG decoder.
<br/>
<br/>
And if you need to pad the disc a bit more, try emulators. As PocketNES is GPL[1], PocketNES aggregated with redistributable NES ROMs is also redistributable. You can raid the pdroms.de collection for NES ROMs with acceptable licenses.
<br/>
<br/>
[1] All of PocketNES except the saved state compression code is permissively licensed.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
I can upload the CD to the Internet at the end if is ok with you guys
