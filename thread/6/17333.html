    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Didn't see any board for site feedback, hope this is the correct place to post here.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the search feature of this version of PHPBB really sucks, and the entire board is blocked in robots.txt, so Google doesn't index it.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a better way to find stuff on this board than repeatedly asking questions that were answered several years ago?<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I also suggest adding a Google searh box at the top of the site for searching the forums. I find alot of forum software has really lame searching. For example on an SMF forum I was searching for some topics I knew existed but could not find them. I had to go through my post history to locate them and to my suprise the title contained the word I was using in my search. Why didn't it find them?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd also think about upgrading the forum before doing that. The latest phpbb3 puts new users into a moderation queue for the first n posts - that's helped a *lot* with the spam in the devkitPro forums. Now all the porn and random stockmarket scams don't make it to public viewing before being deleted.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
