    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone! (all 5 of you)
<br/>
<br/>
The GBADEV.ORG team (krom &amp; SimonB) just wanted to mention that the site is turning 15 years old today. Yay!
<br/>
<br/>
We have been planning sort of a come back for the past couple of years but other things have gotten in the way. Sorry about that heh! But this summer we have taken steps to move the site to a new server so that it can live on for another few years, and we promise to update it every now and then. Really!
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for stopping by and dont forget that the forum is still up and running if you need any help with developing for the GBA!
<br/>
<br/>
Here's to another 15 years!

I don't really do much game dev these days, but I do still love the GBA. And I've actually been on a programming binge this past week, working on my RPG's battle system. Got the menus all done, and basic attacks working. Still need to make lots of magic and item graphics/sound effects, status ailments, and victory/levelup sequence. Pretty generic stuff, but better than not making anything at all.

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

For some reason there's been a small resurge of interest in Anguna recently, so I've actually been doing a little bit of GBA programming again. Fun stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for keeping the site alive, Simon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I recently restarted work an old GBA game I that started working on a few years ago, just as an exercise. It's a faithful conversion of an old 16 bit platform game.
<br/>
<br/>
It's about 90% finished and I'll be releasing the source code.
<br/>
<br/>
Some of it's features are: 2d multi-layered maps, scrolling, bullets, enemies, real-time map changes, sound, title sequence, high score table and score saving.
<br/>
<br/>
I also have a level editor made with VB.Net and the source code for that will be released as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As for phpBB2 security issues, I'm pretty sure there's a migration tool towards 3.x ...

Speaking of GBA, maybe someone would find interesting that I released the library I wrote when coding Waimanu Grinding Blocks Adventure, it's <a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/sverx/GBAdv" target="_blank">here</a> on my github. Provides a bit of abstraction over libgba making it less hard to chew :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://bit.ly/yiQrz9" target="_blank">libXM7</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://bit.ly/yJwcOo" target="_blank">NDS programming tutorial (Italiano)</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://disjointedstudio.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Waimanu DS / GBA</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://adshomebrewersdiary.blogspot.com" target="_blank">A DS Homebrewer's Diary</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
