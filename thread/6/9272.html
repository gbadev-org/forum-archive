It is as good as or better than Lumines in the gameplay dept. imo (Gleam has specials), has great music, and skinned levels. Comments would be greatly appreciated.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Please take the following comments as constructive criticism.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Size efficiency issues</span>
<br/>
17.6 MB compressed, 30 MB uncompressed? Ouch. I opened the .gba file with a wav editor (18157 Hz) and heard the game music. Everything from 678126 to 30704388 is uncompressed wave data. Couldn't you have used the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/gsm/" target="_blank">GSM Player</a> code for 5:1 compression? Or would that have taken too much CPU time?
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Control issues</span>
<br/>
Issue: High score entry does not account for people with no middle initial. At least Tetris (GB, NES) allows spaces in high score entry names.
<br/>
<br/>
Issue: No sound to tell that A and B in high score entry are autorepeated, which could cause premature entry of three identical letters. At least Tetris (GB) has such a sound.
<br/>
<br/>
Issue: A and B for rotate are autorepeated. They are not autorepeated in Tetris (NES/GB/SNES/N64/GBC/GBA/PS2/GCN/DS), Dr. Mario (NES/GB/SNES/N64/GBA), or That Other Game (PSP).
<br/>
<br/>
Issue: Autorepeat is too slow for Control Pad left and right. Tetris Blast (GB), Tetris Attack (SNES/GB/N64/GBC/GBA), and That Other Game (PSP) use a much faster autorepeat system (10-15 frame initial delay, then repeat every 2 frames).
<br/>
<br/>
Issue: L and R to move the piece as far as possible to the left or right don't always work.
<br/>
<br/>
Issue: No pause feature; instead, Start activates an item. You could have bound activate item to L+R or B+A.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Now some gameplay differences that may or may not be intentional</span>
<br/>
Issue: Not all six four-colored squares are present. Specifically, there are no pieces with three of one color and one of the other.

The behavior in That Other Game (PSP) is to evaluate each column only once as the sweeper enters it. Reminds me of Flare (for Java platform).

These were due to limitations in my audio library -- I would improve these things if I weren't moving on from this project.

Your issues with high score entries didn't really bother me (hence why it is how it is). You can back up characters with the B button before committing your entry (having space character would be nice though, I think I can add that easily, i'll try to do that today).
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose that left and right block movement is a little too slow. I'll speed this up if I do a rebuild for the other problem you mentioned -- the fact that two block types are missing. I don't know how I overlooked this (thanks for pointing this out) :-) I will check the code when I get home, fix that bug and increase the block horz. motion thing, rebuild and repost the rom.
<br/>
<br/>
The strange wiper behavior thing you described is intentional. The wiper/deletion rules I set are actually maintained by this use case -- Lumines makes an exception to it's own gameplay rules imo for this case to make things easier on the player. if squares are part of a larger "to be deleted" group in Gleam, and the wiper has passed them, they will be deleted. the player is expected to be mindful of wiper position in this one case or get burned.

Lumines generates each of the four blocks independently. In effect, this means the checker appears 1/8 of the time, the half-and-half 1/4, each 3-and-1 1/4, and each solid 1/16.

Having to watch the timeline is true of Lumines as well, as if you make a square with the sweeper on its <span style="font-style: italic">left</span> half, you get a half-delete. (Luminesweeper has the same behavior since mid-July 2005.) However, cascades under this rule won't cause a half-delete except in some rare cases involving the special blocks.

The lack of pausing and the slow horizontal movement kept me from getting into a groove to the point where I could properly evaluate the intentional differences in behavior, such as the powerup system. But if I'm being harsh, imagine what Nintendo lot check would have said. I wish you luck with the next version.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It has improved, but the autorepeat on rotation keys still throws me off.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I can see that scoring is based on the <span style="font-style: italic">width</span> of a contiguous combo minus one, times the number of raw blocks removed. (Unlike in Lumines, discontiguous combos don't count.) Were the monochrome and empty bonuses left out on purpose?
<br/>
<br/>
It's a bit too easy. For one thing, it seems to give out too many special blocks (Lumines gives approximately one per 32 tetriminos starting after the 75th), and for another, it didn't get fast before I got the "bad ending" with score 8337. By the way, what affects the ending I get?
<br/>
<br/>
It stops after each level, which is jarring. Lumines fades the background out, fades the playfield to the new tileset, and fades the new background in.
<br/>
<br/>
"Sped up motion": The best way to do this is to make the delay between the first two motions (the "autorepeat delay") comparatively large (e.g. 12 frames) and then the subsequent delay between motions (the "autorepeat period") smaller.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">like i said tepples, my goal was not to clone every little aspect of lumines' gameplay, although clearly i wanted it to be similar (in other words, feel similar -- i'm not concerned with how often Lumines gives people specials -- Gleam isn't Lumines). i know you spent a lot of effort on this for your lumines clone, and that's great. i am very happy with the gameplay in gleam, and feel that i pulled off what i wanted to asthetically.
<br/>
<br/>
i see that you posted in my digg post's comments that your version is a more accurate clone, and despite submitting gleam to gbadev.org more than once, it never made the main page (i can't help but wonder why). that combined with the fact that you for the most part only criticized my project (i appreciate constructive criticism, but you really had next to nothing positive to say about it in the least which makes me think you must be offended by it's mere existence alongside luminesweeper or something).
<br/>
<br/>
that said, i did take some shortcuts when implementing gleam, such as using hardware for fades/etc., this is why the fading in and out of levels happens as it does.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by AkumaATR on Thu Apr 27, 2006 6:39 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

"Gleam is not the only Lumines clone on the GBA. Luminesweeper is more faithful to the PSP game in look and feel, and it's much smaller (ca. 4 MB) because it uses audio compression on its music. If you don't like the example skins that come with it, there's a skin editor. There's even a version that runs on the inexpensive GBA Movie Player. And when you get tired of Lumines, you can switch it to Minesweeper mode (hence the name)."

EDIT: It will run in GBA mode. In DS mode, when it switches to GBA, the logo is wrong in the header. You should correct that for maximum compatibility

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's the thing. I was actually not so upset that Tepples promoted his work the way he did. I was actually just upset that in his sea of criticisms (about how my game doesn't play exactly like Lumines, even though I stated more than once that I wasn't trying to clone the gameplay of Lumines down to the atomic level, and was more focused on presentation, for ex.) he couldn't stomach at least one compliment. When some people outside of the scene respond like this, it's easy to chalk up as someone unappreciative/demanding. It's harder when it comes from someone within the scene -- Tepples more than anyone would know that a project like this can take a lot of time (I wrote all of the tools I used to make Gleam minus the compiler/toolchain, even down to the interrupts processing level -- so it did take me quite some time). I realize that Tepples has been in the scene a long time, I guess that's why I took it so personally (a "good job" in some form or fashion would have been nice, or at least a simple nod in my direction). Also, I am less than a state away; there aren't exactly tons of people in the homebrew scene -- he's someone I might have the opportunity to work with in the future, etc. I think Gleam is a damn fine project, not just "good for a first try." :-)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by AkumaATR on Sun Apr 30, 2006 4:15 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

Wow, that sounds like it might be causing the issue that people are having running it on linkers (I am clueless in regards to this as I only have a flash cart). Sadly, I don't really know what you mean by "the logo is wrong" in the header. Can you elaborate so that I can look into fixing this? The final stage of my build process was to run:
<br/>
<br/>
arm-elf-objcopy -O binary $(PROJECT).elf $(PROJECT).gba
<br/>
<br/>
Did I miss some rom-fixing/prepping step or something?
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the typical type of Makefile I used for most of my projects:

If it's not a Lumines clone, then why did the sites with mega-PageRank portray it as one?

I wish I could have thought of a compliment, but when the play control doesn't match the standards set by contemporary puzzle games for Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, and Sony PSP, it's difficult to think of one. In fact, one of the reasons I developed Tetanus On Drugs (a clone of Mute Fantasies' Tetripz) was the poor play control in Tetripz. Should I make a Very Simple Demo(tm) with source code as to what a modern tris-type game's control should feel like? I'm willing to work with you on this issue.

I understand how much work it can be. I wrote everything in Luminesweeper except devkitARM and Toast.

We have a backlog of stuff to post on the site. We are just 2 people, both of whom are working time and a half if not more. Unfortunately this means we cant post stuff as they are submitted. It is rather unfortunate but I can assure you that there is no evil plot in force here and your game will be mentioned on the main page as soon as krom is back. Whenever I have some time to spare I try to work on the backend and let krom do the main page updates, but krom hasnt been answering his phone in 2 weeks so im not really sure when this will be.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
