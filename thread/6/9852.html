    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA section is still here; it's everything but the "Nintendo DS" category. The lack of news comes from the fact that people have lately tended to see the DS as a juicier target.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i dont the gba think its aall dead - i got my uni to use the game boy advance. next semester there will be one, possibly two, classes that utilize gba, vba, devkitpro -- i guess that would be one of the 'tertiary' facilitations for gba (althought it probably has been done before)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
