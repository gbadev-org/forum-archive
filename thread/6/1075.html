<span style="font-weight: bold">MIDI plug-in for Pogoshell</span>
<br/>
Just released a MIDI playing plug-in for Pogoshell. I'm calling it V0.8 as it still needs some polishing.

It's quite hard to show a screen shot of a sound only plug-in!

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Makebook V4.5</span>
<br/>
The other recent item is that Makebook V4.5 now accepts text files in Hebrew for making books with. This was challenging as it is right to left and has combining characters to deal with (as many as three glyphs on top of each other). It also has an 'Exit to Pogoshell' function. If you haven't met Makebook before; it allows you to turn text files and bitmaps into GBA (or GB) books using any language from English to Korean, both types of Chinese, and Japanese. There are three unicode fonts which can be examined and modified with the built-in font editor. Book texts can be marked up with chapter marks and hyperlinks. The ROM can also contain multiple books.
<br/>
<br/>
To be upfront about it, Makebook *can* be registered for further features, but there are no time, language or length limits on books made with the downloadable version.
