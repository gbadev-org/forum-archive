<br/>
<br/>
I've decided to start the new year with a little help and support for the homebrew developers in our fantastic community. A chance for us to give back to the many homebrew developers make the homebrew for our enjoyment!
<br/>
<br/>
Support the community and the developers by donating to the people who make a impact, improve and encourage our community to grow.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">All money goes towards the developer via Paypal.</span>

<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Donations made using the ChipIN buttons are listed and will be shown publically.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I would love to offer prizes to people whom donate towards the developers in our community. I'm going to email around but if anyone is willing to donate prizes, that would be greatly appreciated.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://MrShlee.com/" target="_blank">MrShlee.com</a>

<br/>
I'm just curious, because I have a donate button on my webpage since years and received four donations. It seems to me that either my tools are cr*p or most users simply don't want to express their appreciation via a paypal button. I tend to the latter though ;)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Peter on Sat Dec 30, 2006 12:45 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I heaps can't make that any simpler. People were asking if I got a "slice" or if money was directed via me as a "middleman".. the answer is no.

This seems to be a fairly.. too familiar opinion of people in the community. A disrespectful view at donations and developer support. Yes its been done before yes its nothing special.. yes I simply placed the donations onto a single page to make it look special..
<br/>
<br/>
Support the developers if you feel the urge.. if you don't feel like donating.. <span style="font-weight: bold">DON'T</span> but the idea of complaining because others may is counter-productive.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The donations so far have been great. keep it up :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://MrShlee.com/" target="_blank">MrShlee.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">WinterMute, It should just read "All donations are passed along 100% minus paypal fees".. it doesn't need to say anyones name.
<br/>
<br/>
Peter, I think it might depend on your target group.  Many people have donated for DS projects and there is no reason to discourage it.  As usual, each persons outcome may vary.
<br/>
<br/>
I also think we need to encourage all DS developers to have a donate button (if they can) on their blogs/sites.  Sure, they may never get a donation, but if someone would like to donate it is available.
<br/>
<br/>
Mrshlee, like I said, I think the idea is great.  But the page you have now seems like the same people that are mentioned in every "donation" thread started.  And not to take away from them, they have done a lot of hard work and deserve every penny they receive.  I'd just like to see names "outside the core group" like Tassu, JimmyL, Mollusk/PAlib, Miqualke, and should I even metioned.. (dun, dun, dahhhhh &lt;scary music&gt;) DarkFader, etc..
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: and if you are accepting the donations on behalf of them, and then sending it to them, that is just a waste of PayPal fees.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just putting a donation button on your page will get the very occasional donation. I've found that drawing people's attention to the fact that there's a donation button usually increases the chances slightly and donation drives such as this one tends to gain quite a bit more. Nothing earth shattering or worth quitting your day job over but enough to get a bit of motivation going again.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Your condescending response makes me ask.. Did the people on that page directly contact you asking you to add them to that page?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what your problem is.. I'm just asking questions and I'm sure I'm not the only person that has them.  Do I need to bold my "nice idea" comment?  Did you not see the "maybe it's just my lack of understanding".. which is obviously the case..  Do I need to bold that as well?

Opinions are welcome but no point being counter productive.

Idea: have a page listing every known developer with the description of the releases.. this way people can donate whatever amount they wish to whomever they wish.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://MrShlee.com/" target="_blank">MrShlee.com</a>

I was just asking a simple question.  Hence the "my lack of understanding".. in otherwords.. I didn't understand.. that's why I ask questions.  I'm all for the idea and I think it's great.  I just had a question, so I asked..
<br/>
<br/>
Just like when I comment on homebrew.  I'm just trying to give feedback from another point of view that the dever may not have.
