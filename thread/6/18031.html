I've just released a new version of dslink and a new exploit that gets code running in DSi mode. There are still some people around getting into DS and even GBA homebrew although obviously it's nowhere near as popular as 3DS currently. It does have the advantage of being much cheaper to get into than the new consoles though :)
<br/>
<br/>
Essentially I've put together a DS application that installs dslink into the unused space on the wifi flash chip (which stores the firmware on DS) and created some save game exploits for DS/DSi hybrid games which boot dslink in DSi mode. Once that's running you can transfer homebrew to the console over wifi.
