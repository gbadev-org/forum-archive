<br/>
<br/>
here is a little demo from my current project. I still coding on it, and there is a lot to do.

Is there meant to be anything at the end of the green mesh, when you can see the space?
<br/>
<br/>
Also: It's a horiztonally scrolling space themed shoot em up.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cool.  I really like the graphical look and feel.  
<br/>
<br/>
The ship could move a little faster (the fast moving enemy ships wiped me out repeatedly as it was hard to dodge fast enough).   
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the hit detection or bounding boxes seem slightly funny...sometimes it looks almost like a bullet is going through me, and I'm fine.  Other times, I blow up when I thought I had avoided the object.  
<br/>
<br/>
But overall, a great start!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ha...that's exactly what I thought.  I just didn't say it because after doing so badly on the "hunt" game that was demo'd a couple days ago, I was embarrased at my lack of skills.
<br/>
<br/>
....you know, SKILLS!  Like computer hacking skills, bow hunting skills.....
<br/>
<br/>
Point is, I agree, it's a bit too hard.  It took me quite a few tries to get past those initial waves of enemies.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks.

How are you designing and laying out the levels, in particular the enemy formations?
<br/>
<br/>
I also have a shoot em up game, but it just features random enemies at the moment. I would love to put in some levels with set enemy attack patterns, but I haven't figured out an easy way to generate them yet.

The Enemies are stored in the same format like the Backgroud-Tile Graphics. The size of a Level-Map is currently 200 x 20 Tiles. I have 2 Layers for the Background-Graphics (BG &amp; Paralaxx) plus the Layer for the enemies. The enemies are stored as numbers in this layer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That is an ok way, but it requires a function for each enemy + flightpath doesn't it?
<br/>
<br/>
ie. 1 function to set up a red enemy flying straight across the screen, 1 to set up a red enemy flying in a sine wave, 1 to set up a blue enemy flying straight across the screen, 1 for a blue enemy in a sine wave pattern, etc etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping you would have the enemy placement, and the flight path seperated out, and make your level editor would allow you to place enemies, and give each one a flight path from a list of defined flight paths.
<br/>
<br/>
And also that your level editor was available for other people to use. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Your way is a lot easier to implement. the other way allows for more complex behaviour, but there is so much data involved that a program to nicely manage it all is really required.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Keldon:
<br/>
<br/>
I know you can have it seperated out, and that is exactly what I want.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to have to type in all the data for each level by hand, and then try to wade through it all it find some stuff in the middle of a level when I want to change it around.
<br/>
<br/>
Technically it is quite easy to do, practically, dealing with the large amounts of data required to specify all the attack patterns for multiple levels is a pain unless you have some nice level editor to help manage it.
<br/>
<br/>
That is why I was asking if Alexge had a level editor that supported all of that functionality. I'd really like one, but I haven't made one, or been able to find one anywhere on the net.
