    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey,
<br/>
<br/>
 So I've been working on a 2d tile level editor for my rpg gba game. I'm trying to make it generic enough to be used in more than one type of game. The editor isn't a full 'game maker' where you define the full game inside the editor and launch a embeded engine. Basically it just lets you define boards/tilesets/items export them for what ever engine you want. Basically its a mix between and IDE and a paint program. I plan on creating a plugin api to allow developers to write plugins for their specific engine.
<br/>
<br/>
 I am intrested in working with someone who has a 'good' game that needs a level editor. I would be willing to change my product to intergrate with their workflow. It would benifit us both.

<br/>
PS.
<br/>
 I plan on integrating this product with a 3d level builder i worked on in the past for some DS projects I have in mind.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think the world needs another tile/map editor, but I know it needs a Level Editor!
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know of any free powerful level editor for tile based games. Most editors are map editors, which are not really helpful if you want to create a game, because a game has more elements than a scrolling background.
<br/>
<br/>
MapEd from Nessie is a nice map editor, it's very easy to use but still pretty feature rich. It just lacks of support to add custom entities / game-objects, but that's probably because it's called MapEd instead of LevelEd.
<br/>
<br/>
If your level-editor comes with the features found in MapEd and some from Mappy (e.g. tile-animations), plus support to place custom entities / game-objects, walk/control-paths etc in the level, it would be probably the most useful tool on the web. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A simple suggestion, based on my good/bad experiences with tools:
<br/>
<br/>
If you make it use text files for it's data files (saving in-progress maps, etc), then it opens tons of flexibility for people who want to use it, but would need to adapt it to their game.
<br/>
<br/>
I've used so many level/map editors that save things in one format, and can export to text, which is just rather annoying -- I'd much rather have my in-progress files be text, which means I can write a script to edit tedious parts of my maps.  I can check in the text files to version control, and be able to easily diff them by looking when I make changes.  I can have my build system do the conversion from map-editor format to the format necessary by my game. 
<br/>
<br/>
All of those things are difficult if things are saved in a binary format while being worked on.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, enough ranting.  You get the idea.  Text is everything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#114087 - rodif - Wed Jan 03, 2007 8:58 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">gauauu: Thanks for the suggestion, currently the files are stored as xml. I also hate dealing with binary so that also was a requirment of mine. 
<br/>
<br/>
The save format will always be in xml, currently i am using a java serilization library <a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org/," target="_blank">http://xstream.codehaus.org/,</a> to save my object model. It has served all of my needs so far but if it ever fails i'll just go to simple sax parsing.  Since the format is generated by this library sometimes its hard to follow but i have on many occasions manual edited the xml and it works nice. 
<br/>
<br/>
Along the same lines of source control and concurrent editing, i break my save files up into separate files, the idea being more than one artist can work on the game w/out having to worry about overwriting changes. Also at some point i thought it would be cool to intergrate some source control features into the IDE.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Depending on how the data is structured into XML, it could be a lot slower than a binary loader. And once the level gets bigger, it's also tricky to navigate through the XML with a text-editor, so it has only little advantage over the binary format in sense of human readability. I think the primary format should be binary. If it can export XML too, fine.

I really doubt that more than one level designer will work on the same level for a 2d tile-based game. Having the level split into 10 different files, it makes it even harder to work with:

Exactly, currently each level is in a different file which lives inside of a project. The project will have multiple levels, tilesets and metatdata for the game as a whole.

Currently the xml file will be the default output from the xstream library, it serves as a simple way to do my save/load. I might change the xml serialization in the future. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to process the data manually, you will be able to export the data by traversing the Java Object Model and spit out any text/binary you want. Which will be exposed thru a plugin or by a simple template system using a scripting language. These will be able to be invoked from a commandline.

This seems more of an issue with poor code than xml parsing. Even if you had 30k tiles, using an xml library to parse 30k nodes shouldn't take 45 seconds. Basically i'm not too concenred with load time right now but if it becomes a serious problem then i'll adress it.

This could be anything.  Was it swapping out to virtual memory?  How was it loading the stage?
<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, if you want something with a binary save format, why not use any of the good map editors that already exist?  The world doesn't need another map editor with yet another proprietary binary format (most likely poorly documented).
<br/>
<br/>
XML is implicitly portable, not that I expect the level designers to work on different OSs, although I could see the *files* used on different OSs once you start batch processing them.

A well thought out structure will probably be better than whatever the xstream default is.  This isn't the most important feature.  If it's XML, it can be worked with.  It can even be converted into different (XML) documents with [url="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt"]XSLT[/url].  I think an XML based level editor is very exciting.  (poweruplist.xsl =)

I couldn't handle it.   Development tools (which include map makers) shouldn't, in my opinion, ever have to run fullscreen....I want my map maker to be a standard windowed gui app, with standard menus/etc.  The learning curve of a new style of interface, combined with with the hassles of going fullscreen, make it entirely unworth it for me.

Even if your screen is 640x480 pixels? What about 256x192 pixels, that is, development tools that run directly on the target hardware?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I imagine his post assumes a decent resolution, e.g., at least 800x600. Having personally developed <a class="postlink" href="http://hypernova.amarok-shadow.com/programs.php?id=hom" target="_blank">a level editor</a> for a game, I know that by simply implementing zooming and scrolling well, you can use it at just about any screen size. Maybe for 640x480 you'd need to start zooming out to like 50% and hacking away status bars and menus to fit it all on, but I think pretty much every PC now runs at least 800x600, and the DS's lack of any sort of OS would likely mean rewriting most of your GUI anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
(FYI, I realize the editor shown there is not friendly to small resolutions, having the tile selector built in, no zoom option, and hacky scrollbars. This is a really old version and the next fixes all of these issues; it can be trimmed to as little as a map, title bar, menu bar, and status bar, and I'll probably add options to disable the status and possibly menu bars in the future.)
<br/>
<br/>
Somewhat off topic, just how common are editors running on the target system? The DS and Wii would be decent for this since they have a nice pointing device input system, but older consoles didn't. The only console game that I know used this was Zelda: OoT, in which the camera flybys when you first enter an area are defined using an in-game editor (debug version only :-(), and some debug text in Mario 64 hints at such a thing being used there, but that's it.

That's the point...I want the size of the editor to be adjustable, like every other normal window.  If I have 640x480, I will maximize the window.  If I do have a 1600x1200 monster (like I do), I don't want to waste all that space on my level editor.   That's the beauty of normal windowed apps...the user has control.  With a full screen app, it takes over all your real-estate whether you like it or not.  I don't even mind the option of a level editor with the OPTION of running fullscreen.  I just don't want it to HAVE to.   Non-game apps running in fullscreen feels like the days of DOS 6.22.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm ignoring the case of running it on a different platform, but that's ok, we're talking about normal dev tools.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If a program uses the Allegro library, changing its video mode it can be as easy as writing an allegro.cfg file. If I remember correctly, the syntax looks something like this:

Are you serious, or are you trying to troll me?  I think it should be obvious what I mean....you may disagree with me about my points, but the difference between a game and a tool used to make a game seem to be something that anyone with your technical and game-related knowledge would completely understand.

Yep, I kinda got the feeling the 'forcing full-screen' wasn't being well recieved. To be honest, I only coded it that way because I don't know windows API stuff (plus, I figured it would run slow, with multiple alpha blended layers etc). Much easier to just take over all the screen and do with as you will, mwhaaa haaa.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
