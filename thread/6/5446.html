    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm new here, so I wasn't sure where I should have posted this so apologize if this isn't the place.
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to show you   GBA Demo I did, with some guys at Blackhammer games..
<br/>
<br/>
All the art and animations were done by me. All the restrictions of the GBA was really new to me, and I have a very loose style, so that was the rough part..
<br/>
<br/>
The guys that programmed were new to GBA platform coding, so its alil stiff..
<br/>
<br/>
But I  wanted to show you guys cause you have an awesome community.
<br/>
and you're all an awesome creative force behind this dev scene.
<br/>
<br/>
so I hope you all enjoy
<br/>

another reason I'm posting is I would like to get involved in some more homebrew games.    I have alot of work ahead of me but I should have free time in a couple of months, and would love to jump in with a team and whip up something really cool!! :)
<br/>
<br/>
thats all for now..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It was a homebrew type game that we had hoped to get published,  never happened, and I had the rom for years...
<br/>
<br/>
I figured I might as well share all my hard work with you guys.
<br/>
<br/>
and dont let the credits fool you, Alloy is my character, and the demo was done basicly by two guys, Me and the programmer :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

not really, this was made about a year before alien homind.
<br/>
<br/>
Infact, I was hired to do some art, and some small sprites, because of this game,<span style="font-style: italic"> for</span> Alien hominid :)
