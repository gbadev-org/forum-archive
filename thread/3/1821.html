    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Japanese black GBA SP is black. It might also have Japanese lettering on the label on the back. Other than that, nothing, as far as I can see from checking. =)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The words "Game Boy" still appear in English, and the word "Nintendo" is still Japanese written in romaji, just like on the USA GBA.  There's no significant difference between the GBA BIOS (J) and the GBA BIOS (U).

Do you mean a "menu" used to select what game to play?  That menu is a program on your flash cart or on your Game Wallet, and it wouldn't change if you put the cart in a different model machine.  It's not like Neo-Geo games, which have both Japanese and English text inside that the game chooses based on the system's region.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I just confirmed with various owners of the Imported Japanese GBA SP in black, that the unit is all the same. For those of you who buy on eBay beware that sometimes sellers actually spray paint different electronics black to increase the value, especially computer stuff! So always ask them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
