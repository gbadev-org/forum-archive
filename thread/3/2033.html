    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I just got into this GBA mod world.
<br/>
I just bought my Gameboy SP. It's really interesting that we can do a lot of thing with this little gadget.
<br/>
I just wonder if GBSP can read text file(*.txt *.doc....) if yes, what items do I need for? It will be really cool that I can read some books on my GBSP. (^_^)
<br/>
Since my motherboard is legacy free(no parallel port), I have to buy the flash memory thing in USB. Can you guys recommand one? (EzFlash, flash2advance...)
<br/>
<br/>
Thx!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I ought to make a note about PogoShell compatibility in the FAQ.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Else, just get the cheapest card and use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">Bookreader</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also, I saw on the site that we can emulate Gameboy, Gameboy color, and old nintendo games. Does Flash2Advance can play the backup roms or emulate those roms better than EZF-Advance? I heard that Pogoshell can run in EZF-Advance too. Some people recommand EZF-Advance more than Flash2Advance..I'm really confused... 
<br/>
How about the size? 128mb? 256mb? I just want to put some Text files and 3~5 games(GBA or GBC)
<br/>
Sorry for too much question~</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, the F2A and EZF are just storage. It's PogoShell's included applications that actually do the NES emulation, etc. And no, Game Boy emulation in software is nowhere near mature; GBC emulation doesn't even work yet. (If you're willing to buy extra hardware, you can use the GB Bridge, but I've never tried putting GBC and GBA ROMs on one cart.)

Unless PogoShell has been updated since <a class="postlink" href="http://www.obsession.se/pocket/" target="_blank">the author's page</a> was updated, the 'ezflash.sub' file doesn't work right.

There are 8 Mbits (cart size units) in one MByte (PC file size units). Add up the size in KBytes of all text, NES, and GBA games you want on the cart at the same time, add about 128 KB for PogoShell plus the directory plus the included emulators, multiply by 8 bits in a byte, and you have the minimum cart size you want.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All in all, I'm pretty happy with my Flash 2 Advance 256mbits flash card, running pogoshell. Pogoshell alone is worth buying Flash 2 advance instead of  other brands. 
<br/>
<br/>
I find that 128bits is too small, but it all depend on your usage of it.
<br/>
<br/>
I both have the Usb cable and parallel port, i only use the parallel one. I was able to make the usb work, but it's harder. But by now, the drivers might be working fine.<br/>_________________<br/>-Inside every large program is a small program struggling to get out. (Hoare's Law of Large Programs)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thank you for replies guys!
<br/>
one more question. What is realtime clock and what is the use for?
<br/>
<br/>
ezf advance:
<br/>
Realtime clock and calendar built-in, perfect for Pokemon and future RTC compatible games, and also ideal for third-party PDA-like applications.
<br/>
<br/>
Do we really need these features to run some games,applz and pogoshell?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
