    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered a 256 flash advance extreme cart from game gizmo and got the 256 f2a cart.  I too am wondering what the differences are.  I have a Flash Advance Extreme Usb linker and ive found that it doesnt have intelligent save handling (that could be a lot of things though)  and I have also found that certain 'games' have trouble retaining save information even though the f2a is supposed to have eeprom and sram saving (patchless - crashless)  The f2a cart is also recognized as a turbo advance cart (maybe the root of my problem)  uhhh.... rambling... looking for real specs on the two carts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
