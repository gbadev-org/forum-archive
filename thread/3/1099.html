    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm very new to these things and I was wondering a couple of things. I know all of these adapters can play movies, mp3s, picture viewers, and one of them can even surf the internet, but can any of these be used to play games??? I was planning on getting an Mp3 player + 512mb Flash Cart = $300+ but it's out of the question on my budget also I heard that the Flash Carts don't work on the new SP systems. Is it possible to load some roms ( For Back-up Purposes and for the convenience of lugging around a case of gba games everywhere) so I can play them on my SP system??? I know that these weren't made to become Flash Carts but maybe someone out there will make a program or something that will enable us to do that? Also does anyone know exactly when these products will be launched? THX</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just made a quick look at the descriptions of each of those devices, and they all use a proprietary format.  I think this is the problem you're referring to.  None of these are designed to store or play GBA roms, and because of their proprietary format, I wouldn't expect any software workarounds anytime soon.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm designing an adapter like the am3, but without the proprietery format, so it would only play GBA applications.  Hopefully, it will be useful for program/game development, but also compatible to play a backup game stored on a SmartMedia card.
<br/>
<br/>
On the downside, it wouldn't support the mp3 and video playback that these other devices do.  At least not at first...  Any GBA software developed that would enable these media types should be fully compatible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
