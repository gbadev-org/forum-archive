    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone know if it would be possible to put a GBA-SP screen (with included lighting) into a GBA? I don't know alot about the internals, but I figured someone here probably would. I'd probably mount a dual_led+clear_button thing where the power light goes for the button. (probably enlarging the opening a bit first, of course.)
<br/>
<br/>
And before anyone suggests 
<br/>
- an Afterburner, first, they're hard to find anymore, and second, I've heard of numerous problems they have.
<br/>
- getting a SBA-SP, I have trouble using them, they hurt my hands and are harder to use. And the shoulder buttons are tiny. And apparently some games/hardware don't work on it. (For the issues other than compatability, my brother has one, I've tried it.)
<br/>
<br/>
Couple more things - (1) if I were to do this, and I wanted to use a Division-6 stealth chip with it, would I use a GBA Stealth v4 hooked to the new button instead of select, or (more likely) a Stealth Dimmer SP? and (2) if it is doable, anyone have a fried/mangled/whatever GBA SP with a good lcd/light for cheap?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried to do a LED lighting for the normal GBA screen, it's just BAD, don't do it, it's wasting time ... Maybe it would work though when adding other components, like a transreflective foil over the display like the afterburner does, or whatever....
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm also interested in having a GBA SP Display in the GBA, it would be so much better, as I don't really like the SP's handling ...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">have you tryed the gameboy micro? the GBA SP effectively suck for the controls and is not that small, the old GBA is too big and it either has a poor screen or an afterburner draining battery...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">as the original gba came out, there was an "afterburner set" sold on some sites, as well as instructions how to build your own. you might want to check it out. :^)
<br/>
i'm a douche for posting this, sorry. ;^p</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by silent_code on Thu May 08, 2008 12:17 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeh I know of the GBA Afterburner..
<br/>
<br/>
I quite like the GBA's Design to handle..
<br/>
<br/>
better than SP and better than Micro
<br/>
<br/>
of course the Micro might be better to carry-every-where
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I just ordered a just GBA with Afterburner :)
<br/>
<br/>
I don't care too much about battery life, if I think about the normal GBA with an enormous battery life (with sanyo eneloop cells at least :-) )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you require access to the Game Link port? Do you require the ability to play Game Boy and Game Boy Color Game Paks?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
