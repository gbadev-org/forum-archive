    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I did a little reasearch on both the PocketPix and am3 SmartMedia Player.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PocketPix:
<br/>
<br/>
Some sources said the PocketPix plays video at 10fps and others said 15fps.  It was about 50/50, so I'm not sure which is true.  15 should be plenty for most video.  I would be warry if it is only 10 though.
<br/>
<br/>
The fact that it comes with a codec is very cool.  Being able to convert videos that you already own is very important.  However, the PocketPix supports digital rights management.  This might restrict the codec to work with a very limited portion of video files.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
am3 SmartMedia Player:
<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't come with a codec, so the video possibilities would be limited to those released by am3.   But not necessarily on their media...
<br/>
<br/>
You will be able to buy CD-ROMs with am3 video files on them.  This leads me to believe that though there are am3 Smart Media cards available, the unit is not limited to these cards and can also use commercial SmartMedia.  This is good, since you can get a 128mb SmartMedia card for around $30 on sale.  That's 100min.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, there will be some sort of SmartMedia adapter for GBA rom files.  So one question to ask is "are there any GBA video codecs out there?"  Then people could convert ANY video files to GBA roms and run them on a GBA flash cart or on some SmartMedia adapter.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
