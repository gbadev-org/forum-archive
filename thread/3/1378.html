    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi.  I don't post here much, as I am not that great of a programmer, and I don't really have a lot to say that would sound halfways intelligent.  But I was really hoping that one of you more knowledgeable people could help me out with something.
<br/>
<br/>
I dropped my GBA the other day, and didn't cause any visible damage.  The screen is clear, and there are no cracks visible.  However, when I went to play a game on it, I wasn't getting a good picture.  I was getting faint signs of life from the screen, but not enough to see what was going on, or even something resembling a picture.
<br/>
<br/>
Thinking that it might have been a loose cable or something, I opened it up, and checked that the video cable was inserted properly.  I pushed it in as far as it would go, stuck in the batteries, and now I am not getting ANYTHING on the screen.  I am still getting all the sounds that would go along with the game, which leads me to believe that the CPU is still doing just fine, but I am not getting anything on the screen, not even some cryptical dust mites floating around like before.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, in any of your experiences, is there something that might cause an effect like this to happen, and if so, how might I go about fixing it?
<br/>
<br/>
I thank anyone who replies with even the slightest bit of help, as I am flat broke and really cannot afford another GBA in the foreseeable future.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks to anyone who might have helped.  I managed to fix it on my own.  My problem was that I didn't realize that there were clips on the video cable, and I didn't use them like I should have.  My GBA is alive and well now.  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
