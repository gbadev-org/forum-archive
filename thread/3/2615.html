    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've bought four different GBA link cables now, along with three chatboards, as I'd really like to try out AmPz's stuff (looks so cool!) and build myself some other projects too, but all these cables only have 5 pins, or have all pins but not wired up!  I've even tried rewiring the plugs but they never last long once cut apart.  It's driving me crazy.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have a good reliable source (to the UK) of ANYTHING that has a fully wired (all 6 pins are connected up!) cable on it?  A link cable? A peripheral? Anything really!

TIA, Ian.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought a few GB/GBC/GBA cables in Game a while back - the ones with two plugs on each end. Those had all the pins wired. They were 99p each though so I guess they were probably having a clear out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
