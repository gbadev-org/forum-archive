GBA games use a multiplexed bus at 3V, but I do not know how it works,

Who can tell me how to determine the data on AD0-AD15 is address or data? Thank you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<a class="postlink" href="http://www.ziegler.desaign.de/GBA/gba.htm" target="_blank">Reiner Ziegler's GBA page</a> will tell you everything you always wanted to know about the GBA's connectors[1].

Summary: When /CS goes low, latch the 24-bit address and read one 16-bit word from flash into the cart's output buffer. When /RD goes low, put the cart's output buffer on the bus, and when /RD goes back high, increment the latched address and read another 16-bit word from flash. Preferably, use 100ns flash.
