...<span style="font-weight: bold">search for "GBA Multiboot" on Google</span> and you'll find a small list of homebrew games you can run.  There is <span style="font-weight: bold">no way</span> to run GBA files larger than 256 KB on a GBAMP.  It is not possible.  If you have a slot-1 passthrough device you can use the GBAMP to launch most DS homebrew, but that functions entirely differently.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
