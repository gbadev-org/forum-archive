    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got one of those old GB link cables, the kind with two connectors on each end to support even the oldest versions of the GB. So I cut off one of the old connectors. It has all the pins _except_ pin 1 (VCC) Isn't there any way I could make the Ericsson Chatboard keyboard without it? I could hook up the positive end of the batteries to it, but that's pretty awkward and inconvenient. Any suggestions about physical changes to the connector? Nice job on the keyboard, by the way, AmPz!<br/>_________________<br/>(Works for me!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I actually used a cable w/o the VCC pin too, I found that is was possible to move one of the unused pins to pin position 1.
<br/>
It may or may not be possible on your cable.
<br/>
Even if it's possible, it's very tricky, you risk destroying the entire connector when you try to take it apart.
<br/>
<br/>
The keyboard needs a powersource, can't work w/o one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have no idea. The CHA-01 is the one compatible with (among others) T10 cellphones.
<br/>
<br/>
In sweden you can get CHA-01 from pretty much any cellphone shop. for example <a href="http://www.imperial.nu" target="_blank">www.imperial.nu</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
