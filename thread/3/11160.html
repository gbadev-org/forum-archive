    <h4>#102720 - Kirby - Sat Sep 16, 2006 12:13 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello. I'm making The Kirby Revolution, a Kirby GBA game, and I had a great idea. I wanted to add minigames to my game. I also had an E-Reader. One day I was sitting down... doing nothing... then it came.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you know my idea yet? If not, here's a clue: It involves a set a Kirby Training Cards I had printed out the day before.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes... You get it now? No? OK. Here it is:
<br/>
<br/>
Why not make a minigame called "Kirby Trading Card Center". It would have spaces for collecting Kirby cards (and maybe even adding a card game with your collected cards). How do you get cards? Simple. I sell my Kirby cards, but with special <span style="font-style: italic">dotcodes</span> on them. These dotcodes, when scanned, would connect to The Kirby Revolution, and activate the card in the game.
<br/>
<br/>
There are some problems with this though:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>First of all, I can't even do Multiboot with a normal GBA, so I would have NO idea how to connect to a GBA from an E-Reader!
<br/>
<br/>
Second, I've downloaded the code from the "Hello World" example from <a class="postlink" href="http://users.skynet.be/firefly/gba/" target="_blank">http://users.skynet.be/firefly/gba/</a>, and tried to compile it. It worked fine... until it got up to encode the actual data. Apparently, Firefly deleted the nedcenc.exe file, because I searched the whole web (well, actually, about five minutes worth) and couldn't find it.</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know how to solve these problems? (especially the second one). I've heard that you can download a special E-Reader version of VBA, but it can't even scan a .raw file!
<br/>
<br/>
Please help me with this. I think the card game is a good idea, and really would like to implement it.<br/>_________________<br/>Knock-knock.

These are some good reasons not to do it, another reason is that E-reader is no longer current (It doesn't work on NDS!)

You could publish some things for free on a web site just to see if it work<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's more of a personal value... selling them... as a last resort, and with a licence. I didn't actually plan on selling them.<br/>_________________<br/>Knock-knock.

Yes, it does. For a DS phat, just take it apart and remove that little stub. On the DS lite, just plug and play.<br/>_________________<br/>Hardware: <span style="font-style: italic">GBAMP v2</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Datel MML</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">NDS phat (Flashme v7)</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
