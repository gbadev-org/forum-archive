<br/>
<br/>
The question is: 
<br/>
Is there any chances to put GBA hardware into DMG case? Dont know really, is it a good idea, or i am absolutely crazy about it. I cant sleep well at night because of this question. Guyz, anybody know smthng about it?
<br/>
<br/>
I think that putting GBA into DMG case can solve the button-layout problem for musicans that use original GB, GBC &amp; GBP with such well-known programs like LSDJ, Nanoloop, MuddyGB, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I`ve got some experience in electronics when I was at college. Not a "guru", of course, but i know what to do with soldering-iron &amp; P-CAD software. Is it possible to "cut" original GBA pcb and paste it into DMG case with some dirty tricks? Or maybe I can trace a new one pcb in the form-factor of DMG and make it at home?
<br/>

Sorry for my bad english, i live in Eastern Europe and there is no GB-GBA community. *cry* ;(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
