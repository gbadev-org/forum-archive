    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody,
<br/>
I'm student from Poland, and I need help very quickly, I must use display from Nintendo DS in my final project on university, I need pinout and description of communication with the microcontroler, or full datasheet for this display. 
<br/>
I'm grateful to everyone for help.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by tom8051 on Tue Nov 21, 2006 11:08 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

this guy was able to read the display data from a gba. he says nintendo labeled all the pins on the board. you're gonna have to do all of the work yourself, as nobody has used a ds screen by itself. you'll need to take apart the ds and figure it out. you'll need at least 15 i/o pins to transfer color data, plus maybe 3 more for sync and clock. maybe a few shift registers could cut down your i/o to say 6 pins if they're fast enough.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think that ARM is enough fast (about 60Mhz) to send information on this LCD, end have a lot of I/O ports, probably I will be use external memory. Unfortunetly, I cannot use nothing more from NDS, only LCD display. I know this is big trouble, but I study IT for 5 year, and when I will be have this datasheet for LCD I can do this. I do something similar on (Hosiden HLM 8619 with AVR '8515). Sorry for my English. Please HELP!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I remember everything is labeled on the PCB. The signals are digital with pixelclock, and the timing (i've heard but not sure) is the same as NTSC.
