    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I just want to say that having someone beat me to buying that Dev kit, was a real blow!.
<br/>
<br/>
I have decieded that I will find another Intelligent Systems Dev kit for sale withing 4 weeks! One thing is sure that there is another of those GB Advance Dev kits for sale in the UK,Europe or elsewhere right now. And my search is on for that Hardware. If you know of one for sale or for loan, please send me pm.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason I wanted this kit, is because I want to release a GB Advance game this year which will be something special and really show what the GB Ad is cabable of. Yes that is possible as there are at least 4 publishers world wide that would release a 3rd party programmed GB Advance game (non-Tie-in)  original and really good, but it has to be a completely finished product and like I said something special. It then takes alot of work to put a deal together with one of the open minded 4 world wide publishers. 
<br/>
<br/>
From developing (one of the last) commercial GB Advance games I then want to goto Nintendo and go for a License, by that time I will have a team of 4 and will go and pitch Nintendo with paperwork etc etc.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way I just wanted to say this is an excellent site for GB Dev, and the level of technical knowledge is outstanding from the members here, with the quality of demos and games upto a very high standard.
<br/>
<br/>
This is what the Intelli Sys Kit consisted of:
<br/>
<br/>
Debug/Capture Unit
<br/>
GameBoy Advance Test Unit - does not use batteries, but runs off the power of the main debug unit through wires that run from where the battery compartment would normally be found
<br/>
GameBoy Color Test Unit - works as the GBA Test Unit does, through the power of the main debug unit
<br/>
GameBoy Advance Test Probe Cartridge - as shown inside the Test GBA unit in these photos.  Cartridge can be detached and removed from unit.
<br/>
GameBoy Color Test Probe Cartridge - like the GBA Test Probe Cartridge, this can be detached and removed from unit.
<br/>
32M Flash Cartridge - genuine Nintendo-made flash cartridge for GameBoy Color
<br/>
Nintendo CD-ROM Discs x 6 - multiple revisions of official GameBoy Advance (AGB) and GameBoy Color (CGB) development discs, provided by Nintendo to licensed developers
<br/>
AC Adaptor and all cables
<br/>
<br/>
Oh by the way has anyone used this kit before or a DS Nitro kit, as I know there are a few programmers on the forum who work for publishers. 
<br/>
<br/>
So although I don't need one to do a GB Advance title, I really would prefer the Official Kit as will be easier to make sure when debugging I presume and other things.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Its not huge, this guy was selling the Inteli Sys Dev kit complete for ?150 ($300). So i know its old technology and 75% of software houses are no longer using their GB Advance dev kits but the Ds nitros instead, but these kits are hard to come by complete.
<br/>
<br/>
So having missed out on a bargain at ?150 I would say I don't want to spend over ?300.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I could go more than ?300, for example a bit of a high price to me would be ?600+ ($1200+) but don't ask me why, (when devkitpro is amazing&amp;professional), I would prefer the official kit and I just have a craving to have one and I can sense one is out there and available...just where is it....thats the only question.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm so desparate I might even ring intelli systems in Japan and blag them for a second hand one !!! and I know you have to be a licensed developer to av one, but I taught physcological selling for selling yourself/product/service face to face or over the phone (telesales) for 2 years so its quite amazing what can be done over the phone, and what you can get people to do for you at senior company level.
<br/>
<br/>
But keep posting your votes and let me know if your selling one, your publishing house is selling one (to raise money for a charity for example-good suggestion for you to make at the next project meeting(if you work for a publishers that is!)).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But would you be able to distribute your compiled binaries? With the official Xbox SDK, for example, the Xbox Title Libraries are linked into each compiled binary to ensure the correct version is used for each released game. If the IS kit links in proprietary data (not sure as I haven't gotten my hands on it to pull apart), you would be in a similar situation to the Xbox Media Center project, and would only be able to distribute the source.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you heard of Catapult?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
