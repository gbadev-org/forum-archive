    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
We are thinking of the feasibility of plugging in a wifi card 802.11b (directly or using any custom adapters like usb or anything else)
<br/>
for prototyping of custom network protocols.
<br/>
<br/>
The gba would be used using a custom stand alone embedded system to access the wifi or usb device.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody has ever thought about that ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And how do you intend to interface USB to the GBA? USB is the most complicated and messed up PC interface available. You do not want to build something with USB host capabilities if you can avoid it.
<br/>
Your best bet for wifi on the GBA is to use a compact flash wifi card. There is the gamewallet with compact flash capability that might work (of course, the GBA serial port will be a performance bottleneck) or you can contact me if you want someone to design a custom flashcart with compact flash / wifi support for you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I just got an idea... How cool would it be to be able to surf the web using 802.11 on the GBA, be able to download any GBA games or applications, and run them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just found a possible problem... Wifi cards consume 300mA current during transmission (200mA during reception).
<br/>
The GBA has a current consumption of ~100mA (original game) and ~150mA when using a flashcart (except the new powerstar of course).
<br/>
<br/>
Think the GBA power supply can handle 400-450mA total current consumption? :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry, I'll rephrase.
<br/>
How about this?

<br/>
"How cool would it be to be able to surf the web using 802.11 on the GBA, be able to download any GBA games or applications <span style="font-weight: bold">(except for thoose with a license that do not permit downloading. Of course, free games and apps as well as commercial GBA games and apps that can legally bought and downloaded from the net are ok. Games originating from third party compilation carts may be ok to copy and download, depending on the license. Also, some so called free games may actually not be legal because they have ripped proprietary graphics or sound, this must be determined on a case by case basis. Games released under a Nintendo license are generally not ok to download, but there may be exceptions even to this rule?)</span>, and run them."
<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me if there is something else I can clarify for you. Perhaps I missed some types of software licenses?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This guy got his GBA for a webserver: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.fivemouse.com/gba/diary.html" target="_blank">http://www.fivemouse.com/gba/diary.html</a>

He has fully working TCP/IP, for example.
