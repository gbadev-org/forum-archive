    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been developing a homebrew cart.  Everything works.  I have worked it down to very vew vias.  However my traces are a bit to close together at some places and do not transfer to the PCB well.  Is there anyone who can help me get a pro quailty pcb layout done?  You can go to <a href="http://www.interspecialty.com/game" target="_blank">http://www.interspecialty.com/game</a> to see what I have done.  Its done with eagle layout editor :/  The cpld code is done and works great.  Infact everything is done, but my artwork sux.  BTW this CPLD has a very low voltage digital core and draws very little power :)  Anyway, take a look and if you work in or around a board house or are just good at PCB layout PLEASE HELP!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yes.  This is from their site:
<br/>
<br/>
"ExpressPCB ships anywhere in the world by FedEx International Priority, 2-3 day service. The typical shipping cost for 2-10 boards to Mexico and Canada is $37. Shipping to most European countries is $39. A $10.00 fee is added to all international orders for handling the additional paperwork."
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, don't confuse them with pcbexpress.com - expresspcb are more hobby-oriented, whilst pcbexpress are more professional oriented.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

7 mill

I use photo sentised boards and transperiencies printed in my 1800 dpi laser printer.  However, many of the lines run a bit to close and after etching some run together a bit.  I had to use an exacto knife to seperate a number of traces at various places.<br/>_________________<br/>mov  r0,#Thought

First, everyone I have talked to want to charge hundreds to thousands of dollars to do layout.  If I had the money to pay for that I would simply order carts out of china.  2000 cart minium order.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, If I am going to sell the carts (write disabled) with peoples software on them then I must make them my self.  I can make boards for about $1 each.  Big difference in price from the board houses.<br/>_________________<br/>mov  r0,#Thought

I havn't compared the prices, but maybe this could be an alternative <a href="http://www.pcb-pool.com/" target="_blank">http://www.pcb-pool.com/</a> at least they have a branch in europe, so shipping costs should be be less and you don't have to fear that you must pay duty because Sweden is in european union.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks, they seem to be cheaper. And they are located in Ireland so it is within EU wich translates to reduced shipping costs and no extra taxes. Great page, and it looks like they are very serious with certificates and gurantees.<br/>_________________<br/>"The best optimizer is between your ears..."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Of course the autorouter sucks, there are no good autorouters. (okay, there are one or two multi-thousand-dollar routers that does a acceptable job if set to work overnight)

About the spacing, why don't you use the online DRC?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Im not a pro at this.  I have just run the DRC and done some more manual clean up.  Ofter printing however it appears some smd pads are closer together than others (smd library chip part).  Could it just be that I am using ink jet transparencies on a laser printer?<br/>_________________<br/>mov  r0,#Thought

You did the home brew cart that is has its pic posted on the gbadev site right?  
<br/>

You know more about PCB making that I do im shure ;)  7 mill was the size someone else was using so it seem like the thing to do at the time :P<br/>_________________<br/>mov  r0,#Thought

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is anybody interested in a homebrew PCB cartridge. With Eeprom for save games.
<br/>
<br/>
I am currently producing a PCB so that it can be populated with AMD or Spansion Flash memory upto 64Mb with a Eeprom for save games.
<br/>
<br/>
If people are interested in producing their own games they can pool together and get a large order of unpopulated PCB.  Depending on the size of the game the PCB can then be populated with the required components.
<br/>
<br/>
I have produced a board with a EPM3064 and AMD Flash memory.
<br/>
<br/>
Programming has been carried out using a MBV2 with a new bootloader for the AMD chipset.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
