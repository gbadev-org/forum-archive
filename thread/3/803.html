    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can get 74AC191 from <a href="http://www.digikey.com" target="_blank">www.digikey.com</a>
<br/>
You could replace the 74AC with 74HC, but the fairly large extra overhead might be a problem, you may have to run at slow waitstates, and you may have to consider buying a faster flash memory in order to compensate for the slower counters.
<br/>
You have to do some timing calculations in order to make sure it will work at your desired waitstate.
<br/>
EDIT
<br/>
Actually, I just remembered I have a few 74AC191 extra, if you'd like you could buy a few from me.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing you have to think about, what flash programmer do you intend to use? There are currently no programmers compatible with the schematics on my webpage, you have to make your own. If you replace the AMD flash part with a 32M intel strataflash part, then the visoly flash linker will be able to program it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
TI can give it's 74AC samples.And i will try a fast flash chip(may be 70 ns) if i 
<br/>
had to use 74HC chip. :(
<br/>
It is  troublesome to buy chips from web site in China,becase i have no a good way to pay. 
<br/>
I just  programe flash chip in GBA using multiboot. No need more hardware. I have try this whith a GBA cart( which is mode of a mitsubishi flash) using intel flash's operation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

TI only produce the HC versions. :-/

You may also wanna look for LV or LVC versions, thoose are even faster than AC, but I've not been able to find any. Perhaps you have better luck than I :)

Yes, a custom multiboot app is a very flexible way to program misc. flash parts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Use DRAM. It takes a lot of current compared to e.g. SRAM, but if you're using it to develop software (and not for daily use or for distribution), you can keep your cart tethered to a power brick.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">EPROM requires you to expose the chip to 20 minutes of ultraviolet light in order to erase it.
<br/>
<br/>
EEPROM allows erasing individual bytes, but it's small.

<br/>
Flash allows erasing entire rows.  It is the most common type of nonvolatile memory.
<br/>
<br/>
EPROM, EEPROM, and Flash all have limited rewrite cycles.

SRAM is expensive and volatile.

<br/>
<br/>
So what's a typical rewrite lifetime for a flash memory?  I assume that it can't be too bad, since that's what they use in the GBA flash carts.  Does the finite lifetime cause problems with uses like the flash carts where the user would only write once or twice a day on avarage?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, how power hungry is DRAM?  Would you warn against powering it off of the GBA power?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The number of guaranteed erase-cycles for flash is very much dependent on the manufacturer. Typically, it ranges from 10'000 cycles to 1M cycles.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">joemmac, if ur still interrested on buiding that flash card replacemend using RAM, why not use low-power DRAM. It's build for use in cellular and other battery powered devices, so the the power consumption should be low enough. Take a look at <a href="http://www.infineon.com" target="_blank">www.infineon.com</a> If your still working on this let me know, I might be able to help.
<br/>
Another queston, how do you plan to acces the Compact flash (or similar) via the multiboot port or using adress decoding on it's Gamepack adresses?
<br/>
Let me know on <a href="mailto:shanachie@yucom.be">shanachie@yucom.be</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well you would think this idealic.. however there are some difficulties with this.
<br/>
<br/>
First you have the amount of time that's required to perform a single address cycle.
<br/>
<br/>
Second you have refresh cycles that must be performed.
<br/>
<br/>
Third you have interface issues as well, LVTTL of 1.5 or 1.8 V to 3.0 - 3.3 V to account for.
<br/>
<br/>
Fourth power supply concerns are big, you have to supply the drams with proper voltage for both the dram IO and the dram itself.
<br/>
<br/>
Fifth packaging is all BGA for low power mobile DRAM has to be small to fit into a cell phone.
<br/>
<br/>
Sixth because of the refresh and address multiplexing issues you will probably need an external device to control the DRAM.
<br/>
<br/>
Assuming the use of synchronise mobile dram you have a few clock issues as well.
<br/>
<br/>
None of these issues are trivial you might be able to use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samsung.com/Products/Semiconductor/SRAM/UtRAM_PseudoSRAM/32Mbit/K1S321615M/K1S321615M.htm" target="_blank">Samsung</a>or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.toshiba.com/taec/cgi-bin/display.cgi?table=Category&amp;CategoryID=7194" target="_blank">Toshiba</a> PSRAM instead though again packaging will be a key issue since these are mostly in BGA form.
<br/>
<br/>
The advantage is it won't be as bad as other options, I might point out that it will still consume a fair amount of juice and need some 74ACXXX devicess for handling the address changing.
