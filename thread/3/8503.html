    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">&lt;broken record&gt;Hardware RE doesn't magically appear, either the manufs. need to release a library (I still have no idea why most of them don't, it's not like it really hides anything from the other manufs, and it only hinders their potential homebrew support, which is pretty stupid since they're making money on hardware, not software), or someone needs to buy a gbamp SD for chishm, me, darkfader, or someone else who knows how and is willing to RE it, etc...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">True, tho it makes it very difficult to test a reimplementation of the code, and for e.g. flash carts, there is usually no write code in the menu, it'd only get you as far as the bankswitching.

Dunno about the GBAMP sd, it might write an ini file or something.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat
