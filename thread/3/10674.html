<br/>
i wanna built an xboo cable. But in the help file which comes with the xboo communicator program it is mentioned that it is possible to install a printer port (centronics) directly on the gba and even connect the power to the port.
<br/>
But the description is a little vague about whether it's actually doable, and somehow i wonder whether there is actually enough current supply from the lpt to run the gba.
<br/>
<br/>
Did anybody ever do this?
<br/>
Can I just solder the given ports simply as 'power line' together with a pull down resistor onto the battery + connector (and the ground as -) ?
<br/>
<br/>
i dont want to solder all the stuff together without knowing that it can work, otherwise i'd just built a plain xboo cable.
<br/>
thx
