<br/>
<br/>
I'm new here, so I hope I got this in the right forum. So, well I'm interested in the GBA from technical (Programmers) and a players point of view and I was wondering if there is any possibility to create "special" cartriges for this amazing piece of retro gaming. :) As most of you will recall the Super FX or the Super FX 2 chip. Long story short : Is that possible for the GBA too, is it "upgradeable" in this way, enhancing its longlivety? That would be awesome... 
<br/>
<br/>
/me drools just imagining what would be possible then and if those would be relased as flashable cartridges too. :D
<br/>
<br/>
PS : Sorry for my bad english, but I think you'll get what I want to know... ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yes, it's possible for a cart to map hardware such as a graphics accelerator into the address space. Yes, it'll drain the battery more. Yes, it'll probably make the cart physically bigger; there just isn't as much room inside a standard-size GBA cart as there was inside Super NES carts. No, the Super FX 2 processor wasn't significantly faster than the GBA's ARM7TDMI; compare Id Software's <span style="font-style: italic">Doom</span> on both platforms.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have had the idea before, for example a 66MHz ARM7tdmi could be added to provide extra computing power. It could even be done without increasing the cart size, but I don't see a market for such a flashcart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What would you honestly do with a 66 MHz coprocessor anyway? 3D is the only thing that I can think of. Maybe you could use it for better sound (do the sound processing on the GBA and do the game processing on the cartridge).

Just go get a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tapwave.com" target="_blank">zodiac</a> or something. :P
