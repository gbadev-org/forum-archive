<br/>
Anyway, I'd love to get a good look into the BIOS.
<br/>
I'am looking att RE the disassembly myself, but it's _alot_ of work... I think they made it really messy just to make it harder to RE...
<br/>
<br/>
So, if someone has a full or partial RE of the BIOS, or any other useful info for that matter, I'd be very happy if I could get a look at it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
