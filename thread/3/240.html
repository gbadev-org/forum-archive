This sort of thing might come in handy for my project, ie. it will help me to explain things to some "uneducated" types ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The exact layout of the ASIC is of course only known by nintendo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, i was thinking just how the memory is mapped out, etc. I'll just make my own based on the header files i've got - it shouldn't really be too hard. just wondered if anyone had already done anything like this before to save me doing the hard bits! ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm clueless when it comes to electronics, so I was wondering, what's an ASIC and what does it stand for? Is it like an integrated circuit?
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I was wondering just how hard it would be to build a small integrated circuit that has its own memory, cpu etc..  I've always wished I could build a small system with a cheap cpu and program it myself.<br/>_________________<br/>microkernel advance</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
