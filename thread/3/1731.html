    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The fact is nintendo are stopping gba piracy by punishing the retailers who sell the hardware rather then the pirates themselves. Lik-sang was the latest victim (around early 2002 they stopped selling flash carts).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">your right as well its not as if if when you search for gba  thing it doesnt come up with hundred roms options. but would half of the retailer not probaly lik sang not dell to a person that they though would use it to pirate marterial and i think that s wat got the stick so far up nintendo ass as they dont want to kill there developers but the pirates are killing them.
<br/>
but its nintendos fault they didnt off any kind of testing tool like the flash card if they did they could have made it better and something like a registration system that meant that only developers could obtain them and it would really slow down any  piraters and the people who use roms wold have the excitement of playing the games on there pcs and thats shit</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nintendo does have <a class="postlink" href="http://noa-engineering.com/licensing/" target="_blank">a registration system</a>; the problem is just that the system is designed for developers of commercial game software and not for hobbyists.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
