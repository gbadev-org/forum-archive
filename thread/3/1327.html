    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You should not need to be a licenced developer to publish the game, unless you want to use Nintendo's development kit. Whether vendors will accept your game is another matter entirely, but there is legal precedent for developing for a so-called 'closed' platform without the company's licence; Datel were taken to court by Nintendo over the original NES cheat carts and the courts ruled that Datel could do whatever they felt like, including reproduce the required header data (for the NES, it was the string 'NINTENDO' I think, for the GBA it's the nintendo logo code) because it's the only way to make the cart boot. I.E. it's not legal to use copyrights to force companies to licence your platform. =)

<br/>
As long as you use only free tools and the specs which have been written from reverse engineering, you should be fine.

In the United States, this was <span style="font-style: italic">Nintendo v. Galoob</span> (patch carts) and <span style="font-style: italic">Sega v. Accolade</span> (games), both decided in favor of the independent publisher.

On the NES, it was a program called "10NES" stored in a separate chip with processor and ROM on one die. The Tengen case, <span style="font-style: italic">Atari Games v. Nintendo</span>, went in Nintendo's favor because Atari Games (Tengen's parent company) defrauded the Copyright Office to obtain the source code for 10NES.

<br/>
This may or may not have changed after the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and foreign counterparts, but Datel continues to independently publish Action Replay brand ROM patching software and hardware on Nintendo platforms.

And as long as you have money to pay lawyers to defend you against frivolous legal actions.
<br/>
<br/>
To summarize, you need at least all of the following in order to publish software on the GBA without affiliation with Nintendo:<ul><li>CONTENT: A high-quality original program.</li><li>LAW: An adequate legal defense budget.</li><li>REPLICATION: A fabricator of electronic devices (to make cartridges) and a print shop (to make manuals and boxes).</li><li>SALES: Agreements with retail chains. If you can't get your product into Wal-Mart, forget about significant brick-and-mortar sales in the States.</li><li>PROMOTION: Money to pay other entertainment channels to let readers know that your product exists.</li></ul>
<br/>
Of course, <span style="font-style: italic">Wario Ware Inc</span> for Game Boy Advance glosses over most of this because Wario immediately sets up his company as affiliated with Nintendo. (How this is possible, without shattering the fourth wall between mushroom world and America, beats me.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
