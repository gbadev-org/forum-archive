    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Carrying cases are cheap. Barring that, I'm guessing that there exist PC-based programs that can decode a GameShark code and apply it as a patch to the GBA ROM <span style="font-style: italic">before</span> you write it to your flash cart.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you really want to use GS codes, you can make them work by writing the game in single-rom mode, normally. However, this defeats your stated purpose of carrying around many games on one cart. Sorry.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
