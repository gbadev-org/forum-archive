Thats precisely why we *don't* want you to talk about it here.  There are some thing best left known and unsaid.  I use my dev equipment to create homebrew games.  If you want to talk about piracy, go somewhere else.  I'd rather not have this place shut down.
<br/>
<br/>
When you pirate a game, the company that makes that game loses money.  This does not encourage them to make more games.  I understand that people have economic consderations and may not be able to buy every game that they want to.
<br/>
<br/>
Something to keep in mind: if you are going pirate games, make sure to buy the games you really want.  This encourages more games that to made.  I may well not approve of your choice of good games, but thats your choice.  I'll may well put my money into games you wouldn't buy.
