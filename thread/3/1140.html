    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am looking for a schematic to the GBA's LCD, including pinnouts, part numbers, timing diagrams (if not generally available online), etc.  I am looking to create an NTSC signal from the GBA's internal direct-LCD addressing system.
<br/>
<br/>
Given that I don't have money to go purchase an existing adapter, but I do have the resources and skill to build electronics, I would like to try and do it myself.
<br/>
<br/>
Any schematics or other pointers would greatly be appreciated as I spearhead this effort.  Also useful would be pointers to any other parties currently working on or with knowledge about this type of project.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks!
<br/>
