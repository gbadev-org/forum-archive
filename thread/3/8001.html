Check you have the right port address set in the options, you can also try increasing the delay there.

Did you get UserPort to work or have you attempted to use another port access system? Do you have any other device drivers in your system which use the parallel port?

That method doesn't work with devkitARM, you need to use the appropriate specs files.

The examples provided with devkitPro contain makefiles which do most of the work automatically.

I don't believe anything else is using my parallel port, as I have never before used it on this computer(only usb).

I am now assuming that you have to use devkitPro to use the XBOO Comunicator? I am currently using HAM because I am formillar with it and the book I am working through uses it also, but as I become a more proficient developer and finish the book I plan to move to devkitPro becuase of its frequent updates and smaller/faster code :). I have already downloaded devkitPro, but it is a little intemidating top try to adapt to it while I am in the middle of this book. I will start using it when I move on to the Pern and TONC tutorials. May even use it with VisualHam as I am used to the IDE.
<br/>
<br/>
But as us stated before, even though it will not run it should still transfer to the hardware. With it is not. 
<br/>
<br/>
I don't see where I can increase the delay inside userport only in XC, but I have increased it up to 7 with no luck. I can't understand why it won't work. Any more ideas?

Since Xcomms no longer crashes ( although it should actually report that UserPort is required :/) I think we're safe in assuming that UserPort is installed and working. There's also another app around the forums somewhere, Xboo XP or similar.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're running XP you might try the procedure outlined in the third question here -&gt; <a href="http://www.lvr.com/jansfaq.htm" target="_blank">http://www.lvr.com/jansfaq.htm</a>
<br/>

Q: If a logic 1 is written to the Control Port, bit 0, (Strobe), the PC clears all of the port bits once every five seconds for about a minute.
<br/>
<br/>
A: Some versions of Windows XP look for devices by periodically writing to the port. A registry key can disable this behavior.
<br/>
<br/>
The following registry setting disables the port writes:
<br/>
<br/>
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Parport\Parameters]
<br/>
"DisableWarmPoll"=dword:00000001
<br/>
<br/>
The following registry setting enables the port writes:
<br/>
<br/>
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Parport\Parameters]
<br/>
"DisableWarmPoll"=dword:00000000
<br/>
<br/>
You can make these changes in Windows' regedit utility. Or to make the changes automatically, create and save the following text files:
<br/>
<br/>
DisableWarmBoot.reg contains the following text:
<br/>
<br/>
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
<br/>
<br/>
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Parport\Parameters]
<br/>
"DisableWarmPoll"=dword:00000001
<br/>
<br/>
EnableWarmBoot.reg contains the following text:
<br/>
<br/>
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
<br/>
<br/>
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Parport\Parameters]
<br/>
"DisableWarmPoll"=dword:00000000
<br/>
<br/>
To change a registry key, run the program.
<br/>
<br/>
As always, use caution when working with the registry, which contains critical values for configuring and running the PC.
<br/>
<br/>
After making a change, reboot the PC.
<br/>
<br/>
Disabling the port writes can also eliminate port timeout errors received in some applications.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Richard Shotbolt for informing me of this fix.

It was doing this stuff before just not as much. The window that pops up is just XC reopening itself(wierd).

Pretty much irrelevant, your problem here isn't the binary, it's either the cable you've built, your parallel port or some other piece of software interfering with the process.
<br/>
<br/>
You could try setting your parallel port to SPP mode and maybe adding the pullup resistors as specified in Martin's orginal docs -&gt; <a href="http://www.work.de/nocash/gba-xboo.htm" target="_blank">http://www.work.de/nocash/gba-xboo.htm</a>

The parallel port mode is set in the BIOS settings, usually under "integrated periperals"

<br/>
The pinout of the GBA linkport in the diagram with xcomms is shown looking into the GBA socket. If you look at the cable plug head on with the flat side to the bottom then pin 1 is the top left.
<br/>
<br/>
It's not inconceivable that your parallel port won't work with Xboo, my most recent PC has problems which I've yet to solve ( it's a foxcon motherboard).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi there. im the authour of XBOO XP. i' ve been reading through, and i think the problem is your cable. you are using my program correctly. there is nothing wrong with your settings. You dont need to use userport to get it to work.
<br/>
<br/>
the parrelel port mode setting doesnt really matter, spp or normal will do.
<br/>
<br/>
so, a logical deduction would place the blame on your cable. u seem to know how to compile a multiboot image. i guess thats that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well hopefully it's his cable - I've found two machines so far that I can't get bit banging to work on.

Actually it does matter. SPP mode stops the GBA shorting ( power light flickers with GBA off &amp; cable plugged in, GBA refuses to boot) on one of my machines. Another machine won't recognise the GBA with the port in anything but SPP mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The xboo communicator works pretty good with it, but It is sometimes still randomly exiting. XBOO XP works great on it and seems to be smooth. ZeroX do you think you will ever do a GUI version. That way I don't have to change the batch file everytime(I know it doesn't take that long, but every second counts :) ). Thanks everyone for all of your help. I'm sorry that it turned out to be something so simple that I should have figured out on my own. But hey.... IT WORKS!!!

Now that I am over that it is time to get back to coding.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wouldn't worry about it, I think *everybody* does that the first time, I know I did and so did a couple of people who helped me test Xboo Communicator. You're certainly not alone.

GUI version doesn't necessarily make things any easier, just less intimidating for people who aren't used to command line tools.
<br/>
<br/>
If you've used the devkitPro installer then you should have Programmer's Notepad already set up to run Makefiles. You can add a target to send the binary with your preferred app. There's a brief document on adding tools to PN2 at <a href="http://www.devkitpro.org/pn2.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.devkitpro.org/pn2.shtml</a>
<br/>
<br/>
If you take the template in the gba examples and modify this section of the Makefile
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
.PHONY: $(BUILD) clean
<br/>
<br/>
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
$(BUILD):
<br/>
   @[ -d $@ ] || mkdir -p $@
<br/>
   @make --no-print-directory -C $(BUILD) -f $(CURDIR)/Makefile
<br/>
<br/>
all   : $(BUILD)
<br/>
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
clean:
<br/>
   @echo clean ...
<br/>
   @rm -fr $(BUILD) $(TARGET).elf $(TARGET).gba

sendmb:
<br/>
   xcomms $(OUTPUT).gba
<br/>
<br/>
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
You can, of course, replace xcomms with xbooxp $(OUTPUT).gba -p378 -h -d2 
<br/>
<br/>
then you just add a tool to PN2 which has the command 'make sendmb'</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by wintermute on Fri Jan 13, 2006 6:44 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
