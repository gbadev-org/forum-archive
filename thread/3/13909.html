    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">in that web, they explain step by steop how easy is to make a rumble cartridge with the motor of an old mobile phone and a few soldering points,

<br/>
now the important question;
<br/>
<br/>
Has they don't sell memory expansion cartridge alone, we can't use free browsers like "links" or "okiwi" because they need a memory expansion pack,
<br/>
<br/>
so any can can xplain step by step how to do it (if its possible) ?
<br/>
in case you don't know but you already got one, will be helpfull if you could open it and post a few pics so we know what kind of Integrated circuit should be bought to solder it in the slot2 cartridge NDS already got to pretect the slot,
<br/>
<br/>
thnks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">bcos a supercard lite costs 50$
<br/>
<br/>
and modify the provided cartridge will cost a memory chip of 6$ and 5 minuts soldering a few points in the cartridge...
<br/>
<br/>
ppl that already got a slot1 flashcart dont wanna spend 50$ in a slot-2 flashcart just to use a ds browser few times a week,
<br/>
<br/>
they should sell 32mb of ram in a single cartridge for 8$...
<br/>
<br/>
but they don't a right now the single official software that need expansion memory is opera ds and they already give a expansion memory of 8mb when you buy it,
<br/>
<br/>
so is not a bad idea to make one (in my opinion)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if the memory chip is only $6 to buy one, how come supercards with memory, cost like $20 more (and they must buy the memory chips in large quantities)?
<br/>
<br/>
And it's not exactly just five minutes of soldering... You will need AT LEAST 26 lines (24 for address+data, 2 for power) (see <a class="postlink" href="http://darkfader.net/gba/files/cartridge.txt" target="_blank">cartridge pinout</a>)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's probably $8 if you can find the right supplier, which the supercard manufacturers probably would have. Since there are fewer products to compete with and the unique selling points of each product they probably decided that the given price would yield the most sales - given the target market.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
