    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had a silver Gameboy Advance SP and I recently bought a red shell on eBay. It came with no instructions so I had to figure out how to fit it myself. After some time, I finally took apart the silver shell and replaced it with the red shell.
<br/>
<br/>
When i fitted it back together, I turned on the power and the green light flickered for half a second and went off. If I charge my SP, the orange light stays on but the power light flickers and then turns off.
<br/>
<br/>
I took apart the gameboy and noticed the (very small) golden ribbon cable that attaches the screen to the motherboard wasnt completely in. After carefully pushing the cable in properly, I turned on the gameboy and it worked. However the graphics were sort of corrupt and the screen was a little blurry. I took the gameboy apart again, pulled out the ribbon cable and reattached it, then turned on the gameboy and everything was perfect!
<br/>
<br/>
I was happily playing the gameboy for approx 20 minutes, then I went to bed. The next day I turned on the gameboy and I am having the exact same problem.. power light flickers for half a second, then goes off. I have looked at the ribbon cable and it is inserted properly. What can I do?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Perhaps opening and closing the lid somehow causes it to slip out?<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well it doesnt slip out, I am looking at it now and its in completely. Maybe the ribbon cable is damaged? I really dont know but I really regret buying a shell now!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Gameboy now fixed. It seems there is a locking mechanism right where the ribbon cable goes in. I had no idea you could lock the cable down, now it works fine!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
