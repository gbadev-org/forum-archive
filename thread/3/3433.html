    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I wonder if anyone got any gba linker they don't use, which they want to sell or give away to me.. My goal is to create an general linker library, which will make it easier to create programs to communicate between pc and gameboy..
<br/>
<br/>
The one linker I don't need (which I already have), are the X-rom usb linker..
<br/>

Cheers :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
