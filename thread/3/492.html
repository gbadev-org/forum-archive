    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am trying to figure out if the GBA does have any JTAG interface on the CPU.
<br/>
<br/>
Since it uses an ARM7TDMI core, it includes some JTAG debugging possibilities. But, I am afraid that Nintendo did not put those signals on any pin on the CPU.
<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone already figure out if JTAG is possible or not?
<br/>
<br/>
I want to test GDB (GNU project debugger) to see if it is suitable for a board I am developing. That board will also include the ARM7TDMI core, so I thought it was good to setup the complete development environment before I freeze my board design. (If GDB works fine, I dare to put some flash memory with fine pin pitch directly on the board instead of some smaller flash memory in a socket)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
