    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
 I have just found a source for GBA link connector plugs that has pins to solder to a PCB.  I am using them to make a GBA accessory that plugs into the link port.  I just put in a message to the supplier to confirm that they have all 6 pins, but I'm pretty sure they do.  
<br/>
<br/>
They are $1 each, and I'm planning on ordering 100.  Is there anybody in the US who would like to add some to my order?  That way we will both save on shipping from Asia.  We can split up the shipping cost by the order quantity, and you can pay shipping from me to you, which will be probably not more than $5 or $10.
<br/>
<br/>
I am located in Upstate NY, USA.
<br/>
<br/>
Send me a PM if you want to order with me, and post here if you have questions or comments that others might be interested in.  I'll post a message soon confirming that they have all 6 pins.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in getting some, send me a PM.  They do have all 6 pins, and have tabs that get soldered to a circuit board.
<br/>
<br/>
I can also get plastic cases for a link port accessory ($3 each), and plastic cases for GBA cartridges (for making your own cartridge, not for storing cartridges - also $3 each).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
