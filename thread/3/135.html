The second port is for the charger and the sound output. Yes, you are going to buy a special cable to use headphones X_X</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It looks like the GameCube cable will block physical access to this second port. So how will I be able to hear the personalized GBA audio that some GCN games provide? I'd figure a GBA link extension cable would work, but does anybody make one? A quick Google search didn't turn anything up.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
