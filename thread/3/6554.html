    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello I have had the supercard for a while now and I was testing out the new DS firmware patch with the snes emu that is out.  Well while playing Super Mario World I noticed that it saved my data, but when I turn if off for more then 2 seconds the save will get erased.  Now I know with Supercard you have to manually save the save to the CF card, but I do not believe this option is made available to the DS mode just yet.  So what I was thinking was could it be possoble to wire in some kind of a battery with a switch in it to keep the ram used for the saving alive.  The switch is so that when you turn on the NDS with the supercard it cuts off the battery power so that it doesnt leak or explode.  Im not familiar with the GBA pin-outs or the SC architecture for that matter, so I do not know if there are seperate power pins for the saves and the actual chips</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
