    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I flashed my gbamp with Chishm's firmware, it then reported that it wasnt a read gbamp, so without thinking, i ran the patch again, this time selecting to restore. Now all i get is a black screen when booting.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything i can do to repair this, or is it completely useless.
<br/>
I have a flash cart if that helps.

-Edit-
<br/>
Doesn't matter, e19 fixed it. I should have tried that first before paniking.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
