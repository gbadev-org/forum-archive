    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We're working on a video capture system for GBA. This is going to be an industrial control application. What we want to know is the cart's PCB connector's footprint. BTW, does anyone among you guys have any hands-on experience in a similar project? We're no experts in GBA, we're still pondering the possibility of using it for our application.  Any help is welcome.<br/>_________________<br/>Guns for show, knives for a pro</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
