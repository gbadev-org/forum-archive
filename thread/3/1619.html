    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll admit, I'm new to Flash cartridges, but I've been doing my research lately, and from what I've seen, the EZ-Flash has the most features right now;  That's what I was going to go with (and see how Pogoshell runs on one of these carts)...
<br/>
<br/>
However, beforehand, I noticed that <a href="http://www.firefly-hk.com" target="_blank">www.firefly-hk.com</a> had this "EZ-Flash Advance II" set, which I've heard *nothing* about just about anywhere else, not even on EZ-Flash's main site...

<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know anything about this???  Is it legitimate?  It certainly looks different from the EZF cards I've seen...  ('course, their photos of "normal" EZF cards look different than the Translucent red cards I've seen pictured everywhere else...)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, incidentally, has anyone had *any* good or bad experiences with Pogo on EZFlash they'd like to share???</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
