<br/>
<br/>
In the GBA booklet it warns against the use of any sort of rechargable batterys. I know that Nickel Cadium(Ni-Cad) batterys have some problems (cell reversal and overtime they also cause copper wiring to go black therefore build up resistance). But Nickel Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) don't seem to have any problems and until recently have been used in mobile phones. Would it be safe to use Ni-MH batterys in my GBA? I'm getting sick of buying expensive disposibles.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't seen any issues with NiMh batteries - I've been using them in both of my gbas for ... a long time now, close to a year
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think there is any problem with using them.

The only thing to watch out for is that the green-&gt;red transition of the led happens just moments before the batteries dies, as opposed to quite a while before with normal batteries. I think Nintendo were in cahoots with the battery manufacturers, which is why they wrote that in the manual ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can usually play for another hour or so when the LED switch to red... Must be different for different types of NiMh batteries..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have an afterburner installed (forgot about that, since a GBA without a light is only really useful as a paperweight) which might make a difference. Certainly the light acts a bit odd since installing it, flicking red when I turn the unit off, for example.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
