<br/>
<br/>
I am new to GBA development and I have a problem with my MBV2 cable under WIN XPP. I can establish a connection between my GBA and the PC over the parallel port (thanks to the DIRECT IO shareware). But when I try to transfer something with mb.exe, the transfered program/game never starts on the GBA and mb.exe says something like: <span style="font-style: italic">Return value should be 0!</span> I tried out different sample files from VisualHam, so I assume those files are ok and multiboot ready and should not cause the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
The other strange thing about this problem that the Nintendo-Logo that should appear once the transfer starts is there ? but it's kind of scattered into pixels.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have experience with a problem like that?
<br/>
Could the cable be broken or does this look more like software problem?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in Advance,
<br/>
Andreas</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
