    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm already using the Link port in UART mode to interface with a PIC microcontroller.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm wondering if there's a single other output that can be directly controlled by the GBA? I want to use it to switch on a light programmatically.
<br/>
<br/>
The only General IO I know of is the link port, but this is used fully for serial comms with my PIC. and right now, all my PIC IO are used, so I can't make the PIC control the light, unless I upgrade to a different (more complex) PIC, which i'd rather not do.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything else that might be suitable? I have quite a few wires soldered to the GBA already, and it no longer lives in it's case, so i'm not adverse to modification if thats what i'd need to do.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks
<br/>

Only two of them are used in UART mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm confused now. The link port has 6 pins- Vcc &amp; GND, SI &amp; SO (Rx and Tx respectively), and the other two (SD and SC) which are used at CTS and RTS.
<br/>
<br/>
The SD and SC are needed for a serial link, so where are my two spare gen.pur.  IO's ??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
You don't need hardware handshaking for a serial link, in fact, most do not use it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
