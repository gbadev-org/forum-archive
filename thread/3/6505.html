    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. I've been playing loads of GBC color games recently on emulators, and thought it would be great to actually own some of these games for real.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, since I've been playing them properly, and getting into them, I have got pretty far in alot of the games, Pokemon Silver for example.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, does anyone know where I could get a piece of hardware that would let me transfer my save files across from my PC to the 'real' cart? If so, how much do they usually cost?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I'm in the UK so anywhere that sells them must be able to ship to the UK.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you have a GBA you can upload a software to it that changes the savefile.
<br/>
I don't know how you would do it on a GBC cart, but on GBA cart it can be done.<br/>_________________<br/>Look at:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you using a Gameboy Advance or Gameboy Color? I dont know how to run GBC games in a GBA, but i think it is possible. 
<br/>
<br/>
However if you want to transfer the save file without deep knowledge of the GBA you'll run into a lot of trouble.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm working on a software, XBOO XP that will allow you to read and write to the cart save (SRAM). But you will need a XBOO cable for this. Plus i'm still working on this. It's already released, but only able to send multiboot images. Anybody who can give some guidance please PM me. 
<br/>
<br/>
I know that the SRAM adress starts at 0xE000000, but i know there are different sizes for different cards. I dont know how to indentify these different sizes, and different types. What about the waitstates for all the different types. Need help....
<br/>
<br/>
The XBOO cable is free, you can make it yourself, no need to be a super genius. See the tutorials, like the PERN PROJECT, the first day shows how to make one.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S: if you dont own the game, thats piracy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
