<br/>
<br/>
i recently bought 2 flash2advance ultra cartridges ..one for me and one for a friend...size 256 mbit.
<br/>
<br/>
first everything went right..i flashed some games on the cart and played..when i tried to flash new games on the cart it still works (power writer 2.x connects to the gba sp and flashes new games on the cart) but they cart won't play in the gba sp anymore... i tried to flash new games but always the same..can someone tell me whats happening or what i can do about it? 
<br/>
<br/>
other games play fine in the gba sp ... strange, isn't it? 
<br/>
<br/>
is there a posiibility to completely delete the cart without flashing new games on it? 
<br/>
<br/>
thanx
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Return the cart to the retailer you bought it from and ask for a new card. While you wait you can play the same games but from your original cartridges. Problem solved.
