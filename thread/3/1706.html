    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to have a go at building my own flash cart.
<br/>
(am pretty confident with electronics &amp; pcb design)
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be possible to use the 49lf020 Flash device ?
<br/>
<br/>
How many games were made that would will fit on a 27c256 ? 
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone got any links to some easy to follow diy carts ?
<br/>
<br/>
I have a gb pocket, gb colour &amp; gb advance, so dont care what one to work with for my 1st homebuilt cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ampz has a nice little schematic for an 8mbit flash cartridge
<br/>
a few people have speculated about making a Rom Emulator using SDRAM or DRAM  (which is not a BAD idea it's just not close to EASY ;) ). Static Ram would work as well but you need a fair amount of it (IE 64mb or at least 32mb). PSRAM is possible Again you need at least 32mb (which is obtainable).
<br/>
<br/>
256Kbit is TOO small for most things. This is 64KB of memory, I could fit probably a fair amount of stuff in that in C or C++ myself but .. if you want to develope using a library etc. It's not enough :)
<br/>
<br/>
I believe to do what you would like to you need
<br/>
1 EEPROM based CPLD &lt;this handles addressing and Static RAM and should be EEPROM based because these are 'instant' on programable logic devices&gt;
<br/>
2 4mbit SRAM for keeping game save state information for several different games (handy to have this ability for 16 32KB games even if you are developing).
<br/>
3: 128mbit or 256mbit flash memory.
<br/>
<br/>
Reminds me I should finish my own flash 256Mbit cartridge, I just need to complete the guts of the CPLD :)
<br/>
<br/>
I am looking at the idea of using a SDRAM and some cute caching to make an emulated ROM possible as well. This requires a SRAM based FPGA instead and so it's a much more complicated device to deal with.

but playing on my gbasp and ps2 arent the only things i do on them

i found a way on how to surf the internet on my ps2
<br/>
but that was piss easy
<br/>
and i learnt nothing out of that
<br/>
and i modded my ps2 myself, even though it is a fliptop method

so now i want to make my own flash cart, and has any one seen that picture of gbasp connected to a cd drive? i want to make that aswell<br/>_________________<br/>'this bird's gonna fly'</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm 17, pick up electronics, its a lot of fun, when I was like 12, my dad bought me a book on microprocessors and I never stopped reading about digital electronics since. 
<br/>
<br/>
How are you going to solder those SMD CPLD's onto the board, I wanna see how you do that if you go through with it, drop me an email. I'm also thinking of making a 128KB flash card for my original GB, I won't need a CPLD as the MBC5 is already included (The legend of the river king is not worth my game playing time anyway :D )<br/>_________________<br/>Hello Everyone :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Err.. what good would the RAM do without a boot ROM program? All things are possible just not all are practical. When all else fails be specific :)
<br/>
<br/>
What do you want to do? :)
