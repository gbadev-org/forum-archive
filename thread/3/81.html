    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is my first post here, so hi everyone!  Does anyone know if there are any schematics for simple general purpose I/O cartridges with maybe some flash and ram also?  I am thinking of something along the lines of the Xport device, but with inexpensive MCUs controlling the interfacing for addressing, code fetch, and memory mapping to I/O lines.  JTAG or i2c ports could provide a quick upload of new I/O characteristics.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm long on theory but short on practice (I'm CS, not EE), so any pointers to resources would be great.   I would love to use my GBA to provide "brains" for all kinds of uses.  Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A MCU is waay too slow to handle adress decoding. It has to be done with logic.
<br/>
Of course, the mega-size FPGA they stuck in the xport is a major overkill.
<br/>
<br/>
If you only need a few gpio's then the GBA comm port might be useful to you. I has three or four gpio's.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to build a cart with built in gpio yourself then you might wanna check out my schematics for a basic GBA cart:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.hh.se/stud/d99tibr" target="_blank">www.hh.se/stud/d99tibr</a>
<br/>
Just add adress decoding and a latch or buffer and you have your I/O's.
<br/>
The cheap AMD flash memory in the schematics can be replaced by a intel strataflash if you need more space, or if you want it to be compatible with standard linker software.
<br/>
<br/>
Another way is to extend the GPIO's on the comm port.
<br/>
<br/>
A way to get 10 more inputs would be to open up the GBA and abuse the keypad inputs, but I guess you don't want to do that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You are right, a microcontroller is too slow.  I just looked at some of the bus timings, and at best I could only execute 5 MCU instructructions, which would be meaningless.
<br/>
<br/>
Your design looks just like what I'm after...  Thanks for setting me straight before I went too far up the MCU alley! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The schematic is obviously valid for all flash sizes. I thought that much was obvious..
<br/>
<br/>
Basic save support is easy, just use a part of the main flash memory, no extra components required.
<br/>
Of course, such savegame support is not compatible with Nintendo savegame hardware, but that's not a problem since we don't do piracy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A good book on digital electronics and computer architecture (digital busses). I can't recommend anyone in particular.
<br/>
A college/university course on the subject might be the best way to learn..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
