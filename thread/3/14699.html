    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi to everyone in this great forum.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking to connect a WRT54GL linksys router and GBA by the link port. I have been reading those days about pc gba serial comunication and tension problens between pc serial port (12v) and the gba (3,3v), the maxin tension converter needs to make a cable and ...
<br/>
<br/>
The wrt54gl's "serial port"'s ("" because is not exactly a port, is a option that you can add in the routers PCB) tension is 3.3v so my question is, could i connect directly the two devices ports without any conversor, resistor, etc ... ??
<br/>
<br/>
The wrt54gl is mini linux pc at 200mhz and you can add the app-s you want with the correct firmware (openwrt, dd-wrt, ...).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks
