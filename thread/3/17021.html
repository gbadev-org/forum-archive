    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Please don't yell at me... The site says that it uses NOR ram for storing games and Sram for games. Could this have a patch written for it, or something, to act as a RAM cart?
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I did google it, and I didn't really find anything.
<br/>
<br/>
I have an EFA simple 1gbit card (32 MB), also known as the fake EFA-II. It works perfectly, so I don't really care that it's fake now. But man it was frustrating till I found the Long Card Drivers! (If you need the drivers, just let me know, I have them on mediafire.)
<br/>
<br/>
So, is this possible?<br/>_________________<br/>May the OCZ NIA be with you.
