    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Look inside your GBA, GBA SP, or GameCube Game Boy Player. On one side of the cart edge, there should be a switch that senses whether the cart has an indentation (for GBA) or no indentation (for GBC). The Game Boy micro, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo DS lite do not have this switch because they are not compatible with Game Boy Color games.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, that's pretty interesting.  I had wondered how it could tell the difference between a GBC cart and a GBA one.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Dwedit, you can press the button without the GBA rebooting, but if you actually insert a GB(C) cartridge into the slot, it will reboot into GBC mode.  I actually have managed to insert a GBC cartridge while the GBA bios loads without it rebooting into GBC mode, although it's very rare that it works, and the system just hangs at that screen.  My linker software locks up at that point, and I have been unable to use this trick to obtain the saves off my now-dead Azure Dreams GBC cartridge.

EDIT:  erm, sorry about the gravedig.  I didn't realize that the topic was that old.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
