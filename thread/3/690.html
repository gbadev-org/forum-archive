    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In most normal CPU's (including most ARM CPU's), there is virtually no difference at all because of the internal cache memory.
<br/>
<br/>
However for CPU's w/o cache (like the GBA) there is a difference since the CPU doesn't have to fetch any instructions from the external memory while copying the data if DMA is used.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
