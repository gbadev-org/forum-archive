    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. I was wondering about the DC-DC converters of more recent Nintendo handhelds. I know the original Game Boy and the Game Boy Pocket basically had a dedicated board (though not very big, of course) for DC-DC conversion. Is the case similar for the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, SP, DS, et cetera?
<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any specifics. At the moment, I am being offered a broken DSi for cheap. I am needing a DC-DC converter, but cannot find any info about what is inside.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It appears to vary, could be a TI chip or a Mitsumi one, on a 56-pin QFP. Neither seem to have datasheets or product mentions up anywhere, could be custom part numbers for Nintendo. This page may help you:
