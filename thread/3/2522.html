    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Of the many years i've been programming ( 4-5 ) i've never seemed to understand how the whole Hardware and software things can interact. Another thing is, how emulators 'emulate' the hardware. Could someone please explain to me how this all comes together? I just dont really understand it. :X</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
