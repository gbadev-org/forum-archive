<br/>
I am a linux user and GBA developer newbie. I have been doing all my testing on the emulator so far, but I want to get a flashcart linker o test ont he actual hardware. Anyone have any suggestions on what to get that is well supported and easy to use with linux? I have been looking at the FA Linker, but it looks like the software that comes with it is for windows only. I don't want to have to write a hardware driver, I just want to work on gameboy advance code.
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
