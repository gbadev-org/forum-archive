    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's a support question. Ask the support at the place where you bought it. 
<br/>
Also, it sounds like you might do piracy. That kind of ppl are not welcome here, just so you know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Dude, he did not say anything that even remotely suggests piracy. Assuming somebody uses a flash linker for piracy is similar (IMHO) to assuming that somebody uses their internet for porn, or their screwdriver to kill somebody. There are loads of *"freeware games"* out there that he *could* have been referring to.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, before somebody jumps on me, my point is *nothing* against ampz. I am referring to a general atmosphere in this community, which seems more eager to jump on its own members then blood-thirsty lawers are to jump on a total stranger.
