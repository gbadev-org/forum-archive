<br/>
maybe I found some errors in CowBite ... like 0x06010000 for the OAM Data. 
<br/>
<br/>
Is it wrong? (in gba.h is 0x6100000)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OAM Data is at neither of those addresses, as OAM (Object <span style="font-weight: bold">attribute</span> memory) is at 0x0700:0000.
<br/>
<br/>
But you're probably referring to OBJ VRAM. In that case CowBite is correct. It is 0x0601:0000 (4 ending zeroes), not 0x0610:0000 (five zeroes). Exactly whose gba.h are you referring to by the way, there are a lot of them after all. And are you sure you didn't miscount (which is a very easy mistake to make)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
