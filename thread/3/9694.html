The GBAMP sticks out, and i was thinking how much more neat and easier to store it would be if you could stick the GBAMP on the back of the GBA/DS. Is there a way I could connect the pins on the GBAMP to the pins onto a normal GBA game? so the DS would have the GBA game inserted, while actually connected to the GBAMP which just sits on the back of the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
would this be possible with basic wires? maybe a random USB wire taken apart?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Doesn't the maxmedia thingy use a hard drive, rather than flash? your battery would last about 2 hours, it is worth it?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

Unless you plan to build hardware to serialize/deserialize the data, you are going to need more wires than a USB cable offers.

(32 as mentioned by spinal_cord).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">can i use superglue instead of solder, if i'm reaaaaal careful? :p (if not i guess i could ask the D.T department at school if i can burrow a solder..)
<br/>
<br/>
OK, so do i just solder the pins of the GBAMP to the pins of any other GBA game, do i have to do anything else to the GBA game?
<br/>
<br/>
and how about 32 paperclips (those ones with the plastic covers?)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
can i just simply stick the wires in the holes above each pin on the GBA game?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You shouldn't try using super glue to stick wires together, it will soak underneeth and get between the contects, you will end up with two metal bit glued with no conduction. usless realy.
<br/>
<br/>
I soldered to the contacts on both the cart (tv tuner) a wanted to extend, and an ole GB cart (tetris). If your using a GB cart (better than soldering directly to the gba slot) make sure you kill the cart first, I slised throuth the circuit board behind the contact, leaving the contacts seperate from the rest of the cart. Also make sure you get the connections the right way round, you dont want to kill your GBAMP AND GBASP!
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, surely anything you make to wrap the gbamp round the bottom will stick out anyway?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I obviously don't have the resources (I lost my wires somehow :( and I don't have a solder anyway) 
<br/>
<br/>
so has anyone got any suggestions of how else to make the GBAMP stick out less? Has anyone actually attempted making it smaller?
<br/>
<br/>
would it be safe to cut the GBA connector pins by half way?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

2mm is quite a lot for reducing the sticking-out-ness imo, try holding the GBAMP under your DS and slide it up to approx how small it would look after, and imho it looks much better
<br/>
<br/>
and by the way, for my original idea for this thread, no, nothing would stick out except the gbamp stuck on the back (as badly shown in these pictures)

(the 1st and 2nd pics show the 1cm of space in which the wires can easilly come out of and the 3rd pic is just an example thing trying to show the 1cm but you cant really see it at all)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
