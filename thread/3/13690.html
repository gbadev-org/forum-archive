    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello:
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a complete noob to the GBA Dev scene and i have a question that I haven't found an answer to.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to write a game to a regular GBA Cartridge, specifically "update" a game, some of you may alreadu know that a Fan Translation of Boktai 3 is being done...
<br/>
<br/>
What I want to do is to upload the patched game to an original Boktai cartridge (I already own Boktai 3 in japanese) so that I can play it with real sunlight.
<br/>
<br/>
So, does anyone here can help me or point me out on what do I need to do in order to acomplish this?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any help provided.
<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,
<br/>

 i dont think it does execute code in the flash, i have'nt investigeted the pokemon ruby cart fully as i dont get alot od spare time, it does'nt have the standard 64k EEprom though it's a full 512 mbit flash and i know that the game is interactive abd the data stored in flash effects gameplay, 512mbit is a lot of space just to store save data, it would be worth investigating further</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know Pok?mon Ruby has some sort of patching system. When that bug was discovered where berries weren't able to grow after a year had passed on the RTC, they were able to patch it somehow. I imagine there are some routines (interrupt handlers, an init routine, etc) that are loaded to RAM. The game would just load code/patching info from flash if it finds any, otherwise from ROM. That would be enough to hack in a check that resets the year counter every now and then so the bug is never triggered, since the game doesn't use years for anything anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
A possible option for this particular case is to get a flash/RAM cartridge that you could wire a solar sensor into, and patch the game to use it. If you don't mind not using it on a DS, you could also wire one to the link port.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Are you sure they didn't just copy your savegame to a new cart?
<br/>
<br/>
And I am very sure that the original game did not have 512mbit (64mbyte!) of flash in it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sure. Some <span style="font-style: italic">Pok?mon</span> titles for Nintendo GameCube were able to <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Colosseum" target="_blank">install the berry fix over the link cable</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's a thought I had just now. What if the berry fix is not actually written to dedicated "patch-flash" but to the savegame instead? If it's big enough... copy it into IWRAM and run it!

<br/>
I think LoadingNOW or Chiklit once sent me a pre-patched savegame that showed a scene from one of the anime and gave the player a Jirachi. I'll contact them right away.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It seems unlikely they actually figured "this could break" and put a check to use alternate logic in the berry code, so this seems like a more feasible idea. Or maybe they just set the clock back?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
