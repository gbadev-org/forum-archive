<br/>
Don't know if related but I connected a GBA SP Headphone adapter to my GBA SP console, and this was the only thing I did to my GBA SP console before my GBA SP and SuperCard SD failed.
<br/>
Had check with other GameBoy cartridges and they are loaded and work, so the problem is in my SuperCard SD.
<br/>
The SD card is fine, at least my computer reads and writes to it.
<br/>
The Headphone adapter works and have not cause any trouble with other game cartridges.
<br/>
Does someone knows how to checked a SuperCard SD, and what could I try to make my SuperCard SD work?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
