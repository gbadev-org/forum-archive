    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">looking at <a href="http://www.flashadvance.com" target="_blank">www.flashadvance.com</a> I found:
<br/>
<a href="http://61.10.196.46/gbalinker/downloads/images/ExtremeV125.zip" target="_blank">http://61.10.196.46/gbalinker/downloads/images/ExtremeV125.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
its a 16Mbyte file. if you are on a dial up connection I can remove all
<br/>
the stuff from the .zip that isnt really needed (adobe acrobat reader, lots of gba demos etc). that should get it down to 3-4MB
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: ok Ive removed the stuff and the file is just 1.7MByte now so even
<br/>
if youre on a fast connection you might prefer this:
<br/>
<a href="http://gbadev.org/files/ExtremeV125_no_acrobat_or_demos.zip" target="_blank">http://gbadev.org/files/ExtremeV125_no_acrobat_or_demos.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
the drivers you wanted can also be found on that site, but you have them
<br/>
now i assume?

Thanks for helping though now the Send tool doesn't work at all!

The software itself works, but it just doesn't recognizes the flash itself...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

At least with 1.25 all you have to do is leave it unplugged whilst your not using it and then plug it in when you want to use it and it will be fine.

I'm going to get a parellel cable and power adapter anyway, cause this is bloody ridiculous and I've heard that that method works all the time. Sort of misses the point why I bought the USB version in the first place, but at least this way I get a working solution all the time and don't have to fiddle.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The old Visoly linker needs -9V DC at 500 mA. (I'm reading that off my old linker's AC adapter; I don't know if that's changed with the new linker.)  RadioShack (or your local equivalent) sells universal AC to DC adapters with several connectors; at least one should fit.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It tells you everything in the UserGuide pdf file you get with the 1.25 software. 500mA 9v power adapter and parellel cable is a DB25 male to male, which I think is more commonly known as a Null Modem cable.
