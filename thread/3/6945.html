<br/>
There is a jack accessible to the faceplate (under the faceplate, above the b button) that says V-5(5 volts, I assume) on the circuit board.  The image of the jack is here - upper right: <a class="postlink" href="http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/2005/0913/gb30.jpg" target="_blank">http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/2005/0913/gb30.jpg</a>

EDIT - I was incorrect.  This is not Nintendo's patent, and they don't appear to have one related to faceplates -  </span>Nintendo is patenting 'smart' faceplates. <a class="postlink" href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PG01&amp;s1=nintendo&amp;s2=faceplate&amp;OS=nintendo+AND+faceplate&amp;RS=nintendo+AND+faceplate" target="_blank">Extra WIIIIIDE Link!</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Questions: 
<br/>
<br/>
When will Nintendo or Third Parties release Smart Faceplates? 
<br/>
<br/>
Where can we buy plugs for those jacks, to make our own powered faceplates?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's possible that those inventors are Nin?endo employees who have assigned the invention to their employer per the employment contract, but the assignee might not show up until the patent is issued. True, there are a lot of other computing-tech companies in Greater Seattle, but Micro$oft denies rumors that it's working on an Xboy.
<br/>
<br/>
I checked the images and the illustrations look like the invention is intended for a cellphone, not a GBA. So it's likely not Nin?endo's patent.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

hmmmm...
<br/>
now if i were readly taking apart my micro like that(if i owned i micro :( oh well) that would be the first thing i would mess with(i dont care how long it took for nintendo to figure out to set them at that level...) if say i was always testing stuff on it, turn it up some. if i'm always on the go, i might turn it down a little ::shrug:: .
<br/>
sorry i just dont like people telling people not to do things to somting when obviously they are the kind of people who might do somthing like that.(after all this is a <span style="text-decoration: underline">developers</span> forum.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know what the dial does, but if you remember back when the gba first came out people were adjusting a dial like that and it made the screen look brighter so people tried it. it had the adverse effects of damaging the screen.

If these voltages are out of adjustment then the LCD will no longer respond correctly. The result will be an excess charge built up in the liquid crystal and permanently damage the LCD. 
<br/>
<br/>
The excessive charge gives the appearance of a brighter screen because the liquid crystal is not reacting properly to the voltages applied. When the adjustment of the voltages is correct the changing polarities will not allow a charge to build up, which prolongs the LCD life.
<br/>
<br/>
Adjusting the flicker without the proper tools and lighting will put the voltages out of sync and may cause damage to the unit.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Nokia 3220 has faceplates similar to what is described there - there is a serial port hidden underneath a rubber cover near the battery that faceplates can connect to.  There is only one faceplate with this capability so far, AFAIK.  It has a row of LEDs, an accelerometer, and some games that use the accelerometer.  The row of LEDs is so you can 'draw' messages in the air (not sure what the proper term for this is) by waving it back and forth.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be neat if Nintendo had included these kinds of capabilities.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: And no, that is not a connector, unfortunately.  It is a variable resistor (potentiometer).  That is why it has 'VR1' printed next to it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
