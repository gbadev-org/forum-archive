    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh.  Well, I've been awake since frickin' 6:00pm, yesterday.  My brain isn't functioning too well and I'll be heading to bed, soon.  I'll accept any flaming 'cause I'll more than likely deserve it.
<br/>
<br/>
On to my thought;
<br/>
Might there be a way to use the GSA v1/v2 cart as a flash-linker/card?  Maybe someone could figure out how to intercept the GSAsp/GSAv1-v2/ARv3 software to write something else to it?  Hmmm...  There may not be that much space, though...  The only things being written to it are ASCII-form codes and game-save data...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was just thinking that this could be awsome for Devers out there without enough money to go out and buy a flash linker.  Could be used for testing home brew stuff and backing up ROMs.  Huh, does the hardware require a cart to be inserted into the GSA or could that be worked out on the software-side?  If that isn't a problem then it'd be easier to test homebrew ROMs 'cause you wouldn't have to have a GBA cart inserted.
<br/>
<br/>
Eh, if any of these ideas make sense, please reply.  I'll look forward to any feedback on this concept I can get.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for hearing me out.  =)
