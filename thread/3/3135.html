<br/>
<br/>
I'm wondering if there is any way to tell how much battery life is left in the GBA ? Has anyone written any ROM's for this ? Or seen any functionality in the SDK's that would show this ?
<br/>
<br/>
I really hate it when my battery light comes on, and I'm too far from a save point :)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not too sure on this one, but i remember a game (zelda on gbc?) that knew when the battery was low so i assume there is a flag somewhere to say if the red light is on, but I doubt you can view it in percentages.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>
