    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello there!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm about to convert my gbasp into something that will sitt in my car (can't find the right word for it) and I want it to be as small as possible.
<br/>
However, I noticed that the gbasp didn't start when I had removed the battery.
<br/>
Yes, I did connect the power supply.
<br/>
Does anyone know if it is possible to run the gbasp only from the power supply without the battery?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Your problem might be that you didn't connect the 2 battery slots together, instead you might of only connected the positive to the positive on one battery and the negative to negative on the other. The batteries are in series not parallel. If that's not the problem, test it with a multimeter and make sure the current and voltage is the required voltage. I have connected many circuits with insufficient current before due to people tampering with the power supply.

I haven't done it myself but I am sure it will work, there is no way it shouldn't.
<br/>
<br/>
If that doesn't work simply get an adapter for it at the store. I got one for $4.00 Canadian.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure what you mean with two batteries. The gbasp contains one rechargeable battey that can be recharged using the including power supply. If I remove the battery and connect the power supply to the EXT. 2 port the gbasp  won't start, just flashes the display for a second and then dies.
<br/>
<br/>
If I measure the voltage at the not connected power supply I get 5.3V, which seems right. But when I connect it to the EXT.2 port the voltage i gone (still with no battery).
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the power supply is intelligent enough to think that the battery is fully recharged and enters a tri-state mode.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">did you try shorting the connection in the now empty battery compartment?  Maybe the GBA is always running off the battery, even when connected up -- sorta like a UPS configuration on a PC?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have my power adapter with me, or otherwise, I would've tried this already :)<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA SP probably runs it's power through the battery first before anything else.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not a professional or anything, but I think if you connect a wire to the 2 contacts where the GBA SP battery contacts would be, then that just might work.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry I only have a regular GBA, that's what I was refering to. I haven't had a look at the SP closely. I feel stupid for not reading that part first.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The shorting method didn't work, as I suspected, but I had to try it anyway :)
<br/>
I also tried to connect 4V directly to the battery contacts and that worked fine. That seems to be the only way to power the gbasp without the battery and that is the way I will do it.
<br/>
zazery: Don't feel stupid, I'm glad for any response I can get :)
