    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, so I have this idea. If it ever panned out it would take the support of this whole community and possible more. I really don't have any concrete ideas, so without further rambling, here is what I have so far.
<br/>
<br/>
gameboy attachment\cart. that lets you have wifi linking with a servers list and scores and whatnot
<br/>
<br/>
its a cartridge, which instead of an end, it has an opening for another game, like the XPloder.
<br/>
<br/>
if it can be done, there is an external antennae that connects in the ext. port, and the wifi is 
<br/>
<br/>
brought in through this.
<br/>
<br/>
thats the basics, it just has to be done really well. 
<br/>
this entails:
<br/>
smooth lines... looks like it belongs on the gba, and we shall offer custom paint jobs,for rather cheap.
<br/>
cart. made so the child cart doesnt stick out very far.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What you have just read is my idea on the hardware.  let me know what you think.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tihnk it would be cool, to even make a linkcable to usb (or use availiable ones) and play gba over teh internet..i've heard all the arguements for the whole lag thing, but what about for games like final fantasy tactics advance...and wouldnt a program be able to pulse the last recieved signal back to your gba in so many ms? to trick the gba into thinking that one singal is however many signals... would destroy most games, but some i tihnk may work... just a thought...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, so you are saying my idea couldnt work?
<br/>
<br/>
a signal goes to a computer from a gba, and to another computer and gba... with netplay or seemeplayme or something, thats not what im asking about right now... but when the computer sends the signal to the gba, can't the computer take its last signal and send that in rapid repetition to the gba, and the gba think it was getting &gt;1ms ping? li8ke i said, only swell in turn based games and whatnot, but could do it nonetheless...
<br/>
<br/>
just a theory...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It would be entirley dependent on the link protocol the game uses.  Many games abort linkplay if so much as one byte fails to be recieved immediately.  Games dependent on timing to seed a random number generator would desync quickly as one player has different outcomes than the other.  I think it's completely impossible, unless games are written from the ground up to support such a feature.
<br/>
The only kind of internet multplayer GBA I could forsee is emulating two linked systems, then using normal netplay on two input joysticks.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yup, that's the so-called "TGB Dual method", and the Nintendo DS is probably powerful enough to do that with a port of Goomba to the DS, hopefully even with GBC support.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm....
<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people seem to think that turn-based games do not require immediate responses, like FF Tactics, so the internet lag will not pose a problem. This is not true.
<br/>
<br/>
The response <span style="font-weight: bold">must</span> be immediate, no matter what kind of game. The GBA has an internal sync clock, and when data is sent, it expects an immediate response. For example, in NORMAL_MODE the GBA master sends 32 bits of data, (example) 0000 5DCF. The slave GBA will also send data AT THE SAME TIME, (example) 34FF 0000. 00005DCF is the data sent, 34FF0000 is reply for the previous data sent (cause it happens at the same time). Every bit must be sent within a few micro seconds, im not sure. The XBOO parrelel port cable works withouts delays in between bits. Anyway, see Martin's GBATEK.
<br/>
<br/>
The internet lag is just a lot more longer, no matter how fast your internet connection is, it wont work, also because of networking uncertainties. While waiting for a reply, the internal clock GBA will go out of sync.
<br/>
<br/>
True, some games will not abort transfer if failed to receive data, but it is the GBA that handles this and the timing, not the program. If u are out sync, then it will start taking in rubbish data. This is the main reason why this wont work.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in the future, when the transfer rates reach absurd speeds, then u can think about this idea. Relax dude, there are a lot of other ideas to ponder.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know, I'm just bored...
<br/>
<br/>
But did you at least understand my idea? I know it's not the most coherent sentence, but I think it makes sense, at least.
<br/>
<br/>
when the computer recieves data from the other computer, it repeats this data over and over repeatedly to the GBA until it recieves a new data packet, of which it then sends over and over to the GBA yet again... 
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking that would override the out-of-sync idea, since the GBA could receive signals with less than 1ms ping... 
<br/>
<br/>
Just an idea, I'm clearly no genius.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
