    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anybody know where I might be able to find Eagle files for a GBA cartridge and/or wireless adapter? I've largely given up hope of finding a GBA/slot-2 cartridge with flash that exposes the i/o pins (like the DSbrut), and moved on to Plan B... making one. 
<br/>
<br/>
The electronics, I can handle easily. Getting the physical form factor right is what scares me (I'd feel a lot more confident sending off the files to Sparkfun if I knew that someone else had built at least one board with the same outline &amp; it fit properly). As far as the wireless adapter, they're so cheap ($2.99 @ Gamestop), I kind of figure that if I ended up being unable to build my own flash cart, I could always remove the board from a wireless adapter, unsolder the connector, and transfer it to a board of my own making (preferably, one that can fit inside the same shell) with an AVR flashed to pretend it's a multiboot host &amp; upload the program into the 256k ram area THAT way.
<br/>
<br/>
By the same token... is a cartridge shell necessary to hold the board in place, or can a bare board with the right dimensions be plugged in &amp; work reliably? I haven't been able to try it yet because I'm still waiting for my tri-blade screwdriver to get here in another couple of days...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
