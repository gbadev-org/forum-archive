    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I just finished making and testing a GB cartridge. It is nothing big, and it is not made for gaming.
<br/>
<br/>
The idea is to use the GB and GBA for controll and other type of HW interface.
<br/>
<br/>
The board has a PLCC socket for flash memoery up to 4megabit and 16 bidirectional digital IO.
<br/>
<br/>
You can find more information about the board at:

<br/>
<br/>
I am working on a new board now and would like to hear your opinion about what you think should be onthe board.
<br/>
<br/>
All comments are very welcome,
<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You developed that by yourself? It looks very profesional! Didn't you have to solder the boards by yourself?
<br/>
<br/>
Are you working on a GBA or GB board now? You could add some kind of GBA &lt;-&gt; PC port at the cart that may be used for fast data transfer/debugging/whatever =)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
Actually yes, it is my own design, I send it off to a PCB making compnay and put the components on it myself. That is my job (what I do normally).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the ideas. I am actually working on a GBA board, slightly larger than a normal GBA cart, but with some IO, USB connection to a PC and 16megabit for program and 2 megabits of SRAM. This one will need an external power source and will be mainly used for robotic and data sampling using the GBA units, but I am not completly finished outlining the idea yet.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi All,
<br/>
I had to give up the idea for GBA for a while due to some personal problems.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I have finished a GB board with similar to the one I mentioned earlier, but with SRAM and 8 IO. Is there anyone who would like to participate in the programming/beta testing of the board?
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">I will give you a free GB/GBC cart, while you testing and debugging it you will keep the board for yourself, but any test code you write will be public domain and will be on my future web site.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
If you agree with the terms, send me a note and if you have a web site or any program you have done for GB/GBC.
<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for 2-3 people, so if you are interested and have the knowledge and time, let me know.
<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,
<br/>

<br/>
PS. The board has 1meg SRAM and 4 mega FLASH, with one Xilinx XC9536 CPLD, one expantion connector, and one connector for IO.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">PS2, I know this is GBA forum, but I thought maybe someone here maybe interested.</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
