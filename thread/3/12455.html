<br/>
<br/>
I have googled but came up with no information.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone attemped to add an LED edgelight to original GBA display? I mean the white SMD LEDs. They are like 2x3 mm in the area and 1.5 mm in height, so they should be possible to fit into the chassis. Any other experience on edgelight? Does one need any sort of foil to scatter the light?
<br/>
<br/>
From the photos, the Afterburner mentioned here on the forum so often seems to be an electroluminiscent foil, which usually is expensive, unreliable and an energy-waster, so that is not so interesting.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you can find a short enough cold cathode fluorescent tube, that could do the job - though all I could find on Farnell is a 2.6mm diameter and 205mm length one (5mA drawn), but I'm sure if you looked deeper you might be able to find a shorter one.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling that the GBA SP might have one of those in it?<br/>_________________<br/>I'd like to think this signature is under development, but it isn't.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
