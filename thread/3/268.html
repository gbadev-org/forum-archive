The purpose could be anything ... let's say create a dialer, TCP/IP stack and a tiny HTML brower and surf the net :-)  
<br/>
<br/>
My question was regarding the hardware side - is voltage-conversion required (probably yes) ? Anything else important to be included (PIC-like CPU, etc.) ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They just sent out their sdk doc for review a week or so ago.  It's not a modem, It's a bluetooth cart +flash?  and it needs a usb dongle for your pc to program it/connect to the net.    The sdk looks very simple to use and they will do their own game distrib/money collection.  Looks cool if it ever takes off.  I ran across the reference at <a href="http://www.eet.com" target="_blank">www.eet.com</a> (EE times)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, you could try making a Shark MX clone, those have built-in modems. Of course, when I got mine (new, nonetheless), I didn't know it needed a special service that had stopped being offered. I wonder if a gameshark could 'unlock' it for me to use with my own dialup servers and such...?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
