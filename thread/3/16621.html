    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As I did post earlier before, I'm having some "white" dotelike thing on my display (not dead pixel) and so I did use screwdriver to open it up.
<br/>
<br/>
But guess what, when I did open it i found out that display itself is covered by glass that is, in my opinion (here you come in to say if I am correct) glued to display ??
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,  that "white" thing is between LCD display and glass (the glass I could clean without even opening the thing in the first place.)
<br/>
<br/>
So I would like to know is there any way to temoprarly remove that thing that so I can clean display itself?
