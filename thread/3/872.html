    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I opted for the no bundled games package from Dixions. Wrestling isn't my thing. Although I could have had that starwars jobbie and wrestling in another bunddle. [I think the whole wrestling thing put me off]
<br/>
<br/>
So I bought a Gameboy Advance SP, in Silver @ ?89 Sterling.
<br/>
<br/>
Things I've noted so far:
<br/>
<br/>
* The battery is a Li-ion 600mAH and it's a square blue thing in mine -  as yet I don't know how long it lasts. I would guess less than 3 hours, given a 200ma drain ofcourse. It probably says somewhere on some bit of paper that came with it, but was to excited to read; and there is nothing like trying it out for real is there.
<br/>
<br/>
* The back lit screen would appear to be effective enough. 
<br/>
<br/>
* No headphone jack. Hmm say what? you need an adapter to use headphones, seems a little silly no?
<br/>
<br/>
* My mono speaker hisses like a snake on full volume and it really irretates me. Has anyone else got this trouble with the SP - I know, the standard GBA's hisses a little, but I mean major big python or something when I say hiss, it's very annoying indeed. ( please tell me mine is broken and I need to take it back for a replacement ) - to test it I took the gamepak out, whaked the volume up and turned it on.
<br/>
<br/>
* The gamepak's go in the same way up as they did on the GBA - there was a rumor that they were going to be the other way around so gamepaks with tilt sitches may not have worked.
<br/>
<br/>
* The SP accepted my Flash2Advance 128MB cart without any undue protest, and even ran the last load of code I burnt onto it. I havn't tried burning the F2L cart via the SP yet.
<br/>
<br/>
? Will the one with the silver casing, when it gets scratched, show black and/or grey underneath? I should have bought the black version, damn shop assistants. [ allways make your own mind up :-) ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you think about it they are rotated around 180deg - this will swap a tilt pak's perception of left/right and up/down.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh yes, as you say. I didn't think about it - well I did but that didn't give me the correct answer, urgo it's time for me to stop thinking.
<br/>
<br/>
Colour: I have scratched the silver SP a little on the bottom  seems some dark colour to me underneath; I am not going to maul it on purpose to find out - that will probably happen anyway when I put it in my pocket.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
