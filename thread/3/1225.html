    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm under WinXP, just received my brand new MBV2 but didn't succeed using it.
<br/>
Here's what I did :
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Userport (everything gone well)
<br/>
&gt; then MB.EXE &gt;&gt; displayed this :
<br/>
    "ERROR - No hardware found on selected parallel port!"
<br/>
(tryed to set my // port mode to ECP, EPP and ECP+EPP but still the same error)
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; GiveIO did install without any problem, but didn't want to Start ("An unexpected error occured")
<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be highly appreciated !
<br/>

programms using the paralell port.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, and thanks for the answer,
<br/>
<br/>
But I already tried (he says that Userport should solve the problem, but in my case, this unfortunately didn't work... I'm absolutely sure that I did the good manipulations (which are pretty simple in fact...)
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anithing else I could try? (I already checked my // port, which works fine)

If not, talk through what you are doing and where it goes wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
This helps to round down the possible problems</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I've had an answer from the author of the (excellent) HAM engine E. Schleussinger...
<br/>
Then if someone has the same problem, I'll give the same advice I received : use Direct-IO (http://www.direct-io.com), which is a 30 trial day shareware, and that is the only program that worked for me.
<br/>
<br/>
A big thank to people who tried to help me !
