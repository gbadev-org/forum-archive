    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">um...i got an old gba modded with after burner if you want...
<br/>
what i think is that afterburner loses its effectiveness after a time period, maybe reduce to 80% brightness. also it eats battery pretty heavily, if you use a 1.2v recharable battery as oppose to a 1.5v normal battery, there's a possiblity that the game might not able to save with the light on full settings, reducing the voltage to even lower levels. the light is not really even, it has this "trapezoid effect" which there appears to be 2 slanted line from the 2 edges of the screen. also, installation is a bitch...
<br/>
<br/>
get gba SP 2, you'll save yourself a lot of trouble, maybe even some money. the screen of the new gbasp has this even BRIGHT light to it...extremely tight. and the shape isnt really that much of a concern, i got use to a gbasp pretty soon. and i like it much better than the gba original
<br/>
<br/>
on a completely different note, my gba original is also overclocked =]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you like the horizontal form factor of the Game Gear, Lynx, Nomad, and original GBA, and you want a lit screen, then get a Nintendo DS. It's shaped sort of like an original GBA, if a bit heavier. In addition, the gbadev scene seems to be dying in favor of the dsdev scene :(<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
