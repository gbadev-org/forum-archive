<br/>
<br/>
Iam want to know how the GBA works inside, I dont know a lot of electronics, but I want to learn. Do someone have ideas where I can start?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You need to learn a lot to understand how the electronics make the gameboy work, but if you want to know it at the programmer level read GBATEK or any other document like it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah, ive studied that a lot and now I want to take it further and understand what is happening inside.
<br/>
<br/>
for example.
<br/>
what does hardware support mean in a physic point of view?
<br/>
If ive understand it correctly: it is a chip with the code but why is that much faster then if I would do it in software?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is more of a general Computer Science question than a GBA question (not that there's a problem with that).

I liked this book:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0763716332" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0763716332</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It is a very broad book, organized by level of abstraction.  Application programs are at the highest level and logic gates are at the lowest.  My favorite part was looking at a diagram of a working CPU and not only understanding its components but also why it works together.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know some introductory books that are more focused on the hardware level?
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:  There's also a fun program called LogicWorks that lets you interactively design digital circuits and see how they work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
