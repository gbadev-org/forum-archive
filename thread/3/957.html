    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, i got a brand new flash2advance linker and a 256M Flash Advance Pro cart, connected on LPT1. But i seem to be unable to flash the cart correctly. Verify always fails, each time at a different block. The flashed software is always more or less broken (crashes, sometimes just gfx is f***ed up).
<br/>
<br/>
Here's some output of F2AW 2.0NT:

Sometimes even the i.Linker screen on the GBA is screwed up. I have tried every speed setting, with no success.
<br/>
<br/>
Is the cart broken? The cable? The LPT interface?
<br/>
Anything else i could try?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're using an SP (you didn't mention), try turning the light off.
<br/>
<br/>
Failing that, your cart/cable/other could just be duff - have you got another cable/cart/gba/puter to test with?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
