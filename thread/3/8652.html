    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all!
<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to start a new hardware project using GBA Flash Cartridges as storage media for a data logger.
<br/>
<br/>
However, it is quite difficult to find the manufacturer of the GBA cartridge connector. Does anyone know where can I find/buy such connector?
<br/>
<br/>
I plan to produce about 100 units per year, so a savaged connector from an old gameboy is not a solution ...
<br/>

Bye,

<br/>
<br/>
By the way, after doing some research in the internet, I have found two places to buy the connector:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.mcminone.com." target="_blank">www.mcminone.com.</a> Part number 83-2285 - Price $3.63/ud
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.gaminggraveyard.com." target="_blank">www.gaminggraveyard.com.</a> Part number GBY-00001 - Price: $6.99/ud

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You might try asking Lynx where he gets the GBC connectors.
<br/>
<br/>
Or you could try implementing an SD interface through the Game Link port.
<br/>
<br/>
Or you could use a SuperCard SD.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is a homebrew library supporting a number of different types of mass storage devices for the GBA / DS.  Google for chishm FAT and you should find it.
<br/>
<br/>
A gbamp is a nice, cheap choice, $20 or so for the GBA cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, on your custom hardware, you could use a CF socket and the 14 pin or so microcontroller interface (8+3+2+1 data,address,control,is_inserted, IIRC) on your logger hardware.  As a bonus, your customers could also copy the data to a PC without a seperate reader or cable (well, they'd need a CF reader, but that's one less part you have to build).
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, as long as you're willing to buy lots (100s), you can probably get GBA connectors quite cheap, as tepples suggested, ask lynx.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat
