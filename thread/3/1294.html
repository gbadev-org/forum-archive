    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been waiting for a Gameboy MP3 player since the SongPro/SongBoy was first announced and I've more or less lost track of what's vapour and what's not.  (My interest waned after I got an iPod.)  Does anyone know if this is in fact the first Gameboy (Advance) MP3 player to actually turn into a product that people can buy?

Their cart outputs the sound itself - it seems Datel's uses the GBA for this and so MP3s played using it probably sound like ass.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
