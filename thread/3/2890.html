Hmm are you speaking of a flash card?
<br/>
Things are a bit more complicated than that. For example a flash card stores data in a format incompatable with the GBA cartridge system.  Thus a few wire splices will not get you much of anything other than a dead card reader. :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah like a memory card for a camera, could i splice wires to make it meet with the gba link cable. run the reader off the gba 5v should be enough. and load one the flash card with the gamewallet os files. that way i have the os in there. i already have a flash cart so i would send all my apps and homebrew stuff there from the reader. in essence making my own gamewallet. (just to transfer info, i know you can't run games off of it due to speeds of the cards themselves)

<br/>
But more importantly, the wire protocol that the GBA uses over cart or over multiboot isn't directly compatible with the wire protocol that CompactFlash, SmartMedia, MMC, or whatever else uses; it's the Game Wallet's job to translate between GBA-multiboot and the camera flash cards' protocols. That's the same reason you need an intelligent cable between the PC's USB port and a GBA; the GBA doesn't speak USB-mass-storage-device.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thats what i am trying to see. if the game wallet is just a glorified card reader (meaning the software installed on the card does all the work) or is the wallet have usb protocol specifically for that built in. btw thanks so far to all</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Answer to first question NO.
<br/>
Answer to second question NO.
<br/>
<br/>
Both wrong.
<br/>
The game wallet has a computer in it and software to act as a USB periferal (USB is NOT I repeat NOT a simple protocol it's quite complex even for a simple periferal as the game wallet).
<br/>
<br/>
The game wallet acts as a Mass Storage device (USB Bulk transfer) to the interface.
<br/>
It converts the USB device querrys to something the MMC SMC SD card (and whatever else it supports) and accesses the data acordingly.
<br/>
<br/>
As for how it handles games et al. I've never seen it in action, if it 'backs' up grames then it likely uses the multiboot protocol to read a cartridge and do a few other things.  At this point I donno :)
<br/>
<br/>
However it's not just a simple device. It's a computer in and of itself and thus has definate firmware in it for handling at the very least multiboot, USB, and flash media cardds.
