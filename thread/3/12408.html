    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, i was just thinking about doing a 4-face button gameboy advance.
<br/>
<br/>
The next two buttons would be X and Y respectively (duuh)
<br/>
This is my main idea: <a class="postlink" href="http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/3412/qweup8.jpg" target="_blank">View image</a>
<br/>
<br/>
what i want to do, is solder 4 wires (2 for each button) from select, 2 to A and 2 to B, my question is, will the voltage go crazy?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You should disassemble the GBA, turn it on, and probe whether the buttons actually have a common voltage source. Probe against the ground. You will find ground areas where screws and all sorts of metallic shields connect to the board.
<br/>
<br/>
Then you make your own switches, and wire this source through the switch to the input wires - ones where there is no voltage upon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I forgot about my GBA for a while, now I want to do this project. Really.
<br/>
<br/>
All the info I need is:
<br/>
<br/>
Do all the buttons connect from Testpoints to ground? Or maybe some go to +V?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would love to help, but don't see how this works. would the third and fourth buttons be read as select+A = 3, select+B = 4? you're gonna need some diodes to prevent the buttons from tying together. if you solder a wire from select, to A, to your switch, it's gonna trigger select and A if you press any of the buttons by themselves.
<br/>
<br/>
A = select + A
<br/>
select = select + A
<br/>
button 3 = select + A
<br/>
<br/>
unless there's a known way to wire this up that I don't know about, you're gonna need more than just wire.
<br/>
<br/>
you mine as well just wire up switches to the i/o port, and use general purpose mode to read extra keys, that way you get 4 extra buttons. you're gonna need custom software either way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought about another way.
<br/>
I'm just gonna make a pcb. The pcb will be just a miniaturized button (combining two buttons L and A), mainly it will be named the X button. And it will all be pressed by a rubber "button"(Don't know how to say it) just like the other buttons work.
<br/>
<br/>
Something like this:

<br/>
<br/>
I know where the testpoints are.
<br/>
The same thing will be done with Y ( It'll be L+B)
<br/>
The only thing i need to know now is:
<br/>
Do all testpoints connect with GND?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
