    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I've been looking into the pinout located on this website.  First off, I want to output to a TV.  I'm wondering how to combine the syncs so I can properly wire to an RGB encoder, since I'm assuming the LCD has RGB signals somewhere.  However, the gameboy isn't color, so I'm wondering if it even has RGB to output?  Does it have luma somewhere?  Thanks for the help, especially on my first post.
<br/>
<br/>
Almost forgot, how do I fix the sync to be 15.7khz?  I know it's too low, is there some sort of scandoubler type thing that just regulates it to work on a TV?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
