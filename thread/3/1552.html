<br/>
<br/>
I had a strange problem with my GBA. Yesterday I was playing and it hanged. Then, when I tried to restart it, the ONLY screen that appears is the GameboyColor system, even if I had an ADVANCE game or cartdrige. Of course no game works again, and all I can do is the switch betweew 16/9 and 4/3! Is there anyone that could help me? I CANNOT use it anymore, because it does always the same with or without cartdrige and even the keys don't work. I installed the AFTERBURNER kit: could this affect something?
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is a switch in the cart slot.  When it is pressed, the GBA assumes that GBC cart is in the slot and acts like a GBC.  I might have that mixed up.  GBA &lt;-&gt; GBC

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sgeos is right.  There's a switch.
<br/>
<br/>
Look on the back of a GBA game, and you'll see two small notches denoting that the game uses GBA multiplexed bus protocol. You won't see them on a monochrome or GBC game.
<br/>
<br/>
Now look into a healthy GBA system's Game Pak slot. On the side of the edge connector closest to the R button, there's a switch. Down for GBC, up for GBA. Leave the pak open, press the switch down, and turn on the power, and you'll see the GBC boot screen.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone.
<br/>
I found out the switch, but it is already UP in the correct GBA configuration game setting, and nothing seems to change even if it is down. The only boot I have is the GBC one, with or without game cartdrige. The switch phisically works (it goes up or down), but nothing changes in the system. What more can I do? Is there a possibility that there is a problem with the "S2" connector (where there is the afterburner link) on the motherboard or this thing doesn't affect at all?
<br/>
Thank you all</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't know how the switch works.  It's possible that the button you can see presses another button in the GBA (kind of like the microswitches in arcade machine buttons.)  If thats the case, then the internal button might be jammed.  I think tepples' (grammar!?) idea is more like-ly (ok, so forget grammar).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the afterburner kit is no more installed, but my GBA stills start with the GBC system, and even the internal contacts are clean. What I can't really undestand is that this thing happened hours later I installed the afterburner and before it worked great!
<br/>
Do you have any idea (maybe the last one) of what can I do now?

Thaks again......</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
