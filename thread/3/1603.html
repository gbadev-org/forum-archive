    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So what's the lowest temperature the GBA's LCD screen can survive? Don't tell me to put it in the fridge and see for myself - I haven't got a GBA yet, but my boss is pondering the thought of using GBA for a non-games project and so we need to know what weather conditions it can survive in. :-|<br/>_________________<br/>Guns for show, knives for a pro</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA can survive in an industrial range of temperatures or at least work somewhat.  The real problem is LCD's are temperature sensitive. IE they change there driving threshold depending on temperature.  In fact those cool thermometer things that they put on your forehead work very similiarly to an LCD. That being said I would say go to Samsung Sharp Hitachi or any other LCD manufacturers web site and pick the equivalent out.

If you've ever wondered what the contrast adjustment on an LCD does, it changes the threshhold voltage and LCD bias so the LCD can be visable and not black or empty at all times
