    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a very strange problem with my GBA SP and 256M Flash2Advance Cartridge: sometimes the GBA SP just shuts down while I am playing, or the power lamp turns red (although the GBA is fully loaded) then shuts down, starts again, shuts down again and so on. It wouldn't be _that_ stupid, but everytime this happens all my savegames get lost.
<br/>
This never happened when I played with my Doctor GB 64M Cart, so I assume it is not the GBA SP causing the problem but the F2A Cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone experienced that too? What could be causing that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
