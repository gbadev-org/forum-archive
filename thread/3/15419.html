<br/>
<br/>
I'm newbie for gameboy advance. i want to learn gba programming. First of all, i need a multiboot cable. i am searching a cable but i don't any homemade good cable. Many of cable, lpt port and rs232 whichs are required extra component, microcontroller etc. new computers (especially laptops)  dont have this ports.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i am expert on PIC microcontroller. PIC18F4550 have a usb port. I can build usb to gba multiboot cable, if i learn multiboot protocol. only i know, gba communicate  1 start, 16bit data, 1 stop bit. What do you know extra?
<br/>

One problem is that you can't install homemade drivers on 64-bit Windows anymore due to Microsoft's reliance on VeriSign for vetting driver publishers. My recommendation: implement something that the OS will recognize as a COM port, and handle as much of the translation between the USB serial device class and GBA multiboot serial as you can inside the PIC.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
