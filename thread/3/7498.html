I've had only a few problems in getting my Flash Advance 256 (essentially the same product as Flash2Advance Classic 256) or my GBAMP to work on the Game Boy Player. All have been fixed by cleaning the cart contacts with rubbing alcohol.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you have a NOR card (that is, one that doesn't take CF or SD cards), you might be able to get Datel's Advance Game Port adapter to work if you write one program to the card in single-ROM mode. However, emulation accuracy might not be the best.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
