In theory, it should be possible because the F2A cable and MBV2 cable are both PC-parallel-to-GBA-serial cables.  However, unless the F2A's flash chip uses the same bus protocols as Visoly Flash Advance Turbo carts, it means that Jeff F needs to add support for F2A carts to mb.exe.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
