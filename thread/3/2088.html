    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering if the MBV2 cable <a class="postlink" href="http://www.lik-sang.com//info.php?category=6&amp;products_id=1415&amp;" target="_blank">http://www.lik-sang.com//info.php?category=6&amp;products_id=1415&amp;</a> worked when the parrelel cable was unplugged from a computer? Can, for example, you boot the GBA with the cables attached, then disengage the cables and the GBA would continue operating? 
<br/>
<br/>
Context - Im working on solutions to the expense problems in exhibiting GBA work in a contemporary/fine art context (galleries). If I could exhibit sprite cycles, small slide shows etc without purchasing a flash/ROM cart for each GBA, I'd save alot of money.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I never used the multiboot cable but if your programs are under 256k, then yes, they can run unplugued from the cable. That's the basis of multiboot, to be able to run small program in ram. 
<br/>
<br/>
You could even bundle pogoshell with all of your rom and flash the rom. After that, you would only need your GBA with a link cable to transfer your roms to any other gba.<br/>_________________<br/>-Inside every large program is a small program struggling to get out. (Hoare's Law of Large Programs)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, you can disconnect the MBV2 cable from the GBA while the GBA is on, and the GBA will still run.  I've done this, and I've written code that will copy the running .mb image to another linked GBA system. Thus, I can transfer a program from PC to GBA (swap cables now) to GBA (swap cables now) to GBA. However, it's possible for a GBA to boot three other GBAs, but I haven't tried this seeing as how I only own two.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Awesome - thanks for the tips and for the pogoshell bit -
<br/>
<br/>
So as long as my GBA files are under 256kb on windows, they can run via cable? Sweet!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tepples, I would be very happy if you could supply me with some code/binary to test your mb send function as I have GBA's a plenty.
<br/>
And I would really like to use it in PocketNES as it's mb send isn't working to great and only between 2 GBA's.<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ghostlight: To run ROMs via cable, there's a second requirement, namely that they be compiled for multiboot.  See the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devrs.com/gba/files/mbv2faqs.php" target="_blank">MBV2 FAQs</a> for more information.
<br/>
<br/>
FluBBa: The code is not as polished as I'd like, but I sent it to the e-mail address at the bottom of your web site anyway. But can't PocketNES already replicate itself?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
