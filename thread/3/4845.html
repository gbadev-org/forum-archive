<br/>
Anyway, if I were to cut it at one end of the box thingy in the middle (pardon my non-computer illiterate terms :D) , would I be able to boot up the GBA if it was connected on the other end of it?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I need a DB25 Male Connector, and there's no Radio Shack here. (I might get one at a computer shop, but have no ride.) Anyone know of where to get one online?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also, I've never soldered wires before. I've removed the big grey protection part from about two inches of the wires (and pealed back some copper and strings that were also appearently guarding the wires). I have five of the required wires, and was wondering if I have to remove the color-coded outer layer from them too. (They're very tiny heh.) Won't the iron just melt that away as needed?<br/>_________________<br/>All knowledge is good; only the way it is put to use is good or evil.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yep, use the lighter to heat up the end of the wire for a second or two, then quickly remove the melted insulation with yer finger while it is still hot :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
A multimeter is a handheld, usually battery-operated device with a small display and wires going to two probes, + and -, which are placed at various points in a circuit. It can measure voltage across an element in a circuit, current between elements in a circuit, or resistance across an isolated element. To measure continuity of a cable, put one probe on a pin on one end of the cable and the other probe on the corresponding pin on the other end, and tell it to measure resistance. Low resistance means connected; disconnection will show up as maximum resistance.
<br/>
<br/>
Everything else is explained in the multimeter's manual.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Strictly, yes, but only if the 3.3V interface is not 5V tolerant.
<br/>
There are a number of reasons why it is not necessary in this particular case.
<br/>
The GBA use 3.3V CMOS levels while the PC parallell port use 5V TTL levels. 5V TTL levels do not actually reach 5V, they usually end up somewhere around 4.2V. The outputs are current limited to some degree.
<br/>
<br/>
Then consider the fact that a GBA in GBC mode will have 5V signals on it's link port. Think nintendo would design a product that breaks if two GBAs are hooked up to each other with a link cable with a GBA cart in one and a GBC cart in the other? I think not.
<br/>
So chances are good the GBA link port is in fact 5V tolerant.
<br/>
<br/>
However, there is one thing to watch out for. Don't leave your GBA hooked up to the PC while the GBA is powered off for any longer periods of time. In this state the PC will force some amount of current into the GBA by the signal lines. This is not a very good thing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
