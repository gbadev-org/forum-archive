    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know the GBA Movie Player (v2) reads from compact flash cards and is relatively cheap.  I believe it uses firmware to launch it's different applications.  Are there any firmware hacks available for it to run homebrew GBA code?

Searched, but couldn't find any.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Forget the GBA Movie Player, go buy the Supercard. you can play GBA/GB/NES/SMS/etc... game on it, listen to music, watch videos and abundance of other things. It is easier to use if your not going to dev games on it. the only down side is that if you like cheats you can only use the ones provided by the makers of Supercard. Other than that it work well.<br/>_________________<br/>Comming Soon: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.spyingwind.com" target="_blank">http://www.spyingwind.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
