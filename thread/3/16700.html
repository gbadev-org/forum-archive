I am thinking of using the GBA-Port to program AVRs, guess that serial and ISP can be combined on a test board.
<br/>
However i am just too unsure/noob to actually start it yet. Guess i'll get the components on my breadboard next week.

It's a shame that my lappy doesn't have COM/LPT anymore for some other cheap, non-china programmer/eval board.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
