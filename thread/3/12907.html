    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm finishing a homebrew GBA game.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you know any company that make GBA cartridges like the ones for "2004MBIT competition"?
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to give my game, and the company would flash a number of cartriges, made the package, and deliver to me, ready to sell.
<br/>
<br/>
Or I have to buy a flash recorder, buy the cartridges and flash it myself?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, is this legal? Of course, I made the game, it's not piracy, but is there any legal issue?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any tip.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My game is about 500 Kb.
<br/>
<br/>
So a 4Mb cartridge will be fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you know where I can by this cartridge? Is there smaller ones?

Which, from everything I've looked at, is the most economical and easiest way of doing what you're doing.  It may be cheaper to have something else done if you're doing huge runs of lots of carts, but for most of us, that's the way to go.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, they won't do the packaging for you.
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, it's legal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
