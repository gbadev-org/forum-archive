    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dear all,
<br/>
<br/>
I have an offer from Hong Kong for GBA cart connectors, MOQ 1000pcs. at $2.20/pc. ex works. To that, of course we have to add shipping, customs/taxes, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Since I only really need 500pcs myself, I was wondering if maybe someone in here would be interested in joining a group order. We will also have to decide for one out of two varieties of 7mm and 6mm height, both SMD. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested to join in (only multiples of 50pcs/1 tray, please!) please PM me with your e-mail address, and I can forward you the datasheets.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!
<br/>

Yeah, that would be nice. Do you know someone fluent enough in Asian business to do that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
