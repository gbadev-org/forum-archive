    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys.  I searched the forums for an answer to this problem, and the last thread containing it was made in 2003.  The best suggestion anyone came up with was "turn off the light."  That hasn't really worked for me, so I am posting again!
<br/>
<br/>
I am using F2APowerWriter 2.30.  When I click "Link F2A," or "Write F2A," it spits the following at me, and calls my mother terrible names:

USB.Linker Found
<br/>
Flash not found!!!
<br/>
<br/>
The three exclamation points suggest that this is a <span style="font-weight: bold">serious</span> problem.

Can anyone shed some insight on this issue, two years later?  I might weep if no one can help.

You could always try the older software, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.flash2advance.com/tools/f2aw31.zip" target="_blank">f2aw31</a>. I always have to set the process priority to high to prevent write errors though. Get <a class="postlink" href="http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/ProcessExplorer.html" target="_blank">Process Explorer</a> and you can write click on the f2aw31.exe process and set it's priority to high.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">headspin, you were right - I was so confused by all of the similar names that I didn't realize I hadn't downloaded the latest version of F2APowerWriter!  It works now.  Thanks for the insight!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
