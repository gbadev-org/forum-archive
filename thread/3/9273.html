I've got the back off and can trace the -ve line to the general ground planes, screen connector &amp; EXT port, but can not trace any +ve. (circiut board marked AGB-CPU-10 stamped 322 3702) 
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas ?

I've looked for a GBA circuit diagram, but have only found external port schematics !!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">before replacing the fuse with a new fuse or risking it with a straight wire, check for continuity between the + and - power spots on the board, you may have a short.
<br/>
<br/>
do you have any idea why the fuse blew? if you somehow shorted the positive and negative terminals of say the game cart slot by accident, then the fuse would blow. maybe a piece of metal fell in the cart slot? maybe you dropped it in some water? if you know what caused the fuse to blow, and simply don't do it again, then you can solder a piece of wire where the fuse was. only problem is if you mess it up again it will damage something else that won't be easilly replacable.
<br/>
<br/>
on the back of the gba it says 3v 0.6w, 3 volts at .6 watts. convert that to amps and you get 200 miliamps, which is what I guessed a fuse in the gba would be. if you can actually find a fuse to replace it (pry gotta look online) then I'd say get a 100ma and a 200ma (again, miliamps, 0.1 or 0.1 amp) fuse just to be safe, and put the 100ma one in first. if it blows when you turn the gba on, then it's too small of a fuse or you still have a short. check again for continuity between the + and - power terminals. then try the 200ma fuse. if that doesn't work, then you have something else wrong in the gba.
<br/>
<br/>
if all you can find is some 1 amp fuse, do not use it, it will not protect the gameboy, you mine as well solder a wire across it. to do this right you need to find a tiny 200ma fuse which I've never seen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info makes a lot of sense.  Fault was likely caused by using an unregulate PSU, which make have spiked at power up.
<br/>
<br/>
I think I'll risk a jumper wire, and stick to batteries.
