If it had actually worked, I would have wired it properly for a portable power source. Oh well at least I know for sure it's not only a voltage issue. This is why I asked the question before on what else could it be, because I had known the 5v thing wasn't working.
<br/>
<br/>
If someone could post the pictures in the thread, that would be nice.

Also the DK cart won't even work with Micro, it doesn't support GB/GFBC carts. you'd have to chip some of the plastic off, but then it wouldnt play anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The plan was to see if it was just the voltage causing GB/GBC games not to work, which I found out was not the only reason for the GB/GBC not working in the Micro.
<br/>
I didn't mention it in the first post, but I did modify the plastic of the DK cart in order for it to fit snug in the GBM.

The Game Boy worked fine with the cart being powered externally. The Game Boy still runs off batteries, it's just the cart that runs off the external power source.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The reason it doesn't work is because the GB-Micro and NDS doesn't have a z80 processor in it. But if you have a compact flash card it will run anyway because SuperCard has many emulators built-in. Maybe you could make a adapter for connecting it to emulation ROM connected to GB Micro and then it will run.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
