    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I read about them years ago.  They were going to be unofficial write once piggyback carts.  The theory was that storing the ROM header on an unofficial cart would be illegal, but reading that information from an official cart would be OK.  I don't think anything came of the project.
<br/>
<br/>
Evidently there were GBC carts that algorithmically generated the header, or used some other trick so that the header was not on the cart.  Same basic idea.  The difference is that the GBC carts made it to market.  (I don't know much else about them.)
