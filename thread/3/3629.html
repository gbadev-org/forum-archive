    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How is the Clk port enabled in Xport's VHDL? there wasn't any documentation on it to my knowledge, I checked the clock chip w/ an oscilliscope and it's giving a reading but ClkA/ClkB for usr1 and 2 (pin 33) doesn't give a reading. I figured it was becuase i didn't enable the clock, i need the clock so i can sample input from another device at different rates incase anyone was wondering.

<br/>
so if anyone knows how to get the 50mhz clock from xport to pin 33 it'd be great.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
