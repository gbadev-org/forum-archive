    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know you need counters when designing a gba 8-bit rom flash cart, but i was thinking, if i could use 16bit eproms, would it still be necesarry to use counters?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes. The counter is part of the definition of the GBA cart bus protocol. Without a counter, you just get one 16-bit word repeating itself 65,536 times in each 128 KiB bank, not bootable. If you have an EPROM with a 16-bit data output, go ahead and use it on a Sega Genesis cart. But you'll still need the 16-bit binary counter (e.g. four 74*161 chips) on a GBA cart.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ehh.. something you can 'count' on is needing that counter. It's how the interface works.
<br/>
<br/>
Either a CPLD/FPGA as a go between or some descrete logic is needed.   Fun fun fun.. yeah.

Tepples, is the reset on the GBA connector an output or an input?

Well that kind of answers the question then doesn't it.  I guess my memory is old /REQ[/IREQ, /DREQ] I guess is what I was thinking. (Weee).
<br/>
LOL. Thanks for answering the question I should have looked at GBATEK!
