    <h4>#20143 - zazery - Mon May 03, 2004 2:31 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok I lost my Final Fantasy Tactics game. After searching my house for a few times in the last few months I determined I can't find it. I decided to play it on the ROM I dumped on my computer before I lost the original. (wanted to see how to do some effects) Now after over 3 months I decided to get a new copy of it. I went to my Electronics botique and picked up a used copy of it. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now I've got a saved file on my computer and I want to continue my game where I left off. I've got the EZF Advance with the cable that connects to the GBA ext. port.  
<br/>
<br/>
I've done a forum search and found some useful information but I don't want to completely mess it up so if someone could give me a fool proof way to write a .sav file to an original cart without messing it up, it would be really appreciated. Currently my software just allows me to back up .sav files. (EZF Advance Client v0.99b)
<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

<br/>
It's really confusing, what is the official website for my cart. So many carts have EZ something or other in their name. Where can I get v1.01?
<br/>
<br/>
Ok I've got the 128M version of the EZFA and because of the menu I can't put the ROM it. Plus I don't have Action Reply. There isn't a point to keep it on my EZFA since I test my demos frequently.
<br/>
<br/>
sgeos, are you refering to droping it on the orignal cart using the flash linker? Thanks for the tip unfortunatly I don't have the flash linker.

Why descending order? Your typical .sav file is 64 KB, but real SRAM is often 32 KB or smaller, and if you copy in forward order, you may overwrite bytes that you had written previously.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Like I said I did some searching and came across old posts. I didn't want to bring it back up so I started my own. (lots of forums don't like old posts brought up, I don't know if this one does) Ok anyways I understand what tepples is saying however I'm not sure how FFTA saves.

That problem could be solved.  I'm not sure how much flash linkers run, but they are far cheaper than flash carts.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I did this for Golden Sun - had to copy my savegame back from a F2A cart to the original to carry on playing. The F2A software will write sram saves, but not flash saves, so I had to do it myself there too, based on the info I'd found on the forums...
<br/>
<br/>
The way I ended up doing it was writing a multiboot program (with the new savegame file stuck inside it) that I downloaded to the GBA and ran while the Golden Sun cart was in it, the program just wrote the savegame to the flash and halted. It took a couple of attempts to get it to work, but it wasn't TOO hard. Basically exactly what tepples suggested ;)
<br/>
<br/>
If you can't execute multiboot programs over a cable you could do something similar - you'd have to write a program which did the same, but ran from IWRAM/EWRAM rather than ROM. Write that program to a flash cart, boot the GBA off that - once the program's been copied into RAM and started running from there it waits for a keypress, the flash cart isn't needed any more, put your FFTA cart in and start writing... the only issue is that testing would be really long winded  ;)  I could post the code I ended up using if it'd help?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The video buffer stuff was just in there to give me a really simple idea of whether it'd crashed, etc. The only REALLY strange thing is the way I had to write to data[i-64] rather than data[i] to get the expected results.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As a side note, the actual data itself may be byteswapped depending on what type of hardware save was used. Let's say you were able to dump your FF save to your harddrive from the cart and save it to a file. Then let's say you had it flashed to a flash cart, and dumped the save to file. The two may not be identical, even though they're identical to the game. Like the original data might be 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04, but the flash cart's save file would have 0x04 0x03 0x02 0x01. This usually happens if the flash software patches the game. Or even an emulator's save file could do this. So if you do run into problems, writing the save file to the cart may work, but the data isn't in the correct way. You may need to run through the entire save file and swap 8 bytes at a time to be backwards.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I heard that at least the visoly flash linker only reads/writes 16 bits at a time or something like that, so there'd be no software that could read flash or eeprom saves due to this. So your best bet is using a gba program to read/write the cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For a 1MBit flash chip,  there is one more important sequence of writes to know.  The chips are banked 64K at a time, and the sequence is used to select which bank to use.   Theoritically,  nintendo could make a flash chip up to 128Mbits in size,  with the bank switching sequence involvled.   However, 1Mbit is the biggest flash chip ever seen on the gba for saves.
<br/>
<br/>
The sequence is
<br/>
<br/>
E005555 = AA

E002AAA = 55

E005555 = B0
<br/>

I want to flash/inject a save file from VBA into my original GBA Pok?mon Emerald cart. I've found two "options" to do it, but none of them seems to work:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Getting a EFA Linker. I won't, because they're are overpriced right now. Besides, I just want this for a single game.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Using this tool, "mp_save.gba". I was able to excute it... although... It does recognize the game in "extracting mode" (L), when I put my slot-2 flashcart (SC miniSD) and hit the A button, it tells me to "insert the Movie Player cart". When I try to load and write a saved file into a game (R), I cannot navigate through the contents of my miniSD card. It doesn't even show me the .sav I have in it.
<br/>
I guess all these problems are due to the fact that this program was written to work in CF cards, and it has a poor compatibility with SD based cards.
<br/>
<br/>
So, my question is: is there any way to make this work? If not, at least, with another method... or hope that there's a person wise and good enough to rewrite the program in order to make it work with SD based cards  :roll:

I don't think you get it. I want to inject a save file from a Pok?mon Emerald ROM into my <span style="font-weight: bold">ORIGINAL</span> Pok?mon Emerald cart... AFAIK, there's nothing ilegal involved in it, as far as I have my original cart, as I do. Do you want a video or some kind of proof that I have my original copy of the game along with the backup?
<br/>
<br/>
I already stated it, it's an original game I want to flash. This is what this thread is all about, let me remind you. Read the first post, the user had the same question as I, only 3 years ago. Why on Earth would I be asking for help in this thread if I hadn't a physical, legal copy of the game?
<br/>
But if you insist on treating new members like you do, thank you very much.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, you see, I don't want support for a ROM, not even for an emulator. I'm asking how to transfer a saved game from my computer to a real cart. A legal game I bought with my money, from a dump of the exact same cart a friend of my did with an EZFA a while ago. Unluckily, we both parted ways when we started going to the university, so I find myself in this problem of mine. All that I can think of is that you didn't even bother to read my whole post. You just saw ".sav" and "ILEGAL ROM USER" popped in your mind.
<br/>
<br/>
You could have told me in the first place that Pok?mon games use RTC (I knew it BTW), or even telling me that the rules don't allow "this kind of discussion" instead of trying to make me look like a pirate/idiot.

If you bring up the Rules, which I read before asking this, just to make sure I wasn't breaking any, please, do tell me where my question is in fault with them, and why the exact same question wasn't 3 years ago.
<br/>
You don't allow discussions such as where getting a ROM, how to making it work on X flashcart, etc. But I didn't ask anything related to that. I just wanted to know how could I exchange a saved game file within an original cart. 
<br/>
Also, please tell me why, if you don't allow original carts discussion in these forums, you didn't close/delete this thread before.
<br/>
I'd love to know why you have the right to bash me if I didn't do anything wrong. Or, at least, tell me exactly what I've done wrong, because I don't seem to notice it.
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, thank you very much. I was expecting at least a good treatment, because I think that I asked nicely, following the rules and in a correct way... but then again, thank you very much. I came to these forums, did my homework researching in your archive, made sure you had a thread asking what I wanted to know before creating a new one... I even apologized for bumping a thread so old. But still, you treat me like if I was asking for a ROM site in my first post. 
<br/>
I was hoping GBADev was as good as people say it is, but I was pretty much mistaken. Nevermind my question, as you say, I'll go somewhere else to ask. Some place where manipulating a real cart doesn't translate into "he's using a ROM, call the police". BTW, I've raisen a complaint about you to SimonB, the Admin. I still think you don't have the right to treat anyone like you did, but I'll let him decide wheter you should think about it or not. It's not that I'm interested, though, because I'm pretty much out of these forums forever :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know that the shareware FlashManager program can interface with a variety of linkers and allows you to read/write to/from original carts.  I know you said you don't want to buy a cable, but it's an option.  It works with my F2A cable and a variety of games (though EEPROM saves have every 8 bits reversed, which can be fixed with a simple Python script).  However, I have not tested it with the Pokemon games, as I don't own any of them.  I'm not sure FlashManager will know how to write to them.

Because the written rules in effect on May 03, 2004, were not identical to the written rules in effect as of today. There was a big flamewar between myself and wintermute that resulted in the adoption of the rules currently in effect.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interesting program Chishm.  Now I really wish the Supercard didn't reboot the DS upon insertion.  As it reboots my GBA as well, I no longer believe it to be a FlashMe issue.
<br/>
<br/>
I was able to insert it without rebooting once, and your program appeared to work correctly.  However, as I fear my method of doing so (pushing the right side in first) is causing damage to my GBA slot, I will probably refrain from using the program in the future.  Hm, would it be hard to modify it to save to the SRAM of a GBA flash cart?  I can reinsert my Flash2Advance Ultra cart without any issues, so perhaps that could be the destination cart instead of the Supercard.  It's not a big deal for me though, as I already can accomplish the same task with FlashManager.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Seems there must be some hardware weirdness with the Supercard that's causing this.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nope, the battery stays the same, both with the DS plugged in and unplugged.
<br/>
<br/>
On my GBA that has low batteries, the light changes from red to green when running a multiboot program and ejecting the Supercard, though I'm pretty sure this is simply because of the loss of 5V going through the power and ground pins.  Same concept as the DS battery lasting longer when the passthrough device is ejected after the slot-2 device has been loaded
<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, when running a multiboot GBA application on my GBA, inserting my Metroid Fusion cartridge does not reboot it, which I expected anyway, but inserting either the Supercard or my Flash2Advance Ultra cart does reboot it.  It's the F2AU that's surprising, since when I launched the same GBA multiboot program on my DS and inserted the F2AU, it remained the same.  Wonder why it reboots the GBA but not the DS in GBA mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
