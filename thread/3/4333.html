    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been thinking about making an interface making it possible to run software indirectly from some storage media other than a cart.
<br/>
As I have no experience of GBA-development I thought I'd ask here.
<br/>
What I need to know is how fast a standard ROM in a cart is, or maybe the question should be: At what speed would the device connected to the GBA need to send data from the ROM to make sure that the GBA isn't slowed down?
<br/>
Does any of this make any sense at all? :P

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">CF, SM, SD, and even CD-ROM are perfectly fine storage media if you put a RAM in between them and the GBA. However, the only kind of RAM that is large and cheap is DRAM, and DRAM drains power; better to have an external power supply for the CD reader and the memory.
<br/>
<br/>
Or you could make a CF or SM or SD reader that loads only multiboot programs and lets programs load in more data from flash at runtime; this would work in a similar way to how the Famicom Disk System worked.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I'm getting closer to my degree in CS, and I was thinking about doing something like this for my thesis... Some sort of mass storage media connected to a micro processor which when you power up the gameboy gives you a menu of whatever is stored on the mass storage media. Then you select something and the program is loaded into memory. It's all very sketchy, and I suppose it would be a lot like the game wallet. I just don't like the idea of having to flash the card every time I want to use a different program.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try holding "10-100" GBA Videos simultaneously, and then see how much storage you need. I'd say load the game from CD or HD into a RAM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

You can easily fit 10 commercial games onto a decently sized flashcard.
<br/>
<br/>
But yes, for large amounts of media (video and/or audio) and very large commercial game collections, you need more.
<br/>
<br/>
But I would not consider harddrives and CD-ROMs viable alternatives.
<br/>
1: The GBA powersupply is not powerful enough to power a harddrive or CD-ROM.
<br/>
2: It would make the GBA not-so-portable.

Compactflash and SD cards are a bit more interesting.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Or you can alternatively use:
<br/>
- a CD drive with its own power supply
<br/>
- minidisk Data Disks (read/write at 2x CD speed, possibly read faster)
<br/>
- portable hard-disks ( if speeds permits it )
<br/>
<br/>
They can all run from their own power supply because other media using these technologies all fit in our pockets.
<br/>
<br/>
What's wrong with using DRAM if it runs from its own power source? Thinking of its constant refreshing, I'd guess it drains a lot of power.

<br/>
Large Storage Media and Low Storage Media will share their own power. Low Storage media will hold a record of recent memory requests to decide which data to store in its memory for longest.
<br/>
<br/>
The large storage media must be faster than GameBoy Advanced access, but Low Storage Media is used in between so that less power is consumed.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, my mistake. I should have written my alterations.
<br/>
<br/>
After your post I realised that it was not possible. I have not checked latency but it is pretty obvious that disc based storage is impossible, using the low-storage media as cache.
<br/>
<br/>
So the low storage media would hold the current game, and the large storage media could hold the 10-100 games. The bootloader will always be accessible through the low-storage media. When the bootloader loads a game, it waits for the CD to copy its data to large-storage media and then begins execution.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
