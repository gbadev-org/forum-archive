My soldering isn't to good, but I didn't bridge anything (the second time) and the cart still works fine.[/url]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
i just got an idea from this :P
<br/>
<br/>
a product that someone can try to make :P
<br/>
<br/>
make a false GBA cart that has a battery inside,
<br/>
so it can prevent against dust and extend your ds's battery life :P
<br/>
(would it charge through the gba slot?, i hope it would :P)
<br/>
this mod would be usefull if you were on a long trip (camping)
<br/>
and your ds needs to be charged sometime in there :P<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think you can charge from the GBA slot, with a wire coming from the game and plugging into the charger slot then that'd be OK.
<br/>
<br/>
You can easilly make a USB charger by cutting up a random USB wire and a DS/GBASP charger. i think USB is 5 volts or so, would 3.3v do anything other than make the charge-up a bit slower?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree about the usb charger.  Or do what my friend did...use 4 AA cells in series to generate 6 volts (Which most USB-charging devices can handle), put that in a battery pack with a USB plug.  Makes a handy way to run rechargable devices off of regular AA's if you need to.

makes the charger more portable,

(lol,

if you really wanted this to happen,

just add two wires to the ds charger from the gba slot,

to run power going into the gba slot to the battery :P...

Surely that wouldnt do anything at all, routing power from the battery, through the gba slot, back to the battey. That would just be a waste of wire.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">from my (little) knowledge of hardware, I will simply ask 1 question (with a few more added in brackets):
<br/>
<br/>
Does the GBA slot give out enough power? (and which slot are you talking about? the link cable? the GBA SP was the only one with a power socket, what if you wanted to charge from original GBA? surely being powered by and old gba game would work for both GBA and GBASP)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Of course - I am using the standard port for power - not the slot on the gba.   Works great - a set of normal double AA's can recharge the battery about 5 times while playing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
