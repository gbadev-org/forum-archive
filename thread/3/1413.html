    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey
<br/>
<br/>
I bought a 'Xploder Mega Pack' (released by blaze) the other day, its a new compilation thing, that gives u 3 products that wud cost u around ?75, for ?25.. anyway
<br/>
<br/>
The pack comes with a product called the "Net GameDownloader" and its bloody awful, i dont understand why Blaze even put it in there, as it was originally made by a company called Pellican or summats, and they stopped making them years ago, becoz they were receieving so many complaints about the lousy size of flash memory in the things (128kb - but its not even that! it has some stupid menu program built in and leaves u with a meaningless 96kbs of room - yey..)   Now then im finished complaining, onto my actual post
<br/>
<br/>
Just wanting to know if anybody else owns a one of these awful awful things, and if anybody has changed the EEPROMs in them, as the website which originally hosted PD games for use with this cartridge has not been used for about a year...  There were talks of replacing the EEPROMs with bigger ones, Can anybody tell me if this is actually possible?
<br/>
<br/>
There were also talks about changing the NetDownloader, so that it becomes a flash cart writer, any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help that u give me, coz im going crazy reading throo old posts on the websites..
