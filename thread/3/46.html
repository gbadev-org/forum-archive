    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wierd. Sounds like a USB problem in general. If it were some problem with the linker you shouldn't be able to tranfer any roms at all. I use XL 1.2 (where did you get 1.25 version?). Since the error occurs randomly it could also be a damaged cable/connector or bad USB drivers (perhaps, causing buffering problems in the transmission). Some BIOSes have configuration possibilities, are you sure everything is in order, does other USB devices work? My windows have had some problems with USB device listing, mainly HID compatible devices, so at the moment, until I reinstall the OS, I'm using my brothers computer to transfer my code. I know that they updated the USB firmware once, are you sure that you got the latest one? Have you tried it with another computer? The USB device have a parallell connector also, ever tried this?<br/>_________________<br/>"The best optimizer is between your ears..."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ya, other usb devices work 100% fine just not full speed...buffer underruns. And yes no need for power supply on usb.  I will try it on my other computer when i return home...   I have tried other speeds all have problems...
<br/>
<br/>
What version drivers do you have? i have V20712.
<br/>
<br/>
I got the software of the success-hk.com site....i could try the cdrom they sent. but its the same i would assume.

<br/>
That might just be the problem. A device like the linker needs consistant tranfer speeds. Buffer underruns and other distortion that could leave the recieving FIFO buffert empty might cause the type of troubles you are experiencing.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Had the same problem. I think i fixed it.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using winXP home.
<br/>
<br/>
In your device manager(control panel--&gt;system), extend "Universal Serial Bus controller."
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using USBv2 so it might differ abit.
<br/>
Go under the properties of "USB 2.0 root hub"
<br/>
Under power management tab, uncheck "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power".
<br/>
<br/>
I did this for the rest of the "USB root hub", unsure which 1 is for which usb slot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, no way!  I think the thing was busted because the light would go out after a while.  Strangely, then it would come back on again later.  I'll have to check the USB power saving feature when I get home and see if that's it.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, don't hook up the USB connector AND a power supply...the docs say bad things could happen. :)  You only need external power when you use the serial port...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hrm,
<br/>
This is very disconcerting to say the least. I too have experienced the Flash Xtreme flakiness. The device seems to randomly turn off after a period of time. I've tried almost everything in my power to solve the problem to no avail. I've installed Win98, Win2k, WinXP, tried multiple versions of the drivers on each platform and even the USB Hub fix described above. Nothing seems to have worked. I've also tried to contact the nice folks at Visoly (even when they were in business) multiple times, only to find my messages were apparently going unheard.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad to hear some people are having good luck with these devices, but I am of the opinion that they are trash and I wasted my hard earned money.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there some sort of Linux driver and tool for this thing? Could it just be bad Windows drivers? I hope it's not the actual hardware...
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Any final word on this?  I was considering getting the Xtreme because it can handle EEPROM game saves with the 128M Xtreme card (and it's cheaper).   If the USB is flakey under Win (I'm using XP SP1) or the device has power issues, I'll go with the FAL or F2A with the 256M Pro card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
Where can I download the drivers for the Flash Advance Extreme because I haven't got a CD where I can install the drivers from.  When I look at new hardware (at least i think it's called that because I have the Dutch version) it says the correct drivers are not installed. Maybe someone san sent the files to me by mail / MSN.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
