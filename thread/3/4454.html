    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So here's a bit of a noodler for all you smart fellers... (Tepples, Ampz, chime right in. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be possible to develop a flash cart that would ONLY allow you to store homebrew games? I'm just frustrated with the stigma that these things have... everyone assumes you're a pirate when you are working on perfectly legal programs of your own. There was a post today from some guy whose parents won't let him buy a flash cart, and it got me thinking.
<br/>
<br/>
It's kind of like reverse piracy protection... Are there any tricks other game platforms have used that a 3rd party cart could take advantage of? Some kind of secret token that is easy to compile into your sourcecode but difficult to insert into a commercial ROM? 
<br/>
<br/>
Granted, this is nothing that someone who really knows what they're doing couldn't override, but for learning purposes I think it would be cool. Maybe it would even get Nintendo to stop litigating against companies who sell the thing. (I know, these companies sell more to pirates than to homebrewers... but just for sake of argument.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think MBV2 cables can upload 256kb (kilobytes) to a GBA, which is probably too small for any commercial game. And i don't think they can be used to rip carts either. Although i guess they would have the capability of uploading or downloading big files from the host computer. Still i don't know of any software available to do this, so i guess that they cannot (practically) be used for piracy. And 256kbyte is plenty for most homebrew programs.
<br/>
<br/>
LikSang sell them, so i suspect they are not viewed as a potential piracy tool.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Personally I think it's rather a problem with everyone who automatically think of piracy when flash cartridge is mentioned and lacks the capacity to change their opinion on the matter, and so I think it's them who should change, not me or the equipment I use.
<br/>
<br/>
If someone thinks I'm buying a flash cart to copy games and I tell them it's for hobby deving, and they still think it's for piracy I don't really think there's anything else I can, or should have to do.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, if we're talking about my parents they wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a regular flash cart and a hobby dev only flash cart (if they would exist) so they would have to trust my word, which is basically the same as promising I wouldn't use a regular flash cart for piracy.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Perhaps one could set up a memory map with holes in it- sectors that can not be written to.  That would make patching commercial games a bit of a pain.  (Although I'm not sure how much of a pain).  If the holes are at regular intervals, then that would 'simplify' the compiling the program.

It might not take holes all over the cart, it could just be something as simple as a single hole and different entry point so the cart will always jump to a certain position, which the commercial carts won't.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The MBV2 program has a hidden switch -1 (dash one) to dump a GBA Game Pak. It's useful for *ahem* confirming that your flash card was written correctly or that your other dumper is working. <ol type="1"><li>put cart in gba, gba sp, or gb player ("gba device") </li><li>hold start+select while turning on gba device </li><li>mb -1 confirm.gba </li><li>fc /b <span style="font-style: italic">name_of_ROM</span> confirm.gba</li></ol><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It is technically impossible to run commercial games on a Freelancer cart.

They execute software only from the upper half of the cart adress space.

<br/>
Another posibility it to simply make a 8 or 16Mbit cart. There are no 16Mbit commercial games, right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, Animal Snap has a 32Mbit chip, but when dumped, there is really only 13.6Mbit of game data.  So, that would be an example of a 16Mbit commercial game.<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because the lawyers want you to.
<br/>
<br/>
I've looked at the ROM data for a couple licensed Tetris brand games on GBA, and they could probably easily be made to fit below 16 Mbit.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, it wouldn't be so bad if you split the bankswitching as many NES and GB/GBC games did. Run code from one bank and access data in another. For those things that require accessing two banks at once, load code into IWRAM or EWRAM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

To make it really hard to patch commercial games.  If you set the lower 8 Mbit to bank 0 and allow the upper 8 Mbit to be bankswitched (like the gbc) I think the pirates would have a really hard time patching commercial games.

Exactly what I was saying. Plus if each cart abandons the first 1/2k and starts with a jump to 2048 or somthing like that, then nearly all games will be hindered, unless of course they don't use that area but that's unlikely (but possible).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't mind the idea of a no-piracy dev-only card, certainly would be nice. Particularly if Nintendo said it was cool and bigger chains would risk selling it. I think the real problem is that:
<br/>
<br/>
a) Most people do buy them to pirate games so a manufacturer wouldn't touch it because it would have an extremely low turnover.
<br/>
<br/>
b) The GBA is somewhere between middle-age and retirement. Perhaps Nintendo could be talked or petitioned into doing this with the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
c) Nobody actually cares about us. Personally I have always felt a bit ripped off that so many interest groups get tv shows and magazines galore etc while developers really have to use "underground" sort of communities to gather information, but thats life.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to be such a killjoy, I would love to see a dev-only card (particularly if it had some expanded memory or a cable output for debugging data or something cool) but I can't see it ever happening for the GBA. Not unless you can make one cheaply in your home, but it's a lot of bother.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>
