    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
In my never ending attempt to get the Xinga sticks to accept new software, I find myself needing to do console debugging.  For this I would like to use WntrMute's xboo communicator's console writing routines to dump info and files to the PC.
<br/>
<br/>
For this project, I need to use HAM.  "HAM sucks" is not a useful comment and does not forward this.
<br/>
<br/>
Now that the contest is complete, would anone have time to help me get these console debugging routines up and running from within HAM?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
<br/>
