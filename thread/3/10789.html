    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I'm not sure if this is even the right place to post this, but I am looking to do create some hardware (for NDS) and was wondering if anyone had some internet tutorials that I could use to get started learning the basics of hardware design.

Thanks very much,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know any online resources, but I highly recomend the book, "Designing Embedded Hardware".  It's very very good.  Read it once cassually on your free time, then read it again a chapter a day, studying everything and looking thigns up you don't understand...then...reread certain parts yet again..and finally, refer back to it with your  questions. ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
