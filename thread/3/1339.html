Does anyone know who make the GBA/GBC link cable connectors?
<br/>
There are plenty of unlicensed third party hardware that connects to the link port, so there must be at least one company who officially manufacture thoose connectors.
<br/>

Please don't suggest buying and cutting link cables. I have cut plenty of link cables already. Cutting link cables is the simple solution if you need one connector. It simply does not "cut it" (some pun intended) if you need 100 connectors or more.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
