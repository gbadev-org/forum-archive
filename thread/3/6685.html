    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was just wondering if anyone did ANYTHING with the CHA-01 Ericsson keyboard that AmPz made a tutorial on how to make work with gba.
<br/>
<br/>
Are there ANY homebrew apps or games that worked with it that anyone did or did not release? I would appreciate anything you have, even a text editor or something...This keyboard could have been a great little thing to have if anyone had done anything with it. Especially for the multiple old computer emu's that came out for gba...
<br/>
<br/>
So, if anyone has ANYTHING for this keyboard,

I would greatly appreciate it, I've been sitting here with a useless piece of hardware for at least a couple years now...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
