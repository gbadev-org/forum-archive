    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, hello. First time member here, need some help.
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to use the rt2560 as directed in the tutorial, but I keep on getting this same error message whenever I try to install it. <span style="font-weight: bold">The Specified location does not contain information about your hardware</span>
<br/>
<br/>
And I have looked at the bottom of the tutorial to see what it means, but I already have a WMP54G PCI card in my computer. Its not the newest, i'm not sure if its version 4, but shouldn't it still work?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
