    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The geeks over on the gbaemu board are also having problems
<br/>
with their GBASPs and F2A.
<br/>
<br/>
They keep saying things like: "Do you have the Japanese version
<br/>
of the SP or the UK version?"
<br/>
<br/>
Others refer to the US version.
<br/>
<br/>
How do I know which version I have? (E.g., is there a code on the
<br/>
sticker on the bottom?)
<br/>
<br/>
Don't bother wasting your time by saying, "If you bought it in Japan,
<br/>
then it is a Japanese version. If you bought it in the UK it is the UK
<br/>
version. If you bought it in the US it is the US version."
<br/>
<br/>
I bought it through a super secret source. Could be imported, maybe not.
<br/>
Perhaps from UK, maybe not. Could be from US, might not be.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't say any more about my super secret, clandestine, covert
<br/>
GBASP dealer. (Shhhhhhh.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, if you have a Japanese one, you'd know about it ;) There'll be some Japanese on the bottom, and in the bottom right hand corner of the sticker on the bottom will be "C/AGS-JPN". I'm guessing that code would change for the UK/US versions. Just a thought.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
