    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well. I bought a gameshark SP recently For GBA, I'm not entirely sure if this is the right area to post.

But, that pretty little USB to GBA cable has made me think, If I can send Codes back &amp; forth between them, I should be able to connect emulators. Or maybe at least use some sort of program to display other info on my GBA with it. I really need input from anyone with expertise or basic knowledge in any of this stuff (Programming, Hardware, Etc.). It would be greatly appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
