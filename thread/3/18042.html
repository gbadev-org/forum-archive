    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys I have finally finished making the tutorial on how to make your own GBA flash cart. Now it is in a .torrent file and I will give an explanation as to how that works in the lower segment of the post. I have included all the needed applications for the tutorial and a .pdf document giving all the necessary instructions. Now I have three different types of download, one is all of them in a folder plain and simple, another is downloading the .zip file, and last but not least there is downloading just the .pdf file.

<br/>
The Full Package ~300 megabytes 
<br/>

<br/>
The Full Package In a .ZIP File ~120 megabytes 
<br/>

<br/>
Just the .PDF Document ~1 megabyte 
<br/>
<br/>
Torrents: 
<br/>
Now I'm not going to go into the whole description, functions, bianary make-up and ect. I'm just going over how to use them with a torrent client. 
<br/>
<br/>
First install the client linked in my above post, than start the .exe file. Then hit the large blue + sign to the upper left of the program, and then select "Url" a text box will than appear. Go to this post and copy the links given [Only one] and paste it into the text box. Than hit "Ok" followed by "Add" to choose your download location go to the "Options" tab and then where it says the directory "Downloads" click it on the dropdown menu and select "Other" and choose your download location. Then hit Add, and your download has begun (Note: I recomend downloading the full package {Not the .zip} you'll get the most millage out of that one) 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again guys for everything you help my winy newbie butt with. You guys are totally awesome!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Also if you want a faster acting download you can try the same thing with the "File" tab and a .torrent file. I have the links below to the exact same files just more physical.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey you guys sorry I can't be constantly seeding them so leave a reply and I'll seed it to you.  I lurk alot so you should get me pretty quickly. If not I do every few days so you can just wait a few days with the app open and I can get it to you like that. When I seed I just look for someone who wants the file and give it to them in full.<span style="color: #ffff00">Enjoy</span><br/>_________________<br/>____________________________

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why torrents? Can't you just post the files somewhere? Without needing to download sketchy torrent exes?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Torrents aren't sketchy and neither is the application. The application is from an official open source Portable Application website. They are totally legit and the application has no adds like utorrent or bittorrent. The reason I use torrents is because the are optimal for anyone who has low or slow bandwidth. I use them all the time not to mention there are totally legal torrent sites just the same as pirate ones. Now grant it seedpeer.me leans more towards the pirate side but I only uploaded there because I had already made the torrents and legittorrents.info hasn't verified my account yet. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions about torrents and legal etc. I will gladdy talk with you about it. The actually exe is on sourceforge so it's not sketchy at all the application itself is multi platform on all platforms. 
<br/>
<br/>
Omagosh I'm sorry I forgot to give the link I'll fix that right now one second. I originally posted this in an unrelated thread and the link was in a different post I just copied it into a thread sorry.<br/>_________________<br/>____________________________

<br/>
<br/>
I for one don't frequent here often...
<br/>
<br/>
Probably has been 7 months or more since I last logged in to gbadev.
<br/>
<br/>
Well.
<br/>
<br/>
But this surely sounds intriguing.
<br/>
<br/>
That flashcard your instructions help one build.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it compatible with "Little Writer" ?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.petitiononline.com/blizzds/petition.html" target="_blank">Starcraft DS ?</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
