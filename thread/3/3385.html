    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to read data from an A/D Converter sampling at 10 kHz using an XPort 2.0 from <a href="http://www.charmedlabs.com." target="_blank">www.charmedlabs.com.</a>

<br/>
I'm wondering if there is a limit to how fast I can use the Cart Interrupt Pin to trigger interrupts on the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Unless I've got a problem with my Verilog code, it appears that I cannot trigger interrupts at 10 kHz like I wanted (I'm trying to keep things simple).  If I change my Verilog code to trigger interrupts at 1 Hz,  the GBA recognizes them.  Maybe it's overkill to trigger at 10 kHz?  The GBA runs at 16 MHz though, if I'm not mistaken.
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose, if I have to, I could store 100, or so, samples and only trigger at 100 Hz; however, that means I'd have to write more Verilog code, which I'd like to avoid :)  Anyways, if you have any experience with this let me know.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
