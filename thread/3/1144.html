    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i resently bought a defective gba from a guy for ?10.-
<br/>
the only prob is that i don't have sound, i found out that one of the layers of copper, (1 of 2) has broken off :( that's why i don't have sound (duh...) ok, so what i need is a small diagram of the 2 cirquits.
<br/>
<br/>
does annyone have that cirquit?, or is annyone willing to find out for me?
<br/>
<br/>
