<br/>
<br/>
I want to mod my GBASP so that it goes to sleep when I close the lid... but I really don't want to have go through the trouble of getting an eprom burner and programming a chip just to use the BIOS Stop function.

thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It might be possible to stop the clock in hardware?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It would be a hassle to recompile the demos and homebrew games that you'd want to apply the functionality to, but I think the only solution would be to modify each program you run on your gba to support the sleep mode you are suggesting.
<br/>
<br/>
The questions are:
<br/>
1) Can a binary patch be generic for adding this functionality or would it need to be tailored for each rom?
<br/>
2) Can the gba software detect the closing of the cover or would a button combination be used to indicate sleep.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It can probably be made as a binary patch if the cart IRQ line is used....
<br/>
Just make it a interrupt routine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
