<br/>
What are you thinking?
<br/>
Is it possible to make a software to overclock the cpu from the GBA?
<br/>
<br/>
Please write your opinion in addition!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thats no stupid idea. i have seen this once on a page that someone overclocked a gba. i just don't know the site anymore.
<br/>
The gba was running stable at 2x speed. But if you do it be aware that all of your games are running faster because they are programmed framerate dependet. they also put the clock to a half and all the games were running in slow motion :-)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is supposed to be possible to 'overclock' the ewram...
<br/>
there is an undocumented register that allows control over the ewram - it can be set to 2 (or even 1) waitstates.
<br/>
Its not the cpu, and of course it's not guaranteed to work on all GBAs, so there dosn't seem much point in doing it.
<br/>
however if you are desperate to have a go, and if it works, you could squeeze out a fairly nice performance boost this way.
<br/>
the details are in the no$gba tech docs.
<br/>
<br/>
I've not heard of any way to change the cpu clock via software.
<br/>
<br/>
cheers

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as I know the CPU clock can only be changed by physically changing the crystal oscillator. This is fairly easy to do.
<br/>
I'd suspect that the CPU itself can run at much higher speeds than 16MHz, however, other devices such as the TFT screen, the audio D/A, the EWRAM and the cart will most likely limit the maximum frequency first.
<br/>
The EWRAM and the cart waitstates can be increased to compensate, the TFT and audio D/A cannot be be compensated.
<br/>
Is there a chance increased frequency might be harmful to the TFT?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sure, you could do it. It would make some 3D engines for the GBA I've seen recently run alot smoother.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
