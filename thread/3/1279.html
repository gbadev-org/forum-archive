<br/>
then access it as SRAM[0]...SRAM[65535]. This forces you to access it 8 bits at a time, which is all the memory controller can handle for SRAM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">He's asking how to flash the cart from software, like the F2A stub does. As far as I know, nobody knows how to do this for an F2A cart (else DadyCool would've implemented F2A support in LittleWriter *grin*) but for other carts, I was under the impression that it was possible. Though I must admit, I don't actually know how. If I come across anything, I'll let you know; I will eventually need this to support my flash filesystem. =)

<br/>
<br/>
Its simple to do for sram but for eprom it seem to depend on the type of card you use, i am searching some information of what the flash2advance multiboot program does when writting a gba image in the flash card
<br/>
<br/>
I know its not a simple question but if anybody can help =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">EEPROM is something different again; that's just another saving mechanism like SRAM, and saving to EEPROM is fully documented in the various spec docs (free or Nintendo *grin*). The only cart that actually contains an EEPROM that I know of is the Visoly Pro carts, but I could be wrong. Mine doesn't, anyway. (XG)
<br/>
<br/>
You want Flash. And, for the Flash2Advance, I am pretty certain that nobody but the makers know how to actually write to the thing, though you'd be welcome to disassemble the F2A multiboot program and work it out. DadyCool could do with the info in order to write F2A support for LittleWriter. =)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it stupid to suggest you ask the flash2advance people for information on how it works? They may just give it to you! After all, it's probably in their best interests to have as many people as possible able to write to their carts. I'd sure like to have a writer for Linux...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nobody can really contact the F2A people; they don't seem to provide any contact information. People have been trying ever since their hardware was first released, but no responses so far. Evidently they value being relatively untraceable over helping their customers.
<br/>
<br/>
If you go look on Emuboards you'll find a long history of people complaining about F2A being uncontactable, mostly because people want LittleWriter to support the F2A, and DadyCool doesn't have the required information.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I'd noticed that they didn't have any e-mail address on their website. I guess they don't want to get their asses kicked by Nintendo like Lik Sang and Visoly did.
<br/>
<br/>
There was one email address I found from somebody who wrote a little operating system that works with the Compact Flash version of the Game Wallet. The address is: <a href="mailto:agbranger@hotmail.com">agbranger@hotmail.com</a> (hmm, looks like something else untraceable here...). The URL is: <a href="http://www.flash2advance.com/f2acfos.htm" target="_blank">http://www.flash2advance.com/f2acfos.htm</a>  . I don't think it writes to flash, but rather allows the wallet to be used on its own, but he may  know someone who knows how to write to flash.

Can't hurt to try..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
