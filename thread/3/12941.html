    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm looking into using the GBA link port as a serial communicator with an <a class="postlink" href="http://ifirobotics.com/rc.shtml" target="_blank">IFI Robotics RC</a>. What I really need to know is if it is possible for the GBA to send and receive serial data and would I be able to use the already implemented Xboo library in libgba. I have found a schematic which allows the GBA link port to go to a COM interface but it is a female connector and the IFI RC has a female connector, so if I were to make the GBA able to connect with this would I have to flip the Tx and Rx and use a male connector? A link to the schematic can be found here: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.reinerziegler.de/GBA/UART.gif" target="_blank">http://www.reinerziegler.de/GBA/UART.gif</a>. Any help would be appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
