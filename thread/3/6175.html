    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello.  My MBV2 cable is not working properly.  I have searched the forums for answer, but I haven't found a solution.  
<br/>
<br/>
I am running WinXP Pro with Service Pack 2.  With GiveIO and UserPort, MB.EXE hangs forever.  With DirectIO, it still gives me the "No hardware found" error.   I hope someone can help me with this, I would hate it if my MBV2 cable went to waste.  Thanks for any help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got the cable working on a different computer running WinXP Pro with Service Pack 1, but I have a new problem.  I can transfer the included glib.mb fine and it runs, but when I try to transfer my own .mb file, the flashing nintendo icon stops on a red color every time and the transfer does not continue.  The size of the file is 175 KB and I compiled it with DevKitARM using the specs=gba_mb.spec flag.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I fixed the second problem by increasing the wait states (with the -w flag) to 4000.  The file takes forever to transfer (about 5 minutes) but at least it gets there.  If only I could figure out this Service Pack 2 problem and I'll be  set :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok. Has anyone else had issues with the link being unstable? It seems that the GBA stops recieving data randomly after the sending starts.  When the nintendo logo pulsates between red and yellow (the data is being sent) it will randomly stops pulsating.  With a higher -w value this happens later on in the transfer usually, but not always.  Out of about 30 tries I have only successfully transferred my 175KB image twice.  I notice that the link rarely even starts when -w is less than 20.  Is my parallel port too slow or something, because many people on this site have said that a value of 10 works for them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
