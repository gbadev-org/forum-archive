    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone documented anywhere the differences between running a program on Visual Boy Advance and actual hardware?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm asking because I went to test my engine on hardware today and there were a bunch of things wrong with it. It emulates perfectly, though, so I'm not even sure where to begin looking for the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
(Specifically, my routine for loading tiles outside the normal map area into my map has gone all wonky on me, and I'm getting flickering and screen tears on one of the text backgrounds (which doesn't have any HBlank processing applied to it).)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
