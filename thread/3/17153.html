    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all, I recently opened my "Spiderman" GBC game. Before I explain my motives, I should probably tell you that there is NO battery on the cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, what I want to do with this (if at all possible) is to find a way to connect this cartridge through some kind of cable (parallel/USB), connect it to my computer, and mess around with it with appropriate software. Cable connected to cartridge through soldering.
<br/>
<br/>
Uh, so is this at all possible?
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I hope it is okay I'm asking a Gameboy Color related question..
<br/>
<br/>
If you need more details, I can provide. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If you want to change anything on the cartridge, you can't.
<br/>
If you want to dump it, it's already been done.<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
