    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would love to have heard this a month ago - my MBV2 came from lik-sang last week! But to anyone who is looking for an MBV2 cable they are on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.lik-sang.com" target="_blank">lik sang</a> for only around $15...

And that to me seemed like a bargain price to help me start my GBA development!<br/>_________________<br/>"I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle" - Arthur Dent</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This would be great, as I haven't seen my creations on GBA ever, having started about 6 months ago. I have PMed you. About the shipping costs, I can't pay by credit card or whatever, but I'm pretty sure I could just transfer some money between my bank account and yours.

EDIT : I won't be here for a couple of days, so might not reply. I really do hope this doesn't affect my chances of getting the cable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
