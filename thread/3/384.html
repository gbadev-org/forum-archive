<br/>
Most of the time, I test using an MBV2 cable after having got a program working in VBA.  Then I put a whole bunch of programs (both my own and downloaded from gbadev.org) into PogoShell to give them an extended round of road testing (it's a long ride in the back seat of an SUV between home and college) and demonstrate them to my neighbors.  But I sometimes put a ROM on my cart without a shell when I'm trying to test those aspects that are fundamentally incompatible with multiboot, such as playback of large compressed data.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of reaching behind my PC to unplug my MBV2 cable and plug in my pre-Xtreme parallel flash linker, I usually just write the PogoShell FS to a cartridge through my GBA and MBV2 cable.  It takes longer, but once I've put mb.exe in the background, that gives me a chance to help my friends here on forum.gbadev.org :-)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Depends...
<br/>
The PCB and discrete logic is fairly cheap.. $10 or so...
<br/>
The costly part is the flash memory.
<br/>
a 32M intel strataflash is like $30-40 in low quantity
<br/>
Of course, you also need a plastic case for your cart..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
