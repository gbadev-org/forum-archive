    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello!
<br/>
<br/>
I am finishing up developing some software for GBA/DS but I am having trouble finding a source for actually producing the final commercial cartridges.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of a company that provides ( in quantity) the hardware - (board + case + label) and the burner for them.
<br/>
<br/>
Seems everyone is using flash but has anyone actually produced a final commercial package?  
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help!
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
For what ever reasons, Simon seems to be silent on his sources. 
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else have any supplier info? I think the community could benefit knowing what suppliers are out there and who is best to deal with.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the great developement info you guys have shared so freely.
<br/>
<br/>
I know I for one,  wouldn't have a product to publish if it wasn't for this forum.
<br/>
<br/>
I will share any info I find out about suppliers and I hope others will help this great community out! (and me!)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Again

Last I checked the prices for a shelf ready game weren't extortionate. However there is a minimum order of around 5000 carts.
<br/>
<br/>
With a finished product you may be better off seeking a publisher but Nintendo may be able to give you some advice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Considering the 2004 compo carts and the chinese pirates around the world, I don't believe that's entirely true. I mean, it's a good advice when you show people how to become licensed developers, but if someone has the money to invest in 5000 carts, is not asking for Nintendo's license, and has a lawyer or two just in case, what is wrong in giving the information out?
<br/>
<br/>
I for one would really like to know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
