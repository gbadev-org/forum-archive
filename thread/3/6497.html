    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The program that converts binary files to the dot code has been available to use online for a short time. I used it to produce the dot code.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I now have the means to encode your own dotcodes.  Keep in mind that as Firefly has not released the full version of nevpk, You will be severely limited in the dotcode sets you can create, size wise, until one of two things happens.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Firefly decides to save me the trouble, and release the full version of nevpk.
<br/>
2. I reverse engineer the vpk format myself, and write my own compressor, and release it.
<br/>
<br/>
The remaining tools needed are available at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.caitsith2.com/ereader/tech.htm" target="_blank">http://www.caitsith2.com/ereader/tech.htm</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Nintendo E-Reader dotcode bin maker - This is what converts your vpk file into a set of dotcode bins.
<br/>
2. VBA 1.7.2 e-reader - Provided you have at least one of the e-reader rom images (there are 3 of them), you can create your complete set of raw files, by "scanning" the bin files you created with the first tool.  After each bin file is "scanned", It will ask you where to save the raw file.  (The saving part is optional, you may cancel the saving if you wish, in case your just testing out the set.)

Enjoy. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
