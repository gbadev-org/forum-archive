There's no way to expand the range of Majesco's GBA wireless adapter. Any repeater would add latency, and because Majesco's adapter tunnels an extremely latency sensitive protocol as it is, any more would kill the connection.

Or by "expand the frequency" did you mean ability to switch to a different channel because one of your existing devices interferes?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
