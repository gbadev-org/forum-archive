    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all...my SP's screen started acting funny all of a sudden, and wanted to see if anyone had seen anything like this before, and whether there were any suggestions of a way to fix it myself.....
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, the entire left half of my screen (a straight line down the middle) is often colored wrong.  It seems to be something with red colors, as I only notice it on red backgrounds.  (Can't see it at all on a black screen or the pure white intro screen) Basically, it looks like that half of the screen is twice as dark of a red as it should be.  Whenever reddish colors animate or move, I get weird flashing effects.
<br/>
<br/>
It's entirely playable, just a little distracting, really...
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?  I guess it just might be time to buy a new gba.....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Possibly the ribbon cable has come loose. If you can open it up and poke at it, give it a shot. I've had similar things work before (fixed a calculator dislpay by wedging some cardboard behind it).<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
