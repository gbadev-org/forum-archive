    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I don't actually use the MBV3. I do know that it wasn't made by the MBV2's creator. Here is the info <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devrs.com/gba/files/mbv2faqs.php#MBV3" target="_blank">http://www.devrs.com/gba/files/mbv2faqs.php#MBV3</a>. It may be because this is a clone(with usb added right?) that it doesn't work properly(maybe the program doesn't work well on all systems). I haven't seen many people talk about it. So there may be someone on here that can help you with the errors. I just wanted to give a possiblility.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Are you sure that is what the error is? Are you using the following?
<br/>
mb -s filename.mb 
<br/>
<br/>
i read you need to include the -w(aitstate) too.

I've had a mbv3 from success-hk i believe sitting on shelf for over a year. try busting it out this afternoon, and it is coming up unable to find hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
installed userport, and tested MB.EXE working, by attaching a LPT experiment board, which shows the leds flashing. then stop waiting for a response.
<br/>
<br/>
however, when i plug my gba-sp in, it just sits at the logo screen. 
<br/>
<br/>
havent had any luck in the past either. is why im reading the forums for clues.
<br/>
<br/>
surely some people have had it working, else it would have been dropped by retailers.
<br/>
<br/>
might have to get a PIC burnt at school, and swap the current one, for godsmaze version.
