    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello people,
<br/>
<br/>
i'm trying to make a cartridge with a transciever module so i can make a connection with the PC for which i've made a small pcb connected to the serial port.
<br/>
<br/>
i think i will use the tr3000 from RF chip for it
<br/>
<br/>
are there any people who did something before ? and give me some pointers on how to not make stupid mistakes.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance,
<br/>

You mean connect it to the serial connector ?
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to make a complete cart pcb where the rs3000 together with a PIC/eeprom and some ram can fit in. 
<br/>
<br/>
I've been looking for a pcb layout (orcad format) but there isn't that much info.

greetings,
