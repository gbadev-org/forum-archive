    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. I am planning on making a GBA multi-boot cable but don't know which GBA accessory to canibalise the male GBA plug from. Can anyone recommend a GBA accessory which has all the correct wiring etc. There are so many link cables etc to choose from on Amazon.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. To change the topic a bit. Friends of mine r going to Singapore next week, are AGB flash linkers r available "over-the-counter" there or r they only available online?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you are looking for male plugs. well i couldn't find anythign so i took the orginal GB to GBC adapter(which has a female GBC port) that came with the universal link cable. So after beatign the crap out of that. i soldered it to a centronics port which i beat out of an old printer. so here is what you do just connect the centronics connector to a regular parrelle port cable to the centronics side of the adapter and uses the GBC cable plug into the female GBC port with i got form the adapter thingy mentioned above. and connect the other end of that cable to the Game Boy. 
<br/>
<br/>
i never tested it yet. but you might need to invert the SI and SO connections form the diagram that you got
<br/>
<br/>
This is a round about way of doing things but i didn't want to ruin my GBC cable because most of my games are still GBC. But you could also just rip apart the cable and cut out the middle man</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Look at Xboo Communicator in the downloads section at <a href="http://www.devkit.tk" target="_blank">http://www.devkit.tk</a> the docs have a nice diagram to follow :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I want a plug so I can make a cable to connect an ericsson chatboard to my GBA SP (see Timmy Brolin's keyboard advance project).
<br/>
<br/>
I have three link cables, none of which has the correct wires present (curiously they all had pin 1, which Timmy suggested was the one likely to be missing).  I cannot keep buying link cables hoping they will work nor can I walk around the shops with my multimeter.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a retailer that sells the plugs on their own?  I have tried to take the plug apart on one of the link cables, but it doesn't look like I will be able to do this without destroying it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When I made my xboo cable I used an old Nyko universal gameboy color link cable. It had a gameboy color/pocket plug on one end and a gameboy color/pocket plug + gmb plug on the other. It also had a junction box in the middle. I smashed the junction box (it was glued shut) then desoldered all 6 wires from the circuit board. 
<br/>
This cable has six wires, one for each pin. However, you have to test which wire goes to which pin, as the colors are not the same as on the xboo cable diagrams.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is possible to move a pin from one position to another. It is kind of tricky but it is doable.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I think the plug is actually female... Notice that the pins goes into the external plug, not the other way around. Compare it to a D-SUB for example.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
