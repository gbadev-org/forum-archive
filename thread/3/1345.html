    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I used the XPORT with the GBA and it worked great. It still works with
<br/>
the GBA-SP. However I don't know where to connect the reset line to the SP.
<br/>
The Xport comes with info on how to connect to the hardware reset line in the GBA
<br/>
but no such info seems to be available for the SP.
<br/>
<br/>
Anybody knows ????
<br/>
<br/>
Also my Flash2advance HiSpeedLinker and 128M Flash2 advance cart
<br/>
doesn't work with the SP. I can program the flash on a gba and read them on
<br/>
the SP but I can't program tehm on the SP.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for any help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If it's a parallel F2A then it's a known problem with the SP. Here's a fix you can try if you don't mind doing some soldering - if you've just got it and are considering returning it then don't get a USB one instead, the drivers/software are a load of pap.
