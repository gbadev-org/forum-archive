That said though, at the moment DS-slot devices aren't recommended for running homebrew.  As more homebrew adopts the DLDI system, this will improve in time, but right now slot-2 devices enjoy much better compatibility for homebrew.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That said, what <span style="font-style: italic">homebrew</span> applications do you plan to use?  For music and video you can use Moonshell, which works on most carts now due to DLDI support, but like I said, for most homebrew a slot-2 device is recommended.

I think you can actually buy them at your local electronics store.  They come with a neat box you can store them in, and they're great for getting the full 100% experience of actually playing the game.  &gt;_&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by dantheman on Sun Jan 14, 2007 5:26 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, you will need an additional passthrough device to launch DS code from the GBA slot.  NoPass devices are only about $20 though, and once you have one you can install FlashMe, which removes the need for it so you can carry around an official cart in the DS slot.  The Action Replay DS (about $25) also functions as a NoPass, and you can buy one at most game stores, so if you're interested in the features of the ARDS you get two functions for the price of one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
