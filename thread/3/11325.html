    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">does anyone remember those gamecube to gba cables that gave you extra features to a game? Well i want to know how to hook it up to a usb port, if anyone knows of any useful diagrams, or other postings that are the same, or if they would like to assist me with some tips, then it would be greatly appreciated<br/>_________________<br/>≤{[ژ?ŗ?ď]}≥</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">wow. by putting a usb cable onto the gc-gba cable, you'll get nothing. you could program a microcontroller to interpret the comms on the gc cable, and have it plug into a computer with usb (gc and usb code would be in the ?c,) and have a custom driver on the computer read the data.
<br/>
<br/>
or you could reverse engineer individual gba games to see how they communicate with the gc, then write your own gba code to emulate this behavior and save the data into sram, then dump it to your computer.
<br/>
<br/>
it depends if you want to unlock gba or gc stuff. either way you'd need programming knowledge of the system you're trying to spy on, which is what gbadev.org is all about!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

At "The Source" formally Radio Shack here in Canada i was able to pick up a Game Cube to USB adapter which allowed for joystick type action on your PC with the Game Cube controller. This could be used to bridge the gap between PC and GBA to Game Cube cable.
<br/>
<br/>
Next software would be required this would involve writing a code that send exact singles that the regular controller sends upon button press. I am not sure of the protocol of this controller but you would not need this, because the Gameboy Player allows use of a GBA as a Game Cube controller using the cable used before, so what you would need to do is capture the program the Gameboy Player sends to the GBA (legality check: not sure it this is allowed here, I see no reason why not if you make your own capture) on your pc load it on a flash cart (or use a multiboot cable) and then pop it in connect all the cables and there you have your own GBA controller for the PC. 
<br/>
<br/>
GBA + GBP application &gt; NGC to GBA adapter &gt; NGC to USB adapter 
<br/>
<br/>
A quick test would be just to load the software directly from the GBP to the GBA and then disconnect and reconnect to the NGC to USB adapter.
<br/>
<br/>
I have not tested this method because I have not had all the parts required at the same time but in theory it should work. Hopefully this will work.  
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this is what you were thinking and that is works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes tepples, i am aware this would only be for HID interface, 
<br/>
<br/>
the problem posed did not specify what sort of tasks this overall GBA/Game Cube to USB system would have to do, i was justing giving an idea of how to get the Gameboy Advance connected to the PC using the GBA - GCN connector and a USB device.
<br/>
<br/>
But i think with this setup this is all you can hope to accomplish with this setup, not sure never did much work with this idea though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You see the beauty of this system is that no apps need to be written, the gba software is given by the gameboy player, and the adapter is a direct gamecube to HID joystick (so any software which supports joystick input would be usable for this, i am thinking NES emulators for the correct amount of buttons.)
<br/>
<br/>
That being said we can't legally distribute the multiboot software from the gameboy player, but once i get my supercard next week i can begin work on a replacement software that can be distributed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
