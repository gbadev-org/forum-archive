    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">XP with SP2,  and my MBV2 cable works just fine.  In fact, it works even better, than it did before SP2.  Using totalio.
<br/>
<br/>
With these command lines  (note, I modded my mb.exe, to include the -t function, for turbo multiboot.  Jeff had meant to finish the feature, but never did.   I found a reversed copy of multi.c that was used in some other multiboot program, which I believe to have come from mb.exe anyhow.  I got that working. (and that was the portion of the mb.exe source code jeff could not give out, as per agreement with lik-sang).   However, he was able to give me the source to the various loaders, like gbreadwrite,  from which I adapted to make the turbo multiboot loader.)
<br/>
<br/>
mb -s [program name] -w 3 -t
<br/>
mb -s [program name] -w 4
<br/>
<br/>
Before SP2,  I had to always use
<br/>
<br/>
mb -s [program name] -w 10 [-t]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
