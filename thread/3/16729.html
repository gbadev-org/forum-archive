    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello All,
<br/>
<br/>
Does any one know of a USB host controller cart for the GBA / Slot 2 interface? Is or has any one tryed building one for the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
I`m looking at if it were possible.. mainly for running under DS Linux. I only want to run 1 device. USB 1.0 support is fine. Don`t need the speed.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone seen anything?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.
<br/>
<br/>
