    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everyone!
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I am both new here AND new to GBA hacking, but I am not a noob when it comes to Pro/Hobbyist forum boards and making sure I do some serious searching before I ask dumb questions :)
<br/>
<br/>
That in mind, I have searched here, Google, and everything in between and I still cannot find a satisfactory answer.
<br/>
<br/>
I figured since I am new to this particular hobby, I would start very simple, and just do the GBA GPS hack found here (I am sure you all know the one):

<br/>
<br/>
I am using a MS-Branded Pharos GPS-500, and I figured the easiest thing I could do is just a cable hack between the GPS cable and a GBA Link Cable (in other words, no real hardware hacking yet!). The problem I have run across is trying to decipher which cable colors belong to which pins in the GBA link cable I have cannibalized. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have found a few diagrams online, but they reference wire colors that do not match mine. My wires are colored:
<br/>
<br/>
Red
<br/>
White
<br/>
Yellow
<br/>
Blue
<br/>
Brown
<br/>
Black
<br/>
<br/>
Whereas most things I find online mention a different scheme, including orange and green but lacking yellow and white.
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I can always start testing the lines, but I figured if there was an existing knowledgebase I would just utilize it instead. Let's just say that hardware hacking is a new hobby for me, and I chose the GBA SP as a starting point because of how easily I can obtain replacements if I goof...but I am still proceeding with great caution with everything until I grow more comfortable with electronics in general (I am a bored 3D Animator by trade).
<br/>
<br/>
Any help here would be greatly appreciated, and if a topic or webpage exists on this subject, please feel free to provide me just a link - I do like researching and finding things out for myself whenever possible! This is just one of those things that maybe I am not searching properly for, but I been looking for two days now with no progress :(
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance, and I hope to be able to share back to the community as soon as I am up-to-speed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I suspect every company that makes GBA cables does the colors differently.  Honestly the easiest method would simply be to use a voltmeter set to a setting that beeps when the two leads are connected, poke one end in one of the six pins on the end of the cable, and the other to a random wire.  Figure out which pins map to which colors.
<br/>
<br/>
The issue I had when trying my own mini project (connecting an SNES controller to the GBA link port) is that none of the cables I found had the right pins.  Apparently only 4 pins are actually needed for 2-player gaming, so most cables you find won't have all 6.  The ones I got from DealExtreme, a random one from Gamestop, the GBA-to-Gamecube cable, and my official Nintendo-brand link cable all only have 4 of the pins actually connected to wires, with the other pins either missing, tied to ground, or tied to another active pin.  I eventually just gave up since the project wasn't all that interesting to begin with.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks dantheman, that's what I'll do next!
<br/>
<br/>
I figured that would probably be the case, but a guy can hope, right?
<br/>
<br/>
Once I figure it out, I'll reply back to this thread so anyone else who discovers they have the same type of cable with the same colors can benefit from it :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had the same issue when doing some hardware hacking at one point.  My colors were also different, but I just pulled up my notes, and they are different than yours also.  So I'd just echo what dantheman said and get out your voltmeter/multimeter.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, it took me a while (my schedule is all wacked out), but I finally found my voltmeter and tested the cables.
<br/>
<br/>
As I recall, this cable end came from a 4-way link cable in the DreamGear 15-n-1 pack. If you have one of those, these colors should match up (but testing is probably not a bad idea anyway!).
<br/>
<br/>
Pin 1: Red
<br/>
Pin 2: Black
<br/>
Pin 3: Brown
<br/>
Pin 4: Yellow	
<br/>
Pin 5: Blue
<br/>
Pin 6: White
<br/>

Thanks again to those who replied, and I hope this helps someone else out along the way :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The colors are irrelevant, use a meter. In a pinch you'll get by with a bulb, a battery &amp; some wire.
<br/>
<br/>
Even cables from the same product can and do have different colors used.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
