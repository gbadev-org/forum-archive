    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok I have the Dragon movie player version 1, which a while back I updated with the .e18 file and then found out that my movie player is not the offical one, thus making it defective. 
<br/>
<br/>
I tried using Chishm's program in hopes of it flashing the movie player to fix it, but alas it failed. 
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way this program can fix that issue? 
<br/>
<br/>
Right now I am getting Flash NOT detected! (2B003FF0) 
<br/>
Please insert a Movie Player (with Chisms program) 
<br/>
<br/>
and 
<br/>
<br/>
Update Failed! This Card is a FAKE!! System Crash!!! with the regular movie player going.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
