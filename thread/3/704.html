<br/>
<br/>
If you wan't to make a basic emu i recomend you to port:
<br/>
Gameboy (color/mono) <a class="postlink" href="http://gnuboy.unix-fu.org/" target="_blank">gnuboy</a>
<br/>
Neo Geo Pocket (It is a 6mhz CPU, the cound CPU is 4 mhz) <a class="postlink" href="http://www.emuxhaven.net/~neopop/" target="_blank"> Neo Pop </a>
<br/>
Sega Genesis (i couldn't find a good emu, go look!)
<br/>
MSX
<br/>
<br/>
If you wan't something hard then try this:
<br/>
SNES (ZNES, SNES9X or the wierd one that they made for a SEGA, which is probably the best)
<br/>

I don't think that's possible.  You can only emulate a machine with less memory than the one the emulator runs on.  (No arguments about Turing completeness please; real computers are linear bounded automata rather than Turing machines.)  It's possible to get away with <a class="postlink" href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">emulating a PC on a PC</a> because a PC's RAM is expandable: a 64 MB PC can run popular programs, but it's also possible to make a 128 MB PC.  The GBA, by contrast, has only 384 KB of RAM.  Emulating EWRAM using a swap file on the flash chip would wear the flash chip's sectors out too quickly.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

As for the big-endian thing, I don't know about arm, but x86s are little-endian (IIRC), PPCs are big-endian (again, IIRC).<br/>_________________<br/>--Michael</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#3725 - Grumps - Thu Mar 06, 2003 5:41 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah. Form what I've dug up today, it would appear that the ARM (on the GBA) runs little-endian (or so it appears using the memory dump facility of VBA).
<br/>
<br/>
And from the Pentium4 data sheet, it looks like it can run either, but is set shortly after it boots. And again, this would appear to be little-endian (from playing with good old DOS debug).
<br/>
<br/>
This is all what I like to see, because my target platform is also running little-endian.
<br/>
<br/>
I seem to recall that Motorola CPUs all tended to be big-endian, I guess this is the reason behind the PPCs endianess.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
