    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i was experimenting with the player and noticed that after the game boots its possible to remove the disk without interupting the player has anyone found a way to read from the disk through the player ....or a pc</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can read a GC disk on a PC through the PSO backdoor. It doesn't seem to likely there's any way to read the disk through the GBAPlayer, though, since all the disk is there for is booting the system up properly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thats an absolutely fantasic idea actually. I'm sure alot of us have flash carts, so throw some suggestions anround about how we can figure out if its possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe write a GBA prog that scans all the memory addresses and outputs the data through the link port, which is recorded on a pc, then compare what we get from the GBA and the GC then figure it out from there.
<br/>
<br/>
I did hear a while ago about some games may have extra features on the GBA Player (such as making the GC controller rumble) so if thats true I assume theres some differences in memory addresses and thier read/write only states etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Anything anyone can think of?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">its completely possible. The GCN emulates the GBA on it, allowing complete access to the eternal GCN through those emulation things in memory.. Someone should definatly try it. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have seen photos of the Wide Boy, Super Game Boy, and Game Boy Player circuit boards, and they're no more "emulation" than running my Dreamcast console through my ATI TV Wonder VE card is "emulation." Nintendo's Wide Boy style devices contain a full Game Boy chipset and merely route the video, sound, and input through the host console. They do, however, provide a couple extra registers used to communicate with features on the host console, such as palettes and borders (on SGB) and rumble (on GBP). How to access these registers and whether these registers do in fact allow access to the entire GCN memory space (as they did for SGB; see <span style="font-style: italic">Space Invaders</span> for Game Boy that contained a full Super NES game) are still open questions.
<br/>
<br/>
Datel's competing device, on the other hand, is an actual emulator that reads Game Paks through an adapter connected to the memory card port. Lik-Sang's <a class="postlink" href="http://www.lik-sang.com/news.php?artc=3203" target="_blank">article</a> seems to imply that Datel licensed Marat Fayzullin's <a class="postlink" href="http://fms.komkon.org/VGBA/" target="_blank">VGBA emulator</a> and ported it to the GameCube.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But since it allows direct access to some GCN registers, and memory, there is a slight chance that someone could crack through to the other registers located on the GCN. And none of this meaning to start a flame war. :X</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Can you please give us some specifics on those registers/memory areas?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I do not know these registers as currently they are for nintendo to know only. &gt;_&lt; Someone could try to crack them though. :P
<br/>
My idea is that it would be registered near the GBA's control-pad registers.
<br/>
But that could be wrong. :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well.. some GBA games can be played through the GCN, and rumble the GCN controller.. those are registered values of the controller that must be registered to the GCN's hardware, and in order to access those, you have to access some part of the GCN, which will obviously be accessed by quite a few parts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am not entirely sure what you are trying to says, but according to my non scientific research/uneducated guesses, the GBA side doesnt have "direct access" to any GCN registers but instead the software running on the GCN have access to 1 or more registers on the GBA side. Then the software in the GCN only does what it is supposed to do with the data.
<br/>
That might include uploading program code/data to the GCN and run it, but I doubt that.
<br/>
To understand everything the GBP can do will probably require reverse enginering of the GBP software on the GCN side, if you have come that far I can not see the problem of reading out the discs directly.<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
