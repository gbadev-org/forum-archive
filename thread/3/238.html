    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all,
<br/>
long time fan of GBA, first time poster on GABdev,
<br/>
<br/>
Now, Im assuming that the reader of this thread has seen the TV-Tuner / color monitor adapter for the GBA, if not click <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gameboy-advance.net/accessories/gba_tv_tuner.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My question(s) is:
<br/>
How does it work?
<br/>
<br/>
futhermore, can you send analog video stream (TV signal or composite video) to the GBA?
<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, I would like to take a video color spy-camera (composite NTSC video) and display it onto the GBA's Display.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I understand there will be electronics and software engineering envolved, and Im not afraid to venture both either.  So please throw as many ideas as you can.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a typical flow / block diagram that Im researching on:
<br/>
<br/>
{ Analog vid signal } --&gt; { <span style="font-weight: bold">xxx </span>} --&gt; { XPort Dev Cartridge, by charmedlabs } --&gt; { VRAM/WRAM } --&gt; { 'video' player code/program } --&gt; { GBA Display }
<br/>
<br/>
Were <span style="font-weight: bold">xxx</span>  are methods or techniques to translate or sample to a signal that the GBA can utilize:
<br/>
1) PWM (pulse width modulation)
<br/>
2) PPM (oulse position modulation)
<br/>
3) PCM (pulse coded modulation)
<br/>
4) a combo of PWM, PPM and PCM 
<br/>
5) No translation needed?  (I doubt that, but I could be wrong)
<br/>
<br/>
and if any is used,
<br/>
<br/>
What code type or program needed?  will it promote high CPU usage?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas, comments, questions, flames, or even support are greatly appreciated!
<br/>
<br/>
thanx in 'advance'd

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The xxx part must include a high speed video ADC, and a large FIFO if the resolution is low enough. If you're going for a high resolution solution, then it need to include a complete framebuffer. A double framebuffer if you want higher framerates.
<br/>
<br/>
This is a major piece of hardware. To start with, I'd suggest using a CCD camera with digital outputs, that way you eliminate the ADC.
<br/>
I suppose it _might_ be possible to utilise the FPGA in the xport for much of the logic needed for a framebuffer, but you still need the double buffer itself (2*SRAM).
<br/>
You'll need about 100 FPGA pins, (maybe more), is the xport enough? I doubt it...
<br/>
The xport might have enough pins for a single buffer (1*SRAM). But that will give you a huge framerate penalty (like half the framerate).
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
From the sound of it (PWM, PPM, etc. have nothing to do with cameras and digital video), you don't have much knowledge of electronics at all. You'll need a few university courses in digital electronics and computer systems before you can pull this off.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
