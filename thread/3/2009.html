    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am using pogoshell 1.2.h1 and when I write my flashcard using F2A USB Writer, it works fine.  The problem is that when I go to play my games, the only thing that shows up is the background, not the folders and the roms.  I have tried many different things, but I can not get it to work.  Does anyone have any idea what could be wrong?  Thanks for any help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How big is the flashme.bin file? Does it look like it's big enough to contain all your programs, or is it only a few dozen KB? If the latter, then you didn't build the PogoShell image correctly.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
