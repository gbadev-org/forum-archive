    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I've been needing a project to test out my soldering skills. Is there anyone who's interested in helping? I'd like to somehow make a gba program that would let you browse a hard drive somehow connected to the gba (yeah, talk about a big project, eh?).
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Since it's a ARM system, does anyone know of a hard drive with ARM support (if needed)?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 2: Perhaps USB hard drives would be a great option.<br/>_________________<br/>All knowledge is good; only the way it is put to use is good or evil.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

now what to use it for....<br/>_________________<br/>ps...who?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyway, it makes lots of options. Perhaps someone could make a MP3 player for the GBA with mp3's on the hard drive. Now wouldn't that be sweet? Plus the fact that you could backup all your games with plenty ease-of-space.<br/>_________________<br/>All knowledge is good; only the way it is put to use is good or evil.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As tepples pointed out it's been done (ATA interface).
<br/>
Soldering is your LEAST problem with such a thing.
<br/>
MP3 players are common as dirt, why use a GBA for it?  The audio would be much poorer quality (44khz 8 bit stereo instead of 96khz over sampled stereo).  Power for the hard disk might be entertaining, they do suck down quite a bit of power even if it's a portable HD.  Backing up the GBA images seems more likely what you are interested in.
<br/>
To be honest you would have a lot of challenges to make that thing portable, aside from it being affordable.  If you don't plan on carrying it around then it's much easier to do.  Still won't be cheap, and will require some pretty decent engineering skills along with some experience.
