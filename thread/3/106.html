    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It seems to me that the Flash Advance Extreme is the most common and popular.  I'm particularly interested in the XG-Flash.  I'm wondering how well it works.  I hear that it has the ability to upgrade the firmware for future compatibility.  I'm curious to know if any of you have used it.  I've installed the software for both the Flash Advance Extreme and the XG-Flash(although I don't have either one) and it seems to me that the Flash Advance Extreme is probably the better choice.  Any information would be greatly appreciated.  Take care.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
