    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am looking to add a N64 analog stick to the touch screen of my NDS. Do you think I will need the IC chips from the controller board or just the analog modual? What are the purposes of the 3 film ribbions coming from the touch screen? Help is greatly appreciated ;)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the two input devices are completely incompatible. the touch screen can accept a value on the 2d plane at random points, where the analog stick gives an 8bit value for each plane. how you gonna tap a button on the touch screen with the analog stick? if you were able to somehow hook the analog stick up to the screen input (yeah right) you would need to seriously modify to touch screen routine in any game played.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
