    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My question is concerning the flash card.  I have a 128mbit card with the old Visoly Flash Advance Linker (it uses the printer port).  I doubt the reader/writer will ever go bad as long as I don't do anything crazy to it.  But what about the flash cartridge?  I see it has a 3v lithium battery on it.  If this thing suddenly stops working is it safe to assume the battery is dead?  If it is a battery issue, and I replace it, is this the only kind of maintenance I will need to perform to use this for years to come?  I paid a pretty hefty amount for this tool when it came out, and hopefully I won't have to buy another cart or reader/writer ever again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Intel strataflash (used by visoly) have a guarateed minimum of 10'000 or 100'000 cycles. (number of times you erase the cart).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
