<br/>
<br/>
most of the downloads (if not all) should work with real hardware. I guess it depends what cart you have, what do you have?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also, are you booting into the games directly, or from the flash cart's menu?  
<br/>
<br/>
I know a lot of the games don't have the right magic words to allow them to be booted into, but can still work on hardware if you use the a menu system....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've tried a bunch of stuff I knew worked (a while ago) and there fine, perhaps it was just the few games i tried first. I'm confident the cart is working fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
