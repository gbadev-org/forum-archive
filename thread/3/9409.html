Wouldn't it be great, to have the potency of play-yan chips, to play mp3, and being able to load homebrew? That way we would only have one cartridge in the pocket.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
good idea, but not really teckpossible. Also it is an expensive and hard to obtain item for those outside of japan...
<br/>
The m3 mini SD is seperior (apart from gba mp4 playback.)
<br/>
but damn do i wish i had play yan anyway!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The M3 is 80$ or so. And the the play yan can be bought for 41? in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.japanpa.com/ms2fr/catalog/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=play+yan&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;categories_id=&amp;inc_subcat=1&amp;manufacturers_id=&amp;pfrom=&amp;pto=&amp;dfrom=&amp;dto=" target="_blank">selected places</a> :) (sold out because nintendo himself is sold out).

Anyway, i believe, until i do it myself, I will never see it happens. (not a reproach though, the fact it's a device not really widely dealt speaks for itself). But I won't, eh, I'm kind of a newbie in those things ;).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, so you can find the Play Yan for $53, the GBA MP is still $25 (and can be found for less) and will do the same stuff the Play Yan does and then some.. Sure, it doesn't have an onboard mpeg decoder, but as the mpeg lib shows.. you don't need one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

MoonShell's DPG is MPEG-1 video and MP2 audio. Play-Yan and PSP video are MPEG-4 video and AAC audio, which can have better quality at a given bitrate. In addition, Play-Yan works on a GBA SP or Game Boy micro, both of which are smaller than a DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

You don't ride a train or bus often, right?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I currently take the train about 58 times a month.  I don't watch movies on the bus or train, nor do I want to.  I read books or play games or maybe even look at nearby pretty people, if there are any. =)
<br/>
<br/>
I might consider a movie if a ride were to last 60+ minutes uninterrupted.  I probably take about 6 such rides a year.  Worth $80, or $53?  Not to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, I don't take the train.. but, if I was in a situation where I would watch a lot of movies (aka, every morning or evening on the train) I'd get a portable DVD player and at least get 2x the screen size.

<br/>
I mean, if you watching on a 3" screen.. what's wrong with the GBA MP's codec?  You don't need Mpeg-4.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

File size. If you can fit more minutes of video on a given size SD card with a Play-Yan than with a GBAMP SD, it might be worth it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
