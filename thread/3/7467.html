    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody,
<br/>
I bought the heapdphone adapter but it works really bad. I can barely hear the sounds. There are somo type of sounds (the simplier that are like beeps) that it's volume is higher than the others but it's still low.
<br/>
I think it's missing a contact, I have somthing like this:
<br/>
  o--o    o is a contact
<br/>
  -ooo    - is an empty space
<br/>
  l_
<br/>
   -&gt; I think i'm missing this contact, it's one of the two that are present in the battery charger cable, I think it's the + one
<br/>
<br/>
So, what do you think about it?
<br/>
thanks<br/>_________________<br/>l

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got one of those SP adaptors, a 3rd party one that I think I bought it in Game (UK video game shop) and it works as expected. The contacts are the same as those in your diagram. So the problem is probably something else.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
