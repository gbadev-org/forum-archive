A binary patch, such as an Action Replay code (Action Replay products were sold as GameShark brand in some markets), works only on one build of a program.  The versions of a game released in North America, Japan, and Europe are almost definitely different builds.  Sometimes, a game publisher will fix bugs in a version 1.01 of a game, which is another build, and it throws off the binary patch as well.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing either 1. you have a different build of the GBA game than Datel used when making the code, or 2. you're trying to use a code for Super NES Super Ghouls and Ghosts with a GBA version.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you have to patch your Gameshark to an action replay to use all the new codes and such.
<br/>
<br/>
once in a while the gameshark glitches and says its one game when you have a totally different on in it..
<br/>
<br/>
but then just select the proper game in the list and everythings a go</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
