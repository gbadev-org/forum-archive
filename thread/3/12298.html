    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">just how far can a GBA be hacked? has anyone ever hacked the operating system on a gameboy? I want to know if its possible to almost completely redo the system, adding in usb support to a computer, allowing a usb drive to  be a storage device, and adding in more buttons.]
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
if anyone has any examples of gba's hacked to some of these things, i would love to see it. any links/tips are appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are numerous adapters to put a CF or SD card in the Game Pak slot, such as SuperCard and M3. Your program can read and write a the card in the GBA cart port using Chishm's libfat.
<br/>
<br/>
You can add more buttons by making a serial device and connecting it to the link cable port of the Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Advance SP. It should be possible to make a MIDI transceiver this way. (Has this been done on the GBA yet?)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, i kind of want to integrate the thing into the keyboard. So i'd like to reflash the entire gameboy with a new os. as my gameport would be hacked and turned into the input for all the numerous keys my intrument will have.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to flash my music program ONTO the gameboy it's self, not like a cartrige, but onto the actual gameboy. This will eliminate the need to use cartriges and I can also be able to kill the intro screen/make a new one lol. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now i want to keep the (im guessing bios) from the gameboy, just modify them to my needs and integrate my new software. This way i can update it if i need to and optimize the thing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No. The intro screen is built into the GBA BIOS, which is stored on <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_ROM" target="_blank">mask ROM</a> inside the GBA CPU itself. It cannot be replaced.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
