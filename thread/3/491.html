    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am designing a board with ARM7 processor and a Xilinx FPGA on it for hobby use, but before I freeze the layout I want to test if I can setup a development environment that includes GDB. (GNU Project Debugger)
<br/>
<br/>
So, since the GBA contains an ARM7TDMI core, I thought it would be possible to use the GBA to see if I can get everything running.
<br/>
(After soldering a JTAG connector to the CPU...)
<br/>
<br/>
But until now I did not find any information on pinouts of nintendo specific components in the GBA. So I begin to doubt if Nintendo actually exported the JTAG signals on some pins of the CPU.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone confirm that the GBA CPU has or does not have JTAG pins?
<br/>
<br/>
It is very important for my board that I do not depent on any boot rom that is already made, because the flash memory will not be in a socket.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for anyones time,
<br/>
