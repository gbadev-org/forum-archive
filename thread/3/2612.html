With a xboo cable, which can upload multiboot roms to the gba,
<br/>
is it also possible to download sram and / or multiboot roms from the gba?

Unless the multiboot program has been configured to replicate itself, you can't transfer a running multiboot program from the GBA to the PC with the XBOO cable. If you're trying to intercept a GameCube game's multiboot extras on their way from the GameCube to the GBA, try disassembling the BIOS, learning the details of the multiboot protocol, and bringing in somebody with electronics experience to help you build something <span style="font-style: italic">like</span> the XBOO cable to let you sniff the transfer so that your PC can act as a client rather than as a server.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
