    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a working GBA SP light that I took from a broken SP.  I have a GBA and wanted to know if I can install it inside the same way a Afterburner light is done?  if yes since it is a gba light would I still need the resistor that the afterburner uses?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">check if the light turns on when getting power first. You could try to insert it in the same way as you insert an afterburner :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">they might have designed it to use a slightly different resistor. it'd be best to look on the board where it's getting power and see what they use, or use a meter to see what voltage it gets. but then you need a reflective coating on the gba screen (it comes with an afterburner kit,) other wise it will look like ASS. when I installed my AB in a gba, I forgot the sheet on the lcd screen, and it was almost unplayable. so without that it may not be worth it.
<br/>
<br/>
also if you do go through it, and haven't installed an AB before (I know it's not AB but from an SP,) I recommend doing the psycho way of running the shower for 15 minutes and performing the swap in the bathroom. cause I did it in a normal room, with very little exposure and cans of compressed air, and there's still noticable specs in the damn thing! normally you wouldn't notice such tiny specs, but the way the light lights up the screen exposes them like hell!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
