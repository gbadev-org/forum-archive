    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a strange problem with my XBOO cable that I haven't found any other postings about -- here, or anywhere else that Google's aware of. With the cable attached to both the SP and my parallel port, I can power up the SP once without problems. HOWEVER, if I turn it off, then back on again, it hangs with a black screen and dim LED.
<br/>
<br/>
If the cable isn't connected to the PC, it doesn't affect the SP. It only affects it when it's physically attached to both the SP and parallel port.
<br/>
<br/>
I've isolated the problem down to the green/Strobe line, attached to pin 1 of the parallel port. If I attach a normally-closed switch between the SP and printer port, and hold it down (opening the circuit) while I cycle the SP's power, it boots normally, just like it does the first time I power it up after connecting the cable to both. 
<br/>
<br/>
If I press the button, hold it briefly, release it, and THEN cycle the SP's power, it hangs.
<br/>
<br/>
If I cycle the SP's power, then press and release the button after the SP has already hung, it remains hung.
<br/>
<br/>
For the hell of it, I tried soldering a 560-ohm resistor between pin 1 and pin 4 of the printer port. It didn't make the slightest bit of difference.
<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the hanging-on-reboot, the cable seems to generally work. However, the fact that the green LED is dimmed when it hangs &amp; the knowledge that there's ~2v difference between the two is bothering me... I suspect that whatever's going wrong probably isn't good for the long-term health of my SP, my motherboard, or both.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas what might be wrong? Is this normal?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
