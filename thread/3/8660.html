    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You're right, doesn't seem there are repair centers in your country. Seems Germany is the nearest. 
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about the costs there, but it looks like it's $55 for repair here.

89 available there. Not sure what the heck he means about the backlight.
<br/>

"This is the LCD ONLY. Not the backlight. It includes a backlight but it is only as a backup." Umm. K?
<br/>
<br/>
That, or buying a second broken gba sp would be your best bets.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
