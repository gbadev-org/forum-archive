    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey,
<br/>
Anyone know the pinouts of the EXT2 jack on the GBASP?
<br/>
I see a diagram embossed on the plastic case that identifies
<br/>
2 of the pins as the power input (5.2 VDC). So that leaves
<br/>
4 contacts and what looks like maybe another spring loaded
<br/>
contact. Anyway, say 3 more are used for stereo audio out with
<br/>
another (clean) ground reference. That leaves at least 1, maybe 2
<br/>
unused pins.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a diagram of the pinouts for this connector?
<br/>
Are there unused pins?
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, did you ever find out the pinout diagram? I need the same thing. Any links i seem to find on the net are broken links. In short, i need it cause my GBASP only plays sounds through the speaker when it has the headphone adapter plugged in and it wont charge, i think i messed something up creating a cable. Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
