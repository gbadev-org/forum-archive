    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The movie player is a really weird device.  One day I dump it and the same 512 bytes repeat everywhere.  I just dumped it again today, and it came out fine!  The rom mirroring is rather odd, it's as if each address is ANDed with 00111110 00111111 11111111.  Does this mean it's an incomplete dump, or is it just a memory mapping quirk?  The mask there makes a 512k rom appear to be 4 megabytes large.
<br/>
<br/>
Using the hacks from the chinese version dump, I managed to get it booting in visualboyadvance.  Does the exact same thing it would do as if there was no CF card inserted.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
That's very interesting given that it opens a whole world of possibility for Supercard hacking. Could you elaborate on how you performed the dump/give pointers? I am really interested into it so that we could reproduce it for the SuperCard firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,

Or so that homebrewers can develop native multipart multiboot programs. A long time ago, on the gbadev Yahoo! Group, I mentioned such an idea. Search the list for "Advance Disc System".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It is definitely writing to something, as it is able to store bookmarks even with the power off.

(those polysilicon wires can only operate so many times before blowing).  It would make more sense if they had a EEPROM or SRAM on the board somewhere where the stored the bookmark data.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anybody successfully worked out how to use this to read a CF card? 
<br/>
I have found that the firmware is reading and writing to the following adresses:
<br/>
0x090C0000
<br/>
0x098C0000
<br/>
<br/>
The second has a value of 0x50 when a CF card is inserted, although some writes cause this to become 0xD0. The first address has so far had the values 0xe0, 0xd0, 0xa0 and 0x00 on different attempts to read it, depending on what I write to either of the adresses. I also think that the address 0x0904000, 0x09060000, 0x09080000 and 0x090A0000 are being sed for something. Not sure what yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have worked out that the bookmarks are stored in the firmware starting at offset 0x060000 from the start of the ROM (ie address 0x08060000). This is visible in dumps of the ROM.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, it is possible to write to cart locations at 0x09040000, 0x09060000, 0x09080000, 0x090A0000 and then read back the same data from them. I am thinking they are an interface to the CF card, but unfortunately I still haven't managed to get any data from the CF card yet. I am not sure whether it will simply be a case of reading from some other location in Cart address space, or whether it involves DMA. If anyone has any ideas, I would be greatful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
