Instead of being limited to watching ASF MPEG4 movies in mono sound, higher quality MPEG4 formats will be playable in clear stereo sound. A 500k patch will be released for downloading off the Play-Yan site soon, which can then be stored on your SD card along side any videos. We'll keep you updated as to when the download appears.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Certainly interesting stuff. I assume that this patch means that we can also make the Play-Yan do other things too with our own patches, because it's a large change in functionality.
