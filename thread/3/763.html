Anyways, I finally got off my butt and decided to solder this keyboard today, and then I look at the site's <a class="postlink" href="http://www.hh.se/stud/d99tibr/soldered.jpg" target="_blank">photo</a> and it looks completely different--it looks to me like you're using pins 7 &amp; 9, although those aren't mentioned on the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.hh.se/stud/d99tibr/index5.html" target="_blank">site</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Blah, point is, it doesn't work for me ::shrugs:: This always happens anyways, but I checked the pins and whatnot; voltage is nice and stable at .7 volts (???) and I checked my GBA connector--it's fine, so any suggestions as to where I might have gone wrong?<br/>_________________<br/>(Works for me!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Two wires in the cable are not used, I just soldered them to pin 7 and 9 on the keyboard since thoose solderpads on the keyboard are not connected to anything. Didn't want to just cut the wires...
<br/>
<br/>
0.7V is totally wrong, it should be 3.3V, check your VCC connection... (pin 1).
<br/>
Most link cables do not have a pin 1 at all. Some link cables w/o a pin 1 can be modified, ie. you can open up the connector, and move an unused pin to pin position 1.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT
<br/>
Oh, and do NOT look at the wire colors in my pictures, there is no guarantee that they are the same as your cable. Use a DMM to check wire-to-pin connections.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's very strange. I'm using a 1k resistor, everything is wired properly, and I'm still getting .7 volts. My connector luckily has all 6 pins wired, and pretty much the only difference on my circuit board from yours is that mine says "0005" instead of "0012" in the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.hh.se/stud/d99tibr/soldered.jpg" target="_blank">photo</a>. Do you have any idea where this .7 volts might be coming from? Some kind of hi/low signal? I'm very sure I have the right pins, and I have a standard platinum GBA...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Check that VCC connection. (pin1)
<br/>
Also, you might wanna check the GND connection.
<br/>
<br/>
Voltage between VCC and GND is supposed to be 3.3V</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
