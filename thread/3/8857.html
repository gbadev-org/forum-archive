    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hello all, i'm new here so excuse me if my question sounds stupid i've searched over the forums but found nothing relevant so let's ask it:
<br/>
<br/>
i'm wondering if an Xboo cable could be made for the GBmicro, in other words: is the EXTension port the GBmicro the same as the "link" port on the GBA (plus one 7th pin) ?
<br/>
<br/>
if so, does the GBmicro BIOS works the same as the GBA one ?
<br/>
<br/>
i'm interested in tinkering arround with my micro and the ~200k of the memory is more that enough to make my "hobby code" running (and me happy).
<br/>
<br/>
thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

More than likely.

BIOS in all four 32-bit GAME BOY? systems is bit-for-bit identical.

Unless you need live connectivity with the PC, it might be good to upgrade to a GBA Movie Player CF so that you can 1. read and write a CompactFlash card and 2. test your programs while away from your PC (or do you carry a laptop at all times like I used to?).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks for the replay and all the helpfull informations.
<br/>
<br/>
i've also considered a flashcart-sd/cf but do i need to take the GameboyMovie or any would do (different rom bios / loading method ?) ?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
still i'm considering building the cable as the two-way communication could be helpfull for my project.
<br/>
<br/>
and to respond to your question, yes i always carry my laptop with me, not a lightweight one, and in facts it's my last pc with a "working" (the way it should) Paralell port, so the laptop will be my gbdev platform.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks again</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GBA Movie Player works for running "multiboot" programs, either stand-alone multiboots or those that access the FAT file system on the CF card. M3 and SuperCard are more expensive but they let you run homebrews that were originally designed to run from traditional GBA flash cards.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
