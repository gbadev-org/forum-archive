    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I want to record max quality videos if possible out of those consoles preferably the nds obviously, however my electrical/hardware knowledge is null. I found this: <a href="http://www.bripro.com/low/hardware/vidcap/index.php?page=gba" target="_blank">http://www.bripro.com/low/hardware/vidcap/index.php?page=gba</a> which would cover the gba although its a bit messy and looks like I'd have to use the snes controller to play.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone here is able/willing to build a small device that gets the video from both nds screens and sends the data through usb or whatever, but leaves the nds usable? I can write a driver (as in software) to get the data on display and save to disk. So basically the hardware means and an specification so I can write a driver, if the hardware is just soldering cables a tutorial would do but I doubt it or there would be one already.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
