    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all, I just found out that the F2A can be used to send other multiboot images than the loader software, because the loader software is in the linker software, uncompressed :D
<br/>
The Multiboot image is located around 0xA2A61 in when you open it with a hex editor. Currently, I have not been able to find out how big the image is, but it *could* give us some kind of clue about how to use the software to send multiboot images, just like EZ flash.
<br/>
Maybe someone could even write a program that inputted the MB file into the .exe, that would be pretty easy...
<br/>
Also, someone could write a "listening" program that listened to the REG_SI or one of the other link ports, as it could give us a lot of information about the architecture of the linker.
<br/>
<br/>
Just a untested thought (my linker is broken).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you saying the "Run *.mb" option doesn't work for you? because in my opinion just using that would be the best way to solve this ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: you would have to use 3.1 for this...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm considering whether to recommend the F2A linker. Can "Run *.mb" work from the command line, such as in a development environment's "run" script? Or does the user have to manually move his mouse pointer to a displayed button every single time?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.

<span style="color: indigo">* LordGraga slaps himself :P</span>

I didn't notice that the new release had that function, since the older versions worked fine for me :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
