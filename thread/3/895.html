    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a cable I got with a game downloader, it was a GBA-&gt;parallel 25pin cable.  So I thought perhaps for fun I could write a small server that would allow two games to be linked through the net (like say Fzero).  But I do not have enough references on the GBA linker stuff.  Anyone have any links for references on what it would take to make this?  I understand parallel port is slow...if I can, id like to find USB pinouts and stuff to make a link cable-&gt;usb. but im that bad with hardware,hence the need for as much reference material as possible.
<br/>
<br/>
I have the software side down, for testing i suspect I can just listen to the pareallel port, and send all bits that come down it from a GBA game to another computer IP where a GBA is hooked into there, thus connecting the games (though I think some fudging would be required to keep the GBA connection alive so it doesnt time out do to net lag)
<br/>
<br/>
So any references? anyone interested?

It is not possible to make it work with all games. But it might be possible with a few games. Especially games that use the 8bit UART mode.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't see how it could be done with games that use the "normal" communication mode. The latency over the net is a couple thousand times too high.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
