    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, does anybody have any recommendations for sites that are still currently selling good quality Gameboy micro faceplates in the UK? I've done some googling but they all seem to be out of stock, and doesn't seem to be that many on ebay. Cheers!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've just seen a pack of 4 go on ebay for about ?7 GBP, but I missed the bid because I was decorating the kids bedroom :(
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone's got any other recommendations to find some, or perhaps some spares that they no longer need/use, please get in touch!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
