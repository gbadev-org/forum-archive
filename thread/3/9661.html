<br/>
<br/>
i was just planning to paint my ds.
<br/>
recently i saw a video of how to open the DS properly.
<br/>
<br/>
unfortunately, i didnt save the link, so i dont know where i saw it.
<br/>
<br/>
does anyone has a link of a picturegallery or video showing how to open the DS?
<br/>
and does anyone of you custom-painted your ds'? ^^
<br/>
