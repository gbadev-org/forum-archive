SIO Normal Mode 
<br/>
<br/>
This mode is used to communicate between two units.
<br/>
Transfer rates of 256KBit/s or 2MBit/s can be selected, however, the fast 2MBit/s is intended ONLY for special hardware expansions that are DIRECTLY connected to the GBA link port (ie. without a cable being located between the GBA and expansion hardware). In normal cases, always use 256KBit/s transfer rate which provides stable results.
<br/>
Transfer lengths of 8bit or 32bit may be used, the 8bit mode is the same as for older DMG/CGB gameboys, however, the voltages for "GBA cartridges in GBAs" are different as for "GMG/CGB cartridges in DMG/CGB/GBAs", ie. it is not possible to communicate between DMG/CGB games and GBA games.

The GameBoy camera has a ROM inside, so your GBA is naturally going to boot from that. So you're either going to have to actually REMOVE the camera from the gbcamera cart and wire it into a GBA cart of your making, or switch the gbcamera ROM with your own. Out of those solutions, only the first one will be a *REAL* GBA cart.<br/>_________________<br/>There were worms, lots of worms, worms that made me crazy,..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The protocol that gb camera uses to communicate with gb printer seems not very difficult.
<br/>
Some details about it can be found in google.
<br/>
then to write a program to emulator the gb printer on gba.
<br/>
We can use one GBA (let the emulator program runing on it) and one GB(with the gb camera plugged into it),
<br/>
then let them communicate with each other.
<br/>
when communicating,the signal level is a problem.
<br/>
Maybe we can try with some resistor between the SO pin of the gb and the gba.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Are you suggesting that I display the images on a Game Boy Camera and then take a picture of my Game Boy with a GBA Mini Camera?

<br/>
hmm...well if you can print the pictures to the Gameboy Printer, then I would start looking at it from that angle....like how the printer calls the files from the cam and sends them over the cable to the printer.
<br/>
<br/>
I think I am sugesting kinda something like how a PC can print to a file instead of a printer.
<br/>
I guess what I am babling about is there a way to intercept the print data and save to pc or?
<br/>
<br/>
hmm.I'm new at this and have lots of crazy Ideas some of wich have worked :) so if this sounds crazy plz forgive me.
<br/>
<br/>
well you could always just use some old GBC Equipment to copy it to PC.

they do be stored in sram.

i think you may dump the gba game save with a multi-boot link cable or something like that. it takes the advantage of the nintendo multi-boot patent.
<br/>
but when a gb game cart being inserted,the multiboot feature is not available. you can't dump gb save in that way.
<br/>
or you have some extra device that can do dump work for you?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hold Start+Select while turning on the power to make multiboot available while a Game Pak is inserted. Then you can dump the SRAM with mb -f, or you can dump the ROM with mb -1.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
