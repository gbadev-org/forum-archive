Its more of just a project than a practical device but could someone help me out? I really dont worry about what I do to it its just wasting space right now also.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could try the GBA TV Tuner.  A quick search on Google gives tons of results for it.  If I remember right, you can either pick up analog TV stations off the air or you can plug in a coaxial cable into it and watch cable from your GBA.  I'm sure there are some other features, but I haven't researched it too closely.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
