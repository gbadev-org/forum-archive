    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I was wondering if any one could post a link to what they think is the easiest multiboot cable to make. I'm not very experienced with following schematics or soldering but i want to give it a try. plus any tips on constructing it would be apricieated :)

The "dumb cables" are straightforward to make with basic soldering skill, but they require a dedicated computer booted into <a class="postlink" href="http://www.freedos.org/" target="_blank">FreeDOS</a>.  The "smart" ones that work in Windows or Linux are a bit harder to make because they include a controller chip.  Macs are out because I know of no USB multiboot cable.  Do you have a spare DOS machine handy?

Basic microeconomics:  If you're not good at soldering, the easiest way to make a cable is to make something else and then trade for a cable.  More specifically, do whatever you know how to do at your job for a few hours, until you've earned forty U.S. dollars or your local equivalent.  Then <a class="postlink" href="http://www.lik-sang.com/info.php?category=51&amp;products_id=1415" target="_blank">trade for a cable</a>.  It's probably cheaper than taking a practical electronics class at your local tech school.  But I know, teach a man to fish...<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">actually yeah i do have a spare dos machine :)
<br/>
<br/>
do you have a link to the dumb cable instructions... sorry i've been searching google and i can't seem to find one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok thanks for your help...
<br/>
I guess I'm just going to have to save up and buy one cuz i can't seem to figure out the ASCII schematic that comes with the xboo cable :(
<br/>
<br/>
thanks anyways.

I use it to test my code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'am using it to program my flash carts and try out new code.

You don't need the optional pullups and diodes. Just make the simple version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i just don't understand schematics very well. if I had a parts list and instructions maybe i could do it. can any one explain how to make one in layman's terms? 
<br/>
would all the parts for it be available at a radio shack?

thanks for any help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well i went back and looked at the instructions again and i think maybe i get it now.
<br/>
this part of the instructions was confusing me.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">
<br/>
  GBA  Name  Color                SUBD CNTR Name
<br/>
  2    SO    Red    ------------- 10   10   /ACK
<br/>
  3    SI    Orange ------------- 14   14   /AUTOLF
<br/>
  5    SC    Green  ------------- 1    1    /STROBE
<br/>
  6    GND   Blue   ------------- 19   19   GND</span>
<br/>
Optionally, also connect the following signals (see notes below): 
<br/>
  4    SD    Brown  ------------- 17   36   /SELECT  (double speed burst)
<br/>
  -    -     -       +----------- 2..9 2..9 D0..7    (pull-up)
<br/>
  -    -     -       |---[===]--- 14   14   /AUTOLF  (pull-up)
<br/>
  -    -     -       |---[===]--- 1    1    /STROBE  (pull-up)
<br/>
  -    -     -       +---[===]--- 17   36   /SELECT  (pull-up)
<br/>
  RESET (mainboard) ------|&gt;|---- 16   31   /INIT    (automatic reset)
<br/>
<br/>
am i understanding correctly that I only need to follow the instructions in blue? is the name column important or do i just solder the pin it says under gba to the one under subd column (using a 25pin dsub)? do i need any parts besides the wire? or is that it?
<br/>
and has anyone had any problems with the difference in voltages between the gba and the printer port? The txt says that it won't dammage the gba is this for sure?
<br/>
thanks again!!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Jakerrzero on Sun Feb 16, 2003 2:42 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>
