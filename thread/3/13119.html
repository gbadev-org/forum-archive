As far as I can tell, Nintendo do not sell connectors in that store? Only cables and stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
The "Digital AV" output on the gamecube has only ever been used by the "Component video cable". This cable is not manufactured anymore, so it is not available in any store, and since it was only manufactured in a small quantity, it is very hard to find second hand as well.
<br/>
<br/>
What I want is just the connector, so that I can try a small hardware hack I have been thinking about for a few days.
<br/>
If I could find a complete "component video cable" then that would be fine I guess. I can just cut off the cable and use the connector. But as I said above, it is very hard to find this cable, and when you find one second hand, it is _very_ expensive.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
