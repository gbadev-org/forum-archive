    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
 I've been pondering over this idea for a while, and I finally just now have gotten around to posting it. Would it be possible to use a link cable (Such as the Madcatz GBA Gameport -&gt; Parallel Port cable) to transmit the data sent from GBA-&gt;GBA over the internet, making multiplayer gaming over the net possible? I'm aware that the parallel port isn't that fast, and that lag could probably sever the connection, but would this be possible, or has anything like this been done?
<br/>
 I have almost no development skills in this area, but this just seemed like a pretty cool idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In theory, it would be possible, but it wouldn't be able to emulate a normal Game Link cable because of the latency; commercial games expect a latency a couple orders of magnitude faster than even a high-speed Internet connection can provide. Games would have to support this type of device separately and use prediction to calculate where the other players are likely to be at any given time.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
