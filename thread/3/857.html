    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can only get little writter to work with the old flash linker, the one that needs power from batteries or power supply. i tried my other linker wich gets the power from the gameboy and it plugs directly to the gameboy from the printer port to transfer data to the cart. and little writer dont seem to find this device...  is this imposible or am i doing something wrong?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The linker that plugs into the Game Boy is either the F2A cable or the MBV2 cable, and little writer may not support it. For the F2A cable, use the F2A software. For the MBV2 cable, use Jeff F's MBV2 software (-p to program flash cart, -1 to dump flash cart). And it may not work with the GBA SP at all.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
