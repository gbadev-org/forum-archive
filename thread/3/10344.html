<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the advice . my am just inetrested to build it as a hobby i alrady own a supercard myself just curious how ti works and how to built one

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While building your own flash cartridge with 32MB of flash and 64KB of SRAM is possible, you're not going to be able to build a supercard, since it uses its own mapper.  The supercard contains 32MB of RAM, a bios, a CF controller, some SRAM, and a mapper that switches between RAM, BIOS, CF, etc.  Unless you're a wizard with Verilog, custom hardware which requires a mapper may be too difficult.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

this has schematics and circuit board plans to make your own. no sram, but hell, you could just reflash part of the 32mbit flash chip to store data. I might try and get a few of these made, they look schweet!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I see that on the page above you use a multiboot cable and the GBA to program the flashcart. So, is it possible to just by any flash cart and program it using say an XBOO cable, GBA, and that flashmanager program on the site? That way(if you already have everything else) you could just by the flashcart and not have to worry about buying anything else.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">no, different flash cards have different protocols (read/writes to the cart) before you actually have full control over the flash chip. I don't know if the mentioned software will do it. you need software that will use a certain multiboot cable, and the gba rom it uploads has to have the right protocol for flashing a certain cart.
<br/>
<br/>
so for this raw homemade cart, you don't need a certain protocol to flash the chips, or banckswitch the flash and sram. so you use the software they provided. I looked up the chips they used, and couldn't find a suitable seller on the net. I'm sure other chips which are readilly available could be used instead.
<br/>
<br/>
if you're gonna buy the flash card, it'll come with some way to hook it up to a computer and flash it, either using a gba or its own cradle.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now i understand how i can build a glashc ard . But i need to udnerstand the whole booting process for NDS and GBA . How it load the program i wrote in the flash card? Whats the sram is use for and and how the ROM part is access .
<br/>
<br/>
I have some experience in build CF controllers using a Microntroller and SD ones are tricky bnut not impossible . I guess the chip need to understand how to communicate witht ge GBA . So where do i find resource on how the GBA actually boot up and load the the program in the Flash card . Thanks

<br/>
<br/>
GBA boot process (.gba): The GBA first validates the 192-byte header, then jumps to 0x08000000.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo DS boot process (ds.gba): See PassMe manual.
<br/>
<br/>
ROM: Mapped into 0x08000000 through 0x09FFFFFF.
<br/>
<br/>
SRAM: Up to 64 KB (more if bankswitching is used as in <span style="font-style: italic">Pok?mon</span>) of non-volatile memory, which can be actual SRAM or flash memory.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll have to have at least some flash memory on your card to boot the GBA and copy your boot loader to GBA EWRAM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
