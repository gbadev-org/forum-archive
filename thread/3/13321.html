    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey there! I was searching the web (and this forum) for quite a long time now. My question is: How does the GBA generate Sound? 
<br/>
Does the GBA have a dedicated Sound CPU or does the ARM7 CPU handle the sound? The same goes for graphics. 
<br/>
Does the ARM7 handle all the sound, graphics and cpu processes? Or does the ARM7 just "serves" as a general Cpu?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry if I'm boring you but I just want to have these questions answered.
<br/>
Thanks in advance :)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Karlos on Thu May 31, 2007 8:17 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA generates sound in software.  Using DMA, the sound is sent to the sound hardware's buffer.  Sound hardware has a tiny FIFO buffer, 32 bytes large.  The frequency of the sound is controlled by a timer, this controls both the frequency in which the sound is sent by DMA, and the rate at which the FIFO buffer is emptied.
<br/>
<br/>
Graphics are done by dedicated hardware, except in the bitmap video modes which aren't used much.

Searching all over the web?  <a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm" target="_blank">GBATEK</a> is your answer.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, if these questions sound simple to you. But I am not a programmer. I am just very interested in the GBA's hardware in detail.
<br/>
And I have also found the GBATEK site already, but it is just too much for me to seek an answer for such a simple question in such a (for me) complicated site :)
<br/>
<br/>
So you say the graphics are handled by a dedicated chip? So where is it placed then on the GBA's PCB? I can only recognize the ARM7 and the Z80 chips. Then a few smaler ones, especially on the back side. What are these ones for?
<br/>
Maybe someone could post a link where the PCB layout of the GBA is explained. I would really appreciate that :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The PPU is on the same die as the ARM7 CPU.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
