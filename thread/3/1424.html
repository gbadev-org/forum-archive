I'm going to buy a GBA more and link them together with a link cable. Will two GBA's link if they're different versions, e.g. must I buy an asia version once more?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, the GBA has no territorial lock, I play my Japanese Mario Kart: SC on my European GBA.

I'm not sure, I've never tried it. But I think GBA's from multiple area's can work together.<br/>_________________<br/>Currently playing: NGC: Metroid Prime

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Even though the games themselves aren't region locked, the games' multiplayer protocols may be. If you're using Multi-Pak Game Link, all the games have to be from the same territory. For instance, you can link two copies of Mario Kart Advance (J) on any combination of regional GBAs and SPs, but you can't link Mario Kart Advance (J) to Mario Kart Super Circuit (U).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's true. However, while the Japanese versions tend to not work with other versions, the USA and European versions often work together. Doom does, for example. It is probably exactly the same cart, and I suspect Ecks vs Sever is, too, since my European version actually bears a USA rating and game ID number on the front sticker!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
