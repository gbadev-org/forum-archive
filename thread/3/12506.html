Otherwise, nobody knows of such an easy way to determine a firmware version without opening the box. Frankly, there hasn't been much research. Once NoPass came out and made homebrew cheap and easy again after months of having to use PassMe2, people stopped caring much about firmware versions.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Good to know, but is there a table of what firmwares match what color of console on the box?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To my knowledge, the DS classic is no longer sold new. All new Nintendo DS systems are DS Lite, and the white, black, and pink boxes have the DS Lite firmware, which behaves mostly like firmware version 5.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
