I think we should keep this poll up there to help out newbies such as my self. This way we don't ask this question over and over.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The majority of people only have the one flash cart; the poll would be better written as 'which flash cart do you own and has it worked ok' with XG - Yes, XG - No, EZ - Yes and so on options. Also you have left off a lot of choices (EZ2, EZ512, XG2Lite, F2A parallel, probably others) =)
