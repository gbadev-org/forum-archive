    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Anyway, I opened a commercial cart once (not sure if real or pirate) and i found this chip: M59PW1282. I searched on the internet and i found that it was... a 128 megabit flash chip. Quite unusual, since flash is expensive. Does anyone know what is going on here?
