    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone discovered if there is an accessable JTAG port on the GBA? Most Arm based systems have these  even if they are just a series of test pads, for simple boundry scan testing (IE it saves them money to check the PCB).
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone looked at the official Nintendo developement kit and it's debugging system?
<br/>
<br/>
Curiosity abounds here :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is not known wether there is a JTAG port on the GBA or not. But it is known that there is no ICE, so you would not have much use for the JTAG port even if it exists and you manage to find it. (Only thing you would be able to do is a boundary scan, and that would not be much fun would it? :-) )

The official devkit simply use FIQ and a software debug monitor.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
That's what I was hoping for an ICE. It seems like such a standard thing to put in geesh :)<br/>_________________<br/>If at first you don't succeed parachuting is NOT for you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
