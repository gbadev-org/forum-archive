    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I got a Flash2Advance Set with a Flash2Advance 256M Card.
<br/>
I used it for about 3 month and everything was working fine, until now.
<br/>
Today I got my GB Bridge, and after testing it, both, the GBbridge and the Flash2Advance Card don?t even start. When I put my Flash Card in the GBA it?s like no Card is insert. As a result the Software doesn?t find my Card.
<br/>
Is it broken because of my GB Bridge and is there any hope to get it to work?
<br/>
