    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wonder if I have a lousy GBA or if everyone has the same problem
<br/>
<br/>
if I crank up the vol @ full, and use headphones (I can hear it without headphones too), then there's a rather loud humming noise
<br/>
<br/>
*hummm*
<br/>
<br/>
very annoying, it's so loud I doubt my copy isn't broken somehow<br/>_________________<br/>current signature: 7/8</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It happens on the SP too, but without headphones you can only really hear it if you put your ear right next to the speaker, so I don't think it's anything to worry about :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah I know, if u put ear next to it u hear it.. otherwise rather clearly with headphones
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not worried about it, I just think it really sucks
<br/>
I thought it shouldn't be too hard to make a non humming gba :)
<br/>
I believe some people use this to actually listen to music on, poor people
<br/>
sound is a big part of gaming experience, we must stand up and fight!!<br/>_________________<br/>current signature: 7/8</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes. I've got two GBA's, they hiss a little at full volume. ( without headphones )
<br/>
<br/>
Take your card out and switch the things on an crank the volume up to test it.
<br/>
<br/>
The Gameboy advance SP, hisses like a snake and frankly it's very disturbing, I might even consider taking it back; it really is incredibly noisey. 
<br/>
<br/>
Bad filters perhaps? Hmm. Can't put headphones in the SP either without an adapter? What on earth were they thinking there?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
