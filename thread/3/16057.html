    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a strange situation on an NDSL that I have not seen before.  While I realize this is a game development board, I have reached the end of all my resources, so I thought I might throw this out here.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a Nintnedo DS Lite with a broken power switch &amp; a mountain of other parts.  So I swapped the switch out, however now the DS will not power on.  Before the operation it was working fine, other than the broken switch.  So here is exactly what's happening.  
<br/>
<br/>
When I engage the power switch, the green LED will come on &amp; stay on, however there is no video, although sometimes the top video will blink only briefly.  There is no audio.  Now if I plug the wireless unit back in, the green LED will come on &amp; stay on for all of 2 seconds.  It then blinks for one second every three seconds.  Why would the wireless unit effect the power &amp;/or the green LED?  Is there any resource for hardware wiring diagrams or LED error codes?
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Replaced it with another switch &amp; it works fine.  So it was either a shoddy solder job or the replacement switch was bunk.<br/>_________________<br/>-#2pencil</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
