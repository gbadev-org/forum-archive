    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey,
<br/>
I am interested in interfacing a USB Device which would be connected to the XPort. And the XPort would be connected to the Gameboy.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone done this before. I checked the Charmed Labs website and they claim it is possible using "add-on" circuit.
<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know how this is possible
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Of course it is possible. Hook up your favourite USB interface circuit to the xport, write the VHDL code, the GBA-side drivers and the PC side drivers, and you're done.
<br/>
A easier way would be to use an existing USB multiboot cable. The tricky part is finding one with known specifications...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you want to have the Gameboy act as a USB host (e.g. you want be able to hook up a USB mouse or keyboard) then the chances are that will be quite difficult - as from the little I've looked into it - you'd have to write quite a lot of software, including the drivers for the actual devices that you connect.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want the Gameboy to act as a slave device (e.g. connecting your GBA to a PC, where the PC is the host) then I can recommend the FTDI USB chipsets - these look like serial ports to the PC, but communicate over USB, and can appear like a serial port, or an 8-bit i/o port at the other end.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
USB is actually a lousy interface. It is insanely complicated, and requires a expensive license if you want to label your product as "USB compatible"(!!).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
