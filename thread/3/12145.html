    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey peepz!
<br/>
I was wondering if it was possible to link a GBA to a pc (with a home-made cable or such) and write the RAM from a game (like Zelda) which you played on the EMU to the real cartridge.
<br/>
The reason I'm asking is because I have "The adventure of Link" (the NES classic), and on the EMU I am facing "Shadow Link" while on the casette I just started.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this possible in some weird kind of way?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Saves can be backed up and restored if you have a reader/writer.  Keep in mind that not all games can be used with the read/write unit- some games have strange memory configuration, and the read/write unit may only support certain types of common memory.
<br/>
<br/>
Touch saves at your own risk.  I've irrevocably erased saves.  It's very dissappointing to lose hours of play due to stupidity.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Damn so I can't.
<br/>
Given the fact that I don't have a reader/writer.
<br/>
btw....losing the save that is on there isn't really bad.
<br/>
I just started the game on the cart.
<br/>
In the emu I am facing shadowlink.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You need a device that can read/write saves on standard carts.  I don't think that there is a universal device that does this that is available to the general public.  You might be able to upload a multiboot program to patch the save for you, but I don't think that anyone has written a standard utility to do that.
<br/>
<br/>
As for losing the save, just a warning.  Your circumstances may change.
<br/>
You could always lose your data by overwriting the PC side save with the cart save (without making a backup).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The program I've seen with the best ability to manage saves from real cartridges is FlashManager.  With this, you can read and write to a real cartridge that has FLASH or SRAM saves, which is useful for making a backup copy of the savefiles from official cartridges.  However, although it can read and write EEPROM saves, it doesn't work correctly.  When viewed in a hex editor, the sequence of every 8 bits in the save file is reversed.  It probably wouldn't be an issue though, since I'm sure you're just backing up the save file for archival purposes, right?  The "flipped" file should work fine when sent back to the cartridge.  When attempting to use it in VBA however, it won't work because of the reversal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">FlashManager can write saves to carts as well, and I apologize that my original post did not make that clear enough.  In any case, I believe there is a fix for the 8-bit-reversal issue with EEPROM, but as it would not be needed for mere archiving purposes, it would most likely be beyond the scope of this forum.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
