    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Where can I find info on how to switch banks on GBA flash carts? I want to be able to do it in my app, though I don't have a cart to test with. All I can find is how to write to the flash.
<br/>
<br/>
[edit] I found info for the EZFlash III, but that's it. Also is there a way to tell which type of flash cart is inserted and how many ROM/SRAM banks it has?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's what I was looking at, but it doesn't appear to have much information about bank switching.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For Visoly, search within that page for "VisolySetFlashBaseAddress".
<br/>
For XG and NeoFlash, look for "Flash offset register".
<br/>
For EZ-Flash III, look for "SetRomPage".
<br/>
<br/>
Which carts were you planning on supporting?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, I thought those were for writing. I'd just pass ROM addresses to those?
<br/>
I hope to support as many carts as possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
