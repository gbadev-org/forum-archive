    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">in a portable power supply for your  GBA i have the pinout and will do it for myself (integrating it into an aluminum briefcase) and was wondering if anyone had any thoughts also is there any way i could power/charge two devices off the same supply (different requirements) if so a schematic of the solution would be great

thanks in advance,

What exactly are you trying to do or ask? Be clear, it's impossible to guess what someone wants.

You want a portable power supply to charge it or one that fits into a power outlet?
<br/>
Designing the power supply isn't the problem. It's determining what you want.  Are you wanting to use a battery (IE 12V lead acid or 3 Lithium Polymer cells rated at 2200mah, or 10 GP3300 NiMh sub C cells.. etc).  If you need 5.2V 230ma is what comes out but what power source are you converting?<br/>_________________<br/>If at first you don't succeed parachuting is NOT for you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
