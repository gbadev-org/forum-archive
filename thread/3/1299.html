    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was just wondering if anyone has any experience with the Compact Flash version of the Gameboy wallet.  I have been unable to get mine to reconize the boot software on the the Compact Flash card.  I had a simular issue with the Smart Media version I tested and it ended up being an issue with formatting the card.  I have tried formatting the compact flash several ways under Windows XP and also formatting in a digital camera.  All that happens is it boots to the screen with the curtain on it and freezes.  I never get to the Gameboy Wallet menu.  I have tried the last several version of the GameWallet software including the lastest posted on the website.

Any help would be appreciated!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, that is the problem.  The first Compact Flash GBA wallets had a lot of compatibility problems with different cards.  There is a newer version out now (it is the one without a light) that is supposed to be more compatible.  I sent mine back and they are sending me the new version.  I will post what I think of the new version when I get it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just thought I would mention to anyone who might be getting a Compact Flash GBA Wallet.  Get the newest version.  The new version is black, has no light and stick out the back of the GBA instead of above it.  Mine works great now!  I have tested it with PNY and SanDisk flash cards.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anybody tried to reverse engineer the Game Wallet's hardware interface to CF? This would let a user load any of several .mb programs and play them on the GBA without a cart.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
