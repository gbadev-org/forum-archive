<br/>
From what I've read, this is completely a rumor. I have heard that Nintendo will replace the old GBA LCD screens with brighter, more clear ones manufactured by Kodak sometime, though. Even if this is true, it wouldn't affect any of software development aspects.

Let's just say that IF they were to make a new GBA it most certainly woldn't look like that :). And speaking of rumors, the only thing I've heard about a (supposedly) new GBA is that there "might" be a new one out when the next stationary console will be released. There is not a chance, or at least I think so, that a new handheld from Nintendo will be released any time soon. There are two good reasons for that:
<br/>
<br/>
1. GBA is selling very well, and while the customers are satisfied there is no reason at all to try and market something new. The GB concept have lasted almost 15 years or so by now and evolves much slower than the stationary consoles.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Since GBA is getting a respectable userbase right now (over 20 000 000 units or so) the developers must have a chance of profiting on that and in return big N will profit from licence money flowing straight into the company. Secondly, marketing another unit right now will put Nintendo in an unpleasent situation where they would have to compete with them selves. GBA against "GBA 2". That would force them to advertise against their own product, wich of course is pure stupidity.
<br/>
<br/>
Because of that I don't think that we will se another handheld until the next stationary hardware. And I don't think that they will only add two more front face buttons, add backlight, CPU power and such. I think that they will evolve the GBA&lt;--&gt;GC connection more. Perhaps with functions that allows the gamer to play online using the "GC 2" console as gateway or something similar.
<br/>
<br/>
What about that theory, does it sound resonable? :/<br/>_________________<br/>"The best optimizer is between your ears..."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree, it doesn't look that ergonomic and I didn't cared much for the GBC either. This thing must be so small if the display has the same sie as the gba, which it probably has.

From what I have heard no. You can not tell. It has me a bit worried since some palette might look horible with the light since some palettes are extreamly saturated to look decent on the gba.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi All :) 
<br/>
<br/>
To fill in the blanks that some of you didn't know.
<br/>
<br/>
The GBA SP was announced on 7th January. So it's not surprising that a few of you didn't know about it. 
<br/>
The only differences are: the shape, a built in L-Ion battery and a light. All other specs (screensize, CPU, memory etc...) are the same. 
<br/>
<br/>
Personal opinion: It was a pretty cheap shot by Nintendo to keep this announcement secret until two weeks after Christmas where millions of GBA's were sold. 
<br/>
*sigh* in fact, the release of this system has dampened my enthusiasm to write software for the GBA. I keep thinking: "What's the point, the GBA will be obselete in a couple of years anyway".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
True, with the GBA selling as well as it does, and with the Gameboy player in sight, it's even hard for me to believe that they even made the effort to produce another hardware. Especially since their position is far from thretened.

I don't agree. With the respectable userbase the system has, it is far from dead and will surely be alive and kicking for years to come.
