Here, I have another question about GBA cart. .   What are the functions of pin 1 and pin31 in GBA cart. interface ?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all... read the basic docs before asking questions. All good GBA doc's, such as GBATEK, answer this question.
<br/>
<br/>
But, I'am in a good mood today, so I'll answer your question anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
pin 1 is VCC, it is certainly not unconnected. You might refer to pin 2? pin 2 is clk out. It is not used in most carts. I can imagine stuff like the GBA cam might use it.
<br/>
pin 31 is the cart IRQ line. It is tied to GND in the vast majority of carts, it is used to detect if the user unplugs the cart. It can be used as a generic IRQ line. Again, applications like the GBA cam may very well use it, for example, to tell the GBA when it is time to read data from the video FIFO.
<br/>
<br/>
It might even be possible to let a DMA channel service the cart IRQ (?)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am sorry that I asked a basic question and mistyped pin1.  
<br/>
I have had tried to find out what pin2 and pin31 were, but I could not get any data to make me understand them.
<br/>
<br/>
Next time, I will read more before asking question.  Thank you for your reply.<br/>_________________<br/>---
