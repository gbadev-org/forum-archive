    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I am using the gamesave code found on gbadev in the docs section <a class="postlink" href="http://gbadev.org/files/how_to_save_data_on_a_gba_cartdrige.txt" target="_blank">http://gbadev.org/files/how_to_save_data_on_a_gba_cartdrige.txt</a> and this works great in the emulator but I can't seem to get it working with my SuperCard.
<br/>
<br/>
Well actually, the SAVE part works, its the retrieving part that doesn't work.  I put the game on my supercard, played and saved my score - then soft exit to the supercard s/w - save the game to flash.  If I just rerun the game it is fine (cause it is still loaded), but if I load something else, and then my game, it doesn't pick up the saved data.
<br/>
<br/>
The funny part is that I can take the ".sav" file off my supercard, throw it on my pc and run the game in VBA and it finds the data no problem!!
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?  I know this is not an issue with my supercard (other games work fine)  Thanks in advance!

Update - Upgraded to the latest SuperCard S/W and all works fine.
