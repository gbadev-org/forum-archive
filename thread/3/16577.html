    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it possible to directly use Libfat with a MicroSD with a chip from DigiKey(122-1448-ND)? Or would I have to have some other chip that will preform operations and then call it with the main chip?

Touche, But that was a chip that is simmaler to one used in PassMe and do I need to use all of the 32 I/O for the rom or Do I have a lot free or two so could I get another chip, make a program to read/write for my SD and then use I/O on the main chip if I only have 2 free?
<br/>
<br/>
Also do you know any resources talking about programming a read/write for an sd with SPI?
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I am also looking into: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.xilinx.com/publications/xcellonline/xcell_55/xc_pdf/xc_spi55.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.xilinx.com/publications/xcellonline/xcell_55/xc_pdf/xc_spi55.pdf</a>

Edit Two: Thats fail ^

Edit Three: I am looking into: MMC with SPI by: Ed Waugh 2004, <a href="http://www.edwaugh.co.uk" target="_blank">www.edwaugh.co.uk</a><br/>_________________<br/>~Simplicity is what counts but so does design</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
