    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1st of all, I really wish Nintendo added the GBC's IR Port to the GBA, but is there any kind of adapter you could make for the GBA? or could you somehow connect the GBC's IR Port to the GBA?
<br/>
<br/>
Now down to business...
<br/>
<br/>
My Gameshark came with a 25Pin D-Shell Parallel Cable that links to my GBA (A USB version is also avalible) I know it can write to the Gameshark Cartridge wich says alot, so what would I need to do to make it write to the GBA? or the GBA Cartridge?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
