    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now I know there have been a lot of posts regarding home-brew shops and the such - and it always comes down to the cost of cases and legal battle regarding the logo. I have one possibility that I don't think has been suggested...
<br/>
<br/>
If you were to buy a game that is not in demand - barbie for example - and re-program the ELPD to make it flashable, add your program and re-program ELPD to make it non-flashable. Sell game.
<br/>
<br/>
Now then this would mean no PCB and case costs. I am fairly sure (correct me if I am wrong) but as you bought the official cartridge, you also bought the logo on the original game and therefore when selling it are selling the logo that you bought - it is legal to sell the original game so why not part of it.... Now there is a very big problem with this method - are there any commercial games that can easily and neatly be hacked for reuse?
<br/>
<br/>
Even if this were not a good idea for a homebrew shop - would it be a useful cheap source of flashable carts?
<br/>
<br/>
I dunno, what do you guys think?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1: There is no EPLD in commercial game carts.
<br/>
2: There is no flash memory in commercial game carts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Game carts use a ASIC with built in mask ROM or OTP.
<br/>
And as Miked0801 said, all game carts are produced by Nintendo.
