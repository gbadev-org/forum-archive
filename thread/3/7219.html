Is anyone using their robot controller boards?  Has anyone here done any FPGA coprocessor stuff with their boards?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by legalize on Wed Oct 19, 2005 9:31 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">AFAIK, Charmed Labs is not selling their robotics controller directly anymore. They are, however, selling something similar through <a class="postlink" href="http://www.botball.org/" target="_blank">Botball</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
I have an Xport 2.0 (the SDRAM version, which they also aren't selling anymore), and while I've written some simple VHDL for it, I haven't done anything like coprocessing.
<br/>
<br/>
I mainly use mine as a devcart, and it indeed works well for that. It can be flashed while still inserted in the GBA (or DS), and it automatically resets the system for you.<br/>_________________<br/>My world is black and white, but if I blink fast enough, I see it in grayscale.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can still buy some kits directly from Charmed Labs according to their order page.  The botball site doesn't sell the robot kit separately from a GBA, and I'm not really interested in buying another GBA, so....
<br/>
<br/>
How does the Xport 2.0 that you have compare to a flash cart like the X-ROM?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Which order page? <a class="postlink" href="https://charmedlabs.secureserverdot.com/purchase.php" target="_blank">This one</a> lists the XRC as out of stock. <a class="postlink" href="http://charmedlabs.com/discuss/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=819#819" target="_blank">This post</a> is where they said they will no longer make them.
<br/>
<br/>
The Xport doesn't compare well with modern flash carts if you don't need the FPGA. It only has a 32 Mb chip, and no SRAM or EEPROM for saves. For half the price, you can get a flash cart with 8 times the memory, as well as savegame and RTC support.
<br/>
<br/>
If I were to buy a flash cart today, I think I would get the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.efa.cc/index-e.html" target="_blank">EFA II</a>, since it can also be kept inserted, and apparently even supports automatic reset.<br/>_________________<br/>My world is black and white, but if I blink fast enough, I see it in grayscale.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, I see now.  Its the Xport 2.0 that's in stock, but it wasn't obvious at first that this is <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> the FPGA circuit with some headers and not the entire robot kit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
