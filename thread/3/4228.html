    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone....
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a newbie here and have no experience what so ever related to GBA development... but I just seen this new wireless device for GBA allowing people to play multiplayer games without wires.
<br/>
<br/>
sound so interresting, and the devices looks very neat.
<br/>
I've read somewhere its a 2.4GHz device... I wonder what kind of speed it could performe... 
<br/>
<br/>
does anyone of you think it would be possible to establish a wireless LAN connection on GBA and maybe build a webbrowser to surf the internet ?
<br/>
<br/>
I know there is a linux project toward the GBA, so why not. I mean... it does not necessarily means this would need linux, I think the webbrowser could use gecko or khtml build on top of regular GBA API. there is a module GBA programming under kdevelop, i dont know what is it worth.
<br/>
<br/>
but anyway I'm open to hear from you guys, what do you think ? surfing the internet ? cheap PDA ? GBA is the way to go.<br/>_________________<br/>- linux on GBA

<br/>
<br/>
It's what the tool is meat to do, old multiplayer games are suppose to work flawlessly using this wireless device. The game itself does not see a different.
<br/>
<br/>
they players are recognize in the same way.
<br/>
<br/>
which means, same programming interface than cabling.
<br/>
just different hookup.

Think about the difference between a null modem cable and a dial-up connection. With a null modem cable you can just stream data both ways. With a dial up connection you need to send commands to the modems to dial up/answer, negotiate speed and add error correction.
<br/>
<br/>
Two different ways of communicating, but we use the same standard serial port in both cases.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
