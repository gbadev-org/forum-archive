A thought just occured to me - the Super Game Boy is essentially a Game Boy stuffed into a SNES cartridge, yeah? Well, could one simply open one up, swap all the relevant parts with parts from a Game Boy Color and be able to play GBC games on their SNES? I'm sure it's been discussed a million times but the thought only just occured to me. Thanks for humouring me, heh...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Game Boy's video chip has a 2-bit-per-pixel output. Super Game Boy's glue logic expects a 2-bit-per-pixel stream from the Game Boy.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Boy Color's video chip has a 15-bit-per-pixel output. Game Boy Player is built to handle this, but Super Game Boy is not.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
