    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually you are wrong! I havent destroyed the firmware, nor did I use FlashMe :) Infact, the DS Lite is shared with other family members and hence I cannot "harm" it in anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason for wanting the firmware file is merely out of curiosity, to better understand firsthand what kind of protection nintendo DS currently has for wifi downloads, how strong their rsa signature check is, etc. Simply put I am a reverse-engineering junkie, and I am itching to get my hands on the firmware code.
<br/>
<br/>
So, the answer I am looking for is "Yes I have the firmware file", or "No, I dont have the firmware, but you can get it from here". If I wanted a philosphical rant, I would go to a different forum :)
<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, do you have it? Even if you have the relevant portions of the firmware extracted or disassembled, that will keep me going for now.
<br/>
<br/>
Infact, if you can tell me how to extract the firmware from my DS Lite without opening it (if thats possible) thats good for me too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you haven't flashed your DS, then you can dump your own DS's firmware to a card using a NoPass, a GBA Movie Player, DSLinux, and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dslinux.org/blogs/pepsiman/?p=36" target="_blank">pepsiman's technique</a>. I assumed that you were in the same situation as the fellow in that "help me I want to look at my DS's original firmware but I already flashed it" topic. The rant happens whenever I suspect piracy.

No, I can't help you disassemble it because that's not my specialty.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I live in australia, and we dont have any fancy hacks and mods here. Getting them shipped from US is way too painful and expensive, hence trying to find some new way to download homebrew code via wifi without any mods.
<br/>
<br/>
I will be much obliged to a kind soul who can dump their firmware and share it with me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yep, you are right, its no use for the DS Lite. Anyway, I finally managed to place an order for Max Media Dock and surprisingly they ship to australia for only $7. Hopefully this will let me do a lot more with my DS Lite.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Then the Nintendo DS scene may not be for you or for other people in your country :-( Have you tried the GP2X scene?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
