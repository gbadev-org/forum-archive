    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want to build a product with a GBA link-port where can you buy the 6-pin GBA connector?
<br/>
<br/>
The only way I can see to buy one is to buy a 4-player link cable and cut it apart and get 3 cables (the master cable doesn't have all the pins)...

You can make your own cable, and use the general purpose communication mode in the GBA, it easier to use this for custom made electronic devices. If you want to communicate data wise (youve got a microcontroller on board), and not need much speed, then you can use normal mode. It allows 32 bit transfers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That is exactly what I want to know.  e.g. Flash Linkers, USB to GBA serial devices, where do they buy their connectors?
<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking of building a GBA accessory (and probably won't qualify as a certified Nintendo developer) and would like to know where to purchase the connectors...
<br/>
<br/>
I am also interested in knowing where to buy cartridge shell cases (to put custom electronics in).  I know that for "home brew" I can simply take apart an old game but for a "product" you would need to buy the plastic shells...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any sources for these items?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, you mean you just want the connector? And those catridge shells?
<br/>
<br/>
Well if i were you i would just do it the easy way, use existing items and make do. Its too much hassle to get just one unit to make a prototype. You should worry more on the PCB youre going to design. Once it works, then i guess you can start looking at the rest.
<br/>
<br/>
Im so sorry, but i dont know where to find these guys. Maybe Simon might know? Poor Simon, everybody is interrogating him. Well, he might help you                    :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dont think it would be very hard to find a supplier for the connectors, assuming you want to buy a few hundred or so. I cant imagine them being very expensive either.
<br/>
<br/>
How many do you want to buy?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right now I am only in the concept/planning stage but if I complete it either I would try to sell my design to a 3rd party company (probably too diffcult to become a certified Nintendo developer) or might think of producing it myself without Nintendo's blessing.
<br/>
<br/>
If I did the latter I would think initial production would be qty 1000 or so.
<br/>
<br/>
I have looked on the internet for wholesale suppliers for these but have yet to find any.  Beginning to guess that it is a custom Nintendo connector and the plastic cases would require custom injection molding which is big $$$.  So am looking for an alternate (cheaper) lower quantity source.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas or sources?

Unfortunately you need to order in batches of 2000 although they are quite cheap.
<br/>
<br/>
I still haven't managed to find anyone selling the cartridge cases or blank rom cartridges yet, anybody got any ideas ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
