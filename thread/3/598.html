<br/>
<br/>
When I change a game that is on my flash card, I lose the savegames for all my games! Is there any way to prevent it? I use the Flash Advance Extreme USB 256M. Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Lionheart: LittleWriter has an auto load / auto save feature which prevents you from losing your savefiles, you should try it.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.kiwibonga.com" target="_blank">http://www.kiwibonga.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If so, that's pretty weak.  Anyway, when you are on the other side of the fence and have worked 1-2 years on a game (many times working insanely long hours)...and your company has spent millions of dollars developing a game...you'd probably be pissed about someone pirating your game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">/me would never pirate a game.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I (personally) do consider piracy to only encompass this: If you use an illegitimate copy of a game (or something) instead of purchasing a legitimate copy.
<br/>
<br/>
So, there is nothing wrong with playing an illegitimate copy of a game that the author doesn't sell anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
(NES games, mose SNES games, etc.)
