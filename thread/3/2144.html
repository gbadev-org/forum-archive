    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of any technical documents that outline how the link port on the GBA works? 
<br/>
<br/>
I basically want to connect a RPM sensor to it that would pulse on every revolution of a wheel then the GBA would read and act on this information. Does this sound feasable?
<br/>
<br/>
Does the port interupt on data recieved? Is it buffered?
<br/>
<br/>
So many questions, I hope someone can help out!
<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You'll usually want to use "SIO UART mode" to communicate with devices not specifically designed for a GBA, as SIO UART mode uses a protocol that differs only from the popular RS232 in voltages used.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
