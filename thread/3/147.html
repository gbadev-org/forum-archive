    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've decided on buying a flash cart but i'm stuck between the flash2advance linker or the XGFlash USB linker. I would prefer to have USB because in a couple of years i might have a pc without a parallel port. But if the XGFlash carts are quite poor then i'd rather have an F2A one. Does anyone have any experiences with either of these?
<br/>
<br/>
Also does anyone know good places to buy them in the UK?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I've heard otherwise. Here's an XGFlash review from GBAX.com: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbax.com/xglinker.html" target="_blank">http://www.gbax.com/xglinker.html</a>.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">tepples: There's a whole list of people on the gbaemu forum. The thing that stands out is Dell 8100 (if I remember correctly). No-one seems to be able to configure the parallel port to work correctly on that one. Is that what you've got? I also saw one of the same people trying to complain in the Dell forum - but it seemed to get lost in the noise. I took an interest as I design things which use the parallel port and am always intested in problems, but as I've never seen a Dell 8100 I don't know what the problem is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">get the flash 2 advance one.  It is made by a company that has been around for a while.  Longer then the xg flash.  Another thing is that if you get a game wallet you can only use it with the flash 2 advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
