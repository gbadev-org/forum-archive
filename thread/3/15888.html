    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm wondering what the little screw, that looks like an optical drive's pot tweak screw, under the battery does? 
<br/>
<br/>
I honestly just spent a half hour trying to find an answer, and the fact that I can't find anything on it makes me a little worried to just start recklessly turning it.
<br/>
<br/>
Information is appreciated!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think, it'll kill the LCD. Most likely, it is to fine-tune V<span style="font-style: italic">com</span>, that is used for compensation on the LCD. If it is incorrectly set, there will become a line-structure visible on the display, alongside with a significant loss of contrast (till the screen turns blank). But, this is normally no way to kill a display, because the loss of display quality is usually reversible (just fine-tune, till the quality looks good). 
<br/>
Alas, if the adjustment is meant for the backlight of the display, it actually could kill the whole thing, but this is not very likely: CCFL inverters on this scale usually don't need external regulation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's control of brightness in small diapazon.
