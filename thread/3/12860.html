    <h4>#123586 - spinal_cord - Thu Mar 29, 2007 9:27 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am trying to do a similar hack to what Natruim42 did with a 1.8" hdd instead of a 2.5". they are both pin exact but the 1.8" runs on 3.3v.
<br/>
<br/>
I am however having trouble. I can seem to find much about compact flash connectors (as in the phisical layouy of the pin numbers)
<br/>
<br/>
can anyone help, also is this likely to work?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
