    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, Im new here and um last night I cracked open my gba (not cracked but you know what I mean :P), and started messing with the terminals on the CPU AGB side. When I connected VDRV3 to GND, my gameboy just cut  out and now nothing will start. My friend said that I "bricked" it, but i dunno. There is still electricity running through it so I should still be able to unlock it. Any ideas? (btw everything i meantioned above is referenced from the circuit board)

<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Souylsin on Fri Jul 11, 2008 8:52 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I remember correctly, there is a fuse in the GBA..I don't remember where it is on the board, so hopefully someone here will point it out, if I'm right.
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, all you did was blow the fuse..Otherwise, it's time your GBA took the dirt nap.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: No wait, I just now really read what your post said. Wow, that's really bad... Sounds like you blew one of the chips, which means your GBA is now trash. Sorry.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tinkering with hardware is a bad idea unless:
<br/>
A) You know what you are doing and why, or
<br/>
B) You don't care if something ends up broken.

The best scenario is satisfying both of the above requirements.
