<br/>
You can use any drawing package you want (I used Adobe Illustrator to design my first PCB).  I had it printed on a transparency, and then I exposed it on a photosenstivie PCB.  You then "etch" the board with an etching solution.  
<br/>
<br/>
The drawback is you have to still drill all the holes yourself and the etching solution is really nasy.  You can buy stuff here if you are interested <a href="http://www.elexp.com" target="_blank">www.elexp.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If they're the people I'm thinking of (they may not be) I've heard good reports. The main problem here is that carts need a non-standard board thickness.  (Standard is 1.6mm). You'll pay extra for the right thickness, even if they'll do it. I made a GBC cart once using 1.6mm and it worked fine but was pretty useless as you couldn't put it in the plastic box as it was too thick. As a general pcb industry guide my company reckons on a pcb job costing ?400 no matter how many sub-boards are on it, and up to a volume of 25 boards. This includes plated through holes.
<br/>
<br/>
By sub-boards I mean that you can specify routing between parts of a layout and the manufacturer doesn't seem to notice that you're getting 6 boards for the price of 1.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
yes, i did. Just last week i revised Timmy's schematic (using StrataFlash, single-gate logic...) and did a 2-layer layout with Eagle (an excellent software for me ;-) ). The board is 31mmx51mm and should fit into an original cart-housing (tested with "Monster Inc. &amp; Finding Nemo" cart).
<br/>
The only thing is, that my board will have a thicknes of 1,5mm and not 1mm like the original board (pcb-pool doesn't offer 1mm base material). So for a perfect fit, the housing has to be modified by milling down the 0,5mm.
<br/>
I'll get the pcbs in about 2 weeks. Then i will test it, if i get all parts until then.
<br/>
If someone is interested in the schematic and the layout, let me know.
<br/>
The files can be viewed and edited with the freeware-version of Eagle.
<br/>
<br/>
But beware. It?s a Flash-only cart (NO SRAM, NO EEPROM) and for me a "just-for-fun-and-development"-project (and a starting point for further gba hardware devs). So if you just want a Flash-cart, buy such a F2A or equivalent thing for about ?70. You'll never be cheaper or better with this homebrew stuff...

<br/>
Thanks for the dimensions.  On your site you mention that the cards are 0.5mm thick, but I also read they are 0.8mm thick, can either thickness work?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
Ok Olimex does 0.8mm for an extra $5.  I am thinking of using the GBA cartridge mainly for the nintendo DS with the passme they are making.  Will I still need to use the updown counters (or a CPLD) for sequential memory addressing?  Also does this depend on the code or do I have to assume sequential addressing will always be occuring?  I am thinking it would be a snap to make a cart if only a flash chip was needed instead of requiring extra sequential logic chips (up/down counters or CPLD).  I think Ampz did a pretty good job to get his design on two layers :)  I am also looking at some new flash chips from Intel (28F128L30) that may be able to do the sequential addressing themselves, but I am not sure about this.

That's who I used in the beginning, but you might have the PCB thickness limit with them, or they don't offer any other thicknesses because they put them all on one PCB order.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I have used a AMD29LV320 with a CPLD using a MBV2 to program the cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
Would anybody be interested in a AMD or SPANSION version of the Ampz cartridge that fits in an original GBA cartridge case. 
<br/>
<br/>
The circuit would cost about $5-$10 to build excluding case.
