    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all, I have thought about this before:
<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that the only differences between 64 and 128 mbit F2A carts is the number of chips that is on the back of the PCB, some Intel chips...
<br/>
I have thought about if it is possible to buy such chips in low quantitys (2), and then stuff them on the back of a 64 mbit F2A cart to turn it into a 128mbit cart!
<br/>
<br/>
What do you think about the theory?
<br/>
I think that it would be likely to work, as the chinese manufactors..is chinese :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Assuming there is no difference in the ASCI/PLD, yes, then it would work.
<br/>
But I fail to see the point. Have you checked the strataflash prices lately?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My eyesight is not so good, so I do all my surface mount work under
<br/>
a binocular microscope. I've become pretty good with a hot-air
<br/>
re-work iron and solder paste.
<br/>
<br/>
However, there's no way I'd even attempt to mount a Ball Grid
<br/>
Array package by hand! The chips on my F2A 128M are Intel
<br/>
F320B3TC "Boot Block" in BGA packages. Ouch!
<br/>
<br/>
Instead, I'm going to use the 3.3 V StrataFlash non-BGA series from Intel
<br/>
on my own board.

PS, "StrataFlash" is more fun to say than "Boot Block" anyday.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I am using this cart project as an excuse to finally
<br/>
learn VHDL. I bought a Xilinx eval board from Digilent to learn
<br/>
about CPLDs.
<br/>
<br/>
This is great fun!
<br/>
<br/>
The only problem is that I think I'll have
<br/>
to buy used game carts and throw away the PCB in order
<br/>
to get plastic shells for my board!
