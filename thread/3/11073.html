    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I tried to find all about EZFA and F2A cables in the forum but I couldn't find a complete answer of my questions.
<br/>
I'm currently working on a USB driver for ARM micro controller, also an USB mass storage driver. And I was wondering if I use my GBA micro instead of ARM borad can I use EZFA or F2A to convert it to USB host?
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a problem to make this connection?

GBA-&gt;(EZFA|F2A)-&gt;USB flash drive
<br/>
Probably there will be a problem with the power but I can add an external battery pack.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I want my GBA to be a HOST.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Btw it sounds pretty possible to make GBA mass storage device, and will be much more easy to implement it. Also those cables will be able to do the trick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if you make your own cable with usb on one side and usb on the other it might work. it would be super duper slow, and you'd have to rewrite or port a usb protocol to the gba. you can't just compile some open source usb stuff and have it work on the gba. the f2a cables and such have a little extra hardware in them, so you need to figure out how they work. plus usb runs on 5 volts, gba 3, so you may need a voltage level conversion chip.
<br/>
<br/>
I saw some dudes hooked up hardware to make the gba work with an ide hard drive. all the external hardware was as big as a shoebox.
<br/>
<br/>
recap: custom cable, code usb protocol, and mass storage driver for the gba... good luck buddy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What you saw was <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbacd.tk/" target="_blank">GBACD</a>. When all that hardware between ATA and GBA was miniaturized for manufacturing, the result was SuperCard.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
