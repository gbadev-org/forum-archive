Suppose I've developed the next Metroid and I think my game will sell like hotcakes.  Further suppose, for the sake of argument, that I want to publish it myself rather than go through one of the existing publishers.
<br/>
<br/>
The big hurdle is: how can I make the cartridges?  What companies make these?  Any pointers?
<br/>
<br/>
In the desktop market, CD duplication services are easy to find.  But where are the GBA cart production services?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There aren't any factory able to produce it in China, TW or HK?
<br/>
Would that be illegal (produce Nintendo non-autorized carts)?

What about other hardware like MBV2 and other? 
<br/>
Would that be illegal also?

What is the arguments to Nintendo process SongBoy and others companies?

And beyond that, why would nintendo allow Songboy to produce carts to GBA?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So long as you own the copyright on the ROM data, there's no law keeping you from producing a cartridge without the help of Nintendo.  Even including the logo data is lawful, at least for Game Paks sold in the United States, under the <span style="font-style: italic">Sega v. Accolade</span> precedent.

Given that Nintendo turned a blind eye to the MBV2 cable when making Lik Sang take Visoly flash products out of its catalog, I'd guess not.

Nintendo made the maker of SongBoy change the name to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.songpro.com/" target="_blank">SongPro</a> because of possible trademark confusion. I don't know whether or not the current SongPro hardware is licensed by Nintendo, but at first, Nintendo refused to license the SongPro hardware or any other custom hardware that connected to the Game Pak connector.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

No, the Sega vs Accolade precedent did not involve the SEGA logotype beeing stored in the game itself.

Also, Nintendo has got hundreds of strange patents in the US, at least a few of them probably cover GBA carts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When a game cartridge is inserted, the microprocessor contained in the Genesis III searches the game program for four bytes of data consisting of the letters "S-E-G-A" (the "TMSS initialization code"). If the Genesis III finds the TMSS initialization code in the right location, the game is rendered compatible and will operate on the console. In such case, the TMSS initialization code then prompts a visual display for approximately three seconds which reads "PRODUCED BY OR UNDER LICENSE FROM SEGA ENTERPRISES LTD" (the "Sega Message"). All of Sega's game cartridges, including those disassembled by Accolade, contain the TMSS initialization code.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Yes, the Sega name was stored in the Genesis carts.  I'm guessing that whether the particular representation of the console maker's name fits in 4 bytes (on the Genesis) or 156 (on the GBA) wouldn't matter according to Judge Reinhardt's analysis.

Patents are useless in the face of prior art.  The GBA cart edge interface uses multiplexed address and data signals, but so do ATA, CompactFlash, and Intellivision.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Honestly i just showed up a few days ago here at the forum,  So please forgive me if I make a few "dumb" comments.  Is it just the 156 bytes,  no custom memory manager chips etc?  I built my own nes deevelopment system back in the grey box days and after seeing what nintendo was doing to some folks (tengen) &amp; the strong arm tactics concerning display space I gave up before finishing any thing.  Now its 03 (instead of 89) and at least i can go do my own thing without having to pay 10k or wire up battery backed carts on my own.  Anyone have any more info on legal ramifications of developing (and trying to sell) non nintendo gba carts?

Even after Lik Sang removed the flash carts under pressure from Nintendo, several accessories that connected to the GBA's Game Pak port remained in Lik Sang's catalog, such as a camera, a TV tuner, a digital audio recorder, etc.  I find this encouraging.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Thanks tepples I've wondered all this time where that went.  I'm sorrta hoping the xtrafun thing gets going eventually,  but I sure don't want to have anyone being a single point of failure gateway for things that i develop.

Whoops I missed that one.  Last time I was looking into this getting a flash cart was no big are they still availible?  makes me wonder where xtrtafun is with (or not with) nintendo legal wise...

Wouldn't be much fun to develop games and only look at them on PC and those gba carts have all that surface mount stuff (my pokemon ruby cart broke after 5 minutes with the kids and i don't know what to do with it ... I don't have a surface mount soldering station at home)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you just want to test (not distribute) GBA programs, then after factoring in parts and labor, it may be cheapest just to buy one of the mass-produced flash carts available at gbax.com.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
