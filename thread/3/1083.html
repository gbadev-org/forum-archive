<br/>
If I were to write a software driver for the cable would I be able to do it, or would I need additional hardware?
<br/>
<br/>
Remember I do not know much about the hardware perspective of the gba, so please forgive me if this is a pretty dumb question or anything.<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind".

You'll need a USB device controller and a GBA multiboot host controller. You can find them together in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cdworld.co.uk/mmcd/gbcd/f2ausbreview.html" target="_blank">this cable</a>, but you'll have to reverse the protocol it uses.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
