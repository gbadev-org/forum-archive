    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just got a gameboy camera once again and found alot of resources of building a GB/C link port to PC parrallel port cable to send pictures to the PC. Since all of this stuff was written before the GBA came out, I was wondering if a GBA link cable will work in making a transfer cable. Any insight and help is greatly appreciated, and sorry if this topic has been posted before. Thanks in advance :).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
