    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to use battery-backed SRAM instead of Flash memory in a homebrew "flash" cart? The SRAM should be used to store the game binary files (ROM Images), not for saving games. 
<br/>
<br/>
I know the SRAM is more expensive than Flash, but I hope using SRAM I can program the cart for 1-2 seconds instead of minutes. For me, as a developer, fast access times are much more important than memory size.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If your board design allows for mapping SRAM to 0x08000000, yes.

At the GBA's speed, you may be able to get away with a design that uses cheap DRAM instead.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Not just a simple SRAM based cart, but a 3:rd party devkit. With support for a real debugger. Breakpoints, singlestepping, and so on...
<br/>
Download times of 1-2sec is quite possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, DRAM could be used, however, DRAM requires a DRAM controller. Complicates things a bit.
<br/>
DRAM also requires alot more power. Not good for battery backup applications. Of course, for development purposes battery backup makes very little sense anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
SRAM is cheap enough to build a 32Mbit SRAM cart for a reasonable price. (depending somewhat on the the definition of "reasonable")</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
