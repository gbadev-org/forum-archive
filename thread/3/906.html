    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm investigating using the GBA as an embedded processer- it's looking like it'll be good for it becuase of low cost and ease of programming with a color screen.
<br/>
<br/>
My sole interface requirement I intend to use the link port for, and the software for the processor unit will simply be on a flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
The one thing i would ideally be able to do is to supress the "Gameboy Advance" startup logo/animation on boot. Has anyone got any info on how to do this? I presume it would mean replacing the bios chip with a reprogrammed alternative. 
<br/>
<br/>
My only other idea for a solution is to supress powering up the TFT for ~3 seconds after startup, but this is not ideal really.
<br/>
<br/>
Any input would be greatly appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The BIOS ROM is integrated into the CPU, and there is no known workaround.
<br/>
Please understand that the boot logotype is Nintendos mean of copyprotection/'monopoly protection'. They have made sure there is not way around it.
<br/>
<br/>
Cuting power to the LCD is probably the only way to prevent if from being displayed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
