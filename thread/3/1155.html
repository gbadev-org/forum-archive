    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If anyone can help me.....my 256 Flash card is seemingly dead. Is there any software which might diagnose the problem
<br/>
<br/>
I have considered removing one of the chips, and leaving it a 128M card, but if I pick the one without an error to remove.....GAH
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone help??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If you try and Verify, Write or Erase, it fails.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I suspect it is a devastating corruption in the flash memory, and from looking at the circuit.....I think it may work without one of the chips...but I would hate to do that.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any software to give me a error report...or anything?
<br/>
<br/>
What can I tell you?
<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry to bother the forum.
<br/>
<br/>
But I can't really afford the ?100 fee to get me a new one.
<br/>
<br/>
Its quite painful, I have had it a year, but am in my final year at uni....so have not really had a great deal of use out of it.
<br/>
<br/>
I had such plans....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it might. But I wont prove myself right or wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
It had a logo error. Whatever that is.
<br/>
<br/>
I used f2aw30 instead of the faw32nt application, and it seemed to do the trick. It now works.
<br/>
<br/>
Now a little weary of the card.

Thanks for reading the topic.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
