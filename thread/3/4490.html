    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Donkey Konga for GameCube includes a "DK Bongos" controller with two large buttons, a smaller Start button, and a microphone. Some GameCube games don't detect the DK Bongos as a controller; however, the Game Boy Player (USA version) is more lenient when I plug a standard GCN controller into port 1 and the bongos into port 4.
<br/>
<br/>
The left button seems to press B+Y. The right button seems to press A+X. The microphone is R (presumably analog), and Start is Start.
<br/>
<br/>
So if I set up Game Boy Player with type A control, then the DK Bongos controller looks like this to the GBA program: <ul><li>A: Right button pressed </li><li>B: Left button pressed </li><li>Select: Left or right button or both buttons pressed </li><li>Start: Start button pressed </li><li>R: Sound on microphone </li></ul> Now you can make games for DK Bongos without having to have PSO or the brand-new mod chip. If you're making music games, then a port of the GSM decoder (such as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/gsm/" target="_blank">mine</a> or Tursi's) should prove helpful.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Bump with new info now that I have my own bongos controller to test on rather than borrowing somebody else's.
<br/>
<br/>
It turns out that each bongo has <span style="font-style: italic">two</span> sensors. You may have wondered what the dividing line in the middle of each bongo was there for; it's the line between the two sensors. The top ones press Y and X; the bottom ones press B and A. You'll need to use type B control (X and Y press L and R) to pick this up. I've whipped up <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#bongo" target="_blank">a test program</a> based on the new information.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
