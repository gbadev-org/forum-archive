    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to this forum, and I'd like to participate and develop hard- and software for the DS.
<br/>
As for me, I'm an electronics engineer and have experience in developing hard- and software (and CPLDs) ans have worked in the field of low level systems engineering and development with C/C++ and Assembler for several years.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for information on the slot1 layout and communication protocol as well as good hints for a build environment. My current plan is to connect a gps device to the DS and use it for geocaching or - later - as navigation device. For this, I need further information on the hardware and the slot-1-communication in special, as well as information to run (and debug) homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope, you can help me, or provide me with links for a starting point.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT; I have been informed, that asking questions regarding flashing or cracking is frowned upon. To make things clear: I have NO interest in hacking or copying games, ALL I want, is to develop homebrew hard- and software. That is, a UART expansion as first, and DS-assisted measurement equipment later.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Pukys on Sun Nov 02, 2008 1:13 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

Two things you should check out, that cover most of your questions:
<br/>
- gbatek
<br/>
- devkitPro
<br/>
<br/>
Look for them and then come back for more later. ;^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

I just took a closer look to the slots and figured out, the using the GBA-Slot seems to be more appropriate for my task. It seems, regarding to the various documents you pointed to, that the gba interface is fully accessible to the DS mode, even with increased bus frequencies. Is this right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That must've been some one other than me because I didn't really read the post well enough to comment on anything written in it, it was just the vague subject that caught my eye.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This site has some good info on the GBA bus, including some homebrew flashcarts. You're not building a flashcart per se, but the information is still useful. One link even has an eagle board layout for the flashcart, which might be a good starting point for building your own gadget
