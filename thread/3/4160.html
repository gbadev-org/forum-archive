    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I managed to get my code compiled as multiboot, and it will run on hardware over an XBOO in win98, but not in winXP.
<br/>
<br/>
I read that winXP wont allow software to talk directly to parallel port, so I got the UserPort program, but that has no effect.
<br/>
<br/>
NO$GBA has a driver install option, but it won't install for me, saying that memory is messed up.
<br/>
<br/>
Could anyone help me find these drivers anywhere? I dont want to have to reboot everytime I want to test.
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Work on userport, or try another similar program, that's where the problem is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Userport doesnt seem to allow a whole lot of fiddling. The only thing I can do with it is enter my parallel port address (378 - 37F) and hope for the best. I've copied the sys file to my windows\system directory, but no change.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I an unable to find any sofware similar to Userport. Do others exist?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm having the same problem. Quadruple checked the pinouts and connection using a voltmeter and I can't get anything. I tried setting my parallel port to "Normal" instead of ECP+EPP in the BIOS. I tried xboo, xboo commander, no$GBA, and UserPort. Nothing works. Xboo Commander keeps saying "No response from GBA". No$GBA says "nocashgba driver error". I'm getting terribly frustrated with this. Any ideas? Thanks.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried it using a DOS floppy to boot on 2 computers. No good. I verified that the cable's built properly and the pins are right and there are no shorts. I'm going to consider getting a flash unit instead, I suppose. Tried it on my old GBA, my daughter's, and my GBA SP. None of them worked.

Now I get a "transfer failed...bad response error".

EDIT: It was xboo that gave me the error on my 98 boot floppy. If I use XP and Xboo Commander, it works fine.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It means what it says, probably the cable is a little too long or the parallel port is underpowered.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll probabably have more luck with Xboo Communicator though.
