    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently bought an EZFA cable from jandaman.com so that I could load multiboot programs onto my gba sp(no serial ports in my computer) But whenever the cable is plugged into both the USB port and the GBA link port my power light turns (slightly) green like the gameboy is on. And if I turn it on absolutely nothing happens. Taking it out immediatly(sp?) fixes the problem, as does turning on the gameboy and <span style="font-weight: bold">then</span> inserting the cable. Right now I'm afraid to use it, I was hoping someone here could give me some advise.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
