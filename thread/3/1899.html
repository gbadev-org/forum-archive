    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I am looking into a little project where I would use a GBA to USB cable and then write some small tunneling software on the PC to be able to connect 2 remote GBA's.
<br/>
<br/>
The thing that I am not sure on, it looks like the GBA is written to use 0 latency over the GBA to GBA cable, where introducing USB, plus tunneling over the internet involves some bit of latency even at broadband.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this even possible, or has anyone even attempted something similar to this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If you on the other hand want this to work with allready existing games, forget it.<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
