<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes hear about those CF-wireless adapters. As far as I can see there are for palms etc, but I wonder whether it's possible to configure them to connect to a network and read of a network drive, but still behave like CF card on the other side.
<br/>
Then one could plopp that into the supercard (i.e.) and read a rom off a computer, which would make it possible to run programs quickly during development. Would this work at all?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not really. They'd use the IO mode, which is more like PCMCIA than ATA (as used by the disc type CF cards).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
