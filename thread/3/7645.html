<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the GBA dev scene, so I am not sure if this issue was already discussed or not, but I couldn't find it.
<br/>
<br/>
I have found many sources to connect a regular GBA or an SP to a PC serial port, but I am not sure how to do it on the micro.  the port has a different form factor and seems to have 7 instead of 6 pins.  Does anyone know the layout for the pins on the micro?  Also does anyone know what extra functionality the extra pin provides?  
<br/>
<br/>
Aside from multibooting the micro, I would like to use the ext port for some homebrew non-game apps for the micro.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Also, has anyone tried using the cable dongle and got it to work on the micro?  From my understanding, the micro is slightly different, hardware-wise.
<br/>
