    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There aren;t too many options for communication between your robot and the gba.
<br/>
<br/>
1.  Use COMMS mode as tepples has suggested.
<br/>
<br/>
2.  Make all your robot control IO, memory mapped and put decode logic on a flash cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
Ampz has a flash cart design about.  Do a search on the forums for this.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Atmel AVR Processors should do the job for you. They are cheap, have ADCs (analog-to-digital converter). All have UART, and they should all be able to run at 3.3V. Also, you can interface them with lots and lots of stuff....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
