    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">how does the pc side of things work? (sorry for my ignorance but i don't know much about the ltp port) i don't want to be able to send mb images myself since i guess that's way harder to do and xboo.com perfoms just fine. but it would be nice if i was able to do some kind of gba&lt;-&gt;pc connection in my own programs. 
<br/>
But how to do the pc end?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, you bit-bang the serial protocol.
<br/>
The port pins can be read and written just like a generic I/O port.
<br/>
<br/>
On my old 450MHz computer I managed to get 150-250kbit/s using my software and the xboo cable. But on my new 2.6GHz computer I only get 75kbit/s.
<br/>
Paralell port bitbang timing and performance vary between different computers.

<br/>
I use the xboo cable and my own software to test and program my various GBA flashcarts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
