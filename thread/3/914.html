    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm new to the GBA dev scene (and not fully aware of the many resources yet). I really want to get a flash cart to get a bigger rush programming my GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering what type of flash carts you guys are using? I can read all the reviews from the various sites that sell the carts but I want to know from people that have used and interacted with these buggers.
<br/>
<br/>
What system do you have (eg. GB, GBC, GBA, GBASP) 
<br/>
<br/>
What flash cart do you use?
<br/>
<br/>
What type of interface is it to your computer (eg. USB, Serial)?
<br/>
<br/>
Have you had troubles with it?
<br/>
<br/>
Would you recommend it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using a Visoly 256 Pro cart -- works fine for my puposes, but in reality, I could use a smaller cart for deving.
<br/>
<br/>
I originally used the USB linker with it, but now, I just use my MBV2 cable instead.  I can just leave the cart in the GBA, program it, and then turn it off/on and test my code.  In addition, I can use the mbv2lib to actually put debug code that prints to the console on the PC.  Really nice stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
I also have an XG Flash 256 cart as well, but you can't program it via the MBV2 cable or under anything besides Windows (I'm running Linux on my dev box, and MacOS X on the other boxes).  As soon as I get around to it, I'm going to see if I can get it up and running with the MBV2 cable.
<br/>
<br/>
Whatever you end up getting, I would recommend staying away from the USB linkers unless you have an alternate method of programming the cart for deving (MBV2 cable, parallel port linker, etc).  This way, you can program the cart from the command line or in your build script/makefile.  Otherwise, you'll be firing up the GUI everytime you want to test on hardware.<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Gamboy Advance SP.

Flash2Advance 128mb Pro connecting via the parallel port.

VisualboyAdvance for windows NT(2k) and VisualboyAdvance SDL for debugging

I build with gmake under the windows console, and/or under cygwin. Better to use cygwin for large projects. My build is 284 files[it's only a port of a web browser not a game or anything] I believe make really is an arcane tool. I hope to try out scons or ant or some such thing sometime.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

flash cart: USB XG Flash
<br/>
<br/>
At first i had trouble with my XG Flash because it was faulty, so i sent it back, got a new one and its fine now. I'd say it's quite good and very easy to use (I don't know what the alternatives are like though)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
