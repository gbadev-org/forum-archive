    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got the 64M Cart + USB Linker. When it's plugged in, the linker light comes on... but the light stays on for a short and limited time. After a few minutes, it will come back on, but shut off again, repeating itself over and over. Whenever I wish to load a game ROM or demo onto the cart, in the middle of the transfer, it shuts off. Speed is at minimum, Do not patch EEPROM automaticly is set, and everything is set as it should be. Unfotunately, the linker light just comes on and off at random, shutting my linker off, and turning it back on at random times. Every so often, I can at least get a very short demo ROM loaded in if it can transfer before the connection cuts out. What is happening now?
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had this problem originally, but I fixed it by using a 9 volt adapter for the writer.  The manual says not to use the wall plug while using usb, but this is the only way i could get my linker to work.  I've been using it for months and months without any problems, so I'm not sure why it says you should not use the plug in the manual.  It has worked perfectly ever since I got the plug, so I'm assuming that my usb port wasn't providing consistant power, and yours probably does the same.  Just get the 9 volt adapter.  Although, it's up to you to use the plug since it says not to in the manual.<br/>_________________<br/>While today is tomorrow's yesterday, today is also yesterday's tomorrow....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
