    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought a link cable and noticed it had little plastic covers just before the connecters (left side) so decided to open them up and see what was in them. when i did I found little metal things (right side). Any clue what these are there for? Also, do GBA and GBC link cable have the same number of pins?

Those are ferrite cores, which help to reduce electromagnetic interference.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GB and GBA link cable plugs are identical, except the GBA one has a bump on it so you can't insert it into an old GB/GBP/GBC.
<br/>
<br/>
They are also wired differently, I think.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They are there to comply with stupid EU laws to 'potect' people from electrical shocks by reducing the electic flow down the line. The stupid part is that even a small child would barely feel a thing if they got a shock of these things.<br/>_________________<br/>Rolling a six is unlikely but how do you know if you have never picked up the dice.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">cooky: Electric shocks??? no. It is much more likely they are there to comply with FCC EMI rules.
<br/>
They also improve reliablility in noisy environments and protect the GBA against damaging ESD spikes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
