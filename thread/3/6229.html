Without the lingo: No it is not possible.
<br/>
<br/>
With lingo: The GBAMP loads the ROM into EWRAM then jumps to it. Non-multiboot ROMs are compiled to be run from cartridge, with different addresses used for functions and data. It may be possible to hack the ROM by changing any reference to memory in the 0x08000000 range to be in 0x02000000.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hacking might be harder than just changing the addresses...what if the game uses ewram for other things? Ideally, you'd just get the source and recompile for multiboot mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
