Not many details on how it works yet ie do you have to use a flash cart and the smc writes to that OR (hopefully) you have direct access to the SMC which would be very usefull.
<br/>
<br/>
Not sure how good the compression code is (provided by IMAGICA) as they state 24 minutes of "animation" on a 32mbyte smc and anyone who's ever coded a video compressor knows most animation compresses very well due to it's flat shading.  If there is direct access to the SMC then a 256mbyte card using something like Mystik Movie (http://www.mystik-edge.com/gbamovie.html) which although is for software company license only atm could well be sold a lot cheaper for use on smc, could mean watching whole movies on your gba ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Been there, read that ;)  Theres still no more info on how the thing actually works ie does it boot from some kind of bootstrap rom or does it load a file from the smc.  If the former then it might be quite hard to use it for homebrew dev.  Nice pictures though :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
