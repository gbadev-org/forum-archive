    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
<br/>
romman from the Supercard site has posted a solution for fixing those bricked DS Lites that got turned off at around 1%.
<br/>
<br/>
It involves opening up the DS and switching the BIOS temporarily with a working DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I just got my DS open and wonder if the chip at the top left are (pluggable) is the right one? There's also a cable attached to it, so if that's the right chip, it would be nice to have an idea on how to safely remove it.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!
<br/>
<br/>
Details to the procedure:
<br/>
<br/>
You open up two DS, one which has a working firmware, and one bricked.
<br/>
Put the working firmware chip into the broken DS.
<br/>
Start it up.
<br/>
Start the Flashme installer.
<br/>
Change back the BIOS to the broken one without turning off.
<br/>
X B X B you know the rest.
<br/>
<br/>
The result supposedly consists of two happy DS Lites.<br/>_________________<br/>"It's a fool's prerogative to utter truths that no one else will speak."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hehe, well, as soon as my first one went dead, I ordered a second one, so that's ok.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I continued experimenting. Seems I was right, that seems to be the only relatively large removable chip. The wire is removed by simply pulling it off. I practiced with my dead unit.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, the question is: is it worth it to risk bricking my new one by doing the temporary switch?
<br/>
<br/>
Well...knowing myself, I just know I'll try it.<br/>_________________<br/>"It's a fool's prerogative to utter truths that no one else will speak."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
