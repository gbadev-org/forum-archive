I have GBA cartridge shells though but its hardly worth the effort to send just 4. You are probably better off just going to a game store and ask them for some non-functioning GBA games...

How much an order of 50 for 100?

Shipping would be within the United States.<br/>_________________<br/>-#2pencil</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I'm in the UK (England), and I'm after shells too... preferably in UK/Europe to keep postage down.
<br/>
<br/>
About 10 would be fine, but if the price is right, I'd go for more...
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I sent 10 each to the previous posters.....so I think I have 3 shells left. 
<br/>
<br/>
I didnt charge for shells or postage but if there is interest from people on the board I can order some (but then I would have to charge what they cost + postage).
