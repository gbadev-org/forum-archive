    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, something really weird happened to my touch screen on my DS Phat. Any touch I make on it is ignored and instead touches around this point: <a href="http://img373.imageshack.us/img373/2427/touch2ew8.png" target="_blank">http://img373.imageshack.us/img373/2427/touch2ew8.png</a>

I've tried running the calibration tool in the firmware to no avail. Any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My guess is that there's something already touching the screen, so when you touch it, it registers a touch at the midpoint of the two contact points.

Check the edges of your DS to make sure there's no debris between the casing and the touchscreen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
