    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a gba with a broken screen. I wanted to use it for something, and found this: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.bripro.com/low/hardware/vidcap/index.php?page=gba" target="_blank">http://www.bripro.com/low/hardware/vidcap/index.php?page=gba</a>. I'm thinking of making a video out based on info here and considering alternatives. VGA seems the best, since gba's video out is non-standard and most monitors are multisync (can accept any kind of video in).<br/>_________________<br/>If you would not be forgotten

<br/>
But most consumer multisync monitors can't accept a horizontal sync below 30 kHz, unlike the 15.7 kHz of JAMMA and DS display signals and the 13.6 kHz of GBA display signals. You'll probably need at least a line doubler in the video path.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
