    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am trying to load two 64Mb(8MByte) files into a 128Mb Flash advance pro. When I loaded the two files into the linker, it show it has 128.25Mbit. Where does this extra 0.25Mbit come from? I tried to use remove ff's and it seems doesn't help.  Any ideas for me to try?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try removing the FF's manualy with a hex editor.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, when I pare down dumps of my carts for use in PogoShell, I open them as raw signed 8-bit data in a wave editor, set to 32768 Hz.  Then I look for full seconds of silence at the end of the file and delete them.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Any other utility can you sugget that I try?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You have to get it under 8355840 bytes somehow.  This may not be possible if the developers have placed necessary data in the last 32 Kbytes to keep pirates from putting two ROMs on one 128 Mbit flash cart.  Of course, it could be possible to hack one of the ROMs to fit the menu inside (as was done with the official Nintendo World Cup + Play Action Football multicart for NES), but don't try this unless you are truly l33t.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
