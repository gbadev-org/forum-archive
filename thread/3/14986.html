<br/>
<br/>
At the most inconvenient moment, my XGFlash cart has packed up. A GBA/SP/DS will read it but the programmer attached to the PC cannot see it at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?. I am certain it's the cart because I have 2 programmer units and cables.

This is NOT a flash 2 unit but one I have had for about 3 or 4 years.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
