    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">nope . . .i remember seeing a picture with a gameboy advance and a cartridge with wires coming out of it.
<br/>
<br/>
how does one access the GBAs processor through the cartridge slot? is there some controll unit that can interface to its processor?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Take a closer look at the link cocole gave you. That's the only robot kit for the GBA I know of; it's also the only kit I could find mentioned on Slashdot. (Is <a class="postlink" href="http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/04/15/1519220&amp;tid=137&amp;tid=207&amp;tid=10" target="_blank">this</a> the article you were thinking of?)
<br/>
<br/>
If wires coming out of a cartridge is what you want, the Xport has that. Also, how did you want to interface a processor besides executing instructions on it? If thats all you need, the GBA can run code from a normal cartridge just fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
