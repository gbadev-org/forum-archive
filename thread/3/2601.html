    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been reading a lot of forum posts about how the GBA is too slow for emulating higher end game consoles (snes, etc.). Would it help to overclock the GBA so it can run these emulators? Also, would it persuade anyone to try making an snes emulator?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, (unrelated to the subject), wouldn't it be cool if there was a pcmcia adapter for the GBA? If they ever get linux up and running for GBA, it would be very nice accessory to have, great for wardriving or whatever...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Such as overclocking anything is much more complicated than "make this higher and everything is faster", you may only be able to overclock the main cpu (unlikely but for arguments sake) and then just introduce many other frequency mismatches into the system.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I based the overclocking on what others have already done. The stupid part was the snes emulator part. I recently read more forum posts and discovered that it would take a lot of work and there isnt any cpu power. Anyhow, I still want a pcmcia adapter :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">PCMCIA is too big and linux will never be ported to the GBA anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
However, we have the gba-wallet that has a compact-flash slot - and there are (for instance) wireless lan cf-cards. Now _that_ would be interesting to write a driver for.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I'm not sure if the person (Greg Ungerer) who was working on GBA for linux is doing it anymore. The most recent work I can find of his is a few years old. Has anyone looked at the GBA kernel that he made? For me, it freezes at calculating delay loop. I did find a more recent site about this, but im still waiting for an update.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
