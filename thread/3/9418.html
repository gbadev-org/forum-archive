    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can you buy any addon analog stick or anything for the DS? I remember a friend of mine had a clip-on one for GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
If you can't, how easy do you think it would be to mod an old N64 controller's stick?

My thumb really hurts after a big game on MKDS :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The clip-on accessories are more likely to be practical on a GBA or GB micro, which doesn't have the flip-cover. Clip-on accessories for GBA SP or Nintendo DS would have to be removed when storing the unit.

Have you played <span style="font-style: italic">Super Mario 64 DS</span>? If so, does it handle analog motion in a way that you're comfortable with?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">no, I havn't played it. My friend didn't complain about controls for it though
<br/>
<br/>
I don't really mind if i have to take off the clip on thing everytime i want to store it because everytime i put it in my pocket i take out my GBAMP everytime anyway
<br/>
<br/>
I have a spare DS control pad direction button thing, so putthing that upside down and placing a small analog stick on that - that might work...  not sure how i'd get it to stay on the DS though</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
