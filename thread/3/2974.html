    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, everyone. I am a GBA newbie.
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if it's possible to build a large size sram like 8MByte in a cartridge and the rest 24MByte space is used by a flash memory. If possible, could this 8Mbyte space be read/write in a speed as the internal and external RAM?
<br/>
<br/>
Is any known workaround?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, it is possible to build such a cartridge. Read and write speeds with 2/1 waitstates would be possible. That is slightly faster than external RAM, but much slower than internal RAM.
<br/>
There is however one small limitation: 8bit writes are not allowed.
<br/>
<br/>
It is not possible to do a quick hack and get this configuration. It must be developed from scratch.
<br/>
I can do it for you if you represent a company and need this special cart configuration for a product.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you for your answer, ampz.
<br/>
And I still have a question. If a cartridge is built with 8Mbyte SRAM and 24Mbyte flash memory, how are they mapped into the memory space?Could CPU access them by reading/writing from/to the address straitforward?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If they run at the same speed, you'll be able to access them in 0x08000000-0x09ffffff as you expect.
<br/>
<br/>
However, if they run at different speeds, you'll probably want to access them in 0x08000000-0x097fffff for ROM and 0x0d800000-0x0dffffff for SRAM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
