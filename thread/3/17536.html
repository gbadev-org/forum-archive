    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Folks,
<br/>
<br/>
I need the part # for the right shoulder switch for a Gameboy Advance SP so that I can order a replacement from digi-key and fix it.
<br/>
<br/>
I've checked the switch with a MM and that's the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
On the board it is labeled SW4 and I am pretty sure it is identical to the left one.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I once had problems with my GBA SP's shoulder buttons, and I was somehow able to fix them.
<br/>
<br/>
Normally, the button has a little rubber thing covering up a hole, then there's a flat plastic button switch inside there.  I noticed that I was able to get the button to work when I poked at the switch with a pin.  So I just stuck some "Stuff" in there (I used a crumpled up wad of aluminum foil), then put the little rubber thing back in there, then it miraculously worked.  This problem was caused by the button assembly not pushing hard enough on the actual switch.
<br/>
<br/>
But not all shoulder button problems are the same, your mileage may vary.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
