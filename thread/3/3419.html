    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think this might be one of the few acessories really worth buying, since it is supposedly the same price as an official link cable, but it also depends on the titles it will support. Nintendo won't approve it, I guess, since they are also launching a wireless adapter for GBA (the same one released in Japan with two Pokemon games).

It is different from their wireless messenger, by the way, which is also interesting but I don't like gadgets overall, myself. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">fron the looks of it, the wireless link will function almost exactly like a normal link cable.  nintendo made a very poor choice with the wireless adaptor and only supporting a select few games.<br/>_________________<br/>I was here, but now am gone. I left that smell to linger on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yep - they'd have done much better making it backwards compatible with the serial cable...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I have tested this adpter with many games and im pretty content...
<br/>
heres a few reasons...
<br/>
<br/>
1.)kid sister thinks my gba link cable is a race track finish line, and she runs between me and my brother and messes up a good link game
<br/>
<br/>
2.)I like the design of the product, very sleek and stylish, dont like the nintendos see through dome shaped whatever thats suppose to be..
<br/>
<br/>
3.)Works within a fair distance but wished i could extend that frequency a bit more</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
