    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a 40 gig Ipod. It's basically a nice portable HDD that could hold lots of files other than mp3s. So I'm wondering if anyone tried it....
<br/>
<br/>
1] Is it possible to play roms from an ipod linked to gba through usb or firewire? 
<br/>
<br/>
2] Would something like pogoshell be needed to execute the roms?
<br/>
<br/>
3] Could this also be a possibility for the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your attention :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, in theory it would be possible to make an ieee1394 storage device such as the one in the iPod music player, loading the games into a RAM cart. However, an ieee1394 interface and the RAM to hold the game would probably be expensive, and there wouldn't be much demand for it given that there's already the Supercard that people are talking about over at <a class="postlink" href="http://boards.pocketheaven.com/viewforum.php?f=31&amp;sid=4b97e9b9631c1ca0b59b1131e20d534f" target="_blank">Pocket Heaven's flash card section</a>. (The Supercard can take any type 1 CompactFlash media.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
