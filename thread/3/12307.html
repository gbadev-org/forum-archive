I'm beginning to wonder if Nintendo actually ever produced these.   Nobody has ever actually had them in stock, as far as I'm aware, and now that the GBA is officially end of life, I guess I'm screwed if I want to play linkup games between my Micro and SP?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I assume (maybe incorrectly) that it's the same pins as the gba version, but just a different connector....which means that it wouldn't be too hard to make one if you had an extra power cord for the micro.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I got some on eBay a couple of days ago but unfortunately they're no use for the purpose I wanted which was building a gbm xboo cable.

When looking for a Nintendo related item, always try Nintendo themselves first. Sometimes they even give you free stuff for being a loyal customer.

I got the adapter..it's not serving me quite as well as I thought...I should have looked at it more closely....I thought it converted to let you plug your gba male connector into your micro.  But it's the opposite...it lets you plug a micro male connector (yeah, who has those?) into your regular gba.  Oh well...

Depending on what you want to use this cable for, and possibly how creative     you are, this link may be of assistance to you.

If you just want a GBA female to GBmicro cable, that's possible to build.
<br/>
Male to male micro cables can be found via Nintendo, or more cheaply on Ebay, and just replace one end with a GBA female connector, which can be found on various GBA extention cables etc.

If it's all too much trouble for you, there is a possibility that i could maybe build such a cable for you.......

The point of the cable...I have an SP with issues, so I bought a micro on the cheap, not realizing how different it was.  I hoped this cable would let me:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  Use my existing SP link cable to link up the gba's for multiplayer
<br/>
2.  Use my lpt-&gt;gba cable with my micro.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I guess the easiest way to go ahead is to get a GBM link cable and a GBM2GBA adapter cable and proceed as explain in that link, however I never liked easy things... :-)

Are there any suppliers of GBM type connectors available so that I can make my own cable?
