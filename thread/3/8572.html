    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm doing a little FPGA project and I need a small color LCD - ripping one out of a GBA is actually the cheapest option I've found.  It's sad, I know, but the little guy has to be sacrificed for the greater good.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any hardware interfacing specs on the LCDs used in the various GBAs?  Timing diagrams, signals specs and application notes / example circuits?
<br/>
<br/>
I found a schematic for the original Gameboy LCD by Jeff Frohwein.  Something similar for the GBA series is what I need.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.
<br/>
