<br/>
I think the link port in general mode is the best way: 4 inputs
<br/>
Just short-circuit SD/SI/SC/SO with the +5v and read on 0x0400134 the results on bits 0-3, right?
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried a "client-server" app on no$gba and it works this way.
<br/>
For some reason, on vbalink it doesn't communicate. Maybe vbalink only support "standard" protocol
<br/>
<br/>
If a day i buy the nds and i want to port it, what are the ways to interface? Only the serial on the passme? What serial protocol is used on the passme? Easy stuff that can be converted to 8-bit parallel with a PIC, right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
