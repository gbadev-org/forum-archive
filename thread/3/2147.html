    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got a GBA, was all happy. Then GBA-SP came out. My GBA seems old. So I want to touch it up a bit.  
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know a good replacement LCD for the GBA?
<br/>
The GBA has an easy latch on cable so it is possible to change LCDs. Problem is finding the compatible LCD.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a 64-MB USB flash card for storing stuff from the pc's hd to the memory.
<br/>
<br/>
I also have an 8-MB GBA flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Make a link cable into a USB port extend cable.
<br/>
2) Use the 8 MB flash cart to load data from the pc 64-MB USB flash card.
<br/>
<br/>
I would also like links having to due with doing stuff to old systems.
<br/>
Like my N64 is in the garbage having no use, but would I like to put the MIPS cpu to good use with not a lot of $$ spent.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wouldn't recommend it. For best results, get an A-A' cable with the USB logo such as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00001ZWXA/104-6354465-8287168?v=glance" target="_blank">this one</a>.

Try a Google search on $CONSOLE homebrew, such as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=n64%20homebrew" target="_blank">N64 homebrew</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
