    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i haven't had a lot of time to completely read through everything (i have a life... well... kind of..) so i dont know if someone has asked this before, but has anyone ever tried to overclock the GBA's hardware? i mean, wouldn't that make the DivX movies and the like have faster framerates? I would imagine anything higher than the 16.78Mhz cpu thats already in there would do nicely..<br/>_________________<br/>"Two wolves are fighting.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's possible to overclock the EWRAM in the GBA.  There's an undocumented register, listed in the "GBATEK" doc by Martin Korth, that can change EWRAM from 2 wait states to 1 wait state.  The EWRAM chip in the GBA is rated at 100ns and could probably run stable if OC'd to 1 wait state (120ns); Nintendo just set it to 2 wait states (180ns) for a safety margin.

I do remember seeing <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ronin64.com/gba/gbaoverclock.html" target="_blank">this description of overclocking the GBA itself</a>, but think of it this way:  The display controller runs in step with the CPU clock crystal.  I'm guessing that OCing the display controller would OC the LCD as well.  Wouldn't that damage your <a class="postlink" href="http://www.hardocp.com/" target="_blank">[H]ard</a>ware?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
