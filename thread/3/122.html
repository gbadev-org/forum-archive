    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I have purchased the MBV3 cable from GameGizmo.com. My bad experience with them is a totally different story altogether, so I won't go into it.
<br/>
The software they emailed to me to use the cable with cannot find the gba.  Does anyone have this cable and can you email me your software package? I have tried both windows 98/xp/2000 and suse linux 8.0 with the software.  It cannot find the gba on the parallel port.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Would the fact that the gba is a japanese one make a difference?  I have been told that it is japanese in origin because it already had a backlight feature with a dial to control it.
<br/>
<br/>
All help appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought a MBV3 cable from GameGizmo, and the software they sent me was not compatible with the cable.  The cable is actually the <a class="postlink" href="http://ajo.thinknerd.com/gba/" target="_blank">intelligent multiboot cable</a>.  You can use the software there, but since I wanted to be able to use it from a makefile, I modified the source provided to run in DOS.  I'm still only able to use it to multiboot games, not transfer SRAM or flash ROM.  If you would like the version I complied, let me know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">surely someone must have been able to get the included software to work.
<br/>
I mean why the hell would they include it otherwise?
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone had much success with the MBV3 unit?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought one but then later returned it and GameGizmo said it was defective and they were ordering new cables or something like that.
<br/>
<br/>
They gave me $30 store credit but since they went out of business I probably won't get a chance to use it.
