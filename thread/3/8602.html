Play-Yan uses a dedicated MPEG decoder chip on the cartridge board. GBA Movie Player v2 does not have this chip.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Fixed. No solid plans for a release in Europe or North America have been announced.
<br/>
<br/>
To calculate approximate U.S. price, take the price in yen and convert it to dollars (Google search for <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">nnnn</span> yen in usd</span>), round up to the nearest $10, and subtract $1.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
