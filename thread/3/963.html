    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am testing a game using the MBV2 cable.  The game runs fine on an emulator and on a Flash cart.  The problem that I am having is with the .mb file, the background is alternating blank lines.   The sprites are fine, just the background is messed up.  I am using mode 4 (it worked fine when I had a tile based map background).  Is there any way to fix this.  Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

{ROM compile, multiboot compile} and {emulator, hardware} are independent variables.
<br/>
You have tried ROM+emu: worked.
<br/>
You have tried ROM+HW: worked.
<br/>
You have tried MB+HW: did not work.
<br/>
<br/>
Did you try MB+emu?  That might give you insight as to what exactly is not working.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
