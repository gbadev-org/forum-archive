    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All (or most?) slot 2 devices use gba software, so if you want to do that, then you need one.
<br/>
<br/>
Some slot 2 devices have:
<br/>
Rumble function, for use with rumble pack enabled software.
<br/>
<br/>
And/Or
<br/>
<br/>
Expansion memory, like the RAM you get with opera browser, some hombrew apps can use it. (eg DSLinux)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some slot 2 devices have an integrated launcher (eg Supercard), which will allow you to run GBA software (and DS with passme or a firmware flash).
<br/>
<br/>
However other devices don't have this menu, and simply act as memory/rumble expansion (eg The official Nintendo gamepaks)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">[URL REMOVED BY MOD]</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Also I think a lot most of the devices on the page have additional DS memory, (I don't know about SC Lite Rumble?) however it's use is very limited.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Anyway most retailers will have what you want, just look in the slot 2 section, also I would consider slot 1 devices. If your not interested in gba features?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so i can play GBA roms such as third party games like homebrew and it gives me a boost of RAM. but what doers it mean by data remains after turn off? does that mean it won't delete all my information? and when i get this does it  come wit ha USB thing so i can put stuff of it or do i put stuff on my R4?
<br/>
I'm new and confused and have alot of questions but it will fit fine in my ds lites slot 2. so thats a plus.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Someone else will have to clarify this (as I don't own a 3-in-1) but I think this will enable you to use your R4 to boot gba homebrew (though you may need to use some software such as NDStation? which will create an NDS rom image [which you boot from slot1 devices menu] which 'flashes' the expansion memory, then reboots the rom from the GBA slot and runs the rom image)
<br/>
<br/>
It also gives you expansion memory and rumble pack, for DS homebrew that uses it, and also any official carts like the Opera browser, or a rumble enabled game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
