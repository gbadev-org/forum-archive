    <h4>#171756 - Willrandship - Tue Dec 22, 2009 3:22 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Before you shoot me down, Here's my thoughts.
<br/>
1. NDS isn't powerful enough for N64 emulator.
<br/>
2. #1 is mainly because of interpreting
<br/>
3. More ram is a must
<br/>
<br/>
Number 3 is an easy fix. The Nintendo official or 3 in 1, used with a slot 1 card.
<br/>
Numbers 1 and 2 can be solved like this. 
<br/>
1. Take an N64 rom.
<br/>
2. On pc, use a program to rip the items from the ROM. (sound, textures, pictures, Rom commands, etc.)
<br/>
3. Copy all the files onto the card, and run the interpreter. Then, the game runs as normal!
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, certain control scheme changes will be necessary. Here's what I'm thinking. "it should be configurable for different games, though, as all their needs will be different.)
<br/>
D-Pad acts as Joystick
<br/>
A=A B=B L=L R=R
<br/>
X=Z, Y=Half joystick movement, for walking or precision.
<br/>
Select acts as a changer. Then:
<br/>
ABXY = C buttons
<br/>
Dpad = dpad
<br/>
<br/>
Simple! obviously this would have to be different for certain games, so full customization should be an option.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long post! Give me a reality check, please!<br/>_________________<br/>May the OCZ NIA be with you.

Well, considering there are plugins that actually save textures and such as they run them, I don't think many people are saying that. Unless you meant automatic ripping. That may have to be done automatically.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the interpreter on the ds would be running the rom, but replacing all calls for materials with their respective files, like this:
<br/>
Code calls for Link model
<br/>
Regular emulator                                                     This Thing
<br/>
Finds area in rom, decrypts data. (Slow)                Finds material in folder, already usable (faster)
<br/>
<br/>
Do this for everything, and there is very little hardware emulation involved. Rather than try and interpret the rom real time, it just takes the premade interpretations. Also, since this would be running at a native resolution of 256x192, rather than 512x384 (TV, might be off) allowing for less video card power to be used.<br/>_________________<br/>May the OCZ NIA be with you.

To go along with this, even if all the converting were done prior to the game being executed, the hardware is still too different. The 3D hardware isn't the same. The audio hardware isn't the same.

The hardware being different is why you take them out beforehand. If the 3d models are saved in a format the ds recognizes, it doesn't have any problems with loading it. Also, why not have the rom commands converted beforehand, as well as the textures and such.<br/>_________________<br/>May the OCZ NIA be with you.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Seriously, how much of the N64 and NDS hardware do you know? We've never seen you around here until recently, which makes me guess you know very little, other that wanting the ability to run emulation on the NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
If this is such a simple matter of converting beforehand, then why hasn't it been done with other emulated systems on the NDS, like SNES? What about NES? If there is such a gain from working it in this way, then why hasn't that been the popular method vs the current popular method being used for virtually 99% of available emulators?
<br/>
<br/>
And another thing. You seem so set that this would be the best way. Then, prove it to us. Rather than arguing that it will work, make one so your argument is valid. We know that N64 emulation can't be done on the NDS (and it's been talked about way back before this thread was ever created), so if you think otherwise, then don't look to us to see this through.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

a static recompilation might be possible on some really simple program, but forget that for a whole game it's just impossible specially when you start to throw in self modifying code and such nifty beast</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh well. Thank You for replying calmly. cough cough) It was just an idea. What is the other guy's problem? He sounds kind of ticked. I even mentioned in the first post that this was a reality check....<br/>_________________<br/>May the OCZ NIA be with you.

If my first post wasn't a reality check, then I don't know what is. If you know nothing about emulation, then how can you possible believe your suggestion would work at all without research to back it up?
