    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hello,
<br/>
<br/>
i was just wondering if its possible a connect a simple mobile phone into the gba slot of the nintendo ds.
<br/>
we already have a screen on the ds and the touch screeen can  act as our keyboard.
<br/>
<br/>
i saw in a nokia 1100 that the screen and the keyboard themselves occupy most of the space.so i thought it would be possible to connect a phone to the gba slot via some hack and get a nintendo ds phone ..
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is this possible?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i meant that i observed that most of the space on a simple cell phone is occupied by the screen and the keypad..so i was wondering if we could remove everything and just leave te bare key coomponent ie the motherboard and somehow hack it into the gba slot and

write a program to use the ds as whole as the phone with touch pad as keyboard</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes. He wrote it in the first post.
<br/>
It would be doable, but i think not worth the effort.

Just an idea...wanted to know if it will work.I cant try it out because my side is medical field.

So someone experienced like lynx or natrium or DarkFader probably have to try it out</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the answer to your question qould be the usual "it ain't gonna happen."
<br/>
<br/>
oh yes it's possible, but you'd need to mod the ds a bit and the cellphone would have to be hacked beyond all that is repairable. I believe some phones have software for computers that allow you to dial the phone, send text messages, and download the address book, but think about that for a minute. you duct tape your entire phone to the ds (lite I would hope) which has now at least doubled the size of your cell phone. the cell phone would only need a cable to plug from it's link port to say the gba slot for communications.
<br/>
<br/>
or better yet rip all the guts out of the phone, ditch the screen and keypad, but do you ditch the battery? the ds has a battery, and you have the cell phone's battery strapped to it as well (see how silly this is?) or just using the ds's battery and minimal cell phone hardware, I'd estimate the whole contraption would go about a day without charging. how are you gonna talk to people? hack a speaker and microphone to the back of the ds? you don't want to flip open the ds and rely on it to act as a speaker phone. plus you'd have to RE all the communications in the phone to get the data shown on screen to show on the ds screen.
<br/>
<br/>
sorry, ain't gonna happen, it's simply not worth it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree.. But, for fun, I checked a cell phone I have laying around and the battery is 3.6v.  I don't know enough about cell phones to know if 3.3v would power it or not.  Which means you would be stuck with the extra battery no matter what.  As for length of use, my Motorola Q only lasts a day before needing charged as well.
<br/>
<br/>
And, I am also finding it hard to see a real use for it.  I think it's bad enough holding the Q up to my face, but to hold the DS up to your face to talk?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Buying iphone would be cheaper and faster. And anyone can do it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I though about doing this before and would be able to draw a concept of the product but I do not know about hardware building besides soildering and that boards is merily a easy way to wire parts.
<br/>
<br/>
The phone would look like a standard Cell phone that would be encased like the ones they had during the mid 90's.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sadly Nintendo has already done the Gameboy phone in Japan many times before. They had a personal network where you could connect pokemon Crystal and find people and battle them and it was a working service. You could even talk to people freely.
<br/>
<br/>
The phone that you would attach looks like a common cute celluar phone they had during the late 90's. 
<br/>
<br/>
In fact that phone model is the one I wanted originally and still want.
<br/>
<br/>
There was also a phone service on the PSX that is simular the Gameboy service nintendo had.
<br/>
<br/>
Also now you can practically dail threw a NDS and PSP. 
<br/>
<br/>
However in terms of a free service telenet has been around for years with the video phone service that is free ( and some places it cost money ).
<br/>
<br/>
Again in terms of comminications there is many programs out there that will allow you to talk freely threw the internet. These programs are fairly smaller then a MB sometimes and allows you to view clear video with people over the net.
<br/>
<br/>
It is that simple to make a program for the Gameboy via attena or the NDS, PSP, SNES, Saturn, PSX, or any game system that is able to link to a data point.
<br/>
<br/>
We would need users and supporters of the system like family, freinds, our  workplaces and so on.  The system would have to be simple enough for a monkey to access as with most products.
<br/>
<br/>
However the bigger problem would be that what would be the use for a phone service that you would optionally turn on or off. People use the phone like water and need it on 24/7 and not whenever. 
<br/>
<br/>
Alos services would have agree to use the service for communications.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've pondered before about the idea of somehow hooking my cell phone to my DS. The phone would basically just act as a cellular transmitter/receiver while the DS tells it what to do and pipes audio to and from it. You could just keep the phone in your pocket, connected by a long wire (or bluetooth?) to the DS, use a Nintendo headset to talk, etc. It'd be nice, certainly better than the crappy phone I have on its own, that doesn't even tell you you have a new message until you go to make a call a week later. &gt;_&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
It might indeed be more interesting to build a small board from scratch, or just hack up a cheap phone, to fit in the GBA slot instead of having to be wired to a standalone phone. Even if it does cost $300 for the cartridge (and really, my entire phone cost $80 :-p), that's about what your average phone costs without a contract isn't it?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
