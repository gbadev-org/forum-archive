<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that some cartridges claim to have a Realtime Clock for use with certain games. So, what will happen if I have a game that uses a realtime clock on a Flash cartridge that does NOT have a realtime clock in it??? Will the game still work fine or be fully playable?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To the extent that this is game piracy, I don't care.  In general, it would be best to avoid any posts that pertain to piracy.  To answer your question, it probably depends on the game.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried it and it's true. The game will inform you that the Battery is flat, but everything else works normal. So I guess a RTC is not all that important to where as the game will not be playable at all, cos it actually still works!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
