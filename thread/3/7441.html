    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering if anyone could sling me a diagram or tutorial on where to find the video signals of a GBA Micro.  I'm hoping to be able to do something like the GBA TV or Transverter does, except without paying all that money.  I can use any kind of video signal, if someone could just show me where and what it is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was hoping to send the GBA Micro video signal to a large monitor.  I know it's perhaps more easily (or at least more documentedly) doable with (<span style="font-weight: bold">URL removed by MOD - possible affiliate commision scam</span>) these Chinese things [success-hk.com], but I was hoping to be able to do something that was a little less bulky, (I'm talking about a Micro here, and these were built for the original/SP) a little bit cheaper, and hopefully a little more DIY.
<br/>
<br/>
I figured that the gameboy LCD screens work off an RGB signal which is then converted by those chinese boxes into S-Video/Composit signal.  I'm hoping to grab the original signal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
