I don't think it has wired Ethernet, that was labeled "GBA Access Point."  Does this mean that a normal AP doesn't work?  Is it not your standard 802.11a/b?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The wired Ethernet connection is on the access point. So what you
<br/>
have is an entirely portable, low power, wirelesss GBA that talks to the AP.
<br/>
The AP then relays the packets to the wired Ethernet. (and visa versa).
<br/>
<br/>
You know, I never really moved on to developing stuff for the DS. I did this so that the GBA folks could have wireless too.
<br/>
<br/>
The over the air data rate is 250 kbps, but that is reduced by protocol overhead, retries, processing etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the encouragement!

That's right, this is a custom AP so we can use a low power RF data link. 802.11 is sooo power hungry!
<br/>
<br/>
I've already got too many degrees; I did this to stay out of trouble on the weekends!
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you could not make something like this without the help of all the great folks on this forum.

What's the plans to getting this hardware out to the world and what would you approximate the cost?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can do the EE and software, but I really don't have any experience or skills in commercializing something like this.
<br/>
<br/>
How do we find someone to manage such a roll-out?
