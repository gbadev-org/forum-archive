<br/>
Flash Advance is a seperate piece of hw that hooks up to your parallel port (same thing as a GBX for DMG/PGB/CGB)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What?! I think you better check the objectivity of your "sources" or their testing methods. With the "right" computer configuration I can most certainly make flashing with the Visoly kit take 10 hours!
<br/>
<br/>
When I flash my 128M cart using the F2A linker it takes me approx 160 seconds (including the CRC check)... That's a hell of lot less than an hour (double that for the 256M cart and you're still flashing pretty fast)! It all comes down to what your confiuration is (hardware as well as software).
<br/>
<br/>
My experinces with the F2A are only positive ones (no problems flashing or making backups, no problems saving, great speed, easy to use, right size of cart)... Perhaps there are some flaws with it, but I haven't seen them yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
