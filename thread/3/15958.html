yes, but there are some patch for the DS browser roms to allow it to use m3 perfect ram, but that fall in the piracy side and should not be discussed there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you want the card to pay off, put some homebrew and media you (legaly) own on the card and enjoy!
<br/>
That's what it's good for.

I would never pirate anything. so instead, do you guys know of any good homebrew browsers that support sound and videos?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry about the bad English, I'm using the DS Browser and when I do, I tend to miss punctuation. The idea was the whole thing, I put in the form of a question, because I wasn't sure if it would work or not, my slot-1 flash card is broken, and I'm considering a slot-2. Also, I was planning on getting the latest flash and the portable version of java.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A non-adobe flash player has been ported, without sound, and only supported older versions of flash movies. <a class="postlink" href="http://natrium42.com/blog/?p=36" target="_blank">linky</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, there is a J2ME port...based off of the Sun's KVM Java Virtual Machine, with a custom MIDP implementation on the DS. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.volny.cz/molej/pstrosnds/" target="_blank">linky</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, neither of these work with any kind of browser or wifi, so not what the OP wants at all, but useful information for others.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
