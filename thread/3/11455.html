Unfortunately it appears you can't access the beefy part (the NAND) in "Game mode."  The EZ-Flash III's OS has a game that's a mine sweeper clone - the way they did it, you'd think they'd have opened the door for other people to have made applications for the OS mode ala Pogoshell.  Guess not... :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have the impression that the EZ3 may use the FAT file system, so if you can read and write sectors, you could add the EZ3 to Chishm's code.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think trying to read the FAT 16 file system would be too daunting of a task for me.  However, I found this tidbit at the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.sosuke.com/ezflash/wiki/index.php/EZFlash_III" target="_blank">following wiki</a>:

The EZTeam released a software developers kit (SDK) that alows those who should so desire to make use of the PSRAM section and other non-standard features of the EZ3 see the article GBA for links to the SDK and development guides.

This seems about right.  Anyone know where this mythical SDK is?  EZFlash.cn is eternally down and seems to never work.  I've also read forum posts throughout the Google waste lands that indicate that it was real and did exist.
