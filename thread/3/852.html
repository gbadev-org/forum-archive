    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering....since a 256Mbit cart is only 32 Megabytes big...i was wondering if it would be possible to create a new kind of cart.  For instance you can get a small flash memory card that has 128 megs of data on it...and interface it into the gba....my motivation is this... to create a mp3 program so that i can listen to mp3s on my gameboy sp...but since the flash cards are so small they wont fit so many songs... and information would be apprieciated...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is possible for the GBA to see more than 32 MB of ROM through bankswitching. Put a register on your cart that controls the highest-order address lines, and then switch that from your program to change banks. Most post-1988 NES games and almost all GB and GBC games did this.

<br/>
Because the GBA's DAC is only 8-bit, something mathematically simpler than MP3 such as some sort of ADPCM would probably work well.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you can buy it on nintendo.com<br/>_________________<br/>I have plenty of ideas for games and such, my real interest is making the gba wireless for much more personalized games and optamized communication.  I want to start an online gba community.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can buy hardware chips that decode MP3 for you. Then you could just decode it's output (which is a digial audio stream) and have the GBA process it, or just pass it's output to a DAC and only use the GBA for the interface and controll functions, leaving all the audio stuff to the cart. Go read around (especially <a href="http://www.pjrc.com" target="_blank">www.pjrc.com</a> who has a "build it yourself player" that uses such chips).<br/>_________________<br/>--Michael</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
