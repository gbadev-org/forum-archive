    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey Guys, I'm looking for a way to shift the image on a GBA SP a little to the left. Is there something I could do to get this done on the hardware? Maybe by manipulating the hsync-signal or something like that?
<br/>
<br/>
I have put a GBA SP inside a DMG's housing, forced it to GBC-mode to result in the 'ultimate gameboy' with AGS-101 hardware.

Now as I have mounted the screen, it's a little offset to the right, and I would love to have it centered. Unfortunately the actual screen can't be moved any further without losing the mountings for the screws to close the thing in the end...
<br/>
I'd be really happy if somebody had an answer to this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
