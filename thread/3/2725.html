Might be a nice little device for those interested in connecting their GBA to a network.
<br/>
And the comic is quite hillarious also ;)<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well there are some limitations, I can see using this as a dongle off the mutliboot cable but not much more. Careful inspection will reveal that it has a 230Kbps max serial port that connects to your device.  It supports normal networking protocols etc. It seems more oriented toward low speed communications.  Going from 100Mbps to 230bps is a good slow down ;)
<br/>
I think it's primary focus is a a microcontroller based system add in device, I believe SMSC and Realtek have better alternatives if one wants faster communications.
<br/>

<a class="postlink" href="http://www.smsc.com/main/catalog/ethernet.html" target="_blank">SMSC</a> makes the LAN91C111 which provides your basics. You then need magnetics etc. (not a big deal right? ;)).
<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking to do a hobby type thing the Lantronix device is fine, for anything that might need to to have a fast network interface (IE &gt; 23KBps) then the more arduous route of MYO (Making Your Own) is it.
