    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Guys, 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm curious about how you go about creating a game for the GBA.  Specifically: 
<br/>
<br/>
1. How detailed (if any) are your design documents prior to starting a project?
<br/>
<br/>
2. Do you (or your organization) have a formal procedure for game designs/proposals and design document templates?
<br/>
<br/>
FYI, I generally start with a summary of the game and objective(s), the document outlines desired/expected specifications regarding various parts of the project. As a rule of thumb, I tend to keep the document short (less than 5 pages).  I treat the document as a guideline, not a program to be followed to by the letter.  Naturally as the project progresses the document is modified and ammended to account for previous unkowns, developments and discoveries.
<br/>
<br/>
Most of the "grunt" specs are placed in my trusty spreadsheets.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Personally I normaly just decide what kind of game I want to do (somehow I always decide to make an RPG) and then start coding without any plan whatsoever.
<br/>
When the basic game engine is done, or half-done I start planning the plot and draw some graphics. Then I make an intro without any idea about what will happen next. Then I realize that my game engine isn't finished at all and I try to finish it. Then I realize that I should now recode the intro as it uses crappy old routines that is no longer needed with the more complete game engine.
<br/>
Then I tire and discard the project.
<br/>
<br/>
Do not use this method to organize work. 
<br/>
Maybe I should start writing design documents and stuff...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I start with making clear what type (platform, rpg, top-down view, those things).
<br/>
Then i build the engine (which takes quite some time) with a basic level,
<br/>
test it, get out bugs and stuff.
<br/>
Then i fill in the rest of the levels and get a boring game because i forgot
<br/>
to add some enemies or any other stuff which will get you motivated
<br/>
playing my game.
<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes i write the whole script with movies and stuff down on
<br/>
paper and after that i don't go any further.<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In a current Game Design that i'm working with a group of about 7-8 persons (feel free to join... <span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gosg.org" target="_blank">www.gosg.org</a></span> ) we :
<br/>
-dedicated about 3 months of ideas brainstorming. 
<br/>
-Then spent about 3-4 months creating a GameDesign document (while still bringing in ideas).
<br/>
<br/>
We're now on the first leg of actual developpement. Since it's an afterwork hobby kind of thing, it's a slow process.
<br/>
<br/>
You can have a look at our current GameDesign Document here : <span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gosg.org/static.php?op=gamedesign.txt&amp;npds=1" target="_blank">http://www.gosg.org/static.php?op=gamedesign.txt&amp;npds=1</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">&gt; 1. How detailed (if any) are your design documents prior to starting
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Must contain a screen mock up for every screen.  All data types need to be defined.  Controls need to be defined.  Function hierarchy and passing data from one module to another must be defined.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 2. Do you (or your organization) have a formal procedure for game
<br/>
&gt; designs/proposals and design document templates? 
<br/>
<br/>
Screen mockups, yes.  Everthing else, no.
