From the sound of it, you created a utility that no one else had a need for and are now unable to sell it.
<br/>
<br/>
Most game companies do not care about 3D engines for the GBA, especially those with a relatively low FPS rate for uncomplicated geometries. (I'm not saying that you shouldn't be proud of your engine or that it isn't a worthwhile accomplishment, only that it probably has very limited commercial appeal, especially when all you are providing is a graphics library anyway.)
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to get other companies to buy your engine, why don't you use it to create an incredible game and sell that instead? Companies are much more likely to buy a game that has already been written than a 3D library that they don't need.

Perhaps... I still think his (or anyone's) luck would be better trying to sell a finished product than a graphics library.
<br/>
<br/>
And if the sale is all that matters, then I say go license that movie character. Principles and a token get you a ride on the subway.
