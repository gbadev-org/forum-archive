I started working on my first GBA game, and first coded game ever! It's gonne ge a game with a few levels, and a highscore system. basically, all you go is dodge balls/balloons, and shoot them. you get points for collected bonus fruits, which will appear on the ceiling, and the height of your slingshot thing, when you pop a ball. Also the time you take to clear the level. If any of you guys have a good idea for another feature in a game like this, please tell me :) I wanne polish it up as much as possible. Here's a WIP screen:
