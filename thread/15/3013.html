    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I've been working on an RPG, and I've been trying to develop an exhaustive list of all of the engine-level "events" that can happen in a generic game. Anybody have suggestions? I'm trying to get a list that is broad enough to encompass 90% of your standard situations without being tied to a particular genre. 
<br/>
<br/>
Here's my list so far:
<br/>
<br/>
First Enter Specific Space
<br/>
Enter Specific Space
<br/>
Stand on Space - (kind of like Mike's "tick" approach: fires every cycle)
<br/>
First Use Item on Space 
<br/>
Use Item on Space
<br/>
 - (with an "item" being a generic concept that could include things like the PC's eyes or ears, or their ability to speak.) 
<br/>
<br/>
First Enter Terrain Type 
<br/>
Enter Terrain Type
<br/>
Stand on Terrain Type
<br/>
First Use Item on Terrain Type
<br/>
Use Item on Terrain Type
<br/>
<br/>
First Touch NPC
<br/>
Touch NPC
<br/>
First Use Item on NPC
<br/>
Use Item on NPC
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not trying to create an engine that actually accomplishes everything at first try, but I thought that getting a complete list would make me aware of  holes in my approach.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're in a more argumentative mood, then I'd also welcome examples of RPG events that the above list would NOT handle well. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Thx,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wouldn't stress over it.  Good code, like good prose, is all about revision.  Don't be over-attached to your code -- write a throw-away version or two.  You'll have a better product in the end.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:  I didn't realize who I was talking to!  This is old news for you. ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd give every critter a counter attack function and pass anything that targets that critter through the counter attack function.  That function can call the move or not.  More of a random comment than a response, really.  I'd start with objectives instead of features.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">No No</span>, what you are doing is perfect, it will leave you with no surprises when creating the engine.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to give you my list I compiled years ago, it may still exist in one of my archives of old stuff I should have thrown out so I'll have to do a search and come back next week.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway just play a game and look at the events that they respond to - - and that's half of your research done already :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Use item is very vague, rather use item in item state #x, that way walking into a guy will not kill him with your sword - - also directions aswell, for example many games hurt your player when you walk into the boss - - how thick is that ?!? unless he's made of acid of course.
<br/>
<br/>
But your events depend on what events count really ?!?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Perhaps a matrix/cube/hyper cube would be the best way to solve this?
<br/>
<br/>
Axis-A  (Source Condition?)
<br/>
Carry Item
<br/>
Use Item
<br/>
Have/use spell
<br/>
Have/use ability
<br/>
Have so-and-so in party
<br/>
Have X cash on hand
<br/>
<br/>
Axis-B  (Target?)
<br/>
Enter Space
<br/>
Leave space
<br/>
Enter area
<br/>
Leave area
<br/>
Talk to NPC
<br/>
Attack enemy
<br/>
Kill enemy
<br/>
<br/>
Axis-C  (Global settings?)
<br/>
First Time
<br/>
Nth Time
<br/>
Global flag set
<br/>
Global flag clear
<br/>
<br/>
The above is an example.  One would conceivably want an event to trigger if the party attempts to leave the desert, has a character with heal3 is in the party at least 10,000 money.  The event could be changed if one or more of the party members was dead at the time.
