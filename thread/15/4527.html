I was quite amazed at this quote found on nintendo.com though:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Nintendo.com wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Nintendo sold more than 800,000 Game Boy Advance and Game Boy? Advance SP units during the past week.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
I guess that is world-wide but still....

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have worked in the end user shops (both GAME &amp; an indie) most people only buy one game with there AGB and then just have a "quick blast" on it. Untill something they really want comes out or they finsh the game they got with the machine.
<br/>
<br/>
OK, xmas brings sales thru the roof on all machine (inc. AGB) because people want nice new gifts and games are good for that, a gift they can use for the year ahead.<br/>_________________<br/>Do you want me to cook that or not?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is a company who can provide gamecharts from 1992 uptil now, but a membership costs money. You can visit their site at <a href="http://www.m-create.com" target="_blank">http://www.m-create.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I guess selling 50k units could mean that the game is "doing well" - but only if your production costs are ?2 and the retail price is ?29.99.
<br/>
If each game is costing ?28 to produce, and you're selling it at ?29, the game isn't doing so well.....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
