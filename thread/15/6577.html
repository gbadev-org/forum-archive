    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What does everyone think about a game like this? Just looking for some feedback :)
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">This game has similarities with other puzzle games such as Tetris, Columns, 
<br/>
and Bust A Move. Colored blocks fall down from the top, and if you can manage to connect three
<br/>
blocks in any way, the blocks will be destroyed, thus giving you more points. There are some catches though!
<br/>
As the opponent player scores points, extra blocks may be added to your blocks in random places making
<br/>
it very difficult to match colors. Also, some blocks will be shifted with nearby blocks to make it even more challenging.
<br/>
As all of this happens, your character (the badger by default) stands in the bottom corner
<br/>
of your screen. As you start, he is quiet and doesn't move around very much. However, as you start to pile up 
<br/>
on your opponent, the music gets louder and louder as he begins to dance around faster and faster. The more 
<br/>
you pile on your opponent, the more fiercely your character dances and the louder the music gets.
<br/>
By the time your opponent is being bashed so badly that it begins to be impossible for him to win, your character is
<br/>
practically breakdancing as the screen flashes and fireworks explode! Over ten worlds with five levels each are being planned, from ghostly forests to the outer reaches of space... </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Your badger, space worlds, ghost worlds and all are peripheral art components.  As far as they go, just figure out your target audiance and find someone who make produce the art.
<br/>
<br/>
The mechanics are a little vague.  Falling blocks, fine, but you are not very specific.  Do they fall one at a time?  Three or four in a column?  Random tetris shapes?  Can they only be moved left and right?  Do you rotate your falling block units like tetris, shift them like columns, or uhhh... shoot them like puzzle bobble?
<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you have a 2P game.  1P VS 2P or 1P VS CPU.
<br/>
Blocks fall, match colors.
<br/>
If one player scores the other player gets random blocks.  (How?  Do they fall from the sky?  Do they pop up in random places?)
<br/>
Blocks are swapped with nearby blocks.  (When?  When the opponent scores?  At preset time intervals?  At random time intervals?)
<br/>
<br/>
It sound kind of random.  It seems to me that the added randomness will result in things being harder for the player to plan in advance.  What's your goal with the added randomness?  Is there a goal, or do you just want to try something different.
<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like a fairly standard puzzle game with extra randomness.  Good luck making it.  I'd certainly be willing to play it if it comes to be.
