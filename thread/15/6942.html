    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, before I expose my thoughts let me say I?m not a programer so flame on if you will. Now my thoughts and wishes.
<br/>
Would it be hard to make remakes of some pc titles like:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">- X-Wing</span> (since there is an Elite version for GBA, why not? The 3d meshes have no texture after all)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">- Tie Fighter</span> (same here)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">- Anacreon</span> (A strategy sci-fi text game. I don?t know if the controls would  work though. Then again, there can always be a virtual keyboard. See FROTZ for GBA)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">- Civilization</span> (1 or 2. I believe these are highly possible. Or not.)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">- SimCity</span> (The original pc one, maybe with a few features from the SNES version, like seasons, and good  music. Because the Sim CIty 2000 port for GBA is not really Sim City.)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">- Captain Blood</span> (a sci-fi simulation/strategy game. Very old, poor graphics. Amazing game though.)
<br/>
- Put your game here. (I?m sure there are a lot of old and graphically simple  games you would like to play on the go.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I?m waiting your thoughts now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Too bad. But maybe <span style="font-weight: bold">Sim City</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold">Civilization</span> clone? I bet a clone would be way better than the SC2k for GBA. There is a great open-sorce one called FreeCiv (if I am not mistaken).
<br/>
What about the others then?
<br/>
Don?t you think X-Wing would be possible?
<br/>
There are great ascii games too.
<br/>
Anacreon is open-source, I wonder if it is too much work to convert it to GBA. There are the screen size and the controls issue to solve.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Someone could write a rules spec for a clone.  There <span style="font-weight: bold">are</span> people on this forum that do that kind of thing.  =)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">X-Wing would be mostly doable - though there are a lot of polys flying around on the screen.  The hud does obscure some of the screen which would speed rendering.  AI/Game play would be hardest to pull off here.  Ditto Tie Fighter
<br/>
Civ/SimCity would not be too hard to do if someone had the time and gumption to again create a good AI.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">man, I wish I was a good programmmer.
<br/>
Well, who knows. Maybe in a few years, if my flash cart still lives until then.
<br/>
If someone (a programmer) becomes interested, I would be very glad to provide the graphics. I am an editorial illustrator (mostly children literature and magazine and newspapers articles) but I have been doing my share of sprite art and 3d modelling over the years.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's true, but a lot is usually known about the models. For instance SimCity and its sequels (not sure about SimCity 4) use a variation of cellular automata for much of the model. Sometimes formulae are published in strategy guides and such. It wouldn't really be practical to reverse-engineer a game like SimCity to make an exact port, but it's easy enough to construct a similar system.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.freeciv.org/index.php/Freeciv" target="_blank">FreeCiv</a> could be used to figure out a model for Civ.  I'm pretty sure they have a model that closely emulates the original civilization model.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, trying even port freeciv to gba would be a large project by itself.....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think that those games such as Civilization or SimCity would look better on a Nintendo DS rather than on a GBA, because of its interface.

But what about remaking 8 bit era classics appart from NES ones (which are ported by Nintendo?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Ditto that. A stylus is much less cumbersome than a controller for this purpose. Although sometimes playing a SimCity you'd rather have a controller! Everybody who has played SimCity has placed something in the wrong place because of a slip of the mouse before. And that's the beauty of the DS, you can get conventional console-style control <span style="font-style: italic">and</span> the stylus, take your pick.
