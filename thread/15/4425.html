    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good question, but I think you may have covered most things right there. Only thing I can think of and it doesn't really count is Lost Vikings, where only one of the three characters you can play jumps. Again ladders and lifts and things help the other guys get around, the other guy often scouts ahead and pulls switches etc. so that the others can progress.

Neo Contra? ;)  But seriously though, I seem to have vague memories of that too.  Maybe "A Boy and His Blob"?  I can't seem to recall if you could jump in that or not.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-style: italic">RoboCop</span> for NES was too frustrating, and it didn't introduce any design elements that weren't already in other generic action-movie-license titles of the time.
<br/>
<br/>
Google tells me GBTG is <span style="font-style: italic">Grabbed by the Ghoulies</span> for Xbox. Based on reviews, it appears that <span style="font-style: italic">GBTG</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Neo Contra</span> have dual directional controls (one to move, one to fire) reminiscent of <span style="font-style: italic">Robotron</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Smash TV</span>, and the <span style="font-style: italic">Ape Escape</span> series. This control scheme applies to games in an overhead or isometric domain, not to side-scrolling platform games. If you count those, you have to count much of <span style="font-style: italic">The Legend of Zelda</span> series.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Elevator Action</span> counts only halfway, according to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wickedtoast.com/article.php?id=132" target="_blank">this review</a> that mentions the player character's "ability to duck and jump", but in practice the hero needs to jump in the NES version only when being shot at low.

<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">The Lost Vikings</span> may count, as I could make the guy who jumps of a different race. I'll have to see if I can get my hands on it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Neo Contra's control scheme isn't like that at all (although it's sorta similar-ish). I wish it was that nice. It's primarily overhead like those other games, but the control scheme is just like Contra: Shattered Soldier (Which is similar to Contra: Hard Corps on Genesis). You move and aim in eight directions with the left thumbstick (or DPad). Then, if you hold one of the sholder buttons (forget which one) you'll stand still and the left stick will just aim in any direction (instead of moving and aiming).  Or, if you hold one of the other sholder buttons, your aim will stay the same and you can just move in any direction.  They're fun games once you get used to it, but it's a pain in the ass at first.
<br/>
<br/>
Although, unlike the other Contra games, Neo Contra really doesn't let you jump at all.  They replaced it with this goofy "dodge" button.
<br/>
<br/>
Heheh, that mention of Grabbed by the Ghoulies reminds me of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.twistedpairgaming.com/download/PotatoByRare.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> that I saw at SomethingAwful a while ago.  Far removed from the glory days of Battletoads and Rad Racer, it really sounds like something Rare *would* make now ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

HoH contains a lot of jumping. Both the main characters jump in their own distinctive way.

<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Rod Land</span> is a jump free zone, you get about using ladders.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Two examples I can think of are:
<br/>
<br/>
A fun and addictive gameboy game called 'Tasmania Story'
<br/>

<br/>
And a not so hot (IMO) ZX-Spectrum game 'Frank N Stein' <a href="http://www.crashonline.org.uk/09/frankns.htm" target="_blank">http://www.crashonline.org.uk/09/frankns.htm</a>
<br/>
<br/>
These games both use springs/trampolines to allow upward movement.
<br/>
You should check out tasmania story if you can find it - its very simple, and great fun.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Not side-view platformers</span>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Abscissa wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Neo Contra's control scheme isn't like [that of <span style="font-style: italic">Smash TV</span>] at all (although it's sorta similar-ish) [...] You move and aim in eight directions with the left thumbstick (or DPad).

<br/>
Sort of like the NES port of <span style="font-style: italic">Smash TV</span>, where A fires in the direction you're pressing and B fires in the last direction you fired. But still overhead-ish, right?
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Q-bert</span> was a 4-way isometric game.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Dig Dug</span> (or <span style="font-style: italic">Pika Dug</span> in the form my cousin plays on PocketNES) is no platformer. As there's no gravity on the player character, t's more of an overhead game in feel, except for a few objects that fall, much like <span style="font-style: italic">Boulder Dash</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Crystal Mines</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Exodus</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic">Joshua</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Ecco the Dolphin</span> for Sega Dreamcast uses analog control similar to that of a flight sim, according to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.planetdreamcast.com/games/reviews/ecco/" target="_blank">this review</a>. Perhaps you meant another game in the series. Which?
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Flying is no excuse</span>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Thexder</span> won't run on my win2k machine (complains about some sort of "Packed file is corrupt" when I launch it from the DOS prompt). All I have to go on is a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/review/R23177.html" target="_blank">text-only review</a>, but it appears the player character is a mech that can turn into an airplane and fly, so it'd probably only count as much as <span style="font-style: italic">Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Side-view platformers</span>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Tasmania Story</span> appears to be a clone of <span style="font-style: italic">Mappy</span>. It's not as simple as it looks; it took me about ten Game Overs to 1. figure out that the objective not to kill the enemies but to grab all the items and then 2. actually complete it. Player and enemies bounce on trampolines that break for a short time if stepped on three times in quick succession. The way to slow down the enemies, by setting traps, reminded me of that awful NES game <span style="font-style: italic">Home Alone</span>, which also had no jumping.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Burger Time</span> is another ladder game. Why do these innovative classics invariably take at least 20 lives to learn how to stay alive for longer than 15 seconds?
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Rod-Land</span> was a more forgiving ladder game, as I actually had an attack, but I had to look up a FAQ to figure out how to use it (press button 1 to grab, and then press button 1 three more times to slam the enemy back and forth across the ground). In addition, I could make a ladder anywhere, giving some of the function of a grappling hook.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">The Lost Vikings</span> is a ladder game that looks interesting: three characters with different abilities, only one able to jump.
<br/>
<br/>
The GBA port of <span style="font-style: italic">Frank N. Stein</span> is interesting: a spring is like a one-way ladder where the hero can't stop halfway up. Goal: step on 8 tiles (7 body parts and a defibrillator) in order in a vaguely <span style="font-style: italic">Donkey Kong</span> style room.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm claiming that <span style="font-style: italic">Elevator Action</span> counts because the hero jumps only to dodge attacks, not to advance through the stages.
<br/>
<br/>
Another idea is to place the equivalent of a ladder on the side of every wall not taller than the hero, so that he can pull himself up using his arms. I can't think of any jumping-free game that uses this, but <span style="font-style: italic">Prince of Persia</span> and a lot of the Disney licensed games for Genesis and Super NES use this in combination with jumping.
<br/>
<br/>
Summary of alternatives to jumping so far: <ul><li>Ladders (<span style="font-style: italic">Lode Runner</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Rod-Land</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Burger Time</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">The Lost Vikings</span>) </li><li>Springs (<span style="font-style: italic">Mappy</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Tasmania Story</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Frank N.

Amen. I had some Thexder port for the PC and it was freakin' HARD. It ended up being one of those games I tried to play maybe once every few months out of boredom. But I never got very far... and eventually gave up.

The box graphics were cool, though. That was back in the days when a nice bit of cover art could still fool gamers into buying crappy games.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Was thinking, if you do want to get rid of jumping completely you could combine the Lost Vikings with the Prince of Persia style pulling yourself up. Perhaps only one of a number of characters would have the strength/light weight to pull themselves up onto ledges their own height. That's not too much of a stretch of the imagination really as I'm pretty sure I couldn't do it! Jumping in POP is quite unique as well, it's kinda split into one dimension at a time. You're generally trying to clear a long horizontal gap or pull yourself up somewhere, not like a more action based platformer where you have total control of your jump while in the air and will often try to reach something higher and to the left/right of your starting position.

<br/>
Modern video games adapted from arcade games.  20 x $.25 = $5.00 to learn how to stay alive for more than 15 seconds.  That may not be a good thing.  I had so little cash as a kid I couldn't afford to play at arcades.  If I had gotten to play and I died in 3 seconds, I would have felt really jipped!  (Evil arcade operator laughs in the distance.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not exactly what you were talking about, but anyone remember the game "gumshue" for nes?  It was a platformer, but you weren't really in control of your character.

<br/>
 He ran along, and you had to protect him by shooting the dangers that game at him.  You couldn't make him jump in the normal way, but if you shot at him, you'd pop him up into the air, which was necessary for getting over some of the dangers.
<br/>
<br/>
Wasn't a very good game, but an interesting concept.

<br/>
Edit:  oops, I left out the part where I told why it was interesting.  It was a light gun game.  You had to protect your guy, or shoot at him to get him to fly into the air.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by gauauu on Mon Dec 27, 2004 3:28 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
