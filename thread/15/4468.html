    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have a GBA quality assurance document/manual. I think its used by 'N' to test a developer's game before it is released. It includes things like "when the start button is pressed...".
<br/>
<br/>
This would be helpful for developing games of professional quality. If anyone has one for any other console that would do.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Chances are those documents wouldn't help you make more professional games.  They don't tell you how to make good games.  They only tell you how to meet Nintendo's requirements, which isn't particularly useful unless you are actually trying to publish a licensed game.
<br/>
<br/>
The difficulty of meeting Nintendo's requirements is trivial compared to the difficulty of making a good game.  Study game design or whatever field you're interested in if you want to make more professional games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
