    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all, sorry if I got the hopes up of any Elder Scrolls fans that a game was on the way - sadly I'm no programmer and am totally new to porting/cloning/homebrew - though I do want to be involved in DS game dev in some way (Concept art, quests etc.)
<br/>
<br/>
This post is mainly to see if there are Elder Scrolls fans here - Ideally with the skills and abilities to make one/port one/clone one.  Kind of shameless that I'm basically saying "Will someone make me Battlespire or daggerfall on the DS" But you have to understand - I'm needing it like a mad dog needs tissues to wipe the foam away from his mouth!
<br/>
(nice graphic description for you....though i'm not <span style="font-style: italic">literally</span> foaming at the mouth...yet.)
<br/>
<br/>
Please someone tell me that this is happening or even better <span style="font-style: italic">happened</span>.  If not though - fellow Elder Scrolls fans - post here and tell me I'm not alone. Please.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">These posts about "Could someone make/port/clone &lt;such and such game&gt;" really need to stop. Most people here work on the DS as a hobby. A few are actually professionals, but they have their own projects to worry about.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what everyone else's stance is on these kind of subjects, but when I see people popping up here for the first time, and make requests such as this, I honestly don't give a &lt;insert your own words here&gt;. They don't care about what is required to make it, only that "it gets done", and most of the people just make the request without anything else that could help in making the request come true. This is what I call selfishness. Harsh as that may sound, but that's my feeling on the subject.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes.  They need to stop.  It's getting immensely boring.  And how is a clone part of game design?  You aren't designing anything.

You'll notice that I wrote 'make one/port one/clone one' ...make one suggest's that I'd be a <span style="text-decoration: underline">unique</span> game.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I'm new here and Yes, you're sick of hearing these requests - but don't presume that I'm saying I'll have no part in this - quite the opposite actually. This thread was put here to meet like minded Elder Scrolls fans who <span style="font-style: italic">want</span> to do this - I'm not requesting or demanding it of anyone so lets not go on "the defensive" here.
<br/>
<br/>
I've created textures and meshes for Morrowind and Oblivion so I have some art skills that could be utilized in whatever way possible (sprites, backgrounds, whatever else I can do).
<br/>
If there are people out there who like this idea and are up for it - then let's hear what they have to say - if not - so be it but let's get one thing straight - This forum is here for ideas such as this so don't be so uppity about these questions that will keep coming.

<br/>
Thanks for the welcome btw.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The fact of the matter is that there is about 10 posts a day along of the lines of "Plz do this for me, I have no idea and don't want to learn, but I can use Paint!"

You really should of used the "Help Wanted" forum, and there's a sticky topic in there that explains why everybody gets so pissed off about it.

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction, 
<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't it be a good idea to have that sticky on the main forum page or just text at the top letting people understand the stance on "give me a game but i'll do nothing to help" posts.
<br/>
<br/>
It'd save a lot of time and bother if that could just be refered back to when the situation occurs (<span style="font-style: italic">alot</span> of bother if it occurs about 10 times a day)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
