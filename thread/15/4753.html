    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm currently design a rope playing game and plan to develop it for the gba (no commercialisation). Is it better to be simple e.g auto-character creation, less user interaction with stats, spells, weapons etc, or complex e.g user can tweak his character and other game aspects as he wants to?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="color: #40A0FF">iCYDEMON</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are two perspectives from which to answer your question:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Personal Game Preference
<br/>
I'm not big into number-driven RPGs, so I don't care much for a complex character creation stage. I just want to pick it up and play. 
<br/>
<br/>
2. Ease of Programming
<br/>
A game with a fixed-game character is probably less work (depending on your engine, of course.) If it's your first game, especially, it's a good idea to keep it simple.

First game that i'm going to complete (i hope :))), but as far as i can see GBA differs only in enviroment and not calculations and game programming (same sh*t different platform). The main prob is that the design document is 180pages (with dialogues) and game play is very simple (something like Golden Sun for GBA). is this good or bad, let me know...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="color: #40A0FF">iCYDEMON</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Go simple for your first game.  You can always make it more complicated later.  As an alternative, you can always make a more complicated game later.  =)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, if this is your first game, it's probably already too complicated.  Do you intend to program it?  If so, you should start with something simple like pac man or tetris.  If not, then you'd better ask your programmer what they want to do because if you can't pay them then they are running the show.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
