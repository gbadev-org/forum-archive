    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">a sequel to metroid prime hunters 
<br/>
after samus leaves the place were gorea is and were the dead hunters are an x parasite enters and infects a dead hunter, and an another x enters and does the same thing and so on until all six hunters are alive again.
<br/>
<br/>
awhile after samus goes back to her federation hq for her next bounty
<br/>
then samus is sent to sr388 to go examine strange life forms that have been detected by the b.s.l. so she goes there and then(the same story as the original metroid fusion) but but she finds out that the other hunters are on sr388 but only 3 of them so she has to kill them before they reproduce and gain back all her powers (not the mph power her real powers like suits beams and other stuff like that) so she gains half her powers back and kills three of the hunters when she finds out about an explosion that rocked the quarantine bay (yes the sa-x) and she must go to investigate so she docs at the b.s.l. and learns about the sa-x) but then she encounters one of the three last hunters and learns that the others are there too and so she kills them off one by one and ventures to each sector where gains back the rest off her powers and fights ridley and kraid and finaly fights the sa-x and evacuates.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
when she kills a hunter she gets a new second beam like in the original metroid prime hunters but also upgrades her first beam and missiles
<br/>
kraid is on sr388 and ridley at the b.s.l
<br/>
samus has all her powers until she gets infected 
<br/>
samus fusion suit is one of the multiplayer characters as well as the sa-x but dont have advanced powers 
<br/>
after killing 
<br/>
noxus she gets judacator and bombs
<br/>
spire she get varia suit and spider ball and the fire gun
<br/>
kanden she gets the volt driver gun and power bombs
<br/>
trace she get speed boots gravaty suit and imperialist
<br/>
silux she gets graple beam screw attack and electromag gun
<br/>
weavle super missiles and that blob power beam thingy
<br/>
sa-x her original power suit effused with everything she's acquired and ice beam 
<br/>
ridley has space jump
<br/>
and kraid speed booster
<br/>
and the rest she gets from fighting the rest of the bosse's and data rooms<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://top-car-images.com/1987-bmw-750il/" target="_blank">1987 bmw 750il</a> <a class="postlink" href="http://top-car-images.com/2003-bmw-m3-csl/" target="_blank">2003 bmw m3 csl</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The first rule of making games is "work on your own games".  Sometimes your own games are licensed drivel, but you can't work on licensed drivel until you have the license to do so.  Metroid is not your IP and you have to have a very close relationship with Nintendo to work with their IP.  Even if you are a second party, your product will have to strong enough to stand on its own merits before they Nintendo would even consider slapping a license on it... and that boils down to the first thing I said.  "Work on your own games".
<br/>
<br/>
So, try rewriting this stripped of all metroid references and see how cool it sounds.  If it doesn't sound cool without the metroid spin, keep working on it until it does.  Coming up with "game ideas" capable of pulling funding is very hard work.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But what's the goal?  To get funding, or to work on something that you will enjoy and learn from?  It's certainly worthwhile to try to create original games, but it can be fun to make a "fan game" as well.  Making a fan game will make you a better programmer, and it starts off with a partially written design doc.  Not necesarily a bad thing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<div class="post">
    <h4>#157208 - sgeos - Tue May 20, 2008 11:14 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can do a clone just as easily, and clones start off with "a partially written design doc".  Even a blatant clone could theoretically be released, and probably would be if was done well and found its way to the right people.  PopCap Games is an example of a company that has essentially made a business of clones.
<br/>
<br/>
But, indeed, what is the goal?  If you know that your game is not going anywhere, you have nothing to lose by working on a "fan game".  If "fan work" is more fun than original work and serves to motivate you, you may even have something to gain.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that from a business perspecitive if your "fan" project reaches a point where it is seen as threatening, they have no choice but to cease and desist your project out of existance.  Different companies will see different projects as threatening.
<br/>
<br/>
If you managed to get a job working for "the man" with the IP you are a fan of, you might actually have no choice *but* to work on games based on the IP you are so fond of- so long as it remains popular.
<br/>
<br/>
For what it is worth, every now and then a Hong Kong original is released containing unlicensed copyright material.  I'm not convinced they make enough money off of those to properly pay their staff, which probably explains the lack of any semblance of quality found in those games.  In case you were wondering, they do not and will not get sued due to the first rule of corporate law- "don't sue poor people and poor companies because they can't pay."

Clearly this is object oriented game design and the design doc works something like this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">best_unnamed_sequel_ever extends metroid_prime_hunters
<br/>
{
<br/>
    story()
<br/>
    {
<br/>
        super();
<br/>
        #include("original_post");
<br/>
    }
<br/>
}</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Of course, without the definition of the "Metroid Prime Hunters" design document, the above extension is not worth a whole lot.
