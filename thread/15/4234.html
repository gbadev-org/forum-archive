<br/>
<br/>
Was just wondering roughly what percentage of GBA games offer on-cart save options, as opposed to the old password systems. I imagine its quite high. Anyone got any info?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Adding EEPROM costs an addition roughly $1.00 per unit.  Sell 1M games, lose 1M in revenue.  Not a big deal on a million selling game, but everyone likes more money.  Now, the same module on a game that bombs and only sells 40K units.  That's a lot of money they just lost. 
<br/>
<br/>
You must convince that spending an additional dollar per cart will generate an addition 50+K units of sales to cover the costs.  We were able to do this, luckily.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was considering using passwords on my next game, purely to allow those players who aren't that devoted to solving the puzzles a way to "by-pass" the most difficult parts, and feel like they're making progress in the game.
<br/>
<br/>
I too don't like cheating (too much, I did spend a significant part of the 80s writing poke, poke, poke into my Speccy to get to the next level though) but I suspect that if a player feels like they're going forward, they're more likely to return to your game....

True. I think that I personally could do fine with around 128 byte. And then, if you really need to spare, you might as well just compress your SRAM data with the LZ77 function that was released a while ago.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#31182 - Miked0801 - Wed Dec 08, 2004 7:25 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, you shouldn't compress your save data.  Compression routines are not guarenteed to compress data.  As soon as you rely on compressed data in save ram, you'll get hosed when a data set appears that it expands (or doesn't meet your base compression needs.)  If you think your save data can be compressed, do some manual bit-packing.  That will always save you space.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wow, yeah, that sucked.   That game hurt me.

The best password system I ever saw was for the Lost Vikings.  Only 4 or 5 characters...it was simpler since it only had to save which level you were on.  And the passwords tended to be easy to remember words that had something to do with your level, so you could fairly easily remember them in your head if you wanted to.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
