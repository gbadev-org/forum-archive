<a class="postlink" href="http://www.dslua.com/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,19/topic,80.0" target="_blank">Angor's SnowBattle</a> does that on a DS. :)  It is actually quite fun.  The first player does get small advantage because of the pad.  But I guess right/left handed person may do better on one instead of the other...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've been debating trying to make a 4-player game on 1 gba...either based on the old warlords game, or a tron clone.  For those games, each player could get by with just 2 buttons
<br/>
<br/>
It'd be near impossible to actually play, but I was thinking 
<br/>
<br/>
p1:  control pad
<br/>
p2:  select/start
<br/>
p3:  a/b
<br/>
p4:  l/r
<br/>
<br/>
But the idea of having 4 people trying to have their hands on that tiny gba is just downright silly</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah, that's the whole problem.   I envisioned one person on each side of the gba (top, bottom, left, right), holding it horizontal.  The game would have to be viewable from any angle equally.....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Mario Party advance has a few gadgets that do this.
<br/>
<br/>
The 4 player ones are 1 button though
<br/>
A couple of games that do well with this setup are:
<br/>
<br/>
pinball where you control the flipper.
<br/>
<br/>
Reaction time games like some of the pokemon stadium party games 
<br/>
<br/>
You could always do popular board games like
<br/>
Hungry, Hungry Hippos or Mr. Mouth!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you make it on Nintendo DS, you could do it P1=arrow-keys and L, P2=A,B,X,Y, and R. Then START button could be used to pause game and open menu.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
