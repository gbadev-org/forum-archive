<br/>
<br/>
Long answer:  technically, if you knew how the models were stored, you could pull them out, change them, and update the rom.  But unless you have the source code, it would be ridiculously difficult to make sure everything got updated properly.  Unless you're REALLY REALLY good, don't bother trying.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Track down one of the programmers and offer him lots of money to break his NDA?  Keep in mind that if he gets caught he basically gets booted from the industry.  Offer accordingly.
<br/>
<br/>
Signing a contract with the developer to get the details is probably more realistic.  Then again, maybe not.  I could see them saying "why bother."
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to crack the format from the outside, you've got to be really really good.  If you need to ask how good "really really good" is, you are not qualified.  If you really must know- in short, "really really good" would probably put you at or above professional senior/lead programmer level.  (In theory you might just be a really really good programmer and lack the proper organizational skills to be a lead programmer.)
<br/>
<br/>
Martin Korth could probably pull this off if he could be bothered.  Barring a determined military, I wouldn't bet on anyone else right now.  Others are certainly around- I just don't know who they are.  Could they be bothered with this?  No.  Most certainly not.

Do you know what format the models are stored in?  If the answer is yes, you can probably find them with little trouble.  Otherwise you will be taking stabs in the dark.  (Some people do enjoy that kind thing.  I think.  Anyone? =)

Maya and 3ds Max are the industry standard.  Both are currently owned by Autodesk.  Many (most?) companies convert models to a proprietary format for storage/usage.

A universal model viewer doesn't exist.  You'll need to have the models in a format the viewer can understand.
<br/>

Maya (PLE) will let you modify models you have created with it.  Standard Maya and the PLE do not have compatible file formats.  Any other 3D modelling software will let you modify models generated with it.

<br/>
Yes.  The simplest solution requires proprietary software. (probably expensive)
<br/>
<br/>
The least expensive solution is to write your own 3D model viewer for the DS.  Assuming one already exists, you'll need to convert your models the format it uses.

1. In games, meshes are usually stored in some format proprietary to the rendering engine. For NDS, this will most likely be the format of the display lists that the GPU consume.
<br/>
<br/>
2. One that has quite a lot of popularity is Blender. You can find it at <a href="http://www.blender.org" target="_blank">http://www.blender.org</a>
<br/>
<br/>
3. For this, you'll need a hex-editor and patience. Lots of it. As there is no real reason for homebrew NDS software to convert this way, this looks dangerously much like a ROM hack. ROM hacks are not really the scope of this forum.
<br/>
<br/>
4. This may be easier than converting the model back to a standard 3d-format, once you have located the display-lists.
<br/>
<br/>
I must ask though, is there a reason why you want to lift the content off a ROM?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I assume that by "extensions" you mean the file format (as in .3ds, .lwo, .obj, .x and whatnot), but in most games it's not that easy, as you often want to reduce loading-time by not having to process the data on-target. Usually game-developers pre-process the data, and store them in some proprietary processed file-format. Very few of these formats are publicly documented.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
