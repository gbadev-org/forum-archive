    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There have been a number of topics giving links to important and useful game design information. And I never agree with searching, because you'll <span style="font-weight: bold">never</span> know the right keywords without information of the topics likely to come back.
<br/>
<br/>
So it makes perfect sense that we should have a sticky topic, like what we have in the beginners section, geared totally towards game design. So that it does not get crowded with posts, only the moderator can post information in it; any questions go to them.
<br/>
<br/>
This way we will not get many topics asking the same questions every couple of weeks, and it makes this forum a much more valuable source.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
