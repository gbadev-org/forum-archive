Here he talks a little about the mechanics of the AI and how it all worked. He also talks about how levels were designed.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been searching for something like this for a long time now. I find it always interesting to read about how other people designed games. Too bad there isn't one for <span style="font-style: italic">Mario 64</span> or <span style="font-style: italic">Zelda: Ocarina of time</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
The concept I found most intriguing is the fact that they created levels without an idea of where a player would start or finish. I think this can sometimes be seen in RPGs since the player must revisit areas, it should be as open ended as possible. I think it's a great design strategy to use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Really interesting.  I enjoyed the part about the SGI Onyx costing 250k yet being a fraction of the speed of the N64.  I never realized the N64 was so powerful.  Really makes you step back and realize how far we have come when now we have something more powerful than an N64 in a handheld.

However, I still can't wrap my mind around allocating 1/3 of the graphics processing time to 4 tasks (as well as 10 % of that for audio).  Is this some kind of mistake, or am I missing something?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

He had allocated more than 100% of processing time to various tasks hoping that coding optimizations and better hardware specs would later decrease his percentages.  That didn't happen as he expected, so when all of them were running at full capacity, the frame rate stuttered.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">abilyk, what you said makes sense, but it seems like if his accounting was that over-optimistic the game would have never hit 30 fps.  But then again, I suppose only at certain times all of that 1/3 would be needed, which, I guess, is what ended up happening since some of the levels do play pretty smoothly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
