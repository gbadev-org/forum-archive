    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am starting to program the gba, and i have a menu screen that i have put together. I am using mode 4, but i don't know the best way of selecting the menu items??
<br/>
<br/>
Should the menu items themselves be sprites, or should i use a sprite as a cursor to select the menu items??
<br/>
<br/>
What techniques have other people used?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd personally recommend you do them as sprites. That way, you get a lot of added flexability, since you have the freedom to move them around and, if you want, scale and rotate them.
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, you could forget about an 'arrow' all together, and simply highlight the selected menu option in yellow and scale it slightly bigger.
<br/>
<br/>
When an item is selected, you could send the other menu options flying.
<br/>
<br/>
There are a ton of other things you can do, too. It's just a nice little aspect of polish that's good to use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It doesn't matter.  Or, worded differently, your other requirements will dictate the way you "should" set up your menu system.  (Should you have any other requirements.)
