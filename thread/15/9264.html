    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am working on a game called Combat Advance which is destined to be a arcade style side-scrolling shoot'em up game.

I have just release v0.3 which is just a demo of the main character controls.  I would appreciate if you can try it out and let me know what you like or don't like.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice demo. Good art, clean animation, and intuitive control. I think it's a very nice start.
<br/>
<br/>
My only suggestion would be to make the main character 1/2 his current size... it seems like gameplay with a character that takes up so much screen real estate is limited.
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't dump your existing animation... it's nice. Maybe certain parts of levels could be full size and some half size? Just a thought.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback!  I thought about reducing the size, but I really like the large size main character!  I may still reduce the size, but for now, I want to experiment a little with gameplay as is.
<br/>
<br/>
I am currently adding in the first enemy, to trial the gameplay element.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I have the first enemy in with some <span style="text-decoration: underline">basic</span> AI.  Please check out version 0.31 of Combat Advanced here: EDIT - Check latest post for latest version. 
<br/>
<br/>
Again, I would appreciate your comments/feedback.
<br/>
Cheers!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by sumiguchi on Wed May 24, 2006 2:49 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what else to say... except that it's a project worth continuing. Keep us informed of future progress.

Looks like the sprite used in the mmf french fangame, that got the art from some sprite artist who I don't know. Nothing wrong with that though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a new version of the game ready - this sports a new enemy that is bigger than the hero.  I need to do some work on the details but wanted to get feedback on this version of the gameplay.
<br/>
<br/>
The goal in this is to kill as many of the large enemies as possible.  You can see your current progress in the pause menu and your results when you die.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't played too much, but the most I killed so far was 8.

<br/>
a little odd because there is so little space - but then again, everything is kind of claustrophobic, kinda scary, like an Aliens move, where you dont get much overview, where the aliens lurk, behind the next corner, awww...... !!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
