    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll tell you all the gist of my rpg, but I won't go into details. See, I've been developing this idea for the better part of 2 years, and I'm proud of where it's
<br/>
at. So proud that, for fear of theft, I can't tell you everything! I'm sure many people can say the same thing but.....I don't care. Here I go then.
<br/>
<br/>
The name of the rpg is Renaissance, because a major (unspoken!) theme of the rpg is rebirth. You play a young knight in an era where magic has vastly improved the technology of the world. Think Medieval europe spliced with steam-punk spliced with a very timid dash of Star Wars. The perspective of the rpg WON'T be your traditional isometric affair (I'm a better modeler than I am a spriter), but it will be from an over-the-back perspective much like Quest 64 or Ocarina of Time. The battle system is also real-time, making use of shape recognition for....alas I've already said too much!
<br/>
<br/>
If I haven't scared you away yet, good, because I have more to say! Let me start off with saying that I <span style="font-weight: bold">don't</span> have an amazing gallery of 3D eyesex for you all to enjoy, which is precisely why I'm not asking for a programmer right now. I'd rather have atleast the first city and a piece of the overworld done before I start haggling for programmers. That way, I can be taken seriously when that time comes. What I'm here for instead is somebody whom I can consult with in regards to some DS related limitations and requirements that I have to keep in mind. Somebody that is online at least semi-regularly. 
<br/>
<br/>
For example, I could be in the middle of modeling a house (as I was a few days), and suddenly have no idea what the best way to model the door would be. It needs to be animated, but do I animate it myself and export the animation with the door connected to the house, or do I export the door separately and animate it that way? Another example would be simply asking the consultant what the best way to model a particular asset would be, in regards to how the DS deals with objects and such. Do you see where I'm going with this? I hope so, cause I think I've started rambling. Just note that I don't need tips with modelling. I don't plan to get very complicated with these models anyway. If I do need help, I have friends to talk to about that. I don't need a modelling tutor :)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you get what I mean, just drop your AIM in my PM box or something. And hey, the more the merrier. Like I said before, I have full confidence in this RPG of mine. I'm as committed to it as I am to breathing. Almost. So do get in touch, and thanks for reading (and not falling asleep).<br/>_________________<br/>Uh oh, it's an oreo!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This fear is groundless.  Ideas are worth less than a dime a dozen.
<br/>
A) Most of the people don't finish projects, so it doesn't matter if they "steal" ideas to start a project that dies.
<br/>
B) Everybody else has wonderful ideas, and they all think their ideas are Hot Stuff- certainly better than yours or mine.
<br/>
C) To the extent some group is going to spend 10,000 ~ 50,000 collective hours putting an RPG together, they will work with their own ideas.
<br/>
D) If somebody "steals" one of your ideas (they do not want most of them) they may improve it and you can "steal" it right back.
<br/>
<br/>
I think an RPG where each country uses a different real world language would be really cool.  Interested?  No, you have your own ideas.  Can you pull it off even if you are interested? Probably not.  Pull if well if you can complete it at all?  Extremely unlikely.  Pull it off better than me?  I'd like to think not.  Could you get upper management to green light the project?  I don't it, they have their own agenda.  Could you get an external publisher to fund it?  I doubt it, but if you can steal my idea and get funding for it, I'd be happy to hear about it.
<br/>
<br/>
The upshot of this post is, if you want to get people excited and find helpers, let them know what you are working on.  The more you can show, the more it looks like you have a project that is going somewhere.  Nobody wants to work on the best game than never got finished.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I never touted it as the best thing since sliced bread, but you do have a point.  If you've ever heard of SFGHQ, we have had a problem with idiots running around stealing ideas and claiming them as their own. I wasn't afraid of it being stolen and used successfully, just being stolen period. Judging by your response, I'm guessing that isn't really an issue here.
<br/>

The name of the rpg is Renaissance, because a major (unspoken!) theme of the rpg is rebirth. You play a young knight in an era where magic has vastly improved the technology of the world. Think Medieval europe spliced with steam-punk spliced with a very timid dash of Star Wars. The perspective of the rpg WON'T be your traditional isometric affair (I'm a better modeler than I am a spriter), but it will be from an over-the-back perspective much like Quest 64 or Ocarina of Time. The battle system is also real-time, making use of shape recognition for attacks of all kinds. 
<br/>
<br/>
Each attack and spell has it's own shape that the player has to memorize, because drawing this shape on the bottom of the screen executes the attack in the battle. There won't be a huge number of attacks and such (like the library of attacks commonly available in Final Fantasy games), just a handful. The attacks are upgraded with repeated use, and upgraded versions of the same attack are executed by learning a few extra strokes for the attack you already know.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"> The Story - cause every rpg needs one right? </span>
<br/>
<br/>
There is a hell and there is a heaven, but it's not like how you know it. Instead, hell is simply the eternal path that unrighteous souls travel, and heaven is the path that righteous, good souls travel. These two intertwining paths of souls are anchored to earth with two swords, Adam (who anchors the Heaven) and Lilith (who anchors hell). Of course, we have an evil sorcerer villain named Baroque that wants control over both of these streams of souls. To weild the power of the Lilith, his first target, he needs the strength of the strongest swordswoman there is. Thus, he kidnaps our hero's sister in a climatic tour-de-force on the nation of Blaurmond, using his undead and mechanical army, years before the start of the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Our (of course, silent) hero starts the game at the beginning of his journey to rescue his sister. He meets other people with their own goals all over the world on his journey, and he finally faces Baroque. However, our hero's sister has already drawn Lilith, which plunges the world in darkness and fear of her. Thus, the second part of the game centers on trying to retrieve Adam, to put a stop to the hero's sister (who was originally under the control of Baroque, but is now being controlled by Lilith) and return the soul paths to normal.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's the story, as well as more complete information on the game. I had to restrain myself from delving into the dialogue, that's the most fun part! Could I perhaps get a little more help now? Again, please read the post. I'm not looking for a programmer right now, so don't jump on me about it![/b]<br/>_________________<br/>Uh oh, it's an oreo!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is a technical forum, and the goal here is getting things done- not coming up with fantastic ideas.  If an idea is good, someone else has come up with it and shared it already.  (Or it is a trade secret.)
<br/>
<br/>
Most of the specifics you have posted amount to the kind of work writers do.  It may or may not solicit interest in the project, but it is not specific enough to help a programmer.  Afterall, as far as a programmer is concerned, printing a bad story to the screen is the same as printing a good story to the screen.  Even printing gibberish is the same so long as it meets specification.
<br/>
<br/>
You probably want to start a thread about the technical viability of your idea.  The Game Design forum is probably the best place.  "I want to do this, and this and this.  How possible is it?"  If you stick around long enough and the project appears to be going somewhere, you may find help eventually.  Most of the people here are programmers, and programmers have a hard time being helpful unless they know specifically what you want from them.  (Everyone is actually that way to a certain extent.)
<br/>
<br/>
If you start a thread and keep up with it, the knowledgeable people who are only casually interested can chip in.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sgeos has some good points but your idea does sound intriguing. I'm an RPG fan and I think I might know what your "unspoken" theme speaks of. (I hope so, I loved that franchise) Either way you should release some demo code of some sort.
<br/>
<br/>
If some lamer is going to take the time to reverse engineer your stuff, then they prob don't have the creativity to go any further with it. If they do, you will have a record of it here anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
If someone likes your basic idea and wants to 'steal' it, if they have a chance at all, then they already have the skills to produce what you have so won't need your ideas in the first place.
<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line: show something so someone who might be interested, and skilled, can help you complete your project. The rest of us will just play your demo and may throw some nice comments your way.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, all the best with your endeavours. For a homebrewer to go commercial is a hard route. For a homebrewer to produce something playable will give you 1337 status for life!<br/>_________________<br/>Everything is better with cheese on it.

Why would they bother to RE a "hobby" project when other people have done the work and REed million unit sellers?
