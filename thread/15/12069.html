    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I work for a team that deals with drugs and alcohol awareness and action, but have opted to develop a game for our website <a class="postlink" href="http://www.thedrugzone.co.uk" target="_blank">thedrugzone.co.uk</a>. My original idea was to remake Java Blast Arena; but I am also wondering what other ideas I could use.
<br/>
<br/>
A java version of tetanus on drugs seems like a good idea - I already have texture mapping code that I could use to create a warping effect. Any simple arcade type games would be good ideas, especially ones that are quick to implement.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I think a lockjaw clone (ish) would be the best one as it can be accomplished fairly quickly. Blast arena can come later! My plan for that requires a couple of added features that adds to the complexity.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
