    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't gone through it, but I do know where Nintendo keeps the requirements to become a licensed <a class="postlink" href="http://warioworld.com/apply/wii.html" target="_blank">developer</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.warioworld.com/licensing/becomelicensee/" target="_blank">developer-publisher</a>. Executive summary:
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>You <span style="font-size: 10px; line-height: normal">SHOULD</span> have a working prototype of your product on another platform. Not only does this prove to Nintendo that your team is competent, but it also gives you something to fall back on should Nintendo reject your application. </li><li>You <span style="font-size: 10px; line-height: normal">MUST</span> have leased office space separate from any residence. As far as I can tell, the rationale is that it's easier to secure an office that is used for one purpose than a home that is used for every purpose. </li><li>You <span style="font-size: 10px; line-height: normal">MUST</span> get your games rated M or lower by the ESRB or by the corresponding rating board in each market where you plan to release your game. You <span style="font-size: 10px; line-height: normal">SHOULD</span> avoid the M rating (or foreign counterparts) for two reasons: customers who prefer the games typical of an M rating tend to prefer Sony and Microsoft platforms, and some rating boards completely "refuse classification" to (that is, ban) games with content typical of the M rating. </li></ol>

The 3rd requires enough cash to bribe... err... secure an ESRB rating.  It sounds like you are in a position to deal with that.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have noticed though, following the links provided that Nintendo no longer is offering applications for GBA games.  Any other suggestions?  Once it's finished I guess we'll look into porting it to the DS, but I was hoping to get it released for the PC 1st, because there would be less overhead &amp; it could help create a buzz for both customers &amp; possibly getting Nintendo to allow it's release.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I'm just trying to get suggestions, this is new territory for us.  We've released software before, but never anything that required this much "Corporate approval" from other companies.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, as I've learned so much from this forum!<br/>_________________<br/>-#2pencil</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by no2pencil on Tue Apr 08, 2008 3:40 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nintendo is basically trying to do a few things:
<br/>
A) Sell as many units as possible without much risk (they get a cut of every cart sold; I suspect this is a hidden cost rolled into what they charge the publishers for carts)
<br/>
B) Maintain their reputation (of high quality, kid friendly, whatever)
<br/>
C) Protect trade secrets
<br/>
<br/>
Per A, the rules are set up to benefit them, but rest assured they want old hardware dead- that is not where the money is.  There are both minimum unit orders and minimum unit reorders.  I suspect there are also licensing fees, devkit fees, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Per B, you will need to have your product approved (no adult titles no matter how well they have sold elsewhere) and you have to appear to be able to get the job done.  A track record helps.  If you intend to publish you'll need to be able to handle customer service and all that good stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Per C, there are going to be some non-negotiable criteria your company will have to fullfill to join the club.  Also, basically everything is on a need-to-know basis, and by default people don't need to know.  =)
<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I think a PC release would work for you because ports are perceived as less risky than something that only exists in paper/prototype form.  In any case, everything you need know right now should be on the <a class="postlink" href="http://warioworld.com/apply/agb.html" target="_blank">warioworld website</a>, unless they pulled information down since I last checked.  If you are serious, have your act together and legitimately need a question answered, ask.  You can find contact information on the warioworld website.
<br/>

The <a class="postlink" href="http://warioworld.com/apply/agb.html" target="_blank">GBA</a> page stills seems to live on the site.
