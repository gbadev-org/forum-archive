    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been playing games for years.
<br/>
Super mario was fun, then 50 clones came out. All platform games seemed like that. Jump and kill. (I gotta hand it to Castlevania for being original)
<br/>
<br/>
Then RPG games. I really don't like RPG games much. When is Final Fintasy gonna be final (No offense, but they are milking the cow)
<br/>
Again, Chrono Trigger did a nice job WHERE I CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE BAD GUYS. So did Chrono Cross.
<br/>
<br/>
Grand Theft Auto broke the standard FULLY. No more "you got to do this to go to the next level". You can just joyride etc.
<br/>
<br/>
With that all said and done (BTW, I forgot to thank Maniac Mansion for being the first game with multiple endings and freedom to do things in any order), when do I have to wait for a full control adventure game??
<br/>
No RPG or anything like that. I mean like Secret of Mana and Zelda where you attack and move. Imagine a world where you can go to the beach, fish. Then setup a fish shop. Or, link up with friends to go battle a dragon.
<br/>
You may be saying, well &lt;insert game name here&gt; has that.
<br/>
To simplfy what I am saying, does anyone know a Gameboy Advance game that has Animated characters like in RPGs but is Adventure and allows you to live life?
<br/>
<br/>
If not, I am thinking to design it. I have halfix's GUI to work on, but I can probably add the game somewhere in my schedule.
<br/>
<br/>
I know I BASHED a LOT of games. But, unlike you, I haven't played those games much and haven't given them an EQUAL chance you gave them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You mean like <span style="font-style: italic">EverCrack</span> (for PC and PS2), except single player?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Something like Animal Crossing, but with anime characters. The Sims don't allow you to FULLY enjoy the world. Zelda 64 was the closest to what I mean. You control link, you can go catch chickens, play games (competition). But, it still confined the player to the story.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got to say that up until FFX-2, all the FF games have had plots that do not relate or flow with each other. So technically, they aren't milking the cow.
<br/>
<br/>
Image how HARD it would have to be to actually make a do-anything style game?<br/>_________________<br/>Out of Order.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Normally I don't like those do-anything-you-want games. Even if it isnt actually do-everything-you-want. 
<br/>
<br/>
I think GTA3 went too far. I just didn't like it, maybe uit was my fault for not going for the missions but I just thought the game was boring. Even those missions didnt save everything and I tried some.<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yay, I got someone who is a "specialist" in this field. First step is dividing the "essential" human needs.
<br/>
Then, you find the need for money. When the need for money is high. The program finds the skills the person has best for the job.
<br/>
One need is exploring. WE ALL HAVE THAT NEED. If we didn't, we wouldn't be exploring the power of the GBA :)
<br/>
Now, if fighting is the highest skill a person has and exploring is the highest need then we have an RPG hero :)
<br/>
This is a chance for players to actually sit back and let other people beat the bad guy. Or you can overthrow the government. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Codewise, this engine is gonna run on the PC and 2d. TOO much calculations. So far, I got the basic multiplication code down. Only problem, in one second there are 18402 virtual people on my pc X-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
