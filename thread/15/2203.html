    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">anyone remeber "Flashback" made by Delphine Software?
<br/>
their webpage aren't up anymore. does they exist anymore?
<br/>
well the thing is think Flashback would be GREAT on gba.
<br/>
It's a great platform game!
<br/>
is anyone up for the challenge to make a gbaversion? ;)
<br/>
if delphine doesn't exist anymore maybe you could get the source code for flashback or something.
<br/>
i'm really excited to see that game ported to the gba.
<br/>
i also would like to see another game by them called "Out of This World" a.k.a "another world".</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I admit, I never understand people who say they can't come up with any ideas. I generally assume that means they don't have confidence that their ideas are good, so they put them aside without trying to develop them.
<br/>
<br/>
However, there is another reason people like to port games. When you find a game you really love, you want to be a part of it, and porting it to another platform gives you a sense of that.<br/>_________________<br/>"Only two things are infinite: the universe, and human stupidity.

One can find great pleasure rewriting or porting his fave games to a great platform like our GBA !

Matto, if you're so full of ideas, just send them to me because I have to admit that it is difficult (at least for me) to find original stuff ;O) It's why for the moment I concentrated on rewriting existing games (http://rmstudiogames.free.fr).

By the way, Delphine Software went bankrupt in 2001 like many other French studios these last months, many of them being historical studios (Lankhor, Planet Interactive, Carapace, Cryo Interactive, Kalisto, etc...) :o(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not saying that its easy to come up with TOTALLY original ideas. It just seems totally pointless to completely rip a game off. When you start doing things like copying, you're using the right side of your brain, when you should be using your left in any creative process. You're not allowing your brain to develop, you're treating game design as math, when it should be a lot more creative. Coming up with completely original ideas may be tough, but creating original games is not. Just think of what you think of as fun, and develop from there. After all, its not always the idea of a game that makes it fun, its execution. And instead of making a ripoff of flashback, why don't you brainstorm and figure out WHY you liked flashback, and see if you can take it from there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not trying to come up with some completely random excuse to port games.  For me at least, a complete (or near complete) beginner with little more than two weeks of GBA programming, it's easier to program with a concrete goal in mind, as opposed to starting something just to find how it'll turn out.  Right now, I'm working on Frogger.  Why?  Because I think that it would be a good place to start.  The AI is not complicated and it deals with several topics (sprites, for the character, logs, turtles, and cars, and backgrounds) that are essential with programming on the system.  Yeah, but soon, I'll start working with a friend on a larger scale RPG.  Plus, don't worry about how other people program their games.  Although I do admit I have the same gripe for <span style="font-style: italic">professional </span>companies that only want to port games (when was the last original 2D mario game), beginners and non-professionals should be allowed to program how they wish, to have fun or to learn!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish -- if programming is what turns you on, and you are more interested in testing those skills, porting an existing game is a great idea.
<br/>
<br/>
If your ambition is to become a game designer, then maybe you might want to design your own game to become better at game design.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I tend to lean towards the programming side.  It's fun, it keeps me gainfully employed, and I really enjoy it.  I also happen to enjoy games (surprise!), and it's fun to take a game that you can play on the PC or NES or 2600 or whatever, and make it into a game that you can play anywhere on your GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW -- my stock advice for people trying to get into game programming/design is to start small.  Implement a simple game idea to get the basics down, and expand from there.  So, instead of writing that epic RPG, start out small with something like Tic-Tac-Toe, or a card game, or simple shooter.  After that, make another game -- this time more complex.  Before you know it, you'll have built your way up to that RPG, and you'll have a history of success that you can look back at for encouragement when you get mired in the nasty details of more complex games.

I think he's talking about the old-school series. It will have been 13 years before a new 2D Zelda comes out since A Link to the Past (The Minish Cap, 2005) so I've learned to be patient because good things come in due time.

Um, 13 years?  No.  Link's Awakening for the Game Boy came out after Link to the Past, and the two Zelda Oracle games (of Seasons and of Ages, I believe) for the GB Color came out only a few years ago.

I agree.  Not to be negative, but there is a good chance that epic RPG will turn out to be the best game never made.

The "Another World" port has been removed from the site, due to the demand of the original developer (Eric Chahi). That removal might be temporary, as they met and discussed about it, and some kind of agreement might happen...
