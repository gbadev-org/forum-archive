    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm wondering if anyone would be interested in getting together and 
<br/>
designing some game's for the GBA system? I am working on the rough 
<br/>
draft of a story for a four part RPG series that I think would work 
<br/>
well on this little handheld system, but I lack the skills to program and I won't have much time to learn (atleast anytime in the near future). Contact me at:

I am currently interested in getting together with the following individuals, so that we may team up and hopefully create something that other may be able to enjoy:
<br/>
<br/>
Artists
<br/>
Programmers
<br/>
Composers
<br/>
Sound Effect Designer
<br/>
Testers
<br/>
Writers
<br/>
Battle System Designer
<br/>
Game Feature Designers
<br/>
And anything else I am forgetting to mention....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
