As far as time goes, 5 people * 3 months * 4.2 weeks / month * 5 days / week * 8 hours /day = 2520 people hours (at the very least).

<br/>
Of note is that 5 people includes programmers, artists and anyone else who might happen to be on the team.  1000 ~ 1500 programmer hours.  I could see 3p/2a, 2p/3a or 2p/2a/1o splits.

That said, I don't think they could get more than a couple level's worth done in that time, even if the team is twice the size. There are too many pipeline issues between design, art, scripting and programming. All the manhours in the world won't equate to the time you need.

That can be handled with appropriate communication and management protocols that are suited for this type of work. In one of my jobs we do not all work at the office every day but are contracted to do a certain amount of hours over the year. We have regular meetings centered around the Team Action Management System, where an action is raised, dated, and resolved by the next meeting. It seems like common sense, but having regular reports and meetings on tasks completed and concerns being raised to be considered (like predicting a problem in the design) can raise the action of assessing the design by a given date.
<br/>
<br/>
It all falls down (in my opinion) to management and having reliable people who will tell as soon as they know they cannot complete something or are having difficulty. There is probably a successful lifecycle and management system built for this. Maybe if you treat your programmers as contracted workers who are simply given tasks with estimated times[like bounty programmers]; where they notify the group when they begin work, give an ETA then it might work. If one coder finishes his tasks and notes that another has not started and he knows he could get started on it and finish it by the deadline, then he can take it upon him/herself to complete it. Maybe a protocol to handle this where there is a period that someone can take over your tasks if not completed in time, or something of that nature.

If all of the workers are local in the same city then you can have regular weekly meetings to keep them in order and in the same mindset.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Which should be something every responsible person does.  Unfortunately some companies pressure people into making impossible (or just difficult) commitments and then come down on them when they can't deliver.  This is, of course, silly; but life *is* silly sometimes.

My current plan is that everyone is going to be treated as an independent contractor.  Once the contract ends, the programmer is paid and further commitments cease to exist (NDAs aside).  If you complete a module and it passes inspection, you get paid.  Then, you can go to Bermuda instead of accepting another contract if you really feel like it.
<br/>
<br/>
Getting paid assumes that you complete something usable.  Causing other people to be unproductive is not useful.  Not communicating that risk is destructively irresponsible.
<br/>
<br/>
In theory if people leave all the time this system would really suck.  In practice I don't think making it easy for people to leave (and return for that matter) would cause more people to leave.  (Assuming some people will leave is probably a good thing.)  When people quit, they quit for other reasons.  ("Mr. Manager makes me peel his oranges.  I can't take it anymore." =)

<br/>
It might be kind of cool to put a tentative price on every module.  Whoever completes the module collects that module's bounty.  The price is finalized in a meeting to make sure that nobody feels burned.  (If the module was unexpectedly easy, other people might get fussy.  If it was unexpectedly hard, you might get fussy. =)

<br/>
Split the module bounty? =)
<br/>
<br/>
If I were to do a module bounty system, I'd probably set it up like this:
<br/>
<ul>Contracts end when the game/demo is complete.  (Emergency termination from either side is probably going to happen at times.)
<br/>
Initial team meeting, figure out what the modules are and set prices based on the project budjet  (don't use the whole budget in the first meeting).
<br/>
In subsequent team meetings, revise modules, prices and priorities.
<br/>
Have regular code reviews to improve code quality and ensure that everyone is familiar with and can maintain any part of the codebase.  (God forbid anyone gets hit by a car or abducted by a mystery lover. =)
<br/>
Have code inspections before "accepting" modules, at which point anyone should in theory be able to maintain it; people do leave, afterall.
<br/>
Bounties are paid at the end of the month.  Or would the end of the (next) day actually provide more motivation?  (Assumes accounting is really flexible.)
<br/>
As long as you are generally productive and otherwise not a liability I don't care how many hours you put in or how you do your job.  You are an independent contractor, afterall.  Third party NDAs may force working on site.</ul>-Brendan</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The bounty notion seems fundamentally flawed to me. I'm sure you realize that game programming isn't just making modules, it's working with the modules you and others have made to create a complete game. A bounty style will only encourage people to do the fastest job they can that works, and it's going to bite you heavily in the ass when you actually need to <span style="font-style: italic">use</span> those modules for stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
The competetive slant to it would only encourage people to wastefully repeat effort by doing each other's work, and trying to get it done before the other guy does. Recipe for disaster.
<br/>
<br/>
The majority of code-side problems that have ever manifested in my studio were the result of people coding "under the gun", and always thinking they just have to get it working in time for a milestone, and worry about quality later on. And it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, because you wind up <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> ever having time during alpha/beta/final because you're always crunching to fix code that was incorrectly written. One of the first things I told my devs after I became a lead programmer was that they should <span style="font-style: italic">never</span> take this approach, and that there is <span style="font-style: italic">always</span> time to do things the right way the first time through.
<br/>
<br/>
For all of my successes and failures as a lead, I'm pretty certain it's one of the smarter things I've done, and I think if you foster that under-the-gun mentality then you'll wind up getting exactly what you've paid for.

I'd worked with distributed teams that succeeded and ones that failed.
<br/>
<br/>
It comes more down to a few key things, which I think are more important than whether or not your team is localized.
<br/>
<br/>
1.  Is your team competant?   It's a problem if not.  Even more a problem if they are non-local, and you can't be there to realize they are incompentant.
<br/>
<br/>
2.  Is this project a priority for everyone?  This might make the biggest difference to distributed teams.  
<br/>
<br/>
3.  Is there a standard method and time of communication?  We said the majority of the team needed to be on instant messenger from 9 to 5.  The people on a different continent from us had a certain time that we arranged to touch base daily.
<br/>
<br/>
4.  Can work be divided relatively cleanly?  Sure, there's overlap and touching modules in any project.  But if you can't do anything without stepping on each others' toes, forget it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you have someone capable of managin the team, meaning they know if a team member is just blowing smoke, or if the deadline is really not obtainable then it may work..

This can be a major job, which means you have one more person to pay for that isn't really doing anything but making sure everyone is doing their job.

You are right.  "Modules" should be replaced with "tasks".  A task based bounty system could be implemented in just about any field.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>poslundc wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">A bounty style will only encourage people to do the fastest job they can that works, and it's going to bite you heavily in the ass when you actually need to use those modules for stuff.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
If you accept tasks as complete without reviewing them because they appear to be complete, I agree.  If you are clear about what a task needs to do for the project now and later, and then make a reasonable effort to verify that those requirements are met before it is marked as complete, I'm not conviced that this is true.
<br/>
<br/>
There is an optimum speed/quality/effort level that will vary with your goals.  The sooner something will be thrown away, the less polished it needs to be.  Generally speaking, if you can ship a product that isn't defective, you've done a good enough job.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm operating under the assumption that a fair amount of resources are going to be put into code review and inspection.  It's cheaper to have programmers fix their own bugs than it is to have debug staff find them for you.
<br/>
<br/>
If Author Al writes some code, who is responsible for that code?  At some point, responiblity for that code should probably pass from Author Al to the entire programming team.  Assuming a bounty system, the bounty payment seems like a good time to shift responiblity for that code.
<br/>
<br/>
Assuming the task has been completed to standard, the appropriate acceptance test strikes me as something along the lines of: "If Author Al was hit by a car and I had to maintain this, would I be comfortable doing so?"  If everyone in a position to maintain the module can answer yes to that question, the task has probably been completed well.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm convinced that if a studio were to fire enough debug staff to hire an extra guy to do code QA, the net result would be positive.

<br/>
If communication and a check in system are lacking, I agree.
<br/>
<br/>
If people are willing to compete for something and there are resources to properly review every attempt, it doesn't matter if everybody redoes the same work.  Applying for jobs follows this system.  Every supplies the same application materials, everyone is reviewed and three people get hired.  These people are working against eachother- they are not part of a team.
<br/>
<br/>
A team assumes that people work with eachother to get something done.  If I need a lemonade stand, the boards need to painted, nailed together, and moved to the side of the road.  These tasks can be completed by one person or many.  In certain cases, it may make sense for people to work together to complete one task, but ending up with two stands when all is said and done would be silly.  I think that software development is the same, albeit more complex on many levels.
<br/>
<br/>
The goal of the bounty system isn't to inspire competition, but to motivate people to get things done.  If the system fails to do this, it is essentially worthless.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Clearly a check is needed to make sure that things get completed properly.  Conventional systems probably want similar checks.  There are times when people need to be reminded that "this works, but it isn't finished".  If the project is going to ship, maybe the job can be fixed on the next project.  If an unfinished job is going spawn bugs, the job needs to be finished.
<br/>
<br/>
How much effort does your studio put into code QA?
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>poslundc wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">... and I think if you foster that under-the-gun mentality then you'll wind up getting exactly what you've paid for.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
The way I see it, the goals of a development strategy are:
<br/>
A) Motivate people to get things done.
<br/>
B) Survive the loss of individual members.
<br/>
C) Stay on budget.  (Where budget can be converted into time.)
<br/>
<br/>
If a development strategy fails on any count, I don't thing it's a very good strategy.  Bounties try to cater to A and C.  Reviews and passing control from the author to the team try to cater to B.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm really not sure if a bounty system would be better than a normal salary system.  (Hourly payment isn't appropriate unless you really do need a body for a set number of hours.)  I can also think of base salary + bounty and/or delaying bounty until the product ships.
<br/>
<br/>
With a delayed bounty system, you'd adjust bounties based on imcomlete tasks that cause extra work for other people.  That would function as both a quality and budget check, although it might affect motivation.  As any system goes, appropriateness depends on the participants.

That assumes that all of them are available and interested.  It also assumes that the schools will work with you.  Admittedly, if you call enough schools, this might work.  I'm not convinced you'd get all the best graduates.

NDAs may require people to work on site.  Assuming that an NDA is more enforceable if people work on site is naive.  For that matter, so is assuming that people are working because they are at work.  The advantages of working on site mostly have to do with communication- everyone is available from 9 to 5; eye contact; tone of voice; calling an emergency meeting and using the white board.
<br/>
<br/>
There are advantages to distributed teams:
<br/>
A) You don't have to rent a large building.
<br/>
B) You don't have to buy equipment people already own.  (computers/software)
<br/>
C) People don't need to commute.  (may not matter)
<br/>
D) People don't need to leave when security walks in at 1:00 AM. =)
<br/>
<br/>
It's not that distributed teams can't work, but in my experience they don't work as well.

One could certainly argue that visibility is only an illusion in centralized projects.  I do think it is easier to gain visibility if everyone is in the same building.  In practice, I think most distributed projects suffer from less visibility.
<br/>
<br/>
On the otherhand, certain distributed projects probably have excellent visibility simply because they try.

In practice, I think that this has a real negative effect on ditributed projects.  Even if everyone has lost interest in a centralized project, people are probably going to continue going through the motions instead of disappearing or whatnot.

The director is supposed to direct a project.  This involves making sure that the team is working efficiently.  It also involves keeping the publisher happy.  (These require different skill sets.)

It depends on how much you pay people and how much it costs to relocate them.  People often move, at their own expense, to take jobs in different cities, but they move to take jobs that are important to them.  Nobody moves to become a cashier.
<br/>
<br/>
Companies also move people.  Again, important people, not cashiers- it depends on how valuable (and rare) your skills are.  If you need to be relocated, and all the locals are unquilified, you'll probably be relocated.  If a company transfers someone to a different city, they'll usually pay for relocation.
<br/>
<br/>
Would a company pay to relocate a game programmer?  Sure, if they need to.  For three months?  Probably not.  You'd have to be a very expensive game programmer.

Have you heard of the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology" target="_blank">Indian Institutes of Technology</a>?  If not, you ought to know about them- they are some of the best tech schools in the world.  Anyone who graduates from one of them can basically find a job anywhere.  Applicants who pass the test, but decline to enter (*) can get into an ivy league school more or less anywhere.  (Not that I have a high opinion of ivy league schools in the US/UK, but that I'll leave that for later. =)
<br/>

The Indian Institutes of Technology are not the only good schools in the country.  Indian tech schools are just better, on average, than tech schools in the rest of the world.

I've had a bunch of friends of Indian descent.  (As in 100% Indian "genetically")  But, they were raised in the US/Canada... which means that they don't count for equation.  Being "Indian" doesn't magically make someone better at tech jobs.  India just does good job training people for tech jobs.

I think one of the biggest problems when designing something is outsourcing a programming task to some other part of the world, where the actual problem is not fully understood. Case in point, my super smart car radio always changes the station whenever I drive into a tunnel or even around a corner. It might be nifty feature in the middle of nowhere, but in a big city it just makes you want to kick whoever came up with that concept.
<br/>
<br/>
Mostly, I am firmly against this whole "we need to design smart systems" approach they ingrain into computer science people these days. In general it's a laudable effort to assist the user, but more often than not I find this idea to help me with thinking and deciding what I really want to be quite patronising, preposterous and aggravating.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have worked with many in the software industry.  And some of them are great at what they do.  But, based off my personal experience both in northern New Jersey and Chicago, they are not any better trained or better prepaired then someone from a good US tech school.
<br/>
<br/>
As with any stereotype, there usually is reason for it, but it can't be applied to the whole.  Are there great programmers from India?  Sure.  Are there great programmers from the USA?  Sure.  You can probably say that for any country.  But, are there "more" great programmers from India?  Personally, I doubt it.

Anyway, this is all based off of personal experience, not articles that may have been written or reports.  I've had them long enough to learn the tricks..

As for outsourcing.. there is only one reason and that is money.  Either a savings or even a perceived savings and companies will outsource.  The company I was working for has decided to let go 250 IT staff to outsource their IT with HP.  They "think" they will save money, but what they don't realize is that contractors aren't as flexible as employees.  Our field support team handled everything from servers, workstation, switches, pbxs, voice-mail systems, cabling, you name it.  I think they will be supprised when a cable tech has to be called in for a problem after the server tech has left and the issue is still there..  It's all about cost.  My brother tipped a couple of kids $.50 for carrying his bags at the motel..  He was told that he shouldn't have done that, as it is more then they normally make in a week.  Unless you have personally experienced it, I don't think you can understand.
