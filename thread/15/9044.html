    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is a short note for the (semi) professional teams who want funding to complete (or even start) their projects.  Before anyone gives you any money, they need to know that:<ul>A) You can complete a project,
<br/>
B) That you can complete a project that makes money, and
<br/>
C) That your complete projects make more money than the next team's.</ul>To do that, you'll need to present the following information:<ul>This would be a cool game to make.  [A, B, C] are what
<br/>
makes this game fun.  [D, E, F] are what this game has
<br/>
that others don't.  [G] is what we use to sell the game.
<br/>
[H] is who we sell it to.  It will take [J] length of time to
<br/>
make with [K, L M] staff members, so it will cost [N] to
<br/>
make.</ul>Unless the entity you are approaching has worked with you before and knows what you can do, you'll also need to include something to the effect of:<ul>Our team consists of [O, P, Q], and we made [R, S, T].</ul>I'm sure there is a better way to present all of this.  I'd love to hear it.

PS A lot of this also goes for the "I have a cool game idea, give me slaves to make it!" crowd.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
