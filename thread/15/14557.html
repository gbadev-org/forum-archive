    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am making a rpg-strategy game. a very simple one. I use just 16x16 colour spheres to represent characters. Battle system is mostly finished. Just having three found bugs and a strange lost pointer that i am searching for.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that battles are long, out of graphics and i fear it becomes boring after some time. I thought on a story mode (with my school english XD) with some kind of "paths" or missions to alternative endings. But i am not sure if that could be enough, since the lack of graphic is going to make it even worse.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a little description of the game.

<br/>
Game is a turn based rpg with strategy elements on it.
<br/>
The game is done to be played by 1 to 12 players on the same console (since it is turn based there is only one control needed, but if someone wants to help on multiplayer, you are free to ask.).
<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 game modes: the story mode and the battle mode.
<br/>
On battle mode there are 12 teams. Each team can be assigned to player or computer AI on 4 stages of difficulty.
<br/>
<br/>
Each team is represented by a colour and it has its own level and experience. Defeating enemies gives experience to the team. The larger the level is, the more characters you can have and the more jobs are available. At first teams can have only 6 characters. That number is going to be increased to a maximun of 14 different characters. Also, there are 4 jobs that are unlockable.
<br/>
<br/>
The strategy is based on team working. You can split the characters on formations. You can have a maximun of 7 formations, each one must have a minimun of 2 members. The more members, the stronger the formation will be, but the less number of hits you will have. Also characters have a skill depending of its job. You can use one skill for each formation you have. Those goes from healinng to summoning, passing through attacks with different effects depending of the conditions.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, on battle mode, you can create a monster team (controlled by computer) after meeting them on story mode. Used to play free battles.
<br/>
<br/>
Story mode is in process. It will have a simple story that gives different options and different endings. Characters are different from battle mode but battle mode lets you import from story mode. There are 3 teams reserved to player, and it is strongly recommended to fill the 3 teams, even if you play alone, since you are going to need it.
