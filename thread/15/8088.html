    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am designing a game, my first, I'm not a total spaz, just my gba skills are seriosly needing work as I only started a week ago. however I know how to program adiquitly (spelling on the other hand needs some work)
<br/>
<br/>
basicly, I am making another (yawn) RPG tile game, it will have a few intresting features:
<br/>
<br/>
1) neverwinter nights style open story
<br/>
<br/>
2) diablo style fight and walk with magic
<br/>
<br/>
3) Final fantasy style magic inside weapons to equip 'magic'
<br/>
<br/>
4) your actions make you good / evil and change the story
<br/>
<br/>
5) you can kill anyone, you know when a charactor pisses you off, not a problem
<br/>
<br/>
my problem:
<br/>
<br/>
basicaly I have got to the stage where the background tiles dynamicly load (as loading annoyes me) and I am about to add the sprite of the caractor when I got to thinking about movement and fighting....
<br/>
<br/>
I seem to have 2 possibilities (right?) zelda style 8 directions, or vector movement... I like the idea of vector movement (although alittle harder to control as its like original gta) BUT how can I make a tile game look right as to make it look not shite you need to have perspective building etc, and to be able to turn sprites you need top down view, thats 2 different angles for buildings (45ish) sprites (areial 0)... any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
also, just to check, I am currently doing it in mode 0 for background, can I rotate sprites, they are independant and can do rotation if rotation is disabled for background layer right?<br/>_________________<br/>-Rory

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, you can rotate sprites without needing to rotate the BG.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the vector music thing, I'm not quite sure what you mean. I do know that for your platform, zelda style seems best. You might have your character be able to curve a little around turns for added realism. 
<br/>
<br/>
As for the dynamic camera angles, look at roller coaster tycoon and Harvest Moon 64. Both show interesting ways of achieving this simply. (for HM64, use L and R on the farm.) Obviously, 3d is pretty much out of the question on the GBA, but you might try having a dynamic camera and updating the on-screen buildings and such with sprites. (Think golden sun.) 
<br/>
<br/>
You have a lot of options, the real problem here is choosing one. For now, I would recommend sticking with a diablo type camera (4 positions) and zelda style movement. You can add cool camera and movement later, but for now you need to solidify your battle system.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

<br/>
by vector I mean you turn round with left right and go forwards and backwards with up down and you can go forwards in any direction (eg 13 degrees)<br/>_________________<br/>-Rory

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, I have come to a desision...
<br/>
<br/>
going with vector based movement. BUT with a twist:
<br/>
<br/>
up is up
<br/>
down is down
<br/>
left is left
<br/>
right is right
<br/>
<br/>
but if while holding up you press left it will turn left, if while holding right you press down it will turn down.... (alittle bit more sophisticated but u get the jist)
<br/>
<br/>
therefore acheiving vector based movement without the laimeness of the controlls.<br/>_________________<br/>-Rory

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I'm remembering the top-down levels on Contra 3, where L&amp;R rotate the map around you, then the main directions move/strafe.  It was pretty cool (at least, in my memory)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#66830 - sajiimori - Fri Jan 13, 2006 7:38 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, you can turn if you start by going up, but not when going left, right, or down.  You can go diagonally down/left and down/right by pressing those directions, but not up/left and up/right.  That's real intuitive...
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I misread part of it, but it's still confusing to press to the right, then down, and have your character start going down/right but then go past that (down, down/left...).  I'd be thinking, "Just go down and right god damn you!"</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by sajiimori on Fri Jan 13, 2006 7:54 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I love this idea... I'd like to see the progress on this as you experiment with it, just to see if it's as cool is practice as in theory.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah no prob :-) I'll tell you how it goes, taking a break from programming game to do some reasearch and to build story line etc, but once I make it work I'll send you a demo :-)
<br/>
<br/>
it was a kind of "eureka" moment when I thought of it, probably not my idea, but I thought of it independently, wish it was me that thought of it first :-(<br/>_________________<br/>-Rory
