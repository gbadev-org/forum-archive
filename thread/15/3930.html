    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Something I've been thinking of.. I'd like some advice and maybe some help.
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: this game was designed to seem really simple.
<br/>
<br/>
Title:
<br/>
LightBringer(working title)
<br/>
<br/>
Story:
<br/>
The world was once covered in a dark fog by a mysterious angel. None could find a way through the darkness except a small pack of warriors namely the LightBringers. The lightbringers strove to fight off the darkness but could not kill the entity that had created the black fog. Instead, they captured him and jailed him within the tower of light. thousands of years pass and all memory of the great battle fades into myths. The lightbringer clan had almost gone extinct at that point in time being that they seemed obsolete. The entity had stirred within the tower, from no where a second darkness covered the land. The threads of light holding the dark entity back had grown feint and he escaped, fleeing to the dungeons of the tower. Enter the hero. The town is covered in darkness and in order to defeat the darkness, the lightbringers must bind together to destroy the dark entity in his weakened state.

Quest:

The center of town is guarded by the host of lightbringers left. your objective is to go throughout town and light the beacons of light to hold back the monsters from the town. After that is accomplished you must then delve deep into dungeon to destroy the dark entity. You have been chosen because you are the weakest amongst the clan and all others are needed to hold the center of town. At first you are only meant to run to the beacons and light them, but constant battlement is set upon you and you get fairly strong in a hurry.
