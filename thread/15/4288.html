If I needed to write notes on GBA, I might try this:

dedicate a chunk of SRAM for ASCII text. 256 btyes per note seem about enough.
<br/>
use a similar letter-entry to that used by most RPGs. i.e. a list of letters at the bottom of the screen , d-pad moves list,  a-button chooses, b-button cancels last letter.
<br/>
use tiled graphic mode, and draw some graphics for all printable characters.<br/>_________________<br/>-pb</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What do you know now about making a PDA style app and what do you need to know?  This is kind of a vague question you're asking.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing you're going to have trouble with right away is not having a real-time clock.  I've heard of some flash carts having a real-time clock, but it's not standard GBA hardware, so I'm not sure how you'd keep track of time.  Plus, how are you going to wake up the system if you want to set up an alarm?  
<br/>
<br/>
Another question is, how are you going to input text into the GBA?  You could create an input system using a standard alphabet on the screen and use the gamepad and buttons to choose letters, but that would be awkward a time-consuming to use.
<br/>
<br/>
My advice: wait for the Nintendo DS or get a PDA. :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

We're not sure that the Nintendo DS will be hackable. Has anybody figured out how to run their own code on a freestanding GameCube, where "freestanding" means no PSO/BBA?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Unless the GameCube dashboard or one of the more popular games has a buffer overflow allowing loading code from a Memory Card 1019. First place for crackers to look should be the GameCube version of 007 Agent Under Fire, as the first Xbox memory card exploit showed up in that game as well.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
