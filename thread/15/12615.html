    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If the system is designed correctly then it is possible to write the data before writing code, but then the worst case scenario of the data format being a bad one is very damning when you have spent days producing the data. Maybe these problematic situations are more prevalent with beginners and isn't as much of an issue with more experienced people. And having said that it all depends on how much implementation is required. I can think up plenty of data heavy[ish] projects (not necessarily games) where there implementation is bog standard (simple).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The format is a spreadsheet output a tab separated values.  Adding new columns/data features is a snap.  I'll have to filter it using perl regardless.

If you have a table with personality info for each of 300 different clones that could move into your 100 acre village (with about 50 living there at once), and suddenly you realize you need two fields describing aspects that you hadn't thought of when you had your level monkeys fill in these personalities, it'll be very time-consuming for humans to generate this data. It's better to get the engine working with 30 possible clones than with 300.

You can either go the algorithmic template route (code heavy and data heavy), or you can go the hard coded route (very data heavy).  Either way, real values will have to be added eventually.  You can always "fill down" with a default value until there is time to complete the data.  Type changes will probably be time consuming.  Great structure changes will result in a lot of work having to be redone; this always happens when things are changed.  (Gold changes from a hard coded feature to a generic counter.  Flags are merged with counters.)

Whatever you want it to.  I like to use "fill down" on the data, just to be safe.  It also makes the perl filters cleaner.
<br/>
<br/>
My goal with this whole thing is make the coding session as short and as clearly defined as possible.  I hate bugs and want to minimize the opportunity for them to appear.
