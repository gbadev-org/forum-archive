    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi to all, 
<br/>
i want to post here an idea 'bout a game i'm working on... tell me what you think about it...
<br/>
<br/>
HOLY HELL - this is my first gba project... 
<br/>
<br/>
you guide a little ship inside a fixed background, shooting to a lot of different colour blocks that cames down from the upper side of the screen (imagine "magical drop"). 
<br/>
the ship has the possibility of switching its colour pressing B button (ikaruga with more colours)... 
<br/>
<br/>
pressB -&gt; red -&gt; pressB -&gt; green -&gt; pressB -&gt; blue -&gt; pressB -&gt; violet -&gt; pressB -&gt; red again and so on... 
<br/>
<br/>
you can destroy only the blocks that has your same colour.
<br/>
if you don't destroy a block it slide down and vanish but if you hurt the block you lose a heart...
<br/>
<br/>
this is the idea... i've done the first functions for moving and shoting and without hurry i continue studying and developing...
<br/>
<br/>
what do you think?
<br/>
thanks and sorry for my english again...
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds like it'd be fairly fun if implemented well.  You might also consider having other buttons (L/R/etc) change colors in different ways (Reverse order, skipping, etc) so good players wouldn't have to cycle through everything.  Unless the cycling is purposely part of the challenge.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i have a lot of ideas on how to expand the game but i want to start with the gameplay's basics... optimize all... and then implement something more... 
<br/>
just like a charging bomb with a number of chain... which should be able to destroy all the blocks of a specific colour... (R button)
<br/>
and about the changes of colours i choose to cycle to make all harder to beat...  
<br/>
thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i want to make it more phrenetic and less brain-engaging...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi, this is a demo of the gameplay i thought, but the code isn't well done... i'm keep working... let me know what you think about it 
<br/>
(change-colors-function, score and collision-detection doesn't work very well ... i'm still working! :D) 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- ARROWS move the ship 
<br/>
- A BUTTON shot 
<br/>
- B BUTTON change ship color 
<br/>
- L release colorBomb (every 10 blocks destroyed)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looks like it's working somewhat.  Like you said, it has some issues with color changing and whatnot.  And it definitely needs something added to make it challenging ;-)  Good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi, it's a lot of time that i don't post anything, 
<br/>
and i want to share a little update about my progress. 
<br/>
let me know what you think about it.
<br/>
from treasure forum:

<br/>
"this is the game i'm developing and someone here has already seen in its early phases of development... 
<br/>
<br/>
holy hell is a puzzle game (mr driller, magical drop) with a shmup attitude, the goal of the game is to reach the end of every level trying to chain more blocks of the same colour together. you guide a little ship powered with four different coloured weapons. Every weapon can destroy only blocks of its same colour, so you must switch between them to blow up everything...
<br/>
Brown blocks cannot be destroyed and must be dodged... 
<br/>
<br/>
- A button - SHOT
<br/>
- B button - select Colour/weapon
<br/>
<br/>
i'm now coding some boss fight to insert every 10 levels (they are really short) and a sort of bomb charged with the number of chains made... 
<br/>
<br/>
some screens:

<br/>
<br/>
level design is really poor at this time, but i will create better levels when i'll finish all the game mechanics.
