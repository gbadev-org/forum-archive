    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just thought I'd throw this out there.  I'm a homebrew hobbyist and I do very little coding (I'm an animator by trade), but I had a game design idea that would work really well as a DS homebrew piece:
<br/>
<br/>
  It's basically a "Drawn To Life" text adventure...  Someone ought to do a classic (or even just re-do an already created one) text adventure game (i.e. Zork, The Pawn, or any old Infogrames game).  And implement a paint engine/app where the user is allowed to draw the scene described and/or objects described.  The user could then save off the art (separate from a game progress save) and share it with a community.
<br/>
<br/>
  This would be a really neat at community-type project too as it would be really neat to see the vast difference in appearance of each users interpretation of the game to the next.  Again, I don't have any plans to develop such a game, but I figured it might be worth sharing in case there are any homebrew devs out there looking to take on such a project.  Thoughts?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
