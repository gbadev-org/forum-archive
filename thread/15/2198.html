Do you think you can add anything to that?

That may be where "killer apps" come from, but many great games simply expand on or reinvent old ideas.
<br/>
<br/>
The chances of having a "killer app" for the GBA are relatively slim, since it is already an aging platform and even a completely revolutionary piece of software for it is unlikely to revolutionize the gaming industry itself.

I disagree.  You probably want to start by writing a design for tic-tac-toe, and then something like connect four.  Write designs for more and more complex games as you go along.  Play board games.  Most important of all: read instruction manuals, or at least have a few to refer to!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tic-Tac-Toe.... yeah, I did that.
<br/>
<br/>
But where do you go from there? I don't think programming a board game is fun as i know the basics. What's next? Super Mario?
<br/>
<br/>
Or do you just create a bunch of tiny demos that are in a game? Like one for Mario jumping and another for collision detection and another for killing enemies?
<br/>
<br/>
Is that how most people start?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So you have started.

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Where do you want to go next?  I suggest that you pick a direction and head down it.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>dagamer34 wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">What's next? Super Mario?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
You could do that.  If you want to do a platformer, you could try making something with say four types of power ups and ten stages.  Include a title screen, a game clear screen and the credits.  Don't use more buttons than you have to.
<br/>
<br/>

It really depends on your goals, time constraints and ability to finish projects.  I recommend that you work on the largest project you can finish given your time constraints.  If you can complete a large project and you don't want to be working on the same thing for the next couple of years, then work on something smaller.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>dagamer34 wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Is that how most people start?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I can't speak for most people.  I've completed a few small demos.  I've strated more things than I've finished for lack of time and a somewhat geographically unstable lifestyle.
<br/>
<br/>
I think that one should be very careful not to start something that they will not be able to finish.  One certainly never wants to start something that can not be learned from, although sometimes one ends up learning funny things they never intended to know.
