    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I have a short question for you:
<br/>
<br/>
Does someone of you know the Gba Game: Payback ?
<br/>
<br/>
If so, do you hate the birdeye view aswell ?
<br/>
<br/>
If so, then please answer here if you have any idea for this.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to change the camera view point from: Birdeye view to... Maybe 3rd Person View ? I mean, wouldnt it only take a  90? Angle ?
<br/>
<br/>
I mean it like this:
<br/>
<br/>
Payback normally looks like this:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://img413.imageshack.us/my.php?image=paybacktd0.png" target="_blank">[img=http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/2576/paybacktd0.th.png]</a>
<br/>
But if it would be modified, so that the camera has another view point it could probably look similar to this:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://img66.imageshack.us/my.php?image=driver2advancens9.png" target="_blank">[img=http://img66.imageshack.us/img66/1597/driver2advancens9.th.png]</a>
<br/>
Why I think this coud be possible ? Because Payback has ONLY 3D Modells and nothing other... So:
<br/>
<br/>
Would/ Is it possible ? If so could someone please explain ?
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you answer:
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">More than likely, the only reason for the overhead view is to keep the number of polygons on screen to a minimum. In the second screenshot, you can see a lot more of the world at once (although a lot of it is behind the building, but it still has to be considered during rendering one way or another). If you can get it to run fast enough, then by all means go with the better looking view.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm... the 3D Modells on Picture 1 has all Polygons they need to get displayed, right ? But I just ask this now:
<br/>
<br/>
What would happen if someone (a skilled Programmer maybe) would manage it to change the Camera Positon from Overhead View to 3rd Person View ? Would the game then still run normal or not ?
<br/>
I mean: The Number of Polygon's used for the Modells wouldn't change, but the Viewpoint would, would this really affect the Gameplay ?
<br/>
<br/>
Hope a Programmer or Someone who knows something about gbaprogramming can answer me.

<br/>
If not, would it not be able because of the many Polygons ?
<br/>
If so, why do other Gbagames work in third-person mode (Driver2Advance, Driv3r,...) ? 
<br/>
<br/>
And could something be made that let you change the Viewpoint with,
<br/>
<br/>
maybe, Select ?
<br/>
<br/>
Could the Camerapostion change be done with an Hexeditor ?
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyoneelse tried this succesfully with other Games/ Homebrews ?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is just my assumption. The GBA has no 3D hardware in itself, so the programmer has to program the entire 3D engine themselves. In this, it doesn't mean this 3D engine will support everything that 3D hardware is capable of, so in theory, only those features that the game needs is implemented in, whether that be some special lighting effects, or even the way a camera works.
<br/>
<br/>
Payback, for instance, has it's camera system set up so that you see everything from a bird's eye view. Does that mean it could work from an over-the-shoulder view? Depends if the programmer allowed that. If they didn't, then no, it's not possible. Because of it's current set up, it is most likely that you can't have any other view, as it could really mess with the 3D. Just changing a camera's perspective doesn't mean it will show correct results at that perspective, unless that sort of view was implemented, or which I see it isn't.
<br/>
<br/>
So, the short answer to your question is no, you can't change the camera's position and direction, that is to say if it even has such coordinates that a normal camera system has.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What would happen if someone would change the camera succesfully ? Would the Grafix's get garbled ? Would the Game hang up ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#105329 - DiscoStew - Sat Oct 07, 2006 8:51 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You have to understand. You are most likely thinking that the camera system for it is just like that for any 3D setup ran off hardware. The GBA has no 3D hardware of it's own, so the programmer can set up their 3D engine however they want, which does not mean it will be set up exactly like hardware would.
<br/>
<br/>
So if you wanted to change it, you would have to know how it was set up, and how the 3D engine works with it. For this, you would either have to do reverse engineering on it, or get the information from the author, which is highly unlikely.
<br/>
<br/>
If the 3D makeup for the game was not designed for an over-the-shoulder view, then changing the camera view for it will do nothing but cause problems. To fix that, you would have to redesign the 3D engine yourself. You'd have more on your hands than expected......much more.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, then: Thanks for your answer. Another question similar to this, just for the NDSgame: Tenchu Dark. Maybe you know that this game has a 3D Engine too. And sadly said a Overhead View aswell. would the trick descriptet before maybe work here ? STOP ! Before you start to say me the same you did one post ago, listen: 1. Sometimes in the Game there are briges, and if you walk through these briges you see the charakter in 3rd Person nearly... 2. In the Cut Scenes, you can see the Charakters and the whole eviroment in 3rd Person View too. So would the trick probably work here ? Change the View point. Nearly same Problem like Payback, but better conditions... Hope you can answer again: Pas</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
That formula may or may not be in the game.  Although even if the formula *is* in the game, I think it would be very difficult to find.  Having found it, you'd have to call it with the correct parameters and pray that it works.  It would probably be easier to break into the developer's office, locate and steal the disc with the source code, and break out without getting caught.  In other words, you don't even want to bother thinking about it.

I'm sure that there are some action replay hacks that changed lines of source code - although I could be wrong.

The number of people interested?  I'd love to write an emulator if I had the time.  I'd hate to search for/add a camera algorithm to a game without the source code.
