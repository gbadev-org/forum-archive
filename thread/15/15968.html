    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">By the way, for future reference....if people have already posted replies, it's not really a good idea to completely change and entire edit the text of a previous post -- just make a follow-up post instead.  Edits are useful for fixing typos, making addendums, etc.  Changing the entire post just makes the thread not make sense any more ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
