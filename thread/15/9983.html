I was just going through my temp directory and found this sketch I made of a game follow up to something I made before. And for the first time I matched up the gameboy with the controls and I think it is an ace system.
<br/>
<br/>
The original idea was that it would give the impression of a side scrolling game where he is walking etc, and people appear. But for sketching purposes I just wanted to see how the timing would feel etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Now one thing I want is for the player to be very 'animated'; so he will have a string of moves, pulling out weapons and such. And I felt that these were the main ways of implementing them:
<br/>
 - have each set of sequences corrolate to a move so that you are effectively pulling off a move, and when you miss then the object does not break and it damages you
<br/>
 - again the set of sequences corrolate to a move, but errors will alter the move; so each move is a combination of moves accessed in a tree like fashion so that mid way it can turn into something else - this is much more extensible
<br/>
 - sequences do not corrolate to a move, instead the player is controlled by ai; simple as
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: oh yeah, and as you progress the moves will (obviously) get more complex and interesting. Could appear in a stage like manor, or just give the user continious play with occasional breaks etc.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 2: all that has discouraged me from continuing with this is the animation; I feel like there is no way other than ai or tonnes of frames to get this done. It's more of a factor of having the frames than the engine; the engine is easy.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 3: also the alternative is to discard the major animation and just have a set action for every combination; there are only going to be 7, although there can be transitions between them, not to mention the transitions between left/right attacks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
