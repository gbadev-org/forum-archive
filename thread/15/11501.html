    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In the old school action games the monsters have pattern based AI.  The AI has a initial state which is modified when certain events happen.
<br/>
<br/>
States:
<br/>
<ul>Stop
<br/>
Move/change direction
<br/>
Follow/flee from
<br/>
Self destruct
<br/>
Transform
<br/>
Hide/Appear
<br/>
Clone/Spawn/Respawn
<br/>
Teleport to/from
<br/>
Game specific state change (armor up/regenerate/speed change)</ul>
<br/>
Events:
<br/>
<ul>At random
<br/>
After set amount of time
<br/>
On collision
<br/>
Before falling
<br/>
When (not) lined up with something
<br/>
When something else moves/stops
<br/>
When distance to something else changes
<br/>
When hit/killed
<br/>
When health reaches a certain level
<br/>
Terrain change (for wall trace, etc)
<br/>
Scripted event (step on switch, own the key)</ul>
<br/>
Types of movement:
<br/>
<ul>X
<br/>
Y
<br/>
45 degree XY
<br/>
Free XY
<br/>
Sine wave
<br/>
Parabola
<br/>
Circle
<br/>
Other shape</ul>
<br/>
Is anything especially interesting or important missing?
<br/>
Just for fun, some entities made from these properties (from simple to complex):
<br/>
<br/>
Missle<ul>Initial: Move toward player X, -gravity Y (to hover)
<br/>
On collision:  Self destruct, spawn shrapnel</ul>
<br/>
Lost critter<ul>Initial: Move random direction
<br/>
After 1 ~ 10 seconds, on collison:  Teleport to random location or move random direction</ul>
<br/>
Jumping leaf-ish entity<ul>Initial: Move up
<br/>
On fall:  Sine wave X, fall Y
<br/>
On collision (with ground): Move up</ul>
<br/>
Invisible stalker<ul>Initial: Cloak, stop
<br/>
When close to player:  Move toward player
<br/>
When very close to player:  Appear, move toward player
<br/>
When far from player:  Cloak, stop</ul>
<br/>
Protector<ul>Initial:  Move toward boss
<br/>
When boss hit:  Move toward player
<br/>
When hit:  Clone in place, then teleport to random location
<br/>
When killed:  Teleport to boss, then respawn
<br/>
When boss killed:  Spawn random item, flee from player</ul>-Brendan</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It seems to me there could be any number, depending on the kind of game and the granularity at which you are looking at the AI system.

I'm looking for simple low level actions and events.  "Protect the queen" is too abstract.  It would amount to doing many things.

<br/>
These are more abstract than mine.  Flank <span style="font-weight: bold">is</span> interesting.
