<br/>
For those who don't remember; there are a few <span style="font-weight: bold">rooms</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">suspects</span> and possible <span style="font-weight: bold">murder weapons</span>, and you eliminate the possible suspects until you can guess the correct set of events and win the game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think that clue is pretty good as is.  If you add extra stuff (weapons, rooms, people), I think all you will do is make the game take longer.
<br/>
<br/>
I find that 'solving' a game of clue is fairly mechanical.  Solving rooms is the hardest because you need to actually move around.

I have the ballroom and Prof Plum.  Is the knife out there?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We've got to create our own cluedo game with an additional feature for a group project with AI bots. It's in Java, but once it's finished it's becoming a GBA game.
<br/>
<br/>
I was even considering cluedo as a sort of short story game, where (for example) you have to examine many houses picking up clues. But you don't get the culprit; only their characteristics (or something), and eventually after searching a few houses you can deduct and find out who the real killer was.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What is clue?  (I'm assuming that cluedo is something like the board game clue sold here in the states?)  Basically you have a few lists.  Lists A B and C.  One member from each list is put in a bag.  The goal is to figure out what is in the bag.  If a player looks at the contents and fails to get it right, he or she is out.
<br/>
<br/>
Changing the game to make it more interesting could be done by changing how the components interact.  Maybe players have to buy the cards that are not in the bag?  Changing the theme would certainly be simple enough.  Instead of a human killer, you could have a mysterty killer disease.
<br/>
<br/>
List A = transfer method
<br/>
List B = disease strain
<br/>
List C = vaccine type

Could you add features like looking for prints and such with a flouroscope that you need to find in the game?  Or a lie detector to get one honest answer out of one person (then it breaks).
<br/>
<br/>
or try
<br/>
* intimidating wittnesses (find the rubber hose)
<br/>
* planting evidence (no need for the game to go on forever)
<br/>
* extort money from the suspects ("I could overlook the pipe, for a price")
<br/>
* pocket valuable items you come across for yourself</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cluedo has got to be the best board game!
<br/>
(only no-one in my house/family/albeit restricted circle of friends will play since  lived on a narrowboat without tv, and only the radio, my guitar and Cluedo for about six months!)
<br/>
<br/>
Everything is more interesting when you make it in an isometric view!
<br/>
<br/>
there have been a number of variations on the original cluedo over the last 20 years or so- Super Cluedo Challenge, the one on the train, and there's a new one out now (though I haven't played it myself) with integrated circuit board and no doubt different if not improved gameplay.
<br/>
<br/>
How about using your friends/family as characters in the game?
<br/>
not very original but makes it more interesting for them!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am not sure if GBA can handle this but it is very intresting if we have a 2D movie/cartoon that plots story for cluedo... isn't games consider intreactive movie? 
<br/>
<br/>
this is true adding more weapon/rooms/people will make the games more longer to solve just like "sgeos' said." But nothing wrong to make the game more longer to solve right "patience is the key so solve anything."
<br/>
<br/>
just like MumblyJoe's said. Frontal nudity will make an old game more intresting to play... but not all ages will be able to play this games. 
<br/>
<br/>
BUT you have to considers  which one will spend more time playing games Kids or the Adult ???<br/>_________________<br/>pr0gm3r!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This game is capable even on the DMG, so it will be no hassle on the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of how to make the game longer too, and also looking at how the simple process of elimination has made it into larger games.
<br/>
<br/>
Also while I was at it I came up with some interesting strategy methods to do with AI; or general tactics.
<br/>
<br/>
(1) monitoring opponents suggestions
<br/>
<ul>By looking at who cannot disprove a suggestion you are able to eliminate the possibility of them having a specific card. This can allow you to eliminate what card they gave to another person quickly, and even know whether a card is in the envelope before ever asking about it.</ul>
<br/>
(2) sloathing is the key
<br/>
<ul>Also by knowing what cards someone has, you can predict what they may suggest on their next move, this can save you from travelling around rooms if you know they are likely to suggest cards that you can monitor. It can even be an easy way of getting you around the board.
<br/>
</ul>
<br/>
(2.5) making useful suggestions
<br/>
<ul>As we know that another opponent will eventually make certain suggestions, we can be sure that we do not need to make them because their suggestion will answer it for us.</ul>
<br/>
(3) "diming out someones light will not let your candle burn any brighter" <span style="font-weight: bold">(spite)</span>
<br/>
<ul>..so the bible says. And I can assure you that if you call characters to rooms where they have little chance of eliminating any rooms when they most need to will not let your candle burn brighter, but they will be less of a challenge to you.</ul>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I always take note of that when playing. But why I win each time is because I split up the detective notes into 5 columns, 2 on my left and 3 on my right, eliminating what cards people may or may not have.
<br/>
<br/>
You don't even need to pay close attention. They write high and it's a character, low and it's a room.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway our groups AI would "probably" be the best in the entire years because of this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#31968 - blinky465 - Thu Dec 16, 2004 9:40 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In "Super Cluedo Challenge" there were some revised rules which levelled the playing field (which I personally hated, as I was knocked off my throne quite a few times). Each card has two coloured corners and two numbered corners. Each weapon, room and character card were held in a special coloured holder, which allowed you to reveal one corner at a time.
<br/>
As you moved around the board, landing on a special square would allow you to "look under the top left flap of the green card holder" etc.
<br/>
Not all the murder cards were dealt out at the beginning, and you collected them as you landed on other special squares - so the process of elimination you described above started much later on in the game (since a player may not have a card to begin with, but may collect it later on)
<br/>
<br/>
I basically means that players who weren't so good at the original cluedo have more chance, as a lot more depends on the roll of the dice and being the first to land on a particular square.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
