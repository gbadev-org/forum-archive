    <h4>#11960 - poslundc - Sat Oct 25, 2003 1:42 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to hammer out the details for how my status overlay will work in my game. I'm worried about the screen becoming too congested, though, and would appreciate some feedback on my idea.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically I need to show the character, their life points, and the max points they can have, plus a bar indicating their "force" level.
<br/>
<br/>
Not too much to ask, except that I want to simultaneously display this information for five (yes, five, although not always five, just five maximum) characters without overcrowding the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a rough idea of what I'm thinking of right now:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.danposluns.com/overlay.gif">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The transparent square is where a 16x16 "portrait" of the character would go.
<br/>
<br/>
The life points are four digits (ranging from 0 to 9999). My font for the numbers is four pixels wide; add one pixel for tracking and I need 20 pixels to display the numbers, or the better part of three tiles.
<br/>
<br/>
The "current" life points would start on the top row of the pastel block, next to the bottom right corner of the portrait. The maximum life points would then be displayed beneath that.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not entirely sure what to do about the force bar (especially since I want it to have multiple "levels"), but I'm thinking of having it wrap around the outer frame.
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, my question is what do people think about having the status information spread out like that over the entire screen... do you think it will be too difficult or annoying for the player to keep on top of their party's status?
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried placing them all together, with mixed results. It's an extremely tight squeeze if I try to put them all into one row at the top, and it pretty much conceals the majority of the backdrop if I do. On the other hand, I can make them all in a vertical column on either side of the screen, but then the playing field gets extremely lopsided.
<br/>
<br/>
What do you guys think of it? What kind of a system would you like to see?
<br/>
<br/>
(While we're on the subject, I'm trying to decide how to bring up menus from within this framework, that let you choose actions for a specific character. Kind of like Secret of Mana's ring menu system, but without plagiarizing them. :) I've got some ideas, but I'm curious to hear what suggestions others may have.)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
<br/>

Ever played Gauntlet for NES? That game managed to squeeze four characters' status meters across the bottom of the screen. Without the limitation of 8x8 tiles (pseudo-APA text engines are more practical on the GBA than they were on the NES), you can squeeze more into each line.

<br/>
And here's what it'd look like with my changes:<ul><li>Add a 24-pixel bar indicating the proportion of HP remaining.</li><li>Lose the max HP. You can display this when you expand the character's stats window. For a quick glance, the bar plus the color of the HP text will indicate whether a character needs a medkit administered.</li><li>Draw the fractional portion of the force bar as a 24-pixel blue bar. You can indicate the integer portion with overlapping color changes, as some of the Street Fighter games do.</li></ul>

Does it look too crowded? Yes, some of the background is hidden, but the 8-pixel space between windows keeps it from looking <span style="font-style: italic">too</span> claustrophobic.

I guess I'm not up on the lingo... what exactly is a pseudo-APA text engine? (I tried acronymfinder.com but no probable matches there, unless the American Psychiatric Association has come up with a clever way to render text.)

Hm, some good stuff there. I notice you were using a 4-pixel tile height for the font, status bars, etc. Which is probably a good idea, although it <span style="font-style: italic">would</span> mean more work for me to implement... ;)

Well well well... how about that? Looks like binding precedent to me. Looks like ring menus, er, I mean pie menus, may be back into consideration after all.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, gotcha. That's how my text enginge already works anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping to save on some processing power by just creating tiles for all possible states of the meter and using those instead of having to redraw the actual meter to reflect changes. My VBlank is pretty busy as it is. But I guess it's go big or go home...
<br/>
<br/>
Funny how text backgrounds are so poorly suited for text.

You know, the GBA isn't the NES or the GB. On the GBA, you can copy data into VRAM at <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> time, not just during Vblank. Try computing the next frame's tiles and then copying them once you get a chance.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Technical issues aside, I thought I'd offer my opinion on your status layout.  The two lone windows at the bottom corners seem too disjointed from the other three.  Tepples' suggestion solves that issue, but all five windows on one line is far too cramped for my liking.  My suggestion?  Place the windows along two adjacent sides of the screen, anchored at the top left corner:
<br/>
<br/>
Your design:

My suggestion, take 1:

My suggestion, take 2:

<br/>
<br/>
I think my "take 1" looks pretty good.  "Take 2" I don't really care for, since it really weighs down that corner of the screen.  It's kinda similar to the pop-out inventories of Metal Gear Solid, but what works for items isn't necessarily good for status icons.  Maybe you'd like it, though, so I posted it too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you only get tearing if the part of the screen you're drawing to is refreshed while you're drawing. Think of the refresh as "running laps" around the screen, witht he vblank as a pit stop. If you're drawing top to bottom as well, as long as the vcount doesn't pass you, you're fine. Technically, you could start drawing to row 0 when vcount hits 1, as long as it gets to 2 before you get to row 1, you won't get any tearing. Unless you're SO slow it goes all the way around and passes you again, but then you've got serious speed issues.<br/>_________________<br/>"Only two things are infinite: the universe, and human stupidity.
