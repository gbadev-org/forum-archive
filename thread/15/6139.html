    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">On the news they talk about violent video games how it affects a child in a negative way especially how games are more realistic now. One game that is being made or I think out is scar face and the host of the show said that the game designers should be arrested and be given psychological evaluation.  lol
<br/>
<br/>
Games are time consuming. It should have something to give to people. 
<br/>
<br/>
I know some teachers that tell me that the parents have trouble getting their kids to study since they are always playing games and kid?s tests scores are going down. Maybe many game designers are proud that they make addicting negative games and they lost the original point of games in general. Games should not be an addicting drug to hurt you but help you and so far it does not seem to help many children but hurt them. What is the difference from a drug dealer and a misguided game designer? Both of them make the person addicted and distract them from doing more productive things.  
<br/>
<br/>
Like historians say that people have not changed in how barbaric they are from the roman gladiator days. Top military personal say that the methods they use to desensitize the soldiers are used in video games.
<br/>
<br/>
"fundamental motivation for all game-playing is to learn." "Games are thus the most ancient and time-honored vehicle for education. They are the original educational technology, the natural one,"
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/peabody/game-book/Chapter2.html" target="_blank">http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/peabody/game-book/Chapter2.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Some may think they find meaning in the mindless violent games but so do drugs have a meaning to the people that take it. Everything should be in moderation and no clear balance in video games.
<br/>
<br/>
How ill games look like 10 years from now? Maybe you might find games called rape when you rape people. Why not since some games out now are just as bad. It is a slippery slope and the things you think are ok were not 20 years ago and what you think is bad will be ok in 10-20 years and what your kids think it bad will be ok another 10 years after that. 
<br/>
<br/>
To take away the original educational point of games and replacing it with pure violence that has no meaning is kind of messed up. I do not think anyone will pay attention since so many have been addicted too much to love what they play they will try to say anything to validate what they do. 
<br/>
<br/>
I guess historians are right.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For reals, my 8 yr old cousin was askin if I had GTA3... and I don't. His sister has it, and they play it I suppose... stupid sister and her influence.
<br/>
<br/>
So, what I'm saying, mostly.. kids play these violent games, not because they choose to, but because they are influenced to buy either thier peers, family members, or by the almighty TV. Kids just can't go and buy a M rated game anymore, so they must get the game another way, and thats where alot of parents just slack off and go and buy it for em cause they want it, or don't really care what thier kids do for most of thier time I guess.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Keep in mind that it is not the game designers to blame.  The correct business decision is always to maximize profits.  That may mean putting morals ahead of profits.  As far as the business is concerned, it really doesn't matter what you are selling or what people do with your product after they buy it.
<br/>
<br/>
EA will not publish games with 'mature content' as it were.  They believe that they will lose their existing costomer base if they publish such games.  That is business decision on EA's part, not a moral decision.  I don't agree with them- I don't think they'll lose their existing customer base if they publish games with 'mature content', but I'll admit that I won't touch GTA or anything else Rockstar Games puts out.
<br/>
<br/>
Side note: Rockstar Games gamasutra posting for an artist basically amounted to 'fantasy and sci-fi artists go to hell, we only want artists that draw the here and now.'  I was not impressed.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My view is that it's not the designers/programmers fault AT ALL!  I'm an adult and should be able to play whatever game I want.  If I want to gun down a rival gang in a video game, I should be able to.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, my answer (which is my answer to almost ALL child releated discussions).. It's the parents fault.  If they could take to minutes out of their busy life to spend time with their kids, we wouldn't have this problem.  And if you want to say "so and so influenced them" you can say the same thing for the "infuancer"s parents.  If they would have taken the time to teach them it's not OK for an 8 year old to play these games, therefor we don't let them or show it to them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#46794 - warsong - Thu Jun 30, 2005 6:37 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So what some people are saying is that since the parents are busy it is ok to exploit the kids to play games that will negatively affect them? Now that is twisted and people that think like that are no better than criminals.
<br/>
<br/>
Ever hear that money is the root to all evil? Putting money in front of morality is like selling drugs since that makes a profit but not morally right to hurt others with drugs. People should take responsibility on both side being the people that make money off the game and the buyer. What is next to justify selling WMD to terrorist states and say they are mature enough to use them? If you sell negative things it will come back to bite you in one way of another which so many do not see things in the long run since they have money in front of their face to see it. It seems that giving designers responsibly to make good games is like pretending that drug dealers will have responsibility.
<br/>
<br/>
Also the other notion that if you don?t like it doesn?t buy it is kind of silly since you got an entire game system and all it has is violence. The kids will grow up having problems and the designers will keep lying to themselves that they are not to blame and that they can do anything and that only the parents are to blame and that is a joke. Parents are not like how they use to be and they both work unlike before, more bad influences unlike before, and the list goes on how society tires to sell crap and the parents do not have time to know or deal with everything. The means justify the ends and not the other way around.
<br/>
<br/>
The point is that you can not blame 1 side since both sides help cause problems. The parents should take responsibility but the game companies should not undermine the parent?s authority to show these games are ok to play with their marketing to persuade. Marketing can persuade everyone and like the saying goes a sucker is born every minute and it is the game company that should stop the relentless attack to make crap all the time. Can someone keep deceiving and bombarding you all the time and sell you something that isn?t good 24/7? 
<br/>
<br/>
Even if you are against it is annoying to see it all the time. What next a book on bestiality being plastered all over billboards, commercials, news papers, etc and tell people they have a right not to do it? We have a right not to see crap bombarded. Do you know why they bombard people with junk all the time? Because it does affect people if you keep persisting which psychiatrists know this and marketing uses this against you. You can not expect everyone to fight an endless war and the companies should help since being a parent, a teacher, or whatever to help the child be better is hard work. Even Joe camel was taken off cigarettes for a reason, and some seem to want to go backwards and maybe sell condoms to 1st graders and show adult content to them all the time and say the parents are to blame. Even the fact that parents are supposed to know better does not stick since we have some people that think it is ok. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to be a designer try to be a good designer to make good games for everyone, than a crappy designer to make violent games for adults which target the youth. Taking cheep shots only makes you cheap, so I would expect people take the time and make something good and if they can not then do something else.

I'm not trying to make excuses for game designers, but you don't really address my first question.  Me, being an adult of sound mind (which I'm sure can be disputed) would like to gun down a rival gang.  Expoit the kids?  What are you talking about?  How do you make a commercial for a game that is rated for adults and not "exploit the kids" as you say?  It's a VIDEO GAME!  People instantly think.. If it's a video game, it must be for kids.
<br/>
<br/>
Who's talking about money?  I fully agree with your statement.  But, I like to relax and play video games from time to time.  Some of us actually fallow laws, and will never get to pimp out hoes in real life.. so I like to do it on video games.  The only time money is involved is when I beat it out of the hooker I just paid! :P
<br/>
<br/>
Only violence is available?  That must be because it's all you look for.  I guess it's the same reason people get drunk or do drugs.. Because they can blame it on the beer commercials and peer pressure.  Get a backbone and stand up for yourself.  JUST SAY NO!
<br/>
<br/>
Now, why is it that I should loose that right, because a bunch of horny parents that don't give a damn about their children need the gaming industry to put out software that is "ok" for them because 1) they don't take the time to talk to their child to even know they are playing the game, 2) don't care if they play the game and are influenced by it, or 3) don't take the time to realize what is available in the gaming industry (you know, the old head in the sand) and watch what their child buys.
<br/>
<br/>
How hard is it to pick up a game case and look at the M for mature and think.. Gee.. My 12 year old probably shouldn't be playing this game?
<br/>
<br/>
"parents do not have time to "
<br/>
<br/>
What?  More like parents don't want to take the time!!
<br/>
<br/>
And to argue that todays sociaty is made up of a bunch of useless parents (Which, I will agree with) and state that it is the reason the gaming industry should try to raise a child because the parents aren't, is the biggest load of crap I have ever heard.  Let me tell you this.  I have an 11 month old son.  I can tell you right now that I will know what he's doing, what he's playing, etc.  Have you ever looked at the price of daycare?  People are sending their children to daycare, working a job that only pays enough for the daycare, and still do it.  You know why?  Because they don't want to raise their own child!!!!  They want everyone else to do it for them.  They'd rather go to work then change a diaper, wipe a snotty nose, or listen to a baby cry.  I was around to see my sons first steps (or second, depending on what the definition of "first step" is.)  See him play, and play with him.  I understand that when he's able to hang out with me while I'm on the computer, GTA, ET, and all the FPS's will go in the trash and be removed from my computers.  That when he's old enough to use the computer that they will all have parental software installed to block the crap that is out here.  And you know what.. Before I send him off to the mall with Johnny's parents, I'm going to take the time to meet them, maybe even go along with them to see what they are like, not just send him off, cause then I don't have to deal with him for a few hours.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#46864 - FourScience - Fri Jul 01, 2005 1:45 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Some good thoughts here. I am personally concerned about laws they are passing that restricts video games. I don't mind preventing under-age sales of mature titles, but banning them outright is ludicrous. I don't think they could do the same thing with violent/abusive music, writing, or art.
<br/>
<br/>
My own interesting experience: my upstairs apartment neighbor has all the GTAs. He has 3 kids, all between the ages of 3-7. I would say those kids are very impressionable right now... I don't know if they're playing GTA at all but when I visit them their father pulls out San Andreas and shows it off.
<br/>
<br/>
I really do think that some violent video games, while not brainwashing children to adopt violence, certainly influence their behaviors. You can't tell me that a 1,000 kids that play Pokemon are going to be more violent than 1,000 kids that play GTA.
<br/>
<br/>
Even so, I abhor legislation that bans these games. Just put the choice in the hands of parents. Yeah, a lot of those parents will be totally stupid and show their 3 year old how to beat people on the street with a baseball bat, or gun down police officers. It just seems like the logical solution though.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Two wrongs don?t make a right. You are an adult of sound mind have the right to play it. And so do other have the right to drink them selves to death. These games should not be advertised in front of kids. You do not see bill boards or commercials that show porno on shows that kids watch. You are an adult and you can play the games but weather it is right for you to play it is another topic. Violent video games will not affect an adult the same degree as it does a child. Not all moves are for kids and not all games are for kids. 
<br/>
<br/>
The point is that companies want to sell these violent games to kids and some game companies admit that they do target kids under 18 despite the rating which like I said they are not better than drug dealers. Kids are still learning and growing and the companies try to manipulate them. Game companies are trying to take away the rating system and say that the restricting games to kids is taking away their 1st amendment rights. Maybe some might agree to this twisted view and you might need physiological help. With this kind of twisted thinking the skies the limit on perversions, and things will bend more and more to the point that it is legal to sell future games that make you screw animals, kill your fellow students, teach you how to kill and make poison, give the # to the Whitehorse to harass the president, glorifying drugs to persuade kids its all good. If you want to do everything that the game companies want then you might as well take away the rating system so they can sell those games to kids since that is what they want. If you know that someone is trying to harm your kids intentionally then why do you trust, and why do you fund them for them to get more resources so that they find a way to do so? It seems that even adults fail on the concept of principals. The fact is that games spend billions of dollars to target kids especially the games that they are not allowed to play and they know it works and they do not care. The companies have the right to do it since they are in it for the money and not for you which is why the future of game designers should use real talent to make positive games and if they can not and want to use a gun in a fist fight to win then we know they are not good designers.
<br/>
<br/>
Designers can not just let all the responsibility fall onto the parents since they already have enough that goes against them from bad movies, music, food, financial, social, etc. Even the best parent can not protect their kids from everything. If you want to blame only parents then you are ignoring a wide range of facts. You can not blame the majority of parents that the kids in school are more mentally challenged than other generations despite so much technology to help them. Games are not the main problem but add on to the problem. Many parents do talk to the child but games are intended to be addicting, and many parents complain to the teacher that they can not get their kids off the video games.
<br/>
<br/>
Even if parents do not let the kids buy the game the kids still can no to another persons home and play the game, go out and rent the game, watch older sibling or parent play the game which they might not play it but they are watching it, and more. You attack the parents that do not take the time which I agree with you that they should do something but many do not and that will hurt you. You also ignore the fact that many parents do not want their kids to play those games and restrict them but kids always find a way around it.
<br/>
<br/>
Ever hear the saying it takes a community to raise a child? Well it is true since for over 2000 years it took communities to raise kids and not just one parent. This notion of parents doing everything is a new concept within the last 100 years around. If the gamming community does not care about the child then they are not part of the community that cares for kids or cares to help parents. Like the other saying goes either you are with us or against us. If the game company does not want to be part of the solution then they are part of the problem. The problem now is that many in the community are deranged and you don?t want them to look after your kids and not you have to look out for everyone.
<br/>
<br/>
Also many parents do not want their kids in day care but many have to work since some are single mothers or both work to make ends meat. Also the fact that you get others like the game industry that does not help family by giving information that says that day care benefits kids more and that kids get better grades in school which some buy this. Too much information and you expect the parent to know everything. If you feel you can see everything of what the kids is doing 24/7 then you are an exception that works less than the average person which gets paid 30thou a year. Another fact is this democracy since the people govern but there is not true democracy and if there was violent video games would not even be around, but the reality is that companies rule which pay politicians to be in office so that they help them out. Two wrongs don?t make a right.
<br/>

I see where you are coming from, but I think you've missed the point.  Because adults expected to be able to take care of themselves, society at large does not care about what adults do in their spare time, within legal and moral boundries.  Actually, society at large does not really care what children do in their free time- the legal and moral boundries are stricter. Evidently we hope that they will grow up to be upstanding citizens.
<br/>
<br/>
If an adult only deals with non child friendly content, there is probably something wrong with them.  (Ie. my highschool English teacher- every lesson sex, drugs or violence.  It got boring really fast.)  However, adults at times, for whatever reasons, wish to deal with content that is considered inappropriate for children, which is fine.  To imply that playing a game containing mature content is the same as suicide is just plain silly.

In general, most media has a target age group.  Media aimed at small children may also be aimed their parents- one of the reasons Sesame Street was so popular.  (Jim Henson was a genius.)

I disbelieve.  Please support this statement.  The rating system helps sell mature games to interested kids.  Owning an "M" rated game is a certification that you own a game only your older brother is allowed to play.

I doubt there is a company out there with the mission statement "harm children".  If you don't like the way a particular company operates, feel free to boycott them.  I boycott Rockstar games.  A friend boycotts EA.  (I'll admit that I'm yet to meet a person who boycotts chocolate because it is farmed by people that amount to slaves.)

Kids want to grow up.  Nothing wrong with that.  It is the responsibility of parental guardians to moderate when and how their kids grow up.  When my younger sister was in middle, one of my sister's friends couldn't sleep over because my sister had an older brother (me).  "Something might happen."  I'm sure my sister and her friend thought that was really stupid, but quite frankly that strikes me a very responsible position to take.  Her parents hope something happens.  They just want it to happen after she's married.

<br/>
Who else should the responsibilty fall on?  Parents are responsible for raising their kids.    Your kids might think it's stupid, but a parent can make it very difficult for their kid to see a "mature" movie, or listen to "mature" music.  Financial?  Even if you are poor you can take the time to talk to your kids and see what they are doing.  Social?  Not all people that live in a bad neighborhood are evil.  Some of them are really nice.  You can meet your kid's parents and see what they are into.  Saying "I live in a bad neighborhood, so my kids are doomed.  I give up." strikes me as really irresponsible.  Food?  I don't think any of this has anything to do with being lactose intolerant.  I know plenty of people who manage to cater to their kids' dietary restrictions and keep an eye on what their kids are doing.

Why couldn?t you think of a game like this? I know most people can make a game like this but no one does. I don?t know if many people lack creativity which I have not seen much of that since playing lots of games can influence you from thinking out of the box sometimes. Even Nintendo?s Miyamoto does not play games in an official interview which he admitted so don?t reply and say that he does really play games.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't read everything everyone said. Of what I've read some words are wise and some are less wise. Where I live in sweden I belive that over 80% of the kids and teenagers are wasting their time and throwing away their lives to online-multiplayergames with no end! Sure it's okay to play games, I do it too. But I don't just ONLY play games on my freetime. Besides I don't like to play games with no end like world of warcraft or half-life. I have many projects going on latley and I will try to make a game thats fun, challenging and has a end. 
<br/>
<br/>
I also think that small kids (5-10 years or so) should NOT play violent games. Because my cousin became all mad of playing counter-strike at the age of 8. Screaming "YOU $#!% *** P****$" at the computer screen when he got killed and he also threw his mouse in the wall.

And I have lots more to say but my brother has no coffee nor water, so he is dying of thirst. Good bye.

<br/>
Some complain that parents should look after the kid 24/7 which is impossible. Games labeled for 18 year old and up can not be enforced since stores sell to kids since there is no law that mandates them like smoking. They don?t get a fine if they sell a rating M game to a 13 or 6 years old. It is easy to hide something from parents. The majority of kids do what they want to do and to say other wise is not rational in what the norm is. The game companies are trying to trick the rating system since they do not care but you believe them with all your heart, talk about being blind. 
<br/>
<br/>
Again the new GTA they present it as a game rated for (M) Mature, but they try to trick the rating system to hide the sexually explicit content with a code which the game has to be reviewed again. Talk about the game industry being nice. No matter how much you check the game the company is always trying to find new ways of going around it. Even the news stated that most parents get confused about the rating system and the stores do not show it all since it is new to them and they are simplifying it. sure it looks simple to you just like a rpg game looks simple to you to play, but some dads don?t understand it just as much as how they do not understand RPG games with all the stats which can take 10 min to start a game.
<br/>
<br/>
Military psychologists use violent to desensitize the soldiers to kill without question. They are using games now to do the same and they have stated many times that they do not approve of it. The military can break an adult and make a platoon of men cry and those same people are warning the government to do something about games since it does affect people weather people realize it or not.
<br/>
<br/>
A recent study shows that most CEO's of companies have a psychopathic personality, and that indicates that they do not care for others and do this form their self interest. They have the money to push back legislation to not make the rating system more severe so that the store owner to not sell to kids. And what I have stated before has been said on the news. 
<br/>
<br/>
The point is everything to moderation but these violent games are intended to be addicting which I even send info to friends in the industry to help them make them game more addicting. And no I do not give it to people that make meaningless violent games. Companies that supports the mindless violent games are bias and do not tell you the entire story. You have to know how stats work since they are manipulated which many fall into this trap. I even know professional statisticians which they indicate that they are manipulated in many fields so to prove their clients right which have a vested interest. Police ask the question "who benefits?? from the crime. What benefit does a neutral research gain, or psychologists gain, and the rest that tell you watch out? You can do what you like but know the consequences. Games will eventually show you better how to kill and rape, if a porno, or movie did this then they would be in trouble. Even Larry Flint is against how things have become which he says they crossed the line. As you see the point is that what was not ok is now, and what you find not ok now will be ok later, and it will continue until we value nothing. We are not going forward but backwards. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think I am out of my league since it is trying to explain logic to illogical, standard proceeding that are used in every field are denied by people that play games 24/7 that think they know it all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Exactly my point. *If* games were anywhere near as effective at turning people into crazed killers as these military psychologists and the people who quote them believe, then it *would* make perfect sense to replace boot camp with them. But they obviously don't. And keep in mind: going on long runs is also used to help train those soldiers to become effective killers. Does that imply running turns people into crazed killers?

No matter what Konami and RedOctane tell you (see <a class="postlink" href="http://www.getupmove.com/" target="_blank">getupmove.com</a>), a video game is never going to replace physical conditioning, but video games are good for taking away the mental block against shooting something with a human face.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

So you are a sith. When you say absolute it can go either way you know, since you want to absolutely let any game be made while I say things to moderation. ;) Freedom for a barbarians would want to see senseless violence in the public eye, but slavery for a civilized person is to be forced to see the senseless violence. People already mass produce crap in the toilet, but I guess many to want to eat crap, look like crap, see crap, and create crap. Well people are a product of what they do as the saying goes.
<br/>

====Abscuissa 
<br/>
2+2=4 Don't argue with the fact just try to understand it. Games simulate reality and what research experts know I stated. even some physiologies help people with their fears by letting for example a person that has a fear of bridges go into a simulated environment with a bridge. As the moderator stated about the military they do use it to desensitize the persons mind slowly. You do not jump into freezing water you gradually get use to it if you will go to freezing water. How old are you anyway and what kind of schooling do you have? :| 
<br/>
<br/>
You act like you know better than all professions and you make it like you know it all which you are far off on what you say. I know you are trying to defend you games and I don't mind that you play those bad games, but let?s try to see what is proper and not proper.
<br/>
<br/>
Video games did affect you since look how you talk. You said ?Just because some video game made you cry like a little bitch, doesn't mean it has the same effect on the rest of us normal humans.?  XAXAXAXAXA
<br/>
They have done studies as well to show that people that are violent or/and play violent games are more hostile. you calling another name like bitch is an example. Every single person think they are normal in their own abnormal way. Also crazy people don't generally say they are crazy.
<br/>
<br/>
Also thanks for indicating the news about the rating about GTA even though Rockstar like I said lied and denied about it the entire time until one gaming article pointed out that it is on the ps2 version. I tell you the truth you attack me, Rockstar lies and give sells you addicting negative substances you pride and defend. Nice backwards logic, if you were a lawyers would you also defend convicted predefining killers as well like the ACLU does? I hope not, but if you do then that is your right.
<br/>
<br/>
You say "Then go cry into a corner while the rest of us "crazed killers" get on with our lives.? Naaaaa you won?t kill you will just be foul mouthed to and yell loud and insult to prove your point. Games don?t make people kill but they do have multiple negative affects. Come on dude use some moderation.
<br/>
<br/>
====Tempples
<br/>
you said "games are good for taking away the mental block against shooting something with a human face." That is true in a way. Games in the early 80 you were shooting at people that look like Lego blocks, now games are more realistic. Games will be made more realistic and they are already beating movies in sales. Movies move people to make them feel to get mad, sad, happy, and afraid; and games are reaching that and if you keep bombarding people with these images it helps them be more desensitized. Now a movie is fake but people get moved like the movie passion of the Christ for example since they are not use to it, and some people do not get moved to see a dead body like people in Pakistan since they are use to it. What Abscissa like to talk about are exceptions, and when I say pigs can?t fly he will tell me a story of seeing a pig on a plane.

Don't trust a study you didn't fake yourself.

For that simulating violence =&gt; violence in normal life ... is simple ***.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been a soldier for several years. I have simulated and am trained to shoot other combatants. As well as my comrades did. And tbh none of them is a violent person, infact a lot of them are much more sensitive for a harmonic livetogether then a lot ppl i meet on the streets.
<br/>
<br/>
It's neither the army nor the game nor whatever simulates violence which makes persones go on a rampage, its their personality that search for violence in games and in their RL environment.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's worth pointing out that when people like to prove how evil games are most (all?) of the studies people like to talk about in this context show a <span style="font-style: italic">link</span> between violence and violent games.  This is a statistical link only.  It is <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> a causal relationship. 
<br/>
<br/>
People love to find statistical things and assign a simplistic "A sometimes happens with B, therefore A makes B more likely!"   But that kind of simplistic reasoning is very often wrong.  The demographics of the planet is a very big system. When you see a pattern you're usually only seeing a small part of a larger pattern.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are some examples. (For your enjoyment I've ordered them roughly in order from Very Probable to Silly)
<br/>
<ul><li>If you were already violent person, wouldn't you be likely to seek out violent forms of entertainment?  That's a statistical link, but it says nothing bad about games.
<br/>
</li><li>Since the dawn of civilization, urban areas have been more violent than rural areas.  To me, It seems very likely that games are more popular in urban areas.  If true, that would be a statistical link, but it would say nothing bad about games.
<br/>
</li><li>Many people buy their PS2 primarily to play Madden.  American Football is a violent sport.  If football fans happened to be slightly more inclined towards violence, that right there would explain the weak link between violence and games, but it would say nothing bad about games.
<br/>
</li><li>Perhaps the demographics of violent children and video-game players overlap significantly in some other way. That would be a statistical link, bit it would say nothing bad about games.
<br/>
</li><li>Perhaps people who are violent always wear green hats, Blue shoes go well with green hats and perhaps game stores actively market to people blue shoes. This ridiculous situation would be a statistical link, but it would say nothing bad about games.</li></ul>
<br/>

That's not to say the studies are worthless, but they don't mean what the news media would like them to mean.  Statistical studies are an important part of understanding the demographics of the country, or the world.  And in some cases if there was a really strong link between A and B, then you might use B as a helpful indicator that you need to look out for A.  But the link between violence and video games is very weak. It's statistically significant, but not nearly strong enough to be predictive.<br/>_________________<br/>-Andy L

As you see they make immoral games, so why wouldn't they add more immoral things, and since they do that then it is obvious they lied since they ignore morals. 
<br/>
As you see companies should have a responsibility and venders do not sell drinks to minors but sell these X-rated games which the company hides which so many people yelled out that it only the parents are to blame. It takes 2 to tango.

San Andreas game was not "x-rated".  Even the secret mini-game had only interminably boring clothed dry-humping.  
<br/>
<br/>
(There were mods to make it unclothed, but you can't blame Rockstar for mods.  AFAIK those mods don't work on the PS/2 anyway.)
<br/>
<br/>
I think it's pretty clear that if you're a 17+ year old searching the Internet for a crack to run on your game, and you've purchased the hardware necessary to mess with a PS2 save-game, then you're probably savvy enough to use the Internet to find non-game-related material far more "x-rated" than clothed dry humping.
<br/>
<br/>
If you think clothed humping is scandalous and "x-rated", then you've either just beamed in from the 1950s, or you've lead an extremely sheltered existence.

Incidentally, I've been trying to track down where Rockstar actually makes this now-infamous denial.  I'm assuming there was a press release or something.   I've only been able to find two quotes from it. 
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>"<span style="font-style: italic">[Hot Coffee is] the work of a determined group of hackers who have gone to significant trouble to alter scenes in the official version of the game."</span>
<br/>
This is true, if slightly misleading. The original "Hot Coffee" downloadable mod did more than just unlock the minigame, it also removed the girls' clothes. So they've "altered" the "scene" in the mini-game.
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-style: italic">"Hackers created the 'Hot Coffee' modification by disassembling and then combining, recompiling and altering the game's source code."</span>
<br/>
This is only true if you define "source code" to mean the .dat files and the savegames, instead of the compiled binaries.  If they'd just said "Code" I'd have been fine with that, but "source code" means, to me, specifically means the code you'd compile into a binary executable.  </li></ol>

In lighter news, "Jack Thompson" the lawyer/media agitator who first started this frensy about San Andreas has obviously been encouraged by his 'success'.  He is now claiming that "The Sims 2" is "<span style="font-style: italic">worse than San Andreas</span>" and "<span style="font-style: italic">A pedophile's paradise</span>" and calls for it to be pulled from shelves, recalled, and criminalized.  The best part is that this recent manifesto is full of mistruthes  He claims that Maxis went out of their way to give the sims genitals and nipples under their blur, which is completely false.
<br/>
Either he's intentionally lieing, or he made a serious criminal accusation in a very public way without even the most basic fact-checking.  Either way that is a serious immoral act. So, huzzah for hypocrisy.<br/>_________________<br/>-Andy L

<br/>
<br/>
Interesting how some take thing out of context and distort what the main point it. Keep it up, that way you will always feel right. ;) And for someone to say chess is violent is moronic; O yes the blood and gore that the game focuses on, please. As for Sims 2 who care since it doesn?t focus on it and it was not intended to do anything bad. The stats can say they sell to adults but companies targer kids and some in the industry admit it.
<br/>
<br/>
Abscissa to show one site that give a positive spin on it does not take away that fact there are more facts that go against. It is like saying you got one vote out of 100 and you feel you are right, now that is funny. But the site you gave said plenty of wrong things that some have been stated. The site is not relevant to what I have been staying anyway. As for the stats people are ignoring other factors in society which they do not tell you about like the increase of security and police. Also the fact that violent is so high from 50 years ago that it tends to go up and down especially when we pay more taxes since so many loves to pay more for extra safety. Don?t take states at face vale since you have to look at everything that comes to play which they do not tell you. Stats that say it is good are used to manipulate people to support them since they have a financial interest. Freedom is not being taken away, but we do not have freedom from a content bombardment from garbage should be understood. Also games do not account for all the violence that is going on but it is another straw on the camels back which the game designers do not want to take any responsibility. Everyone is to blame and not just one faction.
<br/>
Look online and see for yourself the wave of information about it all. And we have a few opinionated people that don?t get it.
<br/>
<br/>
For every one site that says crappy games are ok there is another 5 more that counter that argument. Just try to make a game that is manful, if you can?t then you are not a talented designer to incorporate it and that?s that. Just try to make good games that have a meaning and not waste peoples time, if you do not then we know what kind of designer you are. Do people really need to explain logic to you? Are you saying more violet activities will make people more civilized? So I guess people should watch out for old ladies since they might be the most violent of them all because they do not play violent games or watch as much violent entertainment. LOL Can you imagine a old lady watching something extremely violent, sexual, with a lot of profanity with her grand child and her saying YEAH Kill the Bastard, F@#$ him up the @#$, and @#% on his face that mother @#$%@. LOL I am sure you might be laughing but obviously it would be a good thing. I also see people laughing when others get their limbs cut off in reality and that doesn?t mean they are in the right state of mind. True some people are violent but people are not born that way or at least they are not trained to be proper.
<br/>
<br/>
Who knows maybe I will come out with a game called Go F your Dog you Mother F?er, and I bet you I will get plenty of support from twisted people. Hey people will buy it to just see what will happen next it the game, I bet some people will buy it and like it since some are like that. And if some do not like it then don?t worry in 20 years your kids or grand kids will love it and the kids will their moms to go F themselves since that is what the game is all about to do those things, and I will say it is just a harmless game. Brainwashing people is easy, making people civilized is hard since people seem to want to be animals. Maybe some will say we should target kids under 4 years old and teach them now to read and write with words like necrofilia, murder, dildo, hooker, pimp, rob, steal, etc. But again dont worry it will be done sooner or later. It is a good thing we have the ACLU to defend pedofiliac killers which they are helping to push for it. Weather you like it or not it will happen since this is a slippery slope.
<br/>
<br/>
============= stats and quotes, but everyone will ignroe since people never want to listen what should be since they want to do what they to do at the price of everyone else. How sadistic, but that is obvious.
<br/>
If you want some links then here:
<br/>
?Playing a video game triggers the same violent responses in the brain as actual aggression, researchers claim.?
<br/>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4119408.stm" target="_blank">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4119408.stm</a> Also I have to note that if people are not affected as they say then the person tends to be more sadistic which is linked to other negative things like bad language, bad attitude, hypersensitivity, and more which many have shown this time and time again.
<br/>
<br/>
Look everything to moderation. You don?t want a game that consists of full violence, and you don?t want food that is just made of pure sugar, because if you do it will desensitize you and then you will want m ore since the original does not make you feel anything. People that do these are not taking things to moderation. Violence, profanity, and the rest ok, but we should not have them just for the sake of it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"If you want to include violence in your games...put your heart and soul into it, do it with awareness -- not because violence is easy, or because it shocks, but because you need dissonance, and you know how and why it strengthens your game.? Game designer Brian Moriarty at 1998 Game Developers Conference
<br/>
<br/>
"Our children are being fed a dependable daily dose of violence...[that blurs the line between] fantasy and reality....for too many young people...[The] time has come to show some restraint..." Clinton I know it is funny coming from a guy that can not hold restraint but as it seems society affected him in a genitive way.
<br/>
What game would u say crosses the line? Can you think of any that would be out of bounds? If so in around 10-20 years you might see that kind of game come to life, just like how the majority of people 50 years ago did not think entertainment would turn out the way it has now.
<br/>
<br/>
What if we made society have the most violent things imaginable and unimaginable? What about a game that you kill, rape, and eat an entire family and you have to increase your sadistic score to win by doing the most depraved acts? Wouldn?t that be fun too since it is just a game? And what if every form of media represents it and it is main stream? The reason why we have more and more negative things presented to us are that we become desensitized as a people and we need more to affect us, and eventually we will turn out to be cold sad products of our environment. People think of the now and dam the future, just like how so much toxics put in the air, land and ocean which contaminate everything and you have people say it wont affect anything. You play a big of violence obviously it wont affect you if you see it once for most, just like if you throw toxics in a big lake again it wont affect you if you only did it one time, but if you keep doing it constantly and everyone does it then we will have problems.

- ESRB president is hired by the video game lobbying group... Neither the names of the raters nor the criteria they use to arrive at ratings decisions are available to the public.
<br/>
<br/>
?  Teen boys average ten hours per week playing video games. 
<br/>
?  Teens who play violent video games do worse in school than those who do not.
<br/>
?  Only 15% of teens think their parents know about video game ratings. 
<br/>
?  Only 2% of teens say their parents routinely check ratings.
<br/>
Only 1% of teens report that their parents have ever prevented them from buying games due to their ratings.
<br/>
Youth who prefer violent video games are more likely to get into arguments with their teachers and are more likely to get into physical fights, regardless of gender.
<br/>
Only 26% of retail or rental stores provided any information about the rating systems
<br/>
Only 30% of retail stores trained their employees on the rating systems.
<br/>
<br/>
A 22-year longitudinal study by University of Michigan researchers Leonard Eron and Rowell Huesmann reported a direct correlation in middle-class children between the amount of violent entertainment watched and subsequent aggressive, anti-social behavior.

A person that goes off topic and attack another to win a topic does not show you are in a good position. I am typing things facts since if you did not notice it was a long post. Some types like genitive should be general, and sometimes you assume I said something when I quoted form the site. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also I emailed the guy that had the stat and a lot of things he said were wrong and he ignored the other stats which he does not want to show you which I pointed out to him. It is easy to trick people and all you have to do it show ? the information. We have to account for other factors that prevent negative activity. Look at the crimes reported to the police has been increasing, arrests for drug abuse violations increased, some homicide increased, and many more taken to prevent negative actions from the loose of freedom. 
<br/>
<br/>
As for freedom the increase in violent crap helps to reduce everyone else?s freedom which many do not see. People see to ignore the cause and affect of things and some think that a negative action can produce a positive outcome and a positive action and produce a negative outcome which is twisted. What ever was bad 30 years ago is ok now and what is bad now will be ok later. I bet no one here took constitutional law classes, and I know most don?t get how freedom works.
<br/>
<br/>
To increase safety in the society your freedom decreases! To make people more nuts would require more safety measures which now we have, thanks you everyone. :P

It took me a minute or so to properly parse these two sentences. The first time I read it I thought that your first sentence was claiming that you cited many facts, and that your second sentence was disputing the definition of the word "genitive".   Perhaps in the future you should type slower, and create shorter posts.  Try to impress us with your intelligence and your command of the facts, not the sheer number of words you can put down on the page.

<br/>
If you look close I did not go against what I said. The stats on the site show violence down but we can not say violent game caused it to move. Police brought the violence down if you look on the chart on how more police enforce the law has increased. The guy uses the rating and put words in to prove his side.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I agree parents are to blame but you have to agree that the game designers and game venders are to blame. When a vendor makes sells cigarettes or porno to a kid he can get in trouble, but when he sells M rated games he doesn?t and they sell it to them since they got a profit. As for the people that make it they have a responsibility as well since even x rated movies have a limit on what they can do and even people like Larry Flint agrees that people should not cross the line. The same thing with other forms like entertainment and violence.
<br/>
<br/>
We know that parents are busier than ever and can not compete with society for a few reasons and most do not. To expect that all parents to be super parents is not realistic and to regulate it would be interesting but also not realistic.  I agree parents are to blame but everyone should take responsibility and have some restraint and creativity. And since we know that many parents are not good and we make these games freely knowing this then we are also to balm if we make it. It is like me seeing a block away that someone is crossing the street and press the gas to hit them and when I do I say it is not my fault since I did not have the stop sigh. Killing one person you 
<br/>
<br/>
If you do the math you will see that getting a kick out of violence doesn?t help. You agree that it might be small percent that violence has a negative impact and the more accepted it becomes more violence is introduced which increases the percentage. 
<br/>
<br/>
Another negative aspect is the desensitization in how the more you get use to it the more extreme it has to be so that your get a sensation again since the original trick doesn?t do it for you. And every time it gets pushes more and more and we loose track it. Alfred Hitchcock was a great horror movie maker and he did not show penetration of the knife contacting the skin and understood that to let people?s imagination adjust to how violent it can be. Some wanted to push it more since they don?t care about the consequences and do it for the money to show the gore. Then that gore doesn?t do it for us and we need more gore and more extreme gore.

If I understand your garbled, toddler-style English then I think you mean that it's prohibited to sell NC17 movies to children.  This is correct.  (There is no rating 'X'. After 'R' comes 'NC17'. 'X' is just a meaningless buzzword.) It is also prohibited to sell AO games to children.
<br/>

So .... what's your point?

(If you mean to say there's a limit to what a NC17 movie can show, then you are <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> correct.  If you can film it without committing a crime, then as far as I know you're pretty much all clear for releasing it as an adults-only movie. At least in the U.S.A.)

Anyway, on the news time and time again it states the psychiatrists that say it makes kids more violent. Another said it does have a negative impact to make kids do more negative things like cursing, not thinking logically, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Watching a violent movie or news is one thing since you are watching someone else do it, in a video game you are taking job from you doing it. Acting it out is another. People that love to play a criminal have a twisted mind. If their was a video game to do evil things in the early days people would have been locked up but now that we live in brainwashing politically correct backwards society it is ok.
<br/>
<br/>
The venders sell M rated games to minors and only one state has it illegal for that to happen. And the game industry is fighting that ruling since they want minors to play games that are not suited for them. They know it is not allowed, they know they market it for kids, they know parents do not monitor, and they know people will side with them since people are selfish and do not think of others so they push for it. You call that looking after your interests and caring about you? If so then we need a reality check. People have a right to make violent games but when no one wants to take responsibility and makes only these games then it shows they do not care about the consumers. Rockstar keeps lying to people and people keep trusting them as if they are saints.
<br/>
<br/>
We have enough junk in the world we do not need more. Plenty of researched evidence which the links before gave some examples, but many ignore the evidence. A bunch of atheists making games that feel they have no obligation and think there should be no role models and to have everyone present bad things to market to kids and parents have to go against multi billion dollar marketing.
<br/>
<br/>
And to think a game like GTA SA is the first AO rates games to be marketed as big as a car advertisement to be on highway bill boards, painted on buildings, etc. If you shove crap in peoples face they will get the crap. GTA should have been AO from the beginning.
<br/>
<br/>
Someone else said this about presenting negative games.
<br/>
?Woe unto the world because of offences! For it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh! (Mat 18:7 KJV) 
<br/>
The offender is responsible.?
<br/>
?Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend. (1Co 8:13 KJV)
<br/>
So what comes to parents, sure they are responsible but so are the offenders.?
<br/>
<br/>
I think some like to fool themselves to think making pointless games are good for them and others. Doesn?t anyone feel any responsibility? Doesn?t anyone wants to make something worth playing that gives something positive to people? 
<br/>
<br/>
Like a historians said that Humans are just as barbaric as the roman gladiator times. So why do people want to act like savages than act civil? Do people like to make and act like barbaric psychopaths to relax? Putting fuel to the fire does not help the situation but make it worse.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ethics is the act of thinking about what is best for society. You don't need to rely on age-old wisdom for that if you've got two brain-cels to rub together.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you'd like to tell us which religions you think people must belong to in order to create socially acceptable, non-violent games.

I sure hope the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto" target="_blank">Shintoists</a> make that list, because if not, that'd wipe out a good portion of the world's GBA games. (And console games!)

    <h4>#52320 - warsong - Mon Aug 29, 2005 6:39 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You are giving examples without understanding the full meaning of them. And you are twisting things around that do not relate.
<br/>
<br/>
Also your link?s did not do the studies right. They are people whose brains are not in the development stages. They even admit ?their study didn?t concentrate solely on younger teenagers, ?we cannot say that teenagers might not experience different effects.??
<br/>
?interestingly, older players in their study were ?perhaps more strongly influenced?
<br/>
A slue of errors on that report. 
<br/>
<br/>
This point about violence is a tug of war. Good intentions can not help and doing so can make things worse than taking safety precautions.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have kids you can do what you want but would you want to gamble with their lives?
<br/>
<br/>
I see how you interpret things in an odd way just like how you twist what I mean about politically correct. It is PC to tell people that they should do what they want and not worry about consequences. It is like these people that eat and get fat and we can not state that what they eat it not healthy and they complain that there is no link to eating junk food and not working out to being fat. Society has become that everything is good and nothing is bad but when bad happens the people that say watch out for bad are considered bad.
<br/>
<br/>
You want to sell minors mature rated games and you talk about freedom? Brainwashing kids is not freedom but propaganda. Go read a book called ?the marketing of evil? in how people like yourself get influenced to say silly things in what the liberals have done which they themselves that make up the BS laugh at other liberals that believe it.
<br/>
<br/>
A lot of what you say is backwards and you need to step back and understand the other side well. Rockstar does not care you are happy to make you happy but for them to get rich off your delusions of what happy is. The means justify the ends but so far all you have presented it that the ends justify the means. Please think about it. 
<br/>
<br/>
You say saints don?t go into business, so are you saying if you go u will be bad?
<br/>
As for links that I said before 
<br/>
<a href="http://www.smith.edu/educ/student%20work/violence/Quest.htm" target="_blank">http://www.smith.edu/educ/student%20work/violence/Quest.htm</a>

<br/>
<br/>
I see I hit a nerve when I said atheist. Atheism is a religion as stated by the courts since that is a belief on how to live their life. So I kind of agree that religion starts wars but the wrong ones like atheism. The only people that do no have a religion might be nihilism since they are what they think. Christianity for example says to not kill and people that do not act Christian. The rulers act like bosses just like business men and as you stated are not saints. And many of them have a psychopathic personality and tend to be more atheistic. With atheism the ends justify the means is an ok for many, but for Christianity the means justify the ends. Other religions like Satanism is similar to atheism which is anti Christian which some atheists say they are. Other religious views is the Muslim religion which that says a lot of bad things which goes against christianity which I will not bother indicating since that is another topic. Christ never said to fight a war for him and people that do start wars go against Christianity and act more like Atheists, Satanists, Muslims, or some other views. But this is another topic and maybe you should talk about it in a religious forum. Again read the book? marketing of evil? how people are being manipulated.
<br/>
<br/>
You are persistent to look reply but why don?t you use that to look for the truth and to do that try to pretend you are a lawyer defending the other side that you are so convincing you believe it. ;) If you want to talk about it in another place come to the game site christiancoder and ask them some questions.
<br/>
<br/>
You talk about ethics but that came from came from Christianity and Christianity came with the help of ancient philosophers. Now we have this twisted ideology in modern day society that contradicts and manipulates its way to persuade people that go against real intellects.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the Jewish OT violence that has a purpose you can learn something. Saying history that has violence you learn from it. Acting out violence to enjoy it is messed up in many ways. Again stop twisting things around because it will make you twisted. Your negative assumptions to validate your negative views does not help make 2 wrongs become right.
<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever heard of  "The conversion of a savage to Christianity is the conversion of Christianity to savagery." By George Bernard Shaw
<br/>
Meaning ?"The great danger of conversion in all ages has been that when the religions of the high mind is offered to the lower mind, the lower mind, feeling its fascination without understanding it, and being incapable of rising to it, drags it down to its level by degrading it.""? <a href="http://www.chiasmus.com/mastersofchiasmus/shaw.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.chiasmus.com/mastersofchiasmus/shaw.shtml</a>
<br/>
"People that thinks dinner consists of eating a deli sandwich from Arby's while watching Friends is neither Christian nor civilized." Dr. Thomas Fleming"
<br/>
<br/>
So let?s not bring good things or things that can have a positive potential to a degenerated level. If you want come to the other post ask your questions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not necessarily.  One of my aunts sits her kids in front of videos to pacify them.  I think thats a shame.  She does work, if that matters.

As far as the ippon deal goes, it's probably one of these:
<br/>
一本 【いっぽん】 (n) (1) one long cylindrical thing; (2) one version; (3) (a) certain book; (4) (a) blow; (5) an experienced geisha; (P) 
<br/>
一本勝負 【いっぽんしょうぶ】 (n) one-game match 
<br/>
一本取る 【いっぽんとる】 (v5r) to beat; to gain a point; to upset 
<br/>
一本道 【いっぽんみち】 (n) (a) direct unforked road

From sparring matches - usually Karate.  Ippon is to gain a full point.  There is a 1/2 point strike which is usually a glancing blow or a strike without form or power - nipon if I remeber right, but I'm really pulling from deep memory banks for that one.  Nipon also has a TON of meanings as well :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ignoring the facts won?t help you. And if all you have to say weak 1 liner arguments and get praised by someone opinion and exceptions then that is as far as you can go. You guys keep asking the same questions and showing the same information that has been answered as well. It is obvious we need more meaningful games since I do not see the games helping much in your arguments which you guys completely do not get it. BRAVO
<br/>
<br/>
And again people ignore the facts and I don?t know if people do it intentionally or not.  If we go with how some people think then maybe the 1950's were the most violent, immoral, and less educated time since they did not have games or let alone violent ones, but o wait now is more violent than then. People in 1950 did not act as bad as they do in Louisiana how they are shooting at the people that are trying to rescue them.
<br/>
<br/>
As for ippon it was said in SNK's <span style="font-style: italic">Samurai Shodown</span> when you win a round. So again people that ask don?t get the point of a meaningful game and to put more useful things in a game so that you learn ipon means point. Keep asking question because it is obvious you don?t know.
<br/>
<br/>
The entire point of this post was to make meaningful games than addicting meaningless games, and if people got more information we would not be having this talk as much. But as big as this post is, it shows people need more useful information since many don?t get it. Keep playing crap and you will learn crap, it is as simple as that. Make a violent addicting game but it better teach a lot of things or else all you have is a game for wannabe psychopaths.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to play games to take out aggression that won?t help you solve the problem, but delay you from solving it. Talk about running way from responsibility. But if you can not solve it have some things meaningful in the game to at least break even.
<br/>
<br/>
Every time you talk you are proving me right but so many don?t get it and everyone that doesn?t praises each other which is amusing, so thanks for the entertainment.

<br/>
(Click <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pbs.org/fmc/book/pdf/ch12.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Page Four)
<br/>
<br/>
This graph might seem a little surprising so allow me to explain.
<br/>
<br/>
Since our country's creation it's citizens were playing violent video games, causing our rich history of violence and brutality.  It's a long, sad story that starts even before the birth of our nation. In colonial days, as today, simple, free  video games were often used to drum up political support for one cause or another. No less a personage than Paul Revere, known primarily for his work as a silversmith and a newspaper publisher, also had a series of flash games designed as propaganda pieces against the British authority. His controversial side-scroller "The Boston Massacre" was wildly popular and is often credited as one of the key factors in drumming up anti-British sentiment.    The British also commissioned a much more expensive game called "The King's Army", an FPS that gave a romanticized, but semi realistic portrayal of life in His Majesty's army. unfortunately that game's online experience was quickly ruined by campers and griefers who sniped from the bushes instead of marching in straight lines. Regardless, the effect of these games and others like them was immeasurable, causing massive youth violence in the citizens of both nations.
<br/>
<br/>
 This problem reached it's peak during our nation's expansionist phase in the mid 1800s when an entire generation of youths, who had grown up on such titles as "Custer's Revenge" and "The Oregon Trail", took it upon themselves to slaughter entire tribes of native Americans. The natives, whose nomadic lifestyle caused them to prefer portable systems instead of home consoles, were overpowered and decimated to a minuscule fraction of their original population. The exact reasons for this crushing defeat will never be known for sure, but many experts believe that the reduced violence and less realistic graphics of their portable systems left them unprepared to deal with an onslaught of U.S. soldiers hardened by the more immersive and violent PC and console titles.
<br/>
<br/>
This pattern continued throughout the next century. Titles came and went, different genres became popular and then faded back into relative obscurity, but the ultimate result of all these video games was the same : Violence, and lots of it.
<br/>
<br/>
But then, just in time for the 1950s, crime dropped to record lows and, for a brief decade, created a nearly picture-perfect nation. The precise dynamics of this change is a hotly debated topic in academic circles, but the main point that most historians agree on is that in the mid 1940s people stopped playing and writing violent video games. It is widely believed that the sudden popularity of the television is responsible for this change. Another theory is that wartime shortages prevented the production of game disks and carts, and war-weary soldiers returning from Europe and Japan were too busy starting their new lives that they had little time to invest in an activity as addictive as video games. Whatever the cause, the end result was striking. By the year 1950 zero video games were being produced, and the art of creating them or even playing them was completely lost. Video games had become a distant, quickly fading memory, and America was entering a new glorious era of peace and prosperity.
<br/>
<br/>
Alas, This single bright period of our history when the black art of addictive video games was completely forgotten was not to last; In 1962 "SpaceWar" was invented at MIT, re-introducing the addictive video game to the American People and dooming our great nation to eternal violence.<br/>_________________<br/>-Andy L

That is one example of meaningful games, and if people want to not gain anything then they would need to play more silly games since they have nothing else better to do. ;)

Are you actually suggesting that people who plays video games doesn't understand that it would be more fun/thrilling/cool to drive a real sports car than a virtual one?
<br/>
Of all my friends (most people who play videogames actually have those too) noone of them would rather play a game involving sports cars than drive the real deal, that is far from the point.

Note to Warsong : Socrates was decidedly anti-censorship.  
<br/>
<br/>
According to Plato, Socrates was executed for encouraging young people to think and talk about ideas and thoughts that the conservative government believed was inappropriate or dangerous.
<br/>
<br/>
Socrates became a revered martyr for the cause of free speech and free expression of ideas.  
<br/>

?Anti-censorship??  Go post kid porn and see how far it gets you. See if you can win in courts. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Socrates says it clearly and if you disagree then that is your opinion. You can not break everything down. Break down censorship on topics to make people think not to talk about what is a total perversion. The point of freedom of speech as well was to let people be free to talk about things without being attacked and they knew where to draw the line on things that are not good. Almost all the founding fathers said bad things about a certain religious group, or race which they do not tell people in school and that there is censorship, which you would probably be against what they say too and not want them to talk.
<br/>
<br/>
Now if you think Socrates contradicts when he says "Pay attention to the young, and make them just as good as possible." He did not say do what you want and that it?s all good. And to think that you picked one point to attack and think you won is like a boxer getting hit 100 times and you land one weak blow and you cheer. Lol But the fact remains that you are still loosening despite that you ignore the many hits.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone seen the news how a mother tried to be cool and let the kids do whatever they want and she got in trouble for it? She had a court date but she was in a car accident and could not make it. You are probably saying poor women lol. Well she went into an accident for letting the kids do what they want by letting a 14 year old drive the car and the 3 kids and herself had to go to the hospital so the court date is postponed. She said she wanted to be a cool mom.

I'm pretty sure that as long as no actual children were involved in its production the courts usually (But not always) side with freedom on this one. It's not an experiment I'm particularly interested in doing, and besides I can't draw very well at all, so you're going to just have to try this one on your own.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, The courts don't enter into it.  We were discussing Socrates.   The courts didn't agree with Socrates either.  Remember?  I <span style="font-weight: bold">just</span> said he was executed for preaching anti-censorship and free speech.

<br/>
You quoted him saying "Pay attention to the young, and make them just as good as possible.". Fair enough.    But if you've knew anything about Socrates you'd realize you and he have completely different ideas about how to make children "as good as possible".  
<br/>
<br/>
Socrates believed in exposing children to as much as possible, (more than the law allowed) and letting them think and choose for themselves.
<br/>
<br/>
This is not even close to what you're advocating.

Of course not.  No one in their right mind would say you can do anything you like.

We're talking about freedom of to say or publish whatever you like.

However, lets take a moment to think about this.  I haven't read about this case, but according to you this woman ended up in the Hospital with injuries from an automobile accident indirectly caused by some sort of mental illness.  And you're berating me because you think I might feel sorry for this person?
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I hope that her injuries were not severe and that she receives whatever mental help she needs.  Why do I hope this? Because I'm a decent human being.

Are you actually suggesting that people who plays video games doesn't understand that it would be more fun/thrilling/cool to drive a real sports car than a virtual one?

Of all my friends (most people who play videogames actually have those too) noone of them would rather play a game involving sports cars than drive the real deal, that is far from the point.

Do you mean that you drive the same car as the president of Amazon? Or are you actually the president of Amazon?

The car example was for the other guy to get.
<br/>
<br/>
So you say kid porn should be ok? And if you can not have actual kids its ok that in the future people have computer generated graphics of kid porn to cater to people? Now that is twisted. Go ahead do it, if you think its ok either you make a lot of money pleasing perverts or you go to jail.  Obviously you have a twisted mind.
<br/>
<br/>
Do people have to tell you what is right and wrong for you to know? What next, you will defend a person that kills and their plea is that they didn?t know the law. Lol
<br/>
<br/>
Too much freedom takes away freedom if you didn?t know. But I would guess you don't know that. As for Socrates he said ?everything to moderation? but so many don't know where the moderate level is. Just because he says a saying or his action seems to go against it does not mean that the things he said or did is above the other saying and it does not contradict his other saying since his saying give limits or guidance for you to know what to do. If you only choose one thing and ignore the rest it would be like only driving with your steering wheel to the left and you will just go around in circles as you are now.
<br/>
<br/>
You say to let kids be exposed to everything but then you and the other complain about its parent?s responsibility. I guess the parents that have the messed up kids think the same as you to let the kids be exposed to everything. If you don't give kids guidance they will go all over the place or driving in a circle. Make up your mind what you want to choose because so far you believe your own BS. I think you like to play too much and maybe you do know what is right and you are just playing the devils advocate, or maybe I am giving you too much credit to think that.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the thing you did not get. We are supposed to break censorship so that we can talk about things to help make our lives better. We should not say we are breaking down censorship to perverse life. Politicians about politics to get the truth out. But now freedom is to have the freedom to destroy lives then help lives. But that is another topic which is not suitable for a game site, since I would get in trouble which is BS. Everyone says they are for freedom of speech but are against it when the view it does not side with their own.
<br/>
<br/>
You say you wish people can shut their mouths, but I say I encourage the person that disagrees. It is boring when they agree and the person acts like Seinfeld and say ?I know, what?s the deal with it?.
<br/>
<br/>
You stopped debating and I was just flexing. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
As for parenting Kids need guidance. You have parents say they don't want to be strict and let their 8 year old play GTA unattended. The thing is not about being strict it is about helping the child to be focused more and most parents are afraid of that because of a negative word. I know kids that their parents do not let their kids play ay games and they are one of the top speed readers in the state and get high marks in schools, other start their own business young, others are just more happy, etc. People are as loose in mentality as the as the $!#%$ they go with. Obviously I am not saying that people should not play any games but most people over do it and many games do not give back but make people be in a worse predicament. I know some dedicated gamers that play games over 12 times a day and they are not doing well. The mind gets addicted to thing as simple as games it seems.
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously this information will not help you APL since you ignore it but what I say is directed to others that read it.

<br/>
Allow me to clarify.   I believe that the parent has the right to make the ultimate decision as to what their child is exposed to. If the parent wants to be a crazy puritan such as yourself and not expose the child to anything, that's the parent's right.  But it is the parent's responsibility to enforce their morals on their own children.     
<br/>
No one gets to decide what is media OK for someone else's child.  And <span style="font-weight: bold">especially</span> no one gets to decide what media is OK for adults such as myself.

As for your 'views', do you realise you are posting on gbadev.org? Primarily a GBA (and now DS) home-brew development site. Who do you expect to reach with your 'Game Designer's, Don't be Drug Dealers' rant?  The majority of people here are no doubt hobby-ists who wouldn't have the time or resources to make the kinds of game you are talking about even if they wanted to. OK - I'm sure there are a few pro designers and programmers here but these will be primarily GBA/DS people, and again I don't think these platforms have the kinds of games you mean (i.e. GTA). I hardly think you are reaching the right kind of audience here that you want to. Maybe you should be posting on gamasutra or something. But seeing as you can't even convince us that you know what you are talking about, let alone that you are in the right, I would strongly suggest you think twice before posting there.
<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, your posts are a little hard to read. It may be a little easier to understand and agree with you if you tidy up your grammar a little, remove seemingly random phrases ('Too much freedom takes away freedom' - did you just make this up???), and stop with the darn Socrates quotes!!!!!!

People most likely won?t get directly corrupt by game, but kids can be influenced in a negative way.

The average adult plays over 7.5 hour per week (which is a lot),43% play online games, 35% of gamers are under 18, MMORPG players play on average about 22 hours per week

You talk about not quoting Socrates but how about what they felt and did what was right? They felt that leisure time should be used to better ones self and learn new things which that was the definition of leisure time originally. But it has been turned around to be used to slack off too much which is the opposite meaning. 
<br/>
<br/>
?Leisure is the highest use of time. It is the antithesis of "wasting time" or "killing time" with diversions and amusements. Nor is it rest and relaxation; the downtime we need to recover from work should really be considered an extension of work.?  Lol 
<br/>
I will post about this separately.

Haven?t you played the video game version of stratego 1&amp;2?

The last big pc game I beat was Y?s 3. Detailed artwork. ;)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've only read the first few and last few pages of this thread, but let me add my 2 cents.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everybody is completely right in saying they have the right to choose for themselves what they wish to play or experience or learn.  Even if I think a particular choice is bad, I do not have the right to take away another person's freedom to make the choice and choose what I believe is bad.
<br/>
<br/>
But the matter of the thread, and what Warsong originally stated in the very first post, can be more eloquently summed up:  not as "you should not have the right to choose bad things", but "Who are the people who actually create the choices in the first place?"
<br/>
<br/>
It is one thing to choose something bad.  It is another to create something bad for someone else to choose.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edmund Spenser, the author of the literary epic, the Faerie Queen (I believe it was an King Arthurian-based epic), wrote in his opening to Sir Phillip Sydney, that the reason he wrote his epic, and spent all those years creating his work, was so that he could make something _good_ that would actually have a good effect on those who made use of it.  Sir Phillip wrote A Defense of Poesy in which he defended secular poetry from the Catholic Church, who basically argued that it had nothing but a bad influence, because Phillip believed that poets could still create good works of art.
<br/>
<br/>
If I am a game developer, or an artist, or anything, I want to make something that I think is good, and will have a good effect on someone who plays, reads, or sees it.  To intentionally create something bad is to waste my time, and waste the time of those who experience it.  Spenser says he wrote his work to help the reader become a better person by observing what it is like to be a good and noble man.  While this is obviously a little bit grand for the standard puzzle game or platformer, the basic idea is the same.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you can argue that what I say is "bad", the creator believes it is a good thing.  You could assume at this point my argument is worthless.  But there's more.
<br/>
<br/>
Compare, for example, the recent Johnny Cash movie, to GTA.  They both feature, in this case, evidence of a drug counterculture and those who get themselves wrapped up in it (I'm not specifically discussing violence or sexual themes here, as I don't think it applies to the JC/GTA comparison).  But in the movie, you can argue and in fact conclude that the overall theme of the story is not the dark side of Cash's life, but the redemption that he finds.
<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing inherently wrong with the idea of sex, or the idea of violence, and I suppose even drugs are just that:  just substances.  They all have effects.  But in their portrayal in a media, and in themes like them, you have to ask:  what is the purpose of expressing a theme?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't really know what the purpose or the theme of GTA is.  I've watched friends play it, and it looks like a decent game, but I know little of the story other than the fact that it's got Sam Jackson and lets me tick off the US Army if I kill enough officers.
<br/>
<br/>
So I haven't seen the ending.  I hear in one of the games they do an artistic throwback to a Scarface movie (or was it the Godfather)?  I actually imagine such an artistic salute could be a good and decent thing, and of course many could argue that this game in fact has an art to it.
<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, you must decide for yourself, first, what are the ideas that are expressed in a medium, and second, what is the theme?
<br/>
<br/>
Good ideas don't make a good product.  And good themes can be overshadowed by the ideas involved in the experience (such as the violence of GTA).
<br/>
<br/>
If GTA was an uplifting tragedy where the protagonist reformed his life at the end, would I buy it for my children?  No.  But I'd think about it slightly differently:  I'd see it as a story with a theme I appreciate rather than an experience about violence for its own sake.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now of course, you don't have to look for every product or experience you buy to "uplift" you in some way.  Obviously there are many products that sell well despite this ...ah, the sins of business.  But, if I must make something, I want it to have such a good theme.  I think that is what Warsong is trying to say.
<br/>
<br/>
It is not a perfect world, and of course "good" doesn't always sell, and people don't always buy "good".  But if I have a choice as to what I want to create, I want to create good.
<br/>
<br/>
I believe Warsong wanted to hint at that if you could see the results of the actions of exposing people to either a good, or a bad, influencing experience, then you could conclude that a gamemaker should have some responsibility for what he does.
<br/>
<br/>
This is our counterargument, equally valid:  that it is the parent or the person's responsibility for what s/he experiences.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I do not mean to say that I believe gamemakers must accept the responsibility for what they do:  I mean to say, that I think gamemakers, ideally, should <span style="font-style: italic">gladly</span> want and accept the opportunity to make a good thing.  This is a personal thing and I can't impose it on anyone else, like all the other choices.  But I think this is what the topic was about.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
