    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey first post wooo.
<br/>
<br/>
anyway i was just wondering if theres anyone working on anything Golden Sun related.
<br/>
<br/>
And now for the pros and genius on this board:
<br/>
<br/>
Whats the best way to approach starting a project on a GBA. Its a great RPG and theres very little been done to it wereas Pokemon has been ripped apart by modders
<br/>
<br/>
I knew basic C++ and have been using Dev-C++, I also downloaded MinGW and installed it but i havent a clue how it works i cant seem to figure out how to run it as theres no .exe
<br/>
<br/>
thanks:)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The best way is to not start with an RPG.  Everyone and their uncle shows up as bright-eyed noobies and wants to make an RPG.  But RPGs are big and hard enough that it's not going to happen.  Your best bet, if you want to write stuff for gba, is to start with small stuff, make some cheesy little games (space invaders, tetris, pong, etc) and get some experience, then gradually move up to something more complicated. 
<br/>
<br/>
And if you want to start a project that would involve multiple people, you need to do your homework first:  put together a compelling tech demo or design doc.  The more you have to show that  you can complete projects, the more likely someone will be to work with you.

There's not one particular exe like visual studio has.  Instead, write your code using any editor in a text file, then use the executable files in the /bin directory of MinGW and devkitARM to compile your code.  Really, if you use the example makefile provided, the only thing you really usually need to use yourself is make.exe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1) Customization tools?
<br/>
2) Are you talking about reverse engineering aspects Golden Sun / a technical analysis of the ROM / data?
<br/>
3) Some sort of a fan based Golden Sun project from scrach?
<br/>
4) An original RPG project from scrach?
<br/>
<br/>
These are all very different things.
<br/>
#1 is off topic on this forum.
<br/>
#2 is only somewhat on topic„ÄÅi.e. "how can I reproduce XYZ effect?" is a reasonable question, but dumping item tables, etc is not.
<br/>
Projects like #3 and #4 are what this forum is about, although RPG projects are non-trivial.  Feel free to use the search function of the forum for more information... I don't have time for a long rant right now.  =)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Haha I'm so glad I read this topic. My first idea was to develop an RPG as I'm a big Golden Sun fan... so Golden Sun is a big influence my idea concept. It's interesting how it's a 2D world yet it gives the illusion of being 3D with special sprite positions and motions (one good example is the movement of sprites during battles). I have no idea where to start but I guess I'll start with something simple and build up... but I still need to work on my C++ a lot before I even get there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But if you do, please don't post the demo here.  We've only got about a thousand unfinished "opening scene in the player character's house" demos that you can download from this site. ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hahaha alright! I guess I've forgotten that's it's the same with almost every other development scene, not just GBA/NDS Developing. No matter where you go, 99.9% of the time you need to think small first and progress from there. I'll try and avoid being a stereotypical newbie and posting a "demo" which totally sucks ass and never even blossoms into a complete game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Making demo's and protypes is good, just make sure you comment these as well as you can, with the aim of producing more efficient and better designed code in the future. Much can be learned at trying to tackle many of the small things; such as (basic) animation sequences.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
