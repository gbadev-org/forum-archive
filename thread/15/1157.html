    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is this free online MMORPG called Rangarok Online.
<br/>
<br/>
Though it is fun it can be boring and just plain nasty, the reason I am making this topic is to point out the bad things in the hope others will do as well and means to fix them. I always have found that you can learn more about creating a good game if you have seen a bad one.
<br/>

<br/>
First thing is the 3d envourement with 2d sprites. They tried to create the classic RPG feel with having Zelda/FinalFantasy-ish 2d sprites. However they also wanted spiffin 3d envourements. Now I often am irritated by not being able to look further into the distance and I am also irritated by the fact that at one point there was a statue wich I was not able to see because the camera wouldt go that way cuz then the sprites would look out of place.
<br/>
<br/>
In games like Phantasy Star Online or Final Fantasy you often need to have a lot of exp points in order to defeat a boss but you are allowed to make your own judgement if you are ready or that you need to level up. However in order to get a certain job as a character in this game you NEED to just mindlessly level up in order for you to complete the quest.
<br/>
<br/>
In other RPG's there are a lot of items for you to regain your health wich arent hard to find. However the only items you can get easily to regain health are to be found inside of monsters. There are lots of items for you to regain health, trouble is there are too many. In Final Fantasy you have potions, high potions and another potion wich fulls the HP bar, in Phantasy Star Online you also have several versions of the same item to regain health. However in Ragnarok Online you have lots of food wich isnt very orderly and can keep you guessing to the effects of an item.
<br/>
<br/>
There is one easy trick though to regain health and that is to sit put and do nothing but wait. This is very boring, I often go to the toilet or watch some TV during it because I cannot wait.  It is very irritating that this is meant to be the main way to get your health back up.
<br/>
<br/>
In the other MMORPG that I have played (Phantasy Star Online) you often make friends and you really have the feeling that your online. However in Ragnarok Online players almost dont chat with eachother, usually it stays with a small hello and then they walk their seperate ways. In Phantasy Star Online there are only 4 players and you benefit from staying close to eachother, so the chatting comes naturally since it isnt too crowded and you stay together through convience and basic level architecture.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus in the beginning they explain way too much, you want to play and you have to keep listning to them explain stuff. A game should be easy to pick up and play and if it isnt it should be explained during the gameplay.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I could try to sum up more or ways for fixing them but then it wouldt be much of a discussion ;). Do you know some other bad points about the game or how to fix the stuff I have brought forth?<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Play adom or nethack for a couple of weeks.  Your first dozen or more characters will die super fast.  Don't feel bad looking a spoilers.  Once you can keep characters alive long enough to have adventures compare and contrast the either of the above with ragnorak.

<br/>
Or don't do any of this at all. =P

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That doesn't make Ragnarok any better of a game :P. Besides you can't die in this one.
<br/>
<br/>
I think it is bad for a character to die in a MMORPG, how else can you get really strong in a game if you die early on? A normal RPG ok, but not a MMORPG.<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This game is also very unbalanced, I am now at a point where I either have to kill lots of small monsters wich are very easy to kill or fight monsters wich kill me in a couple of blows without me standing much of a chance of surviving.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus you walk around a lot with no monster to fight, just looking around for one. Wich gets boring real fast.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Can someone else help disecting this game? I am better off apearantly doing it myself instead of helping guys here avoid such gameplay errors since no one else helps me.<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I hope these advertisements and screens that say things about the website and stuff are temp since its in beta, really brings down the mood. It crashed my computer, only because I have some RAM problem. My windows XP wont start, and some games make my screen have lines up and down all accross in different colors.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry, I should have warned that they lack a graphical component.  Tiled versions of nethack exist.  The tiles are not animated.  I'm not sure if tiled versions of adom exist.
<br/>
<br/>
Both adom and nethack are similar (to eachother) and neither is online.  Many of the complaints above seemed relevant to game design in general as opposed to mmorpg's specifically.  Some of the mentioned game features ragnorak overlap with adom/nethack, but the mechanics are quite differnent.  These game mechanics seem to be handled quite well by adom/nethack.  Naturally anything regarding networked play or graphics more advanced than simple tiles simply don't apply.
