    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Going to be developing a small demo to start off my gba coding, or at least to accomplish something with it, and im starting off a little demo of catching vertically falling objects. How does this game concept sound... It's based off of the TEA TIME bonus round in Marshcen Cotton 100% (one of my personal favorite games) but along with bonus and super bonus teabags, itll also have exploding ones that will knock your points way down and hurt you. How does that sound for a demo?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can't say I know the game which you are referring to, but simple arcade games like the one you are describing usually make for good tutorials/demos, because you can incrementally add new features and complexity to them.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, once you've got the base engine working you might decide you want to add a way to catch powerups of some sort. Or you may want to experiment with animation techniques for the status display. Or you may decide to give it a scrolling backdrop. Or make a boss-teabag appear every five rounds. Or who knows what. Point is that you can start off with coding a very simple engine and add complexity to it as you see fit.
