    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anybody have a list of the "Official GBA Rules" that a GBA game must follow? Mostly nitpicky things by Nintendo like "game must have a title screen with a 'Press Start to Continue'" or "must have sound volume option" stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, GBADev and DevKitPro rules. After a couple small hiccups, it's working perfectly fine with C++ and XCode.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I'll release my project when it's finished. It's a school project, not something I actually intend to submit or a publisher or anything. I'm just curious about what's required.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What is required is that it doesn't mess up the unit, and that you can't sell junk. It doesn't matter if you don't publish through Nintendo, but it is recomended it doesn't mess up anyways.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The phrase you're looking for is "lot check", the name of Nintendo's software qualification process. I haven't seen the official lot check guidelines, but I'll give you a few samples of what I've gleaned from commercial games for several Nintendo systems:
<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, the Control Pad should always be called the Control Pad, not the arrow keys or directional pad or D-pad or anything else. Buttons should be called "<a class="postlink" href="http://buttonz.ytmnd.com/" target="_blank">buttons</a>"; "keys" are objects that unlock "doors".
<br/>
<br/>
Yanking the cartridge shouldn't completely corrupt the save. (Use some transactional method if you can, or just use an Animal Crossing style last-known-good system.)
<br/>
<br/>
In menus, A goes forward and B goes backward.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Mario Kart Super Circuit</span> doesn't have "PRESS START"; it goes straight to a menu.
<br/>
<br/>
In Japan you PUSH a button, but in North America you PRESS it.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are <a class="postlink" href="http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:lGWge7XTeJcJ:www.isplash.de/koteshi/gcn/GCN_Newsletter6.pdf+nintendo+%22lot+check%22+guidelines&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=7&amp;client=firefox" target="_blank">GameCube guidelines</a> which may be useful as to what to expect.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<span style="font-style: italic">Mario Kart DS</span>, whose gameplay uses only the traditional Control Pad and buttons, doesn't use whatever drag is called.  <span style="font-style: italic">Meteos</span> uses only language related to the effects within the game, assuming that the player can infer how to "slide" pieces up and down.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll be honest and admit that I don't know what the English word is.  I'll also be honest and admit that I don't see how it matters, either.  Create your own guidelines for own image.  Use somebody else's guideline when you release something under their system.

Yes, this certainly applies to Kirby: Canvas Curse. (awesome game, BTW)<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
