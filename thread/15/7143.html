    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had been coding a Final Fantasy VI-esque game but now that Square has announced they will be releasing both FF IV and VI, I do not particularly want to continue this path as I can just play theirs.  
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of maybe shifting to a card game (I have a Euchre game on PC I could port) or working on a mini-golf game.  
<br/>
<br/>
Anybody have any good ideas for a game type that is lacking on the GBA?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you were making the game for the learning experience instead of just having Final Fantasy VI on the GBA, I'd say keep going. Nothing better than to give people a little taste of what is to come out beforehand.  =P

Along these lines, if someone were to port over a game like that (or even just a demo of it), would there be some complicated legal issues to deal with?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Using the real graphics, yes.  Having peeked at the source, mose likely.

Under the radar?  Probably.  I like the ADOM liscence's 'I'll sue you if I deem you worthy' for copyright issues.
