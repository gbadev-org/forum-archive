Second, does anybody know of an easy way to put one on the GBA without throwing thousands of dollars around?  I think it would be neat to make games that could be played by blind people.

A Parappa style gameplay? pretting the buttons according to the melody to get a highscore. With of course the music getting faster and faster accordingly, might not be nice music but i'd be fun to play.

You actually might not need a voice synthesizer for it, but to me using actual voice in a game must be either done by a voice actor or if you are going to use voice synthesis you have to have emotions, or otherwise to me it would be lame. I personally always have to have some kind of emotion to be involved in it, if it would be a robot voice saying things in the same tone without any kind of defiance, emotion or other change in it i wouldt know if i would like it.<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was referring to the genre of games they could play. And I was also noting that a blind person would need to be paying attention to audio, since he has little or no vision, while a capable person has both of those input streams available for him. Even in a living room setting, he'd most likely need someone in there to tend to him, and having the volume up would block his ability to hear what his helper might have to say.

<br/>
They can find there way around the house with ease and know how to operate a radio for example withotu help from someone else so I dont think they need someone to help them operate a GBA.

Never played parappa, but I have played DDR.  There was another press the button the music game as well.  Sighted people rely on visual input to sync the button presses in both cases.

The goal is not to include voice synthesis in order to make the game more interesting for sighted people, but rather to make it playable by blind people.

<br/>
Have you ever listened to a voice synthesizer?  A lot people that can not talk use them.  They do sound robotic, but serve as a means of communication.
<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to have the function that text plays replaced by a voice synthesizer, and create the equivalent of a text intensive game.  The text fed to the screen would want to be fed to an interal buffer that the voice synthesizer would "read" from.
<br/>
<br/>
I think that an RPG could probably be created.  The map would have to be navigated using a sonar like device.  The story, moves, etc would have to be presented using the voice synthesizer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's lots of fun stuff you could do with audiogames.
<br/>
<br/>
A text adventure would translate easily.
<br/>
The game speaks describing the current situation, and maps options to cursor + A + B.   For example:
<br/>
<br/>
"You are in a small room.  To the west is an wooden door.  To the north is an open window.  There is a table here with a casette recorder on it.  Press "A" to play the tape.  Press "Left" to open the door.  Press "North" to climb out the window."
<br/>
<br/>
As far as action, something like Space Channel 5 would work nicely - it doesn't rely much on visual context.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i actually started coding a voice synth for gba a while ago, i was porting it from a really old quickbasic source i had on my hd for a while. I didnt get very far as back then i coudlnt figure out when a directsound sample was finsihed playing so i could play the next sample, and i was very impatient with my coding back then, so it turned into vaporware, and since then i've formattted my hd at least a couple times. but, it was very possible to do, there was maybe 30 or so different samples, one for each different kind of sound i guess, and it made words by linking them together, and it worked quite well, it sounded almost the same as stephen hawking's synth to tell you the truth. if anyone wants to try this out, search google for qbasic speech or something, i remember the source was called speech.bas, and it had 30 some wav files and stuff like that. i remember i recoded it in visual basic before i started with gba. i might be able to dig up that source i might have that and/or the gba source burnt on a cd somewhere. very possible tho, i dont know how practical it would be, obviously if you're blind or watever, the gba is not suited for you, and no software for it will change that.
