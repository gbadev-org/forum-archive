Since you're new here, would you mind if we use you as a gineua pig? Some of us here on the boards are talking about the bad habits in the Pern Project and gbajunkie tutorials and tepples has decided to make a new set. Tell us what you think should be in the tutorial, since you would would be the ones learning from it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Btw, there is already a tutorial set free of most of the bad habits, though I may have made it a little too complicated for beginners. Care to be a vict^H^H^H^Hvoluteer for testing there as well?
