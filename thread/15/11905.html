    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been working on making a clone of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamedesign.jp/flash/dice/dice.html" target="_blank">dicewars</a> on the DS.  
<br/>
<br/>
The problem I am running into is figuring how to make the map.  I have some ideas as but they don't quite make a map as nice looking at was dicewars has.
<br/>
<br/>
I am currently using a hex sprite as a template to draw to an 8bit background.  I plan on doing it this way so I can easily change the color of a tile to be drawn.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It looks like they are using a fat brush to paint the areas.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd select some a place near the middle of the map, and
<br/>
mark it as the home cell.  Expand that area until it is "big
<br/>
enough".
<br/>
<br/>
Next select a bunch of random points on the map.
<br/>
Sort them based on proximity to the home area.
<br/>
Connect them in order.  If the point has already
<br/>
been drawn on by the time you get to it, skip it and
<br/>
move on.

<br/>
  move_in_random_direction();
<br/>
  for (each cell in brush)
<br/>
    if (EMPTY != map[cell])
<br/>
      map[cell] = brush_color;
<br/>
}</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

You might want to move the brush toward home until
<br/>
the area connects, and then randomize movement after
<br/>
that if the area needs to be extended.

I think if I combine the observations I have seen (territory distributions) with the principles behind the <a class="postlink" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Coloured_Voronoi_2D.png" target="_blank">Voronoi diagram</a> I can get something that works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
