This game was released in 1982.
<br/>
It was one of the first 3D FPS, and by far the best.
<br/>
It's gameplay is unmatched.
<br/>
Those who have played it over 20+ years ago became so devoted to it that many of them have replayed it on emulators just to beat it.  Some have ported it to the x86 from the coco.  It has a large fan-base because it is extremely fun to play.
<br/>
<br/>
Being created in 1982, it is also very simple to port.  It uses black &amp; white graphics and simple sound.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to ask the programmers here to download it's PC port and learn from it, get inspiration, and consider porting it to the GBA.

<br/>
There is already a forum devoted to Daggorath game development, but no one has taken on the task of porting it to GBA.

It's sourcecode is available from the author and the license is very liberal.

If you decide to play this game, you will not be able to play it w/out reading the instructions which are here:

This game originally fitted on 16k rom.

<br/>
It should be a very small and easy port for the GBA.  I'd do it myself if I could code worth a damn.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's a bit tricky! I couldn't figure out what to do for ages, attacking seems totally random and the controls are not exactly intuitive.... a GBA port would be doable, but a bit of care would have to be taken on the UI front, I imagine it could play a bit like Dungeon Master or Eye of The Beholder.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'll have to download it and give the thing a try...

Thanks for posting the game. It wouldn't be hard to port, but the keyboard interface is pretty important to the "feel" of the game, at least to people like me who remember the original.
<br/>
<br/>
Ah... I'll have to share that with some friends.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Using the keyboard to type in commands to make the user do things was an important element.  I agree wit this.  I believe they feel can be reproduced using menus and GBA buttons.  Instead of "A L&lt;ENTER&gt;" for "Attack with the weapon in the Left hand"  maybe &lt;SELECT&gt;&lt;A&gt;&lt;RIGHT&gt; would have a similar effect.  Pressing &lt;SELECT&gt; could bring up a menu where the player can choose Attack as a command, which would be the first option, the default, then select it with the &lt;A&gt; button &amp; then choose which hand by pressing either &lt;RIGHT&gt; or &lt;LEFT&gt; on the directional keypad.  So instead of quickly typing in A L &lt;ENTER&gt;, the player will quickly press &lt;SEL&gt;&lt;A&gt;&lt;RIGHT&gt; repeatedly.  The directional keypad might as well be the movement keys.  There can be a a virtual keyboard menu for encanting the rings.  I think it really is possible to do it while keeping the original feel of the game.  I think this game would easily be the best home-brew GBA game ever made if it was made.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
