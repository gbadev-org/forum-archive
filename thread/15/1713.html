    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there.
<br/>
<br/>
About to have a crack at a soccer game and i'm having trouble trying to think of a GOOD control system for the players.
<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if anyone has any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Depends on the style really. Arcadey football games should have their controls as simple as possible. One button for slide tackle, header, shoot and pass worked exceptionally well in Sensible Soccer - the console versions spoilt the balance by adding needless complexity IMO. 
<br/>
<br/>
For "simulation" style footy games the controls can be more complex, providing it isn't just complexity for the sake of it. Winning Eleven, for example, has different pass types (through balls, one-twos, long passes), different tackling style (last gasp slide tackles/shoulder to shoulder pressure) allows you to sprint or just jog, etc etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd aim for a simple control scheme at first (1 or 2 buttons and limited features) and add things as you get a better idea of what you want to do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was going to try a simulation one as i have kinda made an arcadey one before.
<br/>
<br/>
But i actually dug out sensi soccer on my amiga the other nite and loved it.  So I reckon i will go with an arcade one again. 
<br/>
<br/>
I reckon i'll go with a 2 button setup as i like to have big kick and pass seperate and i also like to have slide and header seperate so i can start headers before the ball is off the ground.

Cheers mate.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
