Most of the biggest game designers around are programmers (e.g. John Carmack, Tim Sweeney, Chris Roberts, Richard Garriot, Sid Meier), so you should learn how to write good code and go from there.  I mean, none of these guys got anywhere by saying, "Hey, I've got a great idea for a game.  Who wants to implement it for me?"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

However he is right, aren't fan games allowed? Or is that just something like our dutch drugs policy.
<br/>
<br/>
Say like the big guys from the game allow us, but it's not legal?
<br/>
<br/>
Anywayz, perhaps i can be off assistance.
<br/>
i know some gba coding and can do gfx well, but i never played halo.
<br/>
And i am not clear about what your are willing to do exaclty with the gfx,
<br/>
just rip or redraw?<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ripping gfx is a bad plan. Making a game with entirely original content based on the Halo universe/characters is reasonable under fair use; it's fan fiction, really. =) Taking a single image from Bungie's game is not.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This may seem like a silly question, but why be derivative and limit the potential of your project, when you can be original and free from any legal encumbrances?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying you need to be "different" in terms of fundamentals, but your own characters, your own sprites, your own title, etc. shouldn't be too hard to manufacture. Or to find someone out on the Internet to manufacture for you. (The world seems to be mercifully weighted in favour of the artistically challenged like myself such that the artists vastly outnumber the coders.)
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if when all is said and done all you want to do is make a fan-tribute, then you may as well go for it. It just seems to me that programming a game is a massive undertaking; making it an original work is a very minor portion of the work considering the benefits earned.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, I am in the process of making a Sonic the hedgehog game for the GBA/GP32 ive made my own engine for it and it has to be said that it looks ok at this early stage. Ive created all my own sprites/graphics and MIDI's for the game hence i cant see why i could get in trouble for making it as long as i dont distribute it for profits. 
<br/>
<br/>
As for a Halo inspired platformer its a very good idea and i would be willing to help. However if i were to even consider it i want to see your game design documents or at least some solid plans as i wouldnt want to be wasting my time coding something that is never going to get finished or hasnt been thought through.

If you have them could you send them to my email adress please?
