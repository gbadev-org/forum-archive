    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First hi to all since its our first post in here!..
<br/>
<br/>
 We are group of ppl who are animation students and multimedia designers.   We have  been working  on our  game project for a year.Which is based  for mobile platforms.We had reached to a point  now  and we need some feedback.
<br/>
<br/>
   Game is a turn-based  rpg based on cards and card trading(FF tactics, Yu Gi Oh) with a  branching story and 2 endings.We had finished the  design document for battle system.Also main branches of the story had been completed.
<br/>
   Some  artwork and story baords also  done for the main character(s)and cards.
<br/>
    But now we reached to a point where we cat go any further since we cant get any feedback.We also lack of programmers in here(Turkey) so we cant make a demo and tests for the game.
<br/>
    So what we ask now is what we should do from this point...we have  detailed design document  for battle and story as i mentioned before and  concept art.Should we send it to game companies?Or anyone here who may want to help us with programming and creating a demo for the battle system?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unless this idea is the greatest idea in the world I can almost guarantee a company you send it to won't really care about it. It's best to start working on the game and have a working demo with some promising features in it. If you are planning to make it for the GBA, it really isn't too hard to learn programming and also specific to the GBA. I would suggest reading various tutorials and documents found on gbadev.org.
<br/>
<br/>
You may find some willing programmers on this forum, if not gamedev.net happens to have a lot of aspiring programmers wanting to join projects. Some however have not too much experience so becareful who you chose.
<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you got a great start with your game. Don't be discouraged and keep on trying to make it a complete game.
<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well  thanx for the reply...
<br/>
i guess all we can  do is now publishing a detalied info about the game on net to attract some more attention.
<br/>
<br/>
 i thought companies may show some  attention to the project since it  has a  design document and some artworks.But we lack of a running demo of the game..And what we want actually selling the project.We dont want to involve in the programming section or developing the rest of it.We are animation  and multimedia artists and none of us have any skill in programming nor have time to learn it from beginning...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well if that is what you would like to do I'd recommend persuing it futher. I don't know how many gaming companies are in Turkey but I imagine not that many. In order to present your idea to a company you probably will need to do it in person. Once again I urge you to persue this if you are absolutely confident that your game will be a good game many people would buy.
<br/>
<br/>
I know a small company and they are currently looking for a publisher however they can't get one because all the publishers they talked to at the Game Developers Conference and E3 were only interested in complete games. They had demos and a complete game design. From what I saw of their game design it looks like a really interesting and fun game that would possibly sell as much as publishers would want. However currently they are without a publisher because no one wants to take on some extra small game developer studio.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't be discouraged, if it doesn't work out now, keep on pushing until it does. You could also hire programmers and have them write the game while you create the art, story, and music (if you can compose music). Once this game is pretty much finished you could seek a publisher and possibly get it published. There will be times of high risk doing it this way because if you don't get it published you won't be making a lot of money real soon.
<br/>
<br/>
One last idea that came to me was possibly get employed as graphic artists and writers and eventually work on your game when given a chance if a few years because first you would have to work on other games.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd say give it a shot, show it to companies and get their feedback. It's really useful because then you could improve your design and find what you lack and for the next company you show it to perhaps they may want to take on your game.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My advice is to work with a british (preferably london based) developer to develop the code and engines within the next 2/3 months. <a href="http://www.ects.com" target="_blank">http://www.ects.com</a> is the trade show where there may be a chance to get your idea heard
<br/>
<br/>
There are other opportunities, but just find some small teams who are working for open source or something ?!?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">again thanx  for the info and links....
<br/>
<br/>
  We cant go any further now in here Turkey because game industry is in primal state here.There arent any  game developers, publishers and programmers who have experience in game industry.All we can do is designing game on paper and creating concept work...
<br/>
 What we thought  is after  completing the full design document and main artworks  we plan to  open a site for it.Since with some visual elements and with a better presentation we think we may get some attention and reaction to  it...
<br/>
   Also  ina few days i will post the high concept document in here, gamedev.org  and garagegames...
<br/>
  So if anyone interested pls check it...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
