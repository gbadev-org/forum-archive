    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm toying with the text system for my RPG... the problem with the GBA is the squat screen makes it difficult to display more than a few lines of text. I think I'd <span style="font-style: italic">really</span> like to manage four, though, which puts it back on par with the SNES RPGs.
<br/>
<br/>
Without telling me to get another font (I like this one), have a look at the following two images and tell me what you think:

<br/>
<br/>
(Ignore the status-bars at the top of the screen; this is intended for the travel mode.)
<br/>
<br/>
The first one includes an extra pixel leading between lines for a more spaced-out effect, but means the window takes more space and obscures the bottom quater of sprites at the centre of the window.
<br/>
<br/>
The second one is a much less-imposing window (8 pixels shorter), but the lines are forced together much more compactly (no leading between lines). I included a couple of the taller glyphs from the font (the parentheses) so you could see them touching.
<br/>
<br/>
Keeping in mind that the window can appear on the upper or lower half of the screen depending on the circumstances, which do you prefer? Or would you just tell me to bite the bullet and go with a three-line system?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I say lose the leading. The font seems perfectly legible in the 2nd version. (Although it might be easier to judge with a paragraph of typical text in there rather than "Line 1, Line 2")
<br/>
<br/>
The 1st one feels too claustophobic to me.
<br/>
<br/>
So when are you going to have a complete demo ready to share? Looking forward to it...

Hopefully the demo will be ready in the next couple of months, but I'm not holding my breath.
<br/>
<br/>
When the time comes, I'll be posting for useability/beta testers, so you can feel free to keep an eye out for it.
<br/>
<br/>
I think I will do the smaller window and see how it goes with the four-line system. I can always reduce it to three if need be.

(There is always supertransparency, but I don't know how good it would look with an entire backdrop layer.)

    <h4>#20299 - poslundc - Thu May 06, 2004 7:08 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My engine allows arbitrary positioning of the camera (as opposed to Mode 7 games that use a fixed camera pitch and distance), which means I need to be able to show fog on any scanline where the camera is sufficiently distant from the ground.
<br/>
<br/>
Even if this weren't the case, there is a need to show much larger windows than the standard "text" window for menus, choosing spells, etc. so I can't rely on restricting the windows to being on the bottom third of the screen.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can't you dynamically set the "cutoff point", depending on how high the text goes?  Granted, I've never used any hblank interrupts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#20303 - poslundc - Thu May 06, 2004 7:50 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The point is that on any given scanline the effects register can only be doing one thing. If the fog suddenly stops in order to make a window translucent, it would look very awkward.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, not all windows consume the entire width of the screen.
