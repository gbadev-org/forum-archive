Yesterday (14th february 2009) I got a great idea: I should do my own Pok?mon game! I have tried before, but I'm much better on programming now.
<br/>
<br/>
My plan is that I program the game in a language that I understand fully enough. In this case it should be GML (Game Maker Language) in the program Game Maker 7.0. Then, when I have learned to program and make games to GBA, I convert the GML code to C code and compile and all that stuff that creates a GBA game.
<br/>
<br/>
This topic is my development topic. Here you can give me ideas to the game, and it's here I post the news of the game.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: normal">Pok?mon Transparency</span></span>
<br/>
The name of the game will be Pok?mon Transparency. All Pok?mon games have a color or stone in its name, but transparency is not a color or stone, it is the opposit of a color.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Pok?dex</span></span>
<br/>
The game will have a Pok?dex with a total of 150 Pok?mon, like Pok?mon Red and Blue, the first Pok?mon games. There will be three start Pok?mon, one GRASS type, one FIRE type and one WATER type, just like the other games.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: normal">This is what you can do</span></span>
<br/>
You can give me help and ideas. Just now I need this:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">City names</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't need so very much at this time, I have just started on planning the game. But if you have tips, just post it!</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I don't work with this idea anymore. Look in the topic if you wonder why.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by bollkalle on Tue Feb 17, 2009 3:55 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

That step may give you some problems.
<br/>
<br/>
Code does not really convert between the game design engine and a real programming language. You'd end up having to completely rewrite your whole game, which defeats the purpose of writing it with Game Design to begin with.
<br/>
<br/>
You'd be much better off pointing your efforts towards learning C/C++ up front, unless you're not really worried about ever making this a GBA game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It sounds like you are more interested in designing new levels, items, Pokemon etc. instead of programming a game. If this is the case you could probably modify an existing Pokemon game with custom editors people have released. There are some videos on YouTube that demonstrate editing Pokemon games.

I had many thoughts in the past to create my own version of existing game franchises but decided it would be more worthwhile to create my own original games. Rather than living in someone else's game world, why not make your own?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can program in C++, but not the graphics. But the graphic isn't important at all to make a Pok?mon game. I can fix that after. So I think I maybe write the game in C++.

It's not just the items, Pokemon etc. that I will do. I'm very interested in programming and how the things work. So I think I'll not edit an existing Pok?mon game.
<br/>
<br/>
I have also tried to make own versions of existing games, and I have made one, a Super Mario clone. But it's more fun to make a own game world with own characters. Maybe I'll make a own game that is like a Pok?mon game in gameplay, but a new idea. I will think of it, so you don't need to give me Pok?mon ideas anymore.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

(Simplistic maps, simple character interaction, random events) If you think you can just tack on some random graphics afterwards you're going to have a problem. Something on the scale of a pokemon style game will require hundreds, if not thousands of frames of graphics and animation. I don't mean to ruin your hopes, but it's the  truth.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To his defense, those things (all the frames of animation, etc) make the game look more polished, but don't change gameplay.  One could make a nasty ugly pokemon game, with similar gameplay, but with roguelike graphics (and no battle animations), for example.  
<br/>
<br/>
You'd still have SOME work to do for graphics, but not nearly as much.  And depending on what your goal is, could still be an acceptable result.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is a difference between the scope of a project, and the quality of the project.  A low quality project (not pretty) with a large scope (lots of monsters), is roughly as hard as a high quality project (pretty) with a limited scope (few maps and monsters).  It all depends on where you put your time.  If the scope of a project is too limited, it ends up being no more than a demo, regardless of the quality.  Some "high quality" demos are actually not extensible.
<br/>
<br/>
In summary, a low quality pokemon clone with the scope of the first generation games would be hard for an army of one to pull off, but it could be done.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Of course.  With an army of three you can increase your quality or scope.  Alternatively you can decrease your schedule and therefore increase your chance of success.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
