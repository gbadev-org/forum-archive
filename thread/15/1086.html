    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I have started working on the design documents for a new GBA game called Citadel. This is the first document (Game Rules) and will appreciate you comments/suggestions in that regard.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks
<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
Citadel Rules
<br/>
<br/>
General Rules
<br/>
<br/>
Citadel is a turn-based game, similar to RISK and Defender of the Crown. The goal is to conquer all of the counties on the map.
<br/>
<br/>
The map is divided into eight counties. Each of the counties has the following properties:
<br/>
<br/>
?	Name
<br/>
?	Money per turn
<br/>
?	Owner (none if it is no claimed yet)
<br/>
?	Castle (yes/no)
<br/>
?	Number of footmen
<br/>
?	Number of knights
<br/>
?	Number of catapults
<br/>
<br/>
Units:
<br/>
<br/>
Unit Type	Price	Attack	Defense
<br/>
Footman		$1	10	20
<br/>
Knight		$10	75	50
<br/>
Catapult	$25	200	0
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Buildings:
<br/>
<br/>
1.	Castle		$100
<br/>
<br/>
The game can have two or more players. One player is human and the computer controls the others.
<br/>
<br/>
Each player has the following properties:
<br/>
<br/>
?	Name
<br/>
?	Money
<br/>
?	Color (Flag)
<br/>
<br/>
Each player starts with one county with a castle and five footmen. In the beginning of the game most of the counties are neutral (have no owner) and can be claimed with no battle.
<br/>
<br/>
Each turn consists of the following steps:
<br/>
<br/>
1.	Collect money for each county owned by the player based on county?s money per turn.
<br/>
2.	Move units or attack adjacent counties. The player can move any number of units within the counties he owns. He can attack on adjacent counties. If the attacked county in neutral (has no owner) the player becomes an owner. If the county has an owner the Battle Rules apply.
<br/>
<br/>
Battle Rules (TBD)
<br/>
<br/>
There two participants in a battle: an attacker and a defender. The outcome of a battle depends on the following factors:
<br/>
<br/>
1.	The number and type of units on each side
<br/>
2.	The presence of castle in defenders county increases the defense of his units with 100%
<br/>
3.	The battles are turn based, for each turn the attacker has a choice to attack or retreat
<br/>
4.	The battle is considered won if all of the defenders units are eliminated
<br/>
5.	The outcome of a battle turn depends on: unit numbers, unit types, random factor, castle defense bonus
<br/>
6.	A castle can be attacked only with a catapult
<br/>
7.	If the attacker wins a battle, the defender?s castle is considered destroyed (i.e. castles cannot be captured) 
<br/>
Other Rules
<br/>
<br/>
1.	If the player has left a county, which he owns, with no defense (no units) there is probability of 50% that the people of that county will revolt and return to a neutral status. If there is a castle in that county, the probability is 25%.
<br/>
2.	A player can see the location of his units only.
<br/>
3.	The county?s ownership, money per turn and castles are visible to all players.
<br/>
Winning
<br/>
<br/>
The player, who conquers all of the counties, wins the game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
If I were designing this game I would make the players work for the neutral territories.
<br/>
<br/>
If an army out of nowhere attacked your city, wouldn't you attempt to fight back even if you aren't militant?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://lorrd.fearware.net" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/vzep3wth/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/lorrdbanner.gif">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How about territory?
<br/>
<br/>
A footsoldier can walk a limited distance in a swamp or mountain or through a river whilst a knight cant walk through a river but is faster through the other regions.
<br/>
<br/>
But I don't see the game taking advantage of strategy or creating 'gameplay context' (i dont know a better word for it).
<br/>
<br/>
The only part wich does that si that you can only attack a castle with a catapult. I would suggest more units to achieve this. 
<br/>
<br/>
For example a spy wich has no defence at all and very little attack capability but you can sneak up on the enemy and attack them at close range. Not the best example but this is off the top of my head.
<br/>
<br/>
A better idea would be to incorporate some logisticks. In the sense that you have to preserve your line of supplies. If the enemy attacks your line of supplies and succeeds your soldiers will go without food, maybe the spy could be used for this :).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Im sorry but as it is now I don't think the game would be a whole lot of fun, it just sounds too empty because it is way too straight forward. It has no 'gameplay context'.<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Your design seems incomplete to me, but it looks good enough for now.  Take it, and do your best to make something with it.  If anyting is missing or needs to be expanded upon, it will become obvious.
<br/>
<br/>
I was just making some maps for a game when I realized that randomly adding screens and trying to get them to fit together was a stupid way of doing things.  What I was missing was a map of the area want to create.  I've created a map for four of sixteen levels.  By the time all of that is actually implemented I'll probably have had to go back and clarify something else.
