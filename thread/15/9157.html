<br/>
It was a blast and there are 1000s of dolls already made... If there were a way to write a program for the DS that was capable of loading the doll sets That would be impressive.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I never figured that playing with a virtual paper doll would be any fun. I tried out the windows version and think it has distinct possibilities. I don't think that you could import the dolls that are already made. I might be wrong as I just started programming on the DS. Funny thing is the site has an adults only section for dolls. Anyone else know anything about this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought my daughter a DS earlier last month and she absolutely loves Animal Crossing and Super Princess Peach. I was reading over some of the topics and found this. I looked at the site and called my daughter in to see it too. She was immediately engrossed in changing the clothes, hairstyles, etc for about 3 hours straight. Provided that questionable dolls are excluded, I think it would go over very well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hentai dolls, I'm assuming.  They are for really really single guys who want to remain that way.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Basically.  It probably includes positioning offsets as well.  If I were to write one I'd include clothing types so you can't put on two hats or dresses.  Two hats can be done, but it would make for one ugly art spec.  I'd also assume that all dolls are the same size, for the sake of simplicity and reuseability.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This has a market.  Dating sims have a market as well.  I'll quote myself by saying "really really single guys who want to remain that way" and add even if the don't realize it.  This is huge demographic.  I went to high school with at least one guy who falls into this category.  You'll need to be careful how you make the dolls, and you'll probably want to be able to do something with them.
<br/>
<br/>
You could also go for the weaker "8-year old girl" demographic with more or less the same code base.  =P  How frightening.
