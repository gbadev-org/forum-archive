Well, the game I'm showing you is made in RPGMaker2000. [don't worry, it's being converted]. Some of you may have heard of it, others may not. It's a good program, but it's warez and I can't publish anything. =[

Check it out. I'll be converting this game to the gba after I release a promised rm2k demo. Go ahead and get a taste of the flavor of the design in the screenshots section, the museum section, and check out the features section too. There you'll find some great music made by a good friend of mine.<br/>_________________<br/>Check out this <a class="postlink" href="http://dsfh.rm2kdatabase.com/dsfhintro.html" target="_blank">game</a>.

<br/>
Will be converted to gba soon. rm2k isn't cutting it anymore.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I myself am currently attempting to port two RM95 games to the GBA(Lun's Crestfallen series), so I guess we're in the same boat.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, good luck with that; despite my first comment, it still looks decent. And even better is rm2k's limits are similar to the GBA's, as far as video and input.<br/>_________________<br/>Out of Order.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You're quite idiotic. RM2k3 IS AS ILLEGAL AS RM2k. Don't go getting this fellow's post locked.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, programming something for the GBA is a much better idea than using RM2k3.
