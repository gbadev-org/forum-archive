    <h4>#93778 - sgeos - Fri Jul 21, 2006 6:15 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm still playing around with the idea of a super low spec game.  I'm thinking:
<br/>
A) No real graphics, only 8 by 8 solid blocks of pixels.
<br/>
B) 10 color palette (rgb, cym, black, white, grey, transparency)
<br/>
C) 4 sound effects
<br/>
D) 4 bgms
<br/>
E) No text
<br/>
<br/>
Assuming a side scroller, the sound effects that come to mind are:
<br/>
A) jump
<br/>
B) attack
<br/>
C) collect power up
<br/>
D) take damage
<br/>
Although it seem that they might be too player centric.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking that heart beat style BGMs would neat:
<br/>
A) Up Beat (Active Area)
<br/>
B) Down Beat (Vacant/Depressed Area)
<br/>
C) Steady Beat (High Tension Area)
<br/>
D) Techno Beat (Ending, why not?)
<br/>
<br/>
The maps are cell based and have a couple properties that apply to the entire map:
<br/>
A) Gravity (X, Y)
<br/>
B) Health Update (Damage/Healing)
<br/>
<br/>
Individual cells have multiple properties:
<br/>
A) Auto Movement (X, Y)
<br/>
B) Health Update (Damage/Healing)
<br/>
C) Solid Flags (None/All/PC/NPC/Enemy)
<br/>
D) One Way Movement Flags (N, E, S, W)
<br/>
E) Breakability
<br/>
F) Spawn ID (Item/Monster/Map Jump/Other)
<br/>
<br/>
Maps have 2 layers.  One layer over the player, one layer under the player.  Each cell contains a solid color block (see palette).  As far as the engine is concerned, the display and the cell properties are unrelated, so invisible bridges, secret passages, etc can be made.

<br/>
Assuming I want to maximize my audiance, what should this be written in and written for?  I'm "good" at C and Actionscript (Flash), but C++ and Java also seem really good choices.  I want to describe the inner workings in a language independant way.  If that happens, then what it is written in is sort of secondary.
<br/>
<br/>
The GBA and NDS seem like incredibly poor first targets, for various reasons.  Either a PC binary, Flash executable or Java Applet seems like the way to go.

Wait, no, I've just come up with some amazing add ons to the gameplay of that game to make it TRULY GREAT. Add a style system where you can perform additional tricks if you dare, such as going inside and outside a circle , and reward the player with even more points if they go around 2 points at a time, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Also increase the difficulty later with (slowly) rotating circles etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

yes i believe you could make a template or library for this sort of thing. that way multiple games could come from this. maybe create a set of classes for the objects, a graphics renderer, a physics machine, who knows
<br/>
<br/>
if you wrote it in a format which is event driven, it would be truly powerful (events that the game engine would call when there is a collision, damage taken, etc)
<br/>
<br/>
ex.
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">

<br/>
OO.  That means no vanilla C.  Do you think Java, Flash or C++ would be the best target?
<br/>
Java = Web, Cell Phones
<br/>
Flash = Web, Portability (Java failed compile once run anywhere)
<br/>
C++ = PC, basically any mid spec device
<br/>
<br/>
If I feel like taking my time, I could spec the whole library/API and worry about a language later.  (Or let other people worry about implementing the API.)  It would be kind of cool to have an open platform game API implented in various languages.  Does anything like this exist?  (It would work for an RPG field map as well.  Just think no gravity.)

<br/>
The class hierarchy will look something like this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">interface iCritter
<br/>
class Critter implements iCritter
<br/>
class NPC extends Critter
<br/>
class PC extends Critter</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
The engine will handle critters.  It won't care if they are PCs or NPCs or GhostCritters or whatever.
<br/>
<br/>
Would adding things like the below to iCritter meet your requirements?  The engine would call them when appropriate.
<br/>

Yeah, it's expensive, but it's also an incredibly marketable skill. I know a lot of people who make $100+ an hour doing high-end flash work. So if you're at all interested in a multimedia or web dev career, the Flash price tag is well worth it. And once you pay for the 1st license, the upgrades aren't as painful.

As for game development, Flash is a kickin' platform. Very easy to learn, very expandable, and very powerful out of the box. Plus, there are dozens of games sites that will host your game and expose you to a large audience.

Writing in C for the GBA limits the user base to flash carts and emulators.  (Unless there is a way to append the ROM to end of an auto launching emulator.)  Not many people own flash carts.  "Regular users" don't want to have to learn how to launch a ROM from an emulator.  To the extent I'm writing something niche, I want to maximize the audiance.  I may be wrong, but I don't think that the niche for "block's adventure" is accurately described as GBA homebrewers.
<br/>
<br/>
If/when this is finished, I want to print 1000 CDs and see if they can be sold.  (Given a niche product, assuming it is worth buying in the first place, 1000 units is reasonable.)  GBA complicates things.
<br/>
<br/>
Ideally I'm looking for something cross platform that people can learn from.

But java can be done cross platform if you simply learn how to do it correctly. We've done it, plenty of people have done it. Many java apps on the net work on all platforms, you other guys have just had an unfair deal.

You can simply create it in C/C++ and compile multiple versions. If they are in linux, it is likely that they are more than aware of picking the right compilation, or compiling from source. If they are windows, they will know to pick the "for windows" logo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
