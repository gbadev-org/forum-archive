    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The problem with designing flight simulators (that are realistic) these days, is that it requires A LOT of knowledge of flight physics. Not any ol' game developer can design the game, as they make games, which are not realistic. You need a team of people (preferably) who all are experianced with flying in real life. That is X-Plane is such a good flight sim, and why there are so few.
<br/>
<br/>
One game genre which would be good to see are simulation-esque games. I created an idea for a mod for HL2 a while back that has a lot of interesting gameplay elements not scene in any games today, but I've never had the time to undertake the project.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically - Make the game a game, but add in realistic elements - Like the need to eat food to keep going, or stuff like that. I've only seen a few games which sort of touch on this idea, but it isnt required by the game that you particpate in this function.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me put the idea into real use for you to understand better -
<br/>
The idea for my mod was a zombie survival game. There are many games which are zombe survival, hell to many, but they all lack one thing - They aren't a true simulation. They all either have the player ramboing, or doing things which someone in real life would not be able to do, or the game is just plain unrealistic. My idea, would introduce two new 'health' like status bars that the player would see, one would be 'Food Level' and one would be 'Water'. Both of these meters would run down on a timed rate, and if they hit zero, you would start loosing normal health points. To replenish the food and water bars, you would simply search out for food, or water, collect it, or consume it. Via the easy to use havoc physics system implemented in HL2, I would have it so one could simply collect water, and food, put it in a bag/shopping cart/car/etc and be able to bring it back to a holdup if needed. This would basically force players the need to go outside of a holdup on the game level, and add in interesting aspect not seen in many current generation zombie games - Fighting against other normal human beings to survive.
<br/>
<br/>
I won't go into further details, as this idea took me a while to think up of, and then work out gameplay elements so it would be balanced (Hell, I even stayed up one night working out plans for a MMO version of this game, and it looks good on paper, but not something that would ever happen), but I think you get the general sense of what I'm pointing out. A simulation-esque type game. Where it is a simulation of what would happen if it were real life, but not to the extent where it is just a boring simulation, you still have action/FPS/RPG-ish elements to make it a fun game.
<br/>
<br/>
/That/ is what I think more games need now days.
<br/>
<br/>
The real question is though, would this be fun? Would players want to play a game that is also borderline on simulation? Would it be obnoxious after a while trying to search out for food and water if all you wanted to do was kill zombies?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the point here is that a game shouldn't fall into a genre, if at all possible. It should have enough elements and varying gameplay that every time you go to the next level there's not just more or smarter enemies, but you have to figure out new ways to solve your problems. Killing zombies is fun, I admit. But just like the food and water thing, it gets tiring. People today want variety, but not in a forced way.
<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents as well. You're soooo rich now!<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One problem (problem meaning reason why they don't do games like that), is because people have changed the way they play games.  Most people <span style="font-style: italic">don't want</span> the game to be hard.  For example, Ikaruga came out a few years ago.  And didn't do so well.  It was great, but HARD.  Nobody wanted a challenging game where you were going to die on level 2, and had to start over when you died.  People want a game where you just play through it all, and see the whole thing (maybe with the help of gamefaqs.com).
<br/>
<br/>
People today seem to care more about accessing all the game content than they do the challenge of the game.  Which means slower, less frantic games, where the fun is often in the content (art, level design, etc), and not in struggling against a tough challenge.  (not that that's automatically bad...I just have a fondness for HARD action games)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I once played a vector-based VR game that involved finding gold bars.  I played it on a 286 back in the day, but I have never been able to find it or recall the name.  All I remember was a silly file "go.bat" which obviously just called the program.

i want a row of unit icons at the bottom. the command icon will be over the unit type you control, and select goes to the next unit (only control 1 unit at a time). d pad moves the unit, R and L rotate the unit clockwise and counterclockwise. the control is kidna like double joystick. A fires, start pauses, and b changes weapon or enters another unit (infantry into mg nest or t copter or raft or something).

im having ideas about having L be lockon and R be realign squad and maybe be a lot more like battalion wars but i dont have enough buttons :-(.
