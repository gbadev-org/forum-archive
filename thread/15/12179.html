    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm placing my first steps in the GBA-domain with a relatively simple variant of Sudoku.
<br/>
<br/>
As you know, Sudoku is about entering numbers 0-9 in designated squares. My question: what is a good methodology to input numbers through the limited GBA interface.
<br/>
<br/>
I've come up with two solutions, on which I'd like to hear feedback. The easiest one is to display the numbers and use the control pad to browse through them. But, in theory, this takes 8 key presses per number, on average it would take 4. 
<br/>
<br/>
My own preferred solution is to use a combination of keys. Use the A and B buttons (or some other two buttons) as modifiers, and assign each direction of the control-pad a number: 1-4 with modifier A, 6-9 with modifier B and 5 by just pressing a modifier button. So, in theory, each number only takes two button/pad-presses, but one has to 'learn' how to enter these numbers.
<br/>
<br/>
As an emacs-user, I am more than used to such systems, but I am wondering, do you think the second solution is overly complex? Do you think it to be as intuitive as I think it is, or is it weird? Is there a better solution than either of these?
<br/>
<br/>
Love to hear your input!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I could imagine using the beginner mode until I get the hang of the game mechanics, then switching to the key combo mode.  I wouldn't want to fight with the control scheme while simultaneously trying to understand the game.
<br/>
<br/>
For the combo scheme, visual feedback would help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, about that last part, the visual feedback: I was thinking of drawing a large control-pad whenever the modifier keys are pressed, with the numbers right there. So you would see something like:
<br/>
<br/>
  -  2
<br/>
1     +      3
<br/>
    - 4
<br/>
<br/>
And then by tapping the control pad one of them is highlighted. Releasing the two will select the number.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would go with a scheme like this:
<br/>
<br/>
Main mode: Move around the grid with the control pad. Press A to select a square, which would enlarge.
<br/>
<br/>
Enlarged square mode: You have 9 locations to write numbers in the square. The center is used to write your "final answer" (maybe make the cursor larger when this location is selected), and the 8 surrounding are used for writing little numbers. Move around with the D-pad, press A to go to number entry mode, press B to go back to main mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Number entry mode: Brings up a key pad, with numbers 1-9 arranged in a square, with the cursor in the center. Use the D-pad to move around, A to enter a number, or B to go back to enlarged square mode. If entering a "final answer", go back to main mode, if small number, back to enlarged square mode.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An alternate control scheme for number entry mode would be to hold one of the 8 directions to highlight the desired number on the keypad, and have the cursor go back to the center if you release the D-pad. Might be more confusing to a beginner, but I think it would feel more natural to me, even though you could get to any number with a single press in the other variation too (that is, counting diagonals as a single press). Just be sure you ignore all D-pad input after returning to the previous mode, until you release the direction you were holding to select the number :)<br/>_________________<br/>___________

No, I don't like that. Key to Sudoku is that you have some visual idea of the solution; I don't want the display of the main Sudoku to change through enlargement of portions of it. Also, that would overlay other parts of the puzzle board, and most often you need to look at those to know what to enter in a square. I'm afraid you would lose the `big picture' if you things change in the area of the puzzle itself.
<br/>
<br/>
The enlargement idea could work at the side of the board though, not as an overlay.

I didn't count the diagonals as single presses, and you and other posters are correct that that's a much better way of entering the numbers. I'll probably go with that solution, because it is the simplest and most intuitive.

...And then I made it again a minute later. Except I just realized one flaw, that you can't erase a number with that interface. Maybe use L and R to switch between "enter" and "erase" modes? So if you're erasing, pressing A on a number kills it rather than bringing up the number pad.

<br/>
Good point. It would be annoying going in and out of edit mode to check things when writing a bunch of little numbers in a square. I do like the idea of enlarging off to the side though. That would get your focus over in that area, so you could pop up the number pad there as well without seeming awkward or overlapping the grid.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

This is precisely how I implemented it, with one notable variation: the A and B are both used to select a number, A to select a 'answer'-number, B to select a 'it might be this one'-number (the small digits you scribble to find a final solution). When pressing A, the highlight is in green, when pressing B, it's red. Selecting the same number again, clears it. This makes for a perfect input-system!

Ack. The game is done. If people are interested, I'll post it. The game itself is not that complex (it's SUDOKU after all), but I'm sort of proud on the graphics I used. Unlike commercial sudoku-games (DrSudoku, etc.), it has variable backgrounds, meaning that the board itself is projected on a specific background.
<br/>
<br/>
This is something I made for my dear beloved one, so the backgrounds are pictures of us and other stuff that's meant to make her heart go boom while she's travelling abroad. Judging from the comments I've heard, it did.
<br/>
<br/>
I specifically bought a GBA Micro for this, because the screen is far superior. It's a great little machine, much better than the GBA we have.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by miep on Wed Feb 21, 2007 4:12 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
