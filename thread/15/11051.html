<br/>
so like you have to fly a chapter, and the other chapter walk and shoot.. (shoot 'em up)

I'd better have a very good flying games with many challenges/possibilities (landing, fighting, ...) than a mix of fps and glider. (and I don't like fps)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Cool by me. Just remember that the bigger you make the project, the more likely you'll get frustrated / bored and not finish any part.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://akzeac.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://akzeac.blogspot.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think its a great idea, olny you should make shure to make both parts of the game feel equally good, so it doesent seem like a flying game, with a shooting minigame.  Mebe you could get out and use AA guns on aircraft?<br/>_________________<br/>"in Soviet Russia, car pimps you!"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Seriously though, I think you should go for the included fps parts. It would be kinda awesome to fly to a place and fight through it, only to find that your plane has been shot to pieces, forcing you to hijack a small WW1 plane from a museum or something. If you really want to make it awesome, you need lots of cool cinematics and a good story.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
