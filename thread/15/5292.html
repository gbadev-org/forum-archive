    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I have an idea
<br/>
Think about the multiboot cable can be used to link the GBA to internet. It will not be mobile but If somebody make it to work with GPRS or something like that, GBA can be a mobile and online game machine too. Its a fantasy ofcourse. Nintendo DS and Sony PSP will have the online gaming features. But think of the GBA has this ability somehow. :)<br/>_________________<br/>--------------------

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it's a question of the "gamedesign"
<br/>
<br/>
onlinegameing does not constrain you to play offline and just sync your data with thousand of other players.
<br/>
maybe something like <a href="http://www.darkgalaxy.com" target="_blank">www.darkgalaxy.com</a> for gba :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think there's an easier way to transfer data from the gba 2 pc by using a webcam that shoots some pics of the gba-display and gets it data this way. yes, it would be more difficult to get the data back from pc 2 gba. but it's a lot easier to publish a game that not stricly needs some extra hardware.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wifi for GBA doesn't follow standard conventions - very proprietary.  It's the same speed as serial as well which doesn't bode well for real time games.  biubid_boy - Vuola!... gave me a good laugh :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is a version of the GBA link cable on the market that works like the Pokemon adapter, but supports just a regular old link. Maybe this would work, if you got a server on the computer to connect the four players and then basically bounce the data from the GBA to the PC, through the internet, and back to the other GBAs. It would be tough to get it to go fast though... but it would require absolutely no GBA programming.

<br/>
What would be really cool is if a web browser could be written for GBA.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
