    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all I thought I'd start with an introduction, I've been working at various game companies including Namco HomeTek, Bungie Software, and Ronin. 
<br/>
<br/>
I've seen many game design docs which were long threads of unrelated "wouldn't it be cool if" statements. I decided I'd put together something that would be a step up from that and I thought I'd post it to this form considering that  I'm designing with the DS in mind.
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.okita.com/ES/EmberScribe_CompleteDesign_2005-06-03-1955.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.okita.com/ES/EmberScribe_CompleteDesign_2005-06-03-1955.pdf</a> this is the Design for Ember Scribe a Fantasy spell casting game where the player draws a symbol to throw magic at monsters.
<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead and give the doc a once over, I'd like comments and questions. I'm not expecting too much from posting this since I don't have any programmers, or other artists, or even other designers working with me.
<br/>
<br/>
you can send thoughts to <a href="mailto:emberscribe@gmail.com">emberscribe@gmail.com</a> lets me know that there's something specific to the design.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks!

<br/>
I like this idea. I like it a lot. IMHO, this could be a really solid reason for having the touch screen in the game mechanic at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i think it looks amazing. the whole idea of spellcasting with the stylus looks intreging.
<br/>
<br/>
