    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think we need to get a better understanding of how to tell which ones have updated firmware.  The reason I ask, is the "rumor" is ones starting with NU12 and later..  Well, is later NU40 and NU41?  As, I personally know it works fine on those SNs..  Now, I searched all over the Chicago suburbs looking for a DS with an NU12 serial number and all I could find were NU41, NU10, and NU11s..  in both silver and blue.
<br/>
<br/>
So, is anyone that is having a problem with a PassMe working, have any of these SNs listed above?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Until I read this thread, I thought that the blue units were safe.  I got my passkey today, and was very disappointed to discover I've got the wrong firmware.  The passkey works fine on my friend's silver DS with a NU40 serial number.

One more thing about serial numbers, my friend's silver DS was purchased very close to launch, and there is a 1 in a box next to the serial number .  My new DS has a 8 in the same location.  Could this be a revision number?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Here's the first 4 of the serial of my silver NDS, bought at launch:
<br/>
<br/>
NU70
<br/>
<br/>
The number in the box is a 0.
<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that the number in the box is a checksum for the serial number. The barcode above the serial number most likely is the serial encoded, with a checksum. The serial number is printed in case the barcode reader can't read it for some reason, requiring the operator to manually enter the serial number and checksum.
<br/>
<br/>
The fact that we're seeing inconsistant support of Flashme and Wifime when assuming the number is the firmware version leads me to believe it's just a checksum.<br/>_________________<br/>"Jesus saves, but everyone else in a 10 foot radius takes full damage from the fireball."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You might be right, the digit in the box might not be relevant, but I still suspect that it indicates how old the DS is.  Your DS, bought at launch, has a [0].  My friend's, bought shortly after launch, has a [1].  My new DS has an [8].

Lynx says he has seen an old firmware DS with an [8], so I guess it isn't an absolute indicator.  But I suspect that older units have lower numbers, and you won't get the new firmware if you buy a North American blue or silver DS with a [7] or lower.  We don't have enough information to know for sure though.

You mean parallel flasher, but yes, that will work :)

<br/>
Re-flashing the firmware is a bit more complicated than that, since the flashme installer also extracts the MAC address, current firmware version, and user settings out of the old firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
If you just use a ripped version, you'll end up with either loopy's mac, or more likely, a mac of 00-00-00-00-00-00 or FF's, depending on what he overwrote his MAC address with :D, and no way to know what version you should restore from.
<br/>
<br/>
The MAC is at, iirc offset 0x36 in the firmware, and the settings are the last 512 bytes or so, so if you use the parallel port flasher to first read your firmware, then copy the mac and settings over into the rip (and store the original in a safe place, just in case), then you're probably good to go (but I'm not making any promises to that effect).
<br/>
<br/>
There may be other additional information copied over by the flashme installer, either ask loopy (<a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/privmsg.php?mode=post&amp;u=3890" target="_blank">PM olimar</a>) or check yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
Err, actually I just realized that DF's tool may be smarter than a simple reader/writer, and actually do this stuff for you.  I haven't looked at it and will defer to someone who has on that matter.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

EDIT: Actually it looks like it's just the FlashMe restore code and not the full FW, since fw.bin is only 768 bytes.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just a little summary of some discutions on #dsdev :
<br/>
<br/>
Passme issue ) ique passme *should* work with blue and pink, the only problem is that it is Metroid demo dependent. And as you got your blue/pink with a bundle you probably haven't got the Metroid demo.
<br/>
But how it is dependent : it makes the proc jump to an invalid code located in the metroid demo, this code makes it do a swi to sram and then, let's-a-go. So how can you adapt it for every game ? just find in somegame the same value to jump to, and change the adress of the jump. Straightforward given the fact you can program the passme.
<br/>
<br/>
Wifime issue ) This time we've got to do the same thing as for the passme, except the jump will be in the wmb code. For example I send via wifi a modified header and a real signed code like polarium demo for instance. In the header I make it referring to an address poiting to some invalid code in the polarium signed code. This code being the same as in the passme case, a swi to sram.
<br/>
<br/>
I've got nothing to test this, the only wifi I got is an airport card on my mac and a netgear wg121... I don't have a passme either, so I'm couting on you for some feedback on this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think the only thing wrong is that it shows % now instead of numbers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i have a blue DS and i know i need a GBA flash cart that will be compatible with iQue, and im assuming that the Super Card SD will be compatible.  
<br/>
1) am i right in that assumption?
<br/>
2) if i am, i will order one and test it pending someone make a wifime app that will do it.
<br/>
i already have wifime setup and tested to work so that wont be a problem, but if someone gets a working app with wifime to get flashme running i will test it, as my warranty for bestbuy covers "faulty hardware" :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">from what ive heard is that flashme does checks on the firmware to make sure its compatible and those checks are stopping it from running on an iQue DS.  for those of us that have them, we should wait until a flashme for iQue has been developed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
