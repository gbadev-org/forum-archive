    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's called WifiMe; Google that and you should find it. However there are two important things you need to know:
<br/>
<br/>
1) It requires a specific type of wireless card. Most sites should link to a list of compatible cards. You can't use USB cards in Windows even though they're on the list. (I believe you can in Linux.)
<br/>
<br/>
2) It works the same as a PassMe1. That means it won't work on firmware versions 4 and up, and it still requires a flash cart, GBAMP etc to hold the code. (The homebrew code itself doesn't get sent as a Download Play demo; for that, you need to use FlashMe.)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My DS firmware is V3 My wifi card is supported i can send official demos to my DS and they work fine its when i try homebrew apps/demos that they crash on the first screen (nintendo logo kinda thing)
<br/>
<br/>
I read that i can use a virtual flashme or somthing to edit my firmware to allow homebrew code to be run.
<br/>
<br/>
I need to do it all over download play.
<br/>
<br/>
Anideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

One use of the WMB program is to send official demos.
<br/>
This is not WifiMe.
<br/>
<br/>
WifiMe is another use of the WMB program, and requires a GBA flash cart.

To do this you need to install FlashMe first.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought why keep the gba when im buying a DS cause i thought that i could still use my GBA flashcard on my DS.  i THOUGHT it had a multiplayer connector, i was wrong :(
<br/>
<br/>
So the GBA MP and CF card do the same thing as my EZF advance flash card?
<br/>
<br/>
*Sorry if im a pain but could u please post a link to a good gba mp that will do what i need.
<br/>
<br/>
Also what reccomended size CF should i buy?
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">With GBA Movie Player v2 CF, you can run PocketNES (NES emulator for GBA), nesDS, and a few games in snesDS. You can also run any GBA homebrew program that is designed for "multiboot" mode (if you want suggestions see <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9687" target="_blank">this topic</a>). With SuperCard, you can also run GBA homebrew ROMs. (The difference between a ROM and a multiboot is that a multiboot loads itself entirely into the GBA's 256 KB RAM before running.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
