    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok i got Wifime working last night and spent hours playing japanese E3 demos which was awesome.
<br/>
<br/>
anyway, my problem is whenever i try to send homebrew stuff to my ds via Wifime it allways crashes when displaying the startup logo from the homebrew app/game, it displays the title screen for the game or app and then just freezes (The title screen usualyy is scarmbled and then it will just crash)
<br/>
<br/>
But every official demo i have tried works perfectley, why are only homebrew games and apps crashing?
<br/>
<br/>
ami missing somthing?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You should have just posted this in your other thread. Official demos have an RSA signature, which is like a checksum (to be specific, it's an RSA-signed checksum) but encrypted. Adding the signature to a program requires Nintendo's key, and as far as we know they're the only ones who have it (and cracking it would take a couple hundred years). The DS will refuse to play demos that aren't signed, which means if you send homebrew or a modified demo it will do exactly what you described. (WifiMe is actually an official demo, but parts of the file that aren't RSA-protected are modified.) If you want to send homebrew via WMB you need to install FlashMe.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, WifiMe = wireless PassMe; Wireless Multiboot (WMB) = sending demos/homebrew to Download Play.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
