Next question: Is it very important to you that the card not stick out of the DS Lite while it is in operation? (In my experience, size is most important if you will be playing music while jogging and less important otherwise.)
<br/>
<br/>
Another question: Do you already own a lot of CompactFlash or Secure Digital memory cards?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Within the past week, I bought a 1 GB (that's 8,000 megabit) CompactFlash card for $40 at random-office-supply-store. Combine that with a NoPass (such as the MK4-mini or the MAX Media Launcher) and a GBA Movie Player v2 CF, and you have a very inexpensive, very compatible solution for running GBA homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so what your saying is that I should just get v2 of gba movie player, a 1 gb cf card, and the mk4-mini and the gbav2 will work on my DS lite?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, GBAMP plus a CF card is cheaper than NEO brand cards. If you look on auction sites, you can find a GBAMP v2 CF for 25 USD including shipping. (Yes, sellers can and will try the $10 card with $15 shipping trick.)
<br/>
<br/>
You can probably get a MAX Media Launcher cheaper than an MK4-mini as well.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That would be the cheapest option and much better than getting the neo 512.
<br/>
<br/>
The GBAMP will stick out so much though, it will be very ugly.  It also won't be compatible with homebrew that uses an appended filesystem and it won't run the majority of GBA homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
The next cheapest option that doesn't have any of those problems (although still sticks out a bit) would be a Supercard.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Thu Aug 24, 2006 4:16 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Some homebrew that won't work on GBAMP include: Heretic, Hexen, Ticklegirl and SnezziDS.  All of those could be made compatible but some of those have been out for years and no one has made a GBAMP version yet.  You also won't be able to save in any homebrew that only saves to SRAM.  Most homebrew doesn't have a save feature or will save to your CF card, so that's not a big problem.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">oh then, well I don't care then about those games, I'll just go with the GBAMP V2 since it'll be the cheapest. And get the max media launcher and save off some off the side parts since I heard it can break the ds cart, or I could just put the cart into another case, like my opened metroid prime hunters first hunt cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wish I got paid for promoting the GBA MP V2 CF (make sure you get the CF version or you will be out of luck, as Chishm's hack doesn't work on the SD version) cause it truly is the best bang for the buck as far as NDS Homebrew goes..<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes well, I'll just get the CF version off natrium42's site. Then  I'll buy the max media launcher. And get a 4 GB CF card instead of 1 GB, then I'll be able to put most of the homebrew on basicly, :). Anyways, my dad was going to use that monie for my sister and I, we each get like 130$ for school clothes. But she's getting homeschooled, and I get half of her monie. Bu the only thing is, I can't spend all of the 65$ that I get from my sisters monie. But I'll still be good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
