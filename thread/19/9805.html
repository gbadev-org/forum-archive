I didn't run into any problems. I used a small drill bit wrapped in electric tape as the shorting utility (stolen from Aisu's "DS Lite Flashing Journal" post). When FlashMe ran, it said that it didn't recognize the firmware, but I continued anyway.

What you don't see in the pictures is me peeing my pants when I did it.

I hope you're not trashing the Passkey2 even after flashing succeeded. Waste of resources, and I'm sure there's always more DS's to flash and friends who need help with that - or if you don't really need it, give it to someone who does.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm sure Nintendo will release another version of the DS before it gets replaced with their next gen handheld and the passkey may still work. The reason I mention this is because I felt Nintendo made it easier to flash the Lite (assuming you insulate your SL1 shorting tool).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry by my english. Actually i live in Brazil.
<br/>
Flashed my japanese DS Lite. Thanks for the advice.
<br/>
The first time I used a nail covered by an isolant tape. Didn't work. The bar remained in 0%.
<br/>
The second time, got a paper clips. Isolated it, but again, didn't works (remained in 0%).
<br/>
The third time, got a tin foil, covered the tip of the clips and isolated the sides. What a beautiful scene!!! The bar reaches 100% in a few seconds.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, when I started flashme me, it showed me the following message: "warning - your firmware is not recognized. If you continue, it may not be possible to restore your firmware to its original state. Push start to continue anyway".
<br/>
<br/>
There are some information in the web, saying that with flashme+dslite the brightness adjust is lost, but it isn't true, with the version 7 (526KB file) it works exactly like the original.
<br/>
<br/>

Google still brings up a lot of stuff from when the DS Lite first came out (before Flashme 7) and back then that was the truth. Version 7 added brightness adjustment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is the DS LITE backlight controlled by the same register as the normal DS backlight? I don't have a DS Lite and I never plan to have one, but some people might want to use FWNITRO with a DS Lite, and I have to make the backlight option to work correctly if used on a DS Lite.
<br/>
<br/>
And, you can see something on the old DS if there is other light in the room. Outside in a sunny day you can see it just as good as if the backlight is on, in a room in your house it may be able to see but very dark. In a dark room, you can see nothing without the backlight. It is probably useful to turn off the backlight to save power.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Does anyone have a link to obtain the proper DS Lite version?
<br/>
<br/>
Update: I visited this site (http://mirrors.kicks-ass.net/mirrors/ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/) and downloaded the firmwares and checked their hashes.

<br/>
<br/>
flashme.nds is the same as what I had, but the stealth version is different. Can anyone confirm and help?
<br/>
<br/>
Last update: Well it seems I fixed my own problem. Through some digging, I found this link (http://mobiles.gx-mod.com/modules/mydownloads/visit.php?lid=1700) which had differently sized firmwares and hashes.
<br/>
<br/>

These are twice the size as the ones I had (538,185 bytes vs 276,041 bytes) and are compatible with DS Lite. I have my 4 levels of brightness back! Sorry for bothering anybody.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
