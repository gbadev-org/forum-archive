    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you dont already know, supremefactory is the wholesale/quantity order site for resellers from Divineo, while Divineo.com is the low piece order site. If you have ordered from divineo, you can expect the same types of service from Supreme (in my experience the are both great sites, even if Divineo is a bit higher in price) 
<br/>
<br/>
I think minumum orders from supreme is around 50pcs and requires special accounts and the like for shipping and money transfers when dealing with the wholesale supremefactory site... although I could be wrong on the min qty order for all the products (I wound up on their mailing list too, when I asked DMS about their product providers)
<br/>
<br/>
As to the trainer, thats an official Action Replay product that came out/was announced about a week after DSPet's trainer did, and Im pretty certain DSPet is aware of it.
<br/>
<br/>
Also note that the china supreme site will not be shipping anything from Jan 1 to Feb 1 due to a holiday, if you do decide to be a company and order from them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
