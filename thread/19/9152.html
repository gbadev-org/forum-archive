    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can anyone help me to run my .nds file on boot up, without having to select it in the list?
<br/>
<br/>
I've got my DS lite booting straight to the supercard on power up, and was hoping that I could avoid having to select the .nds file to get it to run.  I have used .scu files which boot straight up from the card, so hoping there is a way.  
<br/>
<br/>
I hope someone can help.[/b]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is no way as of yet to set a "default" application for Supercard to run on boot, you will always have to manually select one from the menu.

<br/>
Hopefully Romman will add this feature to a future kernel, as it's been requested quite a lot.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been told that you can run .gba files from a gameboy cartridge which will boot straight into the homebrew.  But I don't know the implications of running my .nds file in .gba mode, are there any.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyway of getting a .nds app to boot, maybe with a different supercard equivelent, or flashing the application straight into the DS memory?  Is there code in the header of a .scu file that I can use in my homebrew?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
what memory?
<br/>
the ds has no memory that is not lost when you power off :P,
<br/>
the ONLY memory it has that keeps on forever,
<br/>
is its firmware memory...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

<br/>
well i don't consider the firmware

to not be part of the ds's memory that is usable.
