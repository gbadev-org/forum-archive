    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've read the stickys and countless posts about this but something doesn't add up to me and needed some help clarifying it.
<br/>
<br/>
My DS is running FW1 and I just recently bought a GBAMP and superpass2.  I know that the GBAMP doesn't have SRAM so it should work, but I've managed to get it working with apps like MightyMax's GBAMP Multiboot, Win2DS, and DSOrganize.  But things like DSLinux and games give me the white screens of death.  
<br/>
<br/>
I figured since I can get some apps to run off the GBAMP, I should be good, but doesn't seem like it.  Can someone shed some light as to why some work and some don't?
<br/>
<br/>
TIA</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">umm it shouldnt really work at all according to what i have read but anyway, if you install the latest version of flashme then you should be able to play anything without superpass2 or whatever.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the confusion is around the SuperPass2 being used as a SuperPass1.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I think we can thank the them, for making one more piece of equipment harder for the homebrew community to support that it should be.
<br/>
<br/>
Only thing I can think of is that their code might not be setting up the environment correctly (registers) or to a state that some homebrew would be expecting.  I'd go with the suggestion above and just install FlashMe and not worry about it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I've successfully flashed it, but games still don't seem to work.  I still get the white screens, but I can run most homebrews still.  Any thoughts?
<br/>
Also, how do I start up my DS with my gbamp without having it looking for _BOOT_MP.nds? (ie. I want to use my gbamp firmware to watch movies again)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
