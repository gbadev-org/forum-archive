    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
First of all i'm sorry but i'm french so my english is not so good ^^
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to know, what gba flash card is the best with a passme2
<br/>
because i'm lost with all reference.
<br/>
I want to buy a passme2 (natrium42 website) and i just have a metroid Prime demo <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">FR</span></span>.
<br/>
I don't know how code I need in the passme...
<br/>
<br/>
(I don't want a neoflash kit because i don't agree at all with their philosophy...)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot for all the answers.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. Ask Natrium42 if he can sell you custom programmed PassME2 (for EUR version of MP:H demo).
<br/>
2. You have three choiches:
<br/>
<br/>
- SuperCard
<br/>
<br/>
The cheapest option. You can pick up a SD or CF version.
<br/>
Some homebrew may cause trouble, so beware.
<br/>
<br/>
- M3 Perfect adapter
<br/>
<br/>
Will work with every homebrew. Probably. I recommend the CF version, since SD can cause some trouble
<br/>
<br/>
- the classic FlashCarts
<br/>
<br/>
They fit to GBA slot perfectly though they're expensive and quite useless.
<br/>
You won't be happy with 'em, believe me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
In response to MaHe:
<br/>
You are correct. I regret buying a flashcart. I bought one when I was a noob to the DS homebrew scene, and had such a bad experience trying to get it to work swear words could have been used. I'd reccomend a SuperCard CF.
<br/>
It works with almost all homebrew as far as I know. And hey- not all homebrew works with all storage options.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">oohh thanks for your answers.
<br/>
<br/>
So i will look for a M3.
<br/>
If i need i can custom the passme2, since i have seen the method.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot.

PS: i will give you my opinion whan i will test the solution ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nope. According to <a class="postlink" href="http://darkfader.net/ds/games/" target="_blank">DarkFader's PassMe2 compatibility chart</a>, it'd be like making a PassMeteos2: the magic bytes just aren't there.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry but i don't understand your last answer.. could you explain more simply for me? ^^
<br/>
<br/>
And just an other question, with the M3 adapter they sell a passkey... Is there a difference between passme and passkey because they say that we don't need any original game for this.....
<br/>
<br/>
????? &lt;= it's a screenshot of my brain at the moment :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
And there is some information about the reverse for DS because i know a little about X86 reverse and windows reverse.
<br/>
<br/>
But it must be very interesting for the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
