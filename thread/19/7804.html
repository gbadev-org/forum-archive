    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"I will get my M3 CF next week, on friday. Since my DS is likely to have new firmware, do you think it's a good Idea to ask Divineo if they could put a PassKey 2 in my packet instead of a PassKey 1? If they don't have the PassKey 2, I could receive my M3 only next year! Do you think I can have them exchange the passkey for a passkey 2 and still ship my packet before next year?"
<br/>
"If they can't make the change, should I buy an EZ-Pass 2 from somewhere else or should I wait for PassKey2?"

God Knows when (if) PassKey2 is released! Anyways, I e-mailed Divineo way back before I got a PassMe2 and they've agreed to exchange it with a PassKey2 once it comes out.<br/>_________________<br/>3 is not an "e",

the passkey looks a bit more compact and less likely to break and will a passme2 fit perfectly in a DS without it like moving around or anything</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
