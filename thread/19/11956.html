    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi there,
<br/>
<br/>
i hope someone can help me. im a bit confused about all these methods and products to get different things working on the ds.
<br/>
what i need is the possibility to get my applications, build with the official sdk, to work on the ds lite. all sound and I/O features should work troublefree (thats the most important thing - otherwise i could use ensata emu instead). Can you recommend a specific product that fit my needs?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i knew this question will come up :)
<br/>
im working for a game development studio, but we didn`t recieve the dev kit yet. even when we got it, i wont be able to take it at home (there s no devkit for any programmer - it isn`t cheap).
<br/>
if you can help me out please write me a private message - im sure i can convince you of being a legitimated developer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Develop the game in parallel for Windows and the Nintendo DS. Work on shared game logic and a PC-side front end at home, and sync with the Nitro devkit at work. That's similar to what I'm doing for my current puzzle game project. An additional advantage is that you'll be able to sell the Windows port as a casual PC game after the DS version is launched. If the game heavily uses the touch screen, then develop the PC version on a tablet PC.

If that's not feasible, <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=11474" target="_blank">this topic</a> may be helpful.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
