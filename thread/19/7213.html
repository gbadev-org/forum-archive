    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi, this is my first post, and as you have guessed, i have a question.  I have an NDS, and a wifi card that works with wifime.  i have successfully loaded the polarium demo with wifime. however, when i try to load flashme.nds on my NDS, all i get is white screens with what i think should be a nintendo logo, but the word nintendo is all scrambled and only the border around it is recognizable.  then, it fades out slightly and locks up.  am i doing something wrong?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Official WMB demos have been <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature" target="_blank">digitally signed</a> by Nintendo using RSA public-key cryptography. Nintendo's public key is in every DS, but the private key is presumably locked in a vault in Japan. In order to run homebrew through DS Download Play, you need to disable the firmware's signature verification using FlashMe. The only way you can get FlashMe onto a DS without using something in the GBA slot is through a variant of darkfader's UnBrickMe (ppflash) technique, which involves soldering.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, you're not using "WiFiMe" to run demos; you're using WMB. WMB is an abbreviation for "wireless multiboot", which is said to be an internal name for DS Download Play. WiFiMe is a small DS Download Play program whose header's ARM7 run address has been changed to point at GBA ROM space, which is the same modification performed by the PassMe adapter on the header of a DS game.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i see...i was thinking WMB and WiFiMe were one in the same.  it all makes sense now.  well then, i guess i'll have to get to ordering that M3.

Thanks for the reply pepsiman. I'll try again then. Couldn't make it work at all, but I guess I didn't try hard enough.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and thanks for all the work on linux-ds so far.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
