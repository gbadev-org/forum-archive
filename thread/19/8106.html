First, read this:

From what little I know about passme2buttonwait (learned from a Google search) its job is to run in GBA mode, and program a GBA cart's SRAM to suit the needs of a Passme2 with a particular game card.  The code is the same as the one printed on the NDS game card you use with the passme2.  I don't know the code for Super Mario 64 DS offhand - check your card label.  The "Buttonwait" is there so you can program the SRAM of a different cart from the one you booted with.
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully that solves your problem.  Beyond that, I don't think I can help, as I haven't yet successfully booted NDS code from the GBA slot by any means.  (Trying to help get WiFiMe working from Linux.)<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC
<br/>
I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.
<br/>
Thank you, everyone, I look forward to taking advantage of your work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
