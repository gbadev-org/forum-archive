    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there
<br/>
<br/>
Strangest thing happened to me. I was watching a movie in NDS mode with my M3. I exited the movie to the file menu and then turned the DS off.
<br/>
<br/>
I turned it on again in NDS mode and M3 would jam at the "This product is NOT..." not going further.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried updating the firmware (eventough it had already been updated) with no effect it would still jam at that point, after being updated.
<br/>
<br/>
I then got my M3 into GBA mode (by pressing "Select" and going to the DS's menu) and it ran smoothly. When I got back to NDS mode it was all OK.
<br/>
<br/>
*EDIT*
<br/>
<br/>
It being OK was not due to having run the M3 in GBA mode, it was due to having a DS card inserted when I pressed "Select" to override the flashme. It must clear the memory or something.
<br/>
<br/>
******
<br/>
<br/>
I tried some things and got to this conclusion.
<br/>
<br/>
If I turn off my DS while the movie IS playing this doesn't happen.
<br/>
<br/>
But if I turn my DS off AFTER seeing a movie and exiting to the file menu, the M3 will jam at the next startup.
<br/>
<br/>
I have flashme v6 and had metroid hunters demo in the DS slot.
<br/>
<br/>
The CF card is irrelevant, as it does it with all the CF card I have, and even with none inserted.
<br/>
<br/>
Tried with my Superpass and it works. So it seems to be a problem with M3 and the flashme, hummm.
<br/>
<br/>
Can any of you test this? To see if it is a general problem or if it's only happening to me?
<br/>
<br/>
It's not really an incapacitating bug, but I'm just curious.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hum, you're right, it doesn't happen.
<br/>
<br/>
But the strangest thing is that it only happens when I turn off the DS after quitting the movie to the M3 menu.
<br/>
<br/>
Does the passme key clean the memory?
<br/>
<br/>
So it's an M3 problem, allied to flashme not clearing the memory before jumping to the M3 memory header?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks tepples</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes. The GBAMP used a copy-protection circuit that would often lock up the adapter in a quick power cycle. The M3 is from the developers of the GBAMP.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
