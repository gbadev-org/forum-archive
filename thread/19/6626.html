    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi.
<br/>
I'm pretty new to the homebrew scene, even though I've been reading these forums for a while. I'm thinking of buying a passme for getting homebrew games and stuff to run on my DS but then I saw the Neoflash. I must admit that that device seems like just a passme and a flash cart. Is that the case? Because I already own a flash cart, and in that case I can just buy a PassMe and still get the same effect. Can anyone confirm this?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not interested in the commercial roms, I would like to be able to run homebrew and stuff though.. So what's the difference between the Magic Key and a PassMe? It's just the way they are built, right? Because Natrium42 currently doesn't have any PassMe for sale and I found the Magic Key really cheap shipping to Sweden.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">magic key can be purchased by itself for $29 I think check the neo-flash shop links on their forum, it is really just a nicer finish...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
