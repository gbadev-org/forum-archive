    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi
<br/>
<br/>
Firstly I have checked all the Forums but I cant find a solution to my problem and I dont think I am the only one with this problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I have all the right equipment, compatable wifi PCMCIA card, supercard 1.50 firmware, Multiboot Application 1.4, latest drivers etc but still have problems.
<br/>
<br/>
My problems is I cant get Flashme to run on my DS. I can send homebrew software to the DS via WiFiMe with no problems but when I try to send  the Flashme.nds file to the DS the black Nintendo logo starts to fade away on the top screen and then it freezes.
<br/>
<br/>
I have also tried the other way by putting the flashme.ds.gba file onto the CF card and then running that via WiFime but again when I run the flashme.ds.gba on DS it locks up a Gameboy logo. When in wifi mode the DS does show two screens with my CF contents on top screen and the Supercard logo on bottom screen so I guess the Supercard 1.50 has installed correctly, although if i try to reinstall firmware 1.50 it does come up on screen that I still have version 1.20  and that the new version is 1.50 but I read somewhere that this is a bug.
<br/>
<br/>
I have been told that there a certain key presses you can do on the DS to find out what version of firmware you have but I dont know what they are.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope someone can solve this soon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">simple: you MUST rename the flashme.ds.gba to flashme.nds before putting it on the CF card. I can almost guarantee it will work then (provided there isnt something else holding you back like booting into the SuperCard DS mode...).
<br/>
<br/>
as to the firmware of the SuperCard, hold L and R shoulders while the gba logo is onscreen as you are booting the SuperCard. Pressing A will cycle through the test menus and one of the screens has a version number on it.
<br/>
<br/>
That 1.20 thing is a bug, apparently it was fixed but the version of the download on the SuperCard site never changed...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
But an DS only accepts homebrews after flashme ? Or I'm wrong? (RSA verification, blah, blah...)
<br/>
<br/>
Try to rename flashme.ds.gba to flashme.ds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi
<br/>
I tried what you said and renamed the file but all I then got was two white screens.
<br/>
I have checked my SC firmware and it is 1.50
<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to do this with wifi only and not a Passme Card. 
<br/>
<br/>
If I rename the file to flashme.ds then nothing shows up on the DS screen
<br/>
<br/>
I presume you mean run wifi from PC, then click the renamed flashm.nds file on DS.
<br/>
<br/>
any more ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
UPDATE
<br/>
I have just noticed that I cant run any of the .ds.gba or nds.gba software via wifime. It is only official game demos I can run via wmb.exe and then send a .nds demo to the DS, maybe this will give you more of a clue as to my problem.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way I live in the UK and my DS is also UK</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I flashed my Nintendo DS firmware using wifi and supercard CF
<br/>
<br/>
Here's what I did
<br/>
<br/>
PREPARATION
<br/>
<br/>
Get a compatible WIFI PCI card
<br/>
<br/>
I used the ?17 sitecom wl-115 card from play.com:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://play.com/play247.asp?pa=sr&amp;page=title&amp;r=ELEC&amp;title=602457" target="_blank">http://play.com/play247.asp?pa=sr&amp;page=title&amp;r=ELEC&amp;title=602457</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Use this driver:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://users.belgacom.net/bn967347/download/rt2560_driver_1_0_0_8.zip" target="_blank">http://users.belgacom.net/bn967347/download/rt2560_driver_1_0_0_8.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Use this version of wmb.exe:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime/rt2560_app_wmb_1_1_fixed.zip" target="_blank">http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime/rt2560_app_wmb_1_1_fixed.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Download these files:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/ndsloader.bin" target="_blank">http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/ndsloader.bin</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/flashme.nds" target="_blank">http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/flashme.nds</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Run this command in windows command prompt in the dir containing the files
<br/>
<br/>
copy /b ndsloader.bin + flashme.nds flashme1.nds
<br/>
<br/>
copy flashme1.nds to your CF
<br/>
<br/>
FLASHING
<br/>
<br/>
start wmb.exe on the machine with the compatible wificard/driver on it
<br/>
<br/>
boot the DS and download the wireless multiboot program
<br/>
<br/>
The supercard menu should now pop up
<br/>
<br/>
run flashme1.nds
<br/>
<br/>
Follow the instructions on how to flash the firmware at:
