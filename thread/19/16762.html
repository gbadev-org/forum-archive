    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm looking for a flashcard for my DS Lite. I need it to be able to support homebrew and use Aim for the Ds and some kind of web browser so I can go on myspace and other sites. Can you help me pick a good quality flash card that will do what I need. I also need a microsd and it would be nice if you can refer me to a place to buy all of it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

most cards menus don't set the argv stuff, making nitroFS/libfilesystem not work. but we do have the homebrewmenu for that.<br/>_________________<br/>my blog:

There's nothing wrong with R4's, I've got 2 - R4 and R4i.
<br/>
<br/>
The R4i is using the HBMenu instead of the supplied launcher and I'm getting no problems with homebrew at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the team that made the original r4 quit a long time ago, so the only r4 cards that you can buy are fake ones that just use the name for its populairity, and thus many have a bad build quality, may not work on dsi 1.4 (or have no way to update in case nintendo releases 1.5) has little to no support, etc. 
<br/>
<br/>
if you have an r4 card and it works for you, good. but if you're looking for an card, you are better off looking for a card that isn't a fake of the r4. there aren't any downsides, and they are useally cheaper to.<br/>_________________<br/>my blog:
