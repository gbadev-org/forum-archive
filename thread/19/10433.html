If not then can the GBA Movie Player (SD Version) have multiple .nds files on it and then you can pick which to run?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What you want is Darkain's MultiNDS loader. You don't see much talk about it, because most people at this point use CF or SD based cartridges.
<br/>
You can get it here: <a href="http://www.darkain.com/ds/hack/" target="_blank">http://www.darkain.com/ds/hack/</a> -- I think you want "Final Multi-NDS Loader (includes teh everythings)"

There is zero support for using GBAMP-SD in DS mode currently, sorry. If it's like the GBAMP-CF, you can load small GBA multiboot(mb) homebrew, but that's about it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

M3-SD and SuperCard-SD will get the job done for you. I believe FAT support is a little better on M3, but SuperCard is being worked on so that may have changed since I looked. Look for threads from chishm about the FAT driver for the most up to date info.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's the problem, it can't run NDS homebrew unless there is a firmware hack that allows it to boot into NDS mode.  Untill someone provides Chishm with a GBA MP (SD), SD card, and he agrees to take on the task, it will probably NEVER be able to run NDS homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
But, using the standard firmware provided, it can run .mb.gba (GBA Homebrew) files under ~256k as is.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
