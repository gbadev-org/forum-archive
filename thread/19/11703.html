    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How come none mentions the screwdriver as something one has to obtain when talking about what's required for flashing the DS? Is it really that common to have such small tools to work with? Because I certainly don't.
<br/>
<br/>
Today, I went to the local hardware store to buy one today, but for tiny tools like this one, they only had kits available, the cheapest one at more than $30! I don't have this kind of money to spend, but using my PassMe2 ain't so cool either.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, the hardware guy allowed me to borrow the screwdriver I needed to open it up, but then I'd forgotten to put FlashMe on my SD card, so I wasn't able to flash it then, though he told I could come back tomorrow with the software. Cool guy, really. He said it sounded like fun to flash the console.
<br/>
<br/>
I read that it's really important for DSLs to use the AC adapter, but my DS' a blue v4 phatso, then it won't matter that much as long as I've recharged it fully, right? Because if not, I'll make myself a aluminium toothpick and go over there for some flashing fun tomorrow.
<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone else have to buy screwdrivers, or eventually open it another way?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A screwdriver of the size used for eyeglasses will usually work. I happened to have a set of jeweler's screwdrivers around the house, and my replacement DS battery came with a screwdriver.

If nothing else works, you can use a small, really pointy knife.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For the flashing I used a toothpick covered in foil.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
