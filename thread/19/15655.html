    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been saving for a slot1 card and found the M3 with Ram &amp; Rumble pack to be my solution of choice to purchase. With it, I'd also like to buy a Kingston 2GB  microSD.
<br/>
<br/>
So, how good is the M3? Assuming the R4 is the reference (at least from what I read.)
<br/>
<br/>
And, is the Kingston card any good?
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to buy it on tuesday (UTM+1), so, I appreciate fast responses. ;^D

Please vote and post your opinion.

Thanks for any advises! :^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's a Real. What's the difference? They are equally priced, but a Real set with an R&amp;R just costs 5? more and an R&amp;R+GBA would cost ~19?, if I bought it for the Simply. That's too much of a difference for me, at the moment.
<br/>
<br/>
And as I have some (little, but good) experience with the Cyclo DS Evolution, how does that compare?
<br/>
<br/>
Btw: What kinds of problems do you mean?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dunno what the difference is between a Real and a Simply. Hell, they could be just the same product rebranded! But I've had people mail me often about fat-related problems yet I never get mailed about R4 or M3 Simply problems!
<br/>
Also I have no idea what's in the RAM pack - some people have gotten it to work with my stuff just fine but others say it's a no go. Then I had someone contact me about the rumble problem...which I have no idea about!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The M3 Real is the current generation line of M3 Slot-1, so it is different from a M3 Simply/R4. 
<br/>
<br/>
M3 Real seems like a good selection, although I suggest the GBA Expansion Pack, as the Ezflash 3in1 ram pack I prefer. The latest firmware is M3 Sakura, which fixes slower speeds of the GUI and adds more eye candy. You don't get much from the ram pack, while with the GBA Expansion you get the ability to boot GBA files from the slot-1 menu.
<br/>
<br/>
Since it supports SDHC, I suggest getting a 4GB card. You'll need it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for all the info!
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I already have a SLOT2 solution, but without ram and rumble (got the official rumble pack, though). Also, why would I need a 4GB card? I was even thinking of getting just a 1 GB card, as I use the NDS *only* for dev (I have only one game, Metroid Prime Pinnball, hence the rumble pack, and the Metroid Hunters demo). :^)
<br/>
<br/>
How does the EzFlash differ in Ram? Is it fater / more Ram?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I'm asking so much, but I want to get 100% sure before I spend *all* the money I currently have on some potentially unsatisfying hardware. :^/
<br/>
<br/>
And I wonder what that person, who voted for the last option might have to say? Anonymous posts are useless. ;^)
<br/>

If I find something funny about the hardware, I'll sure post it. After a little testing, I found it to work quite nicely, so I suggest, this can be closed or even deleted.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The only problem that I am having, is that the peeps in the shop sold me a lite R&amp;R pack. Leaving the shop I have checked the set  and found, that out.
<br/>
So, I turned around and told them, that the website states it's for NDSp &amp; NDSl, and because I only have a good old trusty phatty, I couldn't use it.
<br/>
Long story short, I asked for an adapter and they gave me *something*... Looks like a GBA cartridge replavement shell... Well, I guess they thought it was easy to just throw the guts over, I can only guess, but where the heck would I put the rumble motor? There's no save spot (the original shell has a special molding)! It's totally incompatible!
<br/>
Well, at least it was free, but I wouldn't mind paying two or three bucks for the damn adapter. Prescious frikkin RAM. Bummer.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything I can do? Can someone point out some sort of "extension"?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm pleased with the slot1 cart so far and it's a multitude of factors easier to handle than the old device. Plus, now I can watch movies on my mobile phone (with higher resolution, but only on *one* screen simultaniously! X^D) *and* the handheld! That's "fantastic"! &lt;/sarcasm&gt; Yay! :^D
<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, I think the NDS is the best multimedia device aroud (I know of.)
