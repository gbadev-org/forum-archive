    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hello,
<br/>
<br/>
Im sure this question has been asked before which does put me off asking a bit, but is there anyway to use a <span style="font-weight: bold">wpc54g</span> pcmcia card to transfer files to DS?
<br/>
<br/>
It's quite a common card so that's why i ask.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help/answer :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">most likly reason is that when you instal a driver, instal the cutom made driver for the pcmcia card which is wifime. To get the app and the driver. Go to <a href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php" target="_blank">http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php</a> and get the driver and app, next, you'll need to uninstall your current wifi driver. But be warned, this takes the wifi part out, so you can't go online unless you ethir have another wifi card or ethernet cable. Now instal the driver, also before the installing the driver app, just to make sure your doing it right. Go back to <a href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php" target="_blank">http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php</a> and follow the directions on how to instal it correctlly. If the instals a success, then your wifi cards supported, also you could just check on the listed cards part of the site to see if it is supported.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, sorry about that seems the answear is no lol :D
<br/>
<br/>
Im going to buy a Belkin F5D7010 which should work according to: <a href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">http://ralink.rapla.net/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
However it says </span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">F5D7010
<br/>
v2/3000au/3001* 
<br/>
<br/>
* chipset depends on card revision/version (could be Accton, ADMtek, Agere, Atheros, Atmel, Broadcom, Conexant, Envara, Inprocomm, Intel, Marvell, Realtek, SiS, Texas Instruments, VIA, ZyDAS or some other).</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
The one on ebay is
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Part Number F5D7010 / 3000uk</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
You think there will be a problem since it states 3000au and this one is 3000uk?
<br/>
<br/>
Also on the page where you get drivers from it says it's v3 not v2 however this could be the driver.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
