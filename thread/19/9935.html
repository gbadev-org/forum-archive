My ez-flash 2 PS no longer seems to work with new .nds files.
<br/>
<br/>
I used to be able to patch a few files to .gba format but now nothing works!
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a lot of time to read through guides and faq... so please be as thorough as possible with your help.
<br/>
<br/>
thank you very much!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have had a similar experience with my EFA-Linker.
<br/>
<br/>
The EFA client also messes up the header, so when I flashed my V4 DS and others with the pre-lite build of Flashme V7, I had to prepend the loader, but after that all was fine.
<br/>
<br/>
The first Lite I helped flash however, I prepended the loader as normal, but all I got was a corrupt GBA bios screen - the difference was that I was using the lite-firmware-included build Flashme V7. It was really quite embarassing, because I was trying to help this dude flash it (he probably hangs around here) but nothing would work, and had me very confused at the time.
<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is, I had in fact used the Lite build of Flashme V7 earlier on a standard DS - but only to restore a messed up flash as some guy found a non-working DS lying around in the apartment he was moving into - the difference was, since I didn't need my passme 2 to restore it, I didn't have to include the EFA client's NDS loader/menu on the cart (I still prepended the actual file), because using the loader/menu is the only way you can select which sram data you want to use.
<br/>
<br/>
So either it just doesn't like flashing Lites, or the latest firmware itself is just incompatible with my cart (and I would suspect possibly others too) for some reason - or a combination of both.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
