    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dont want to sound cliche, but its going to happen anyway, so im sory that this has been asked 17^42 times already...
<br/>
<br/>
Im on the way to sorting out my DS and this is the understanding i have gained from this site, but im not sure if ive got things quite right...
<br/>
<br/>
I have a silver DS (MK:DS bundle) i did the firmware test by removing the DS kart when in pictochat room 1 - green screens (firmware 3 i think)
<br/>
<br/>
I have 2 options - to use pass me2 each time i want to play with my homebrew apps (not voiding the warranty of my DS), or to flash my DS and change the firmware which can be done via either WIFI me or with passme2 and the CF GBA thing.
<br/>
<br/>
I can then load up homebrew apps from the CF GBA thing and run them ( how does this part work, do you select it in the start screen the same way you select to play GBA games?)
<br/>
<br/>
My other question is can someone direct me to a UK online store 
<br/>
where i can buy the stuff?
<br/>
<br/>
Any and all help will be much appreceated!
<br/>
<br/>

edit: 1 more thing - i keep hearing about "old and new" DS, how do i tell the difference and what would mine be?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Yata^Duck on Tue Jan 24, 2006 2:15 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Since you have FW3, you won't need PassME2. I personally prefer flashing the DS and then sticking the little red-and-white back on the SL1 slot. If you don't mind something sticking out of the DS' back, go for PassME (you'll need it for FlashME anyways).
<br/>
<br/>
"The CF GBA Thingie" is actually called GBAmp ( <a href="http://www.movieadvance.com" target="_blank">www.movieadvance.com</a> ).
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you flash your GBAmp then load a multiboot application (the best one right now is MoonShell since Mighty Max is gone) as _BOOT_MP.nds on the CF. Afterwards, you just put your (homebrew, of course) applications and games on the CF and you're all set.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the fast reply - maybe too fast the plastic in my wallet cant take the strain ;) (hey what are student loans for!?!)
<br/>
<br/>
"sticking the little red-and-white back on the SL1 slot" what do you mean by that and what is the SL1 slot?
<br/>
<br/>
"go for PassME (you'll need it for FlashME anyways)" So i do deffinatly need passme? I cant just use wifime to flash my DS? That would be a shame as i needed an excuse to get a wifi card. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the link aswell, i much prefer to buy from the UK; it jsut makes things easier for me :)
<br/>
<br/>
As for movies, what format do they play in and roughly how big would a 2 hour movie be, so i know what size CF card to buy.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeh, ive seen those M3 things and it says they give the system an extra 32mb of ram, where would i need something like that, or is that onlysomething devs would need?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks again for all the help :)
<br/>
<br/>
One more thing - not related to the rest, but i have a load of GB and GBC games lying around, although i still have my GBC i would much prefer to be able to play it on my DS, is there a way to do this using some sort of adaptor or mod of some sort?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you could use wifime, as you have firmware older than v4. i don't know what happened to the list of compatible cards, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, you can use WiFiME.
<br/>
<br/>
Pick a PCI or PCMCIA WiFi card from this list in a local store ;)

EDIT: I think 2 hours of movie in DPG format is about 180MB ...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
