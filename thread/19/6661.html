    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't seem to sleep the game. When I close the lid of the DS with the retail verison of AW:DS, it chops up and keeps turning the lcd's on and off, while chopping up the sound as well. It doesn't crash or anything, it just can't figure out whether or not to sleep itself and keeps turning on and off. Other games sleep fine, and I haven't reflashed with the original firmware to test, because I'm afraid to heh.

Whoa weird. Maybe your sleep magnet got demagnetized or something? I was messing with my gf's DS by touching its right speaker to my DS's ABXY buttons and making it go to sleep, and it seemed to have the same effect that you describe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The same thing has been happening to me with Nintendogs on a DS without flashme. I think it may be my flash cart, because when I take it out and start Nintendogs I don't have the sleep problem. I'm still going to email Nintendo about it, I just won't mention the flash cart part.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I am now 99.9% sure it is my flash cart making my DS do this. I tested it with other games in the GBA slot and with nothing in the slot, and I have had no problem with sleep mode. I guess I won't be emailing Nintendo now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That is pretty weird...I have Nintendogs, haven't actually played it yet without my flashcart inserted and I have no problems...hm, maybe both games have hooks for a game expansion option pak or something, and the code doesn't like your GBA flashcart?

Something about the GBA slot and flash cards interfering with the sleep process..I really don't think it's a magnetic issue...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i'd flash the regular firmware back and see if it still happens, but i don't actually have a passme or compatible wifi card as my firmware was generously flashed by somebody on this board.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ah, I didn't know that.  which one do you need?  Does it work with both Advance Wars GBA games?  I wonder if it is possible that certain GBA flashcarts are interfering with this and causing weird problems?

Hmm..if that's the case though wouldn't people be having problems with other games that do this like Feel the Magic (and I think WarioWare: touched! does also)?<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well that's pretty cool actually.  I'd also like to note that I discovered that I have this sleep mode problem with my GBAMP inserted while playing Nintendogs.  It's like it keeps trying to go to sleep mode but for some reason can't, and so keeps on going.
<br/>
<br/>
Weird.  I should have thought to test this before with my GBAMP.  If no one else does I'll flash my NDS back to the original firmware and see if it still does it later.  If it doesn't then we can eliminate that as a suspect of this weird behaviour.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Grrr... Sold AW 1 by accident. I had them all packed in boxes and didn't bring Rainbox 6 instead of Advance Wars. Every game should have its own colour. Seriously, it would be cool.
<br/>
I'll have to use a friends' copy....
<br/>
<br/>
That's a very cool feature though. The addition of a seperate gba slot was a fantastic move by Nintendo. In fact, it's one of the best features :)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!
