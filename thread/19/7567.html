They ship to Aus (I got it in about 4 days) but I'm not sure if they have Paypal as an option.

If you purchased your DS recently the passkey that comes with the M3 will not work because of the new firmware in these systems. The M3 team are working on Passkey2 which should be compatible with the new firmware DS models.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I used VISA and the transaction went through without a hitch. Shipping was surprisingly fast considering it was international and only costs $5 USD, which is pretty cheap.
<br/>
<br/>
You're lucky to have an earlier model DS. I got the Mario Kart DS bundle about a week ago and the new firmware on my system means I can't use my Passkey unless I re-program the chip inside it. But thats another story and while I haven't been successful yet I'm going to try with 3 more games tomorrow.

Hope the M3 works out for you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Passkey wont work if you have a <span style="font-weight: bold">new firmware / recent model DS.</span> It should work with Mario Kart, and any other game according to M3. The problem lies in the new firmware, not Mario Kart.
<br/>
<br/>
I was just pointing out that I <span style="font-weight: bold">recently</span> purchased my DS in a Mario Kart bundle and thats why the Passkey doesn't work for me. If you have an older DS you should be ok.
<br/>
<br/>
The prices are in US dollars, so you're looking at about $133 Australian dollars (including shipping).

I purchased from Divineo last week and they proved to be fast and reliable. But you should use your own judgement when purchasing anything online, there are several other sites selling the M3. Do a search on Google.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
