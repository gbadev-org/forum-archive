    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So sorry if this isn't the right forum.  I'm a noob when it comes to ds dev.  Can you tell me if this is all that would be required to run homebrew?

CF:

(SuperCard CF - see Retailer Feedback)

The reason I posted the MS to CF is because I have three gigabytes worth of those and no CFs.  Thank you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Before you buy anything, you'll also need to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/pass/#takemeout" target="_blank">TakeMeOut</a> to see which firmware version is installed on your DS. I'd also recommend buying a MAX Media Launcher instead of a PassKey.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I don't know if anyone has ever tested a MS-&gt;CF adaptor with a Supercard before, so you're kinda in uncharted waters there. Plus the fact its gonna stick way out of your DS. I would recommend spending the $30 on a 256mb CF card (or even 512MB, you can find them on sale for under $30 sometimes)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, thank you guys, I was thinking about the whole sticking out of the system thing, and I think I will just spend that money on a CF card.  Thanks guys, that's all I wanted to know, this topic can be closed now if you wish.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
