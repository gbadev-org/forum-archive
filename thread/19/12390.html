    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm a bit confused by all the passkeyness and what have you of soft-modding, but I was browsing and found the <span style="font-weight: bold">R4 product</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
If I understand correctly this, plus a MicroSD card, would be all I would need?
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any particular opinions on this product? Would it be more beneficial to get a flash cart + passkey? This seems more economical.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SLOT-1 solutions such as R4 cannot run GBA homebrew. You'll need a SLOT-2 card (such as SuperCard or M3) for that. If you get SuperCard + SuperKey, you can run both GBA homebrew and DS homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're not interested in GBA, then a Slot-1 solution will be fine for you. There's some homebrew that makes use of the extra memory that slot-2 carts have, but you could probably buy Opera DS and use its RAM expansion cart if any of that homebrew interests you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You suggest SC Lite + SC DS; that could work. The SC Lite+SuperKey would probably be cheaper though. Just avoid the rumble series.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does the Supercard not have a GBA shell?
<br/>
If it doesn't, there's always the M3 Lite, which can be put into a shell to work on the DS Phats and real GBAs. Of course, the M3 is more expensive than the Supercard.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
