    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been doing GBA homebrew for a few years now, and want to get into the DS soon. I preordered a DS Lite, so I should have that in the next two weeks. I've already got a 128 Mb Flash2Advance flash cartridge, and I've got an extra Compact Flash card lying around I don't use (16 MB one that came with my digital camera).
<br/>
<br/>
What else do I need to buy to get started with homebrew? I'm not fond of the idea of flashing the firmware on the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Start by just buying a MAX Media Launcher ($20 + S&amp;H). Currently <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9746" target="_blank">only one retailer</a> sells it. Then you can run DS homebrew on your F2A cart (provided you don't sell the GBA).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
