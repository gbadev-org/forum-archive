    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A few questions I need to know about WiFiMe or WMB for an alternate project.
<br/>
<br/>
1. This Download Play chip I've read about, is this where the demos and PassMe code is stored and run from? Or in the DS's 4MB of RAM?
<br/>
<br/>
2. How big is this Download Play chip exactly? Or at least, how big of a demo/program could it hold?
<br/>
<br/>
3. Is there a Wiki or other open refrence as to the technical details, such as memory addresses and such?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for any help to any of these questions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">WMB is a Windows program to send .nds files (or WifiMe) using the DS Download Play protocol.
<br/>
<br/>
WifiMe (<span style="font-weight: bold">wmb -data wifime</span>) is a DS Download Play exploit that redirects execution to the GBA slot. It works only with old DS firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
In general, sending .nds files (<span style="font-weight: bold">wmb -data electroplankton.nds</span>) works with clean dumps of official demos, but not homebrew or patched pirate roms, unless you've already installed FlashMe.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, thank you. However, the wiki you linked to was not of the kind of... technical level I was looking for. Also, the question as to where the demos/homebrews are stored while running and the size of this area are the most important to me. 
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if this is true, but I had HEARD of a chip in the DS dedicated specifically for storing the downloaded portions of the game you're playing, leaving the 4MB of RAM free for processing. Is this true, or is the game stored in the DS's 4MB of RAM?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As with multiboot on GBA, the downloaded DS program is stored in the 4 MB of RAM. The 'text', 'rodata', and 'data' sections are sent, and then the 'bss' and heap have to come out of the rest of the 4 MB.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
