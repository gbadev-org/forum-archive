Each tutorial tells me something different.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The absolute cheapest way to get started, and the only way to get started if you have no access to a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debit_card" target="_blank">debit card</a>, is with Datel's "Games n' Music" accessory (available for $20-$30 where DS accessories are sold). If you're willing to shop online, and you want a faster and more reliable card, buy an R4 adapter ($40 at several online stores; check the Retailer Feedback forum) and a 1 GB microSD card (probably $20 at an office supply store).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Of course, again, I'm not sure what that is in $, so the GnM might be cheaper.<br/>_________________<br/>My favourite DS apps:

That'd be true in the (GBA) Flash Equipment forum, but for DS mode, you also need to buy a NoPass, and in some places that's almost as expensive as the GnM, which comes with a bundled generic microSD card and microSD writer.
<br/>
<br/>
The second thing you <span style="font-style: italic">might</span> need to buy is a C book. Stay far away from anything by Herbert Schildt. What programming experience do you have?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So scratch the Games 'n Music and go for the NoPass?
<br/>
or get both?
<br/>
<br/>
█I also don't have any GBA games, if that matters at all...
<br/>
<br/>
I know certain basics of programming (whilst looking through beginner tutorials, I could understand some of it.) 
<br/>
I'll probably check out the flea market for a 50? dummies C book.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd say get the GnM if it's cheap, as you can use it as a NoPass if you decide to buy a Slot-2 device.  The only reason you'd need a Slot-2 device would be if that:
<br/>
<br/>
A. The homebrew didn't support the GnM, which most does now anyway
<br/>
B. You wanted to use Slot-2 for extra RAM, which the forthcoming QuakeDS release will do</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I own both a GBAMP v2 and a Games n' Music, and it's a decent setup.  The Games n' Music is not only the cheapest slot-1 out there, it's also probably the cheapest (maybe not, but close) NoPass out there, and it's definitely the most available one.  I use my GnM to boot my GBAMP into DS mode if there is homebrew that requires a GBAMP or older system, but most things use the new libfat and support DLDI.  The only downside is that the GBAMP has no RAM, so I should probably get like an M3CF or SCCF if they're still around.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
