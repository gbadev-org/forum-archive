    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so i purchased a passme2.  since i recieved it last night i have had no luck getting flashme to work (thinking i knew what i was doing.)  well i find out today that all along the DS is supposed to recognize a game if it is inserted into the passme2 and then inserted into the system.  so it isn't a problem with the SRAM, etc, the DS simply won't recognize the Passme2!
<br/>
<br/>
i have it inserted properly.  i have tried holding it in every position it goes and putting pressure at every angle while booting.  the ds simply says "no ds cart inserted" or whatever and has the option to boot from GBA highlighted.  i even tested all the connections from the chip to the connections that contact the DS (except the 3rd one over because it lacks a line on the circuit board) and they're all fine.  the ds cart seems to fit into the passme properly and it looks like they should be making fine contact.  ANY suggestions?  i am about to conclude that the passme is faulty or i have some ultra new ds that has already trumped the passme2.

thanks....
