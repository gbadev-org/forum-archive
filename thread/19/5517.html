But for my personal opinion, I don't think you're going to get the answer you're looking for on these forums.  Here, it's strictly homebrew.  Any topics that help to run commercial games illegally (ie. making a BIN work on PassMe) get that information removed, sometimes the topic is locked, and depending on the person's history / insistance / annoyance factor, he/she/(it?) is banned / removed / erased from existance.
<br/>
<br/>
In other words, I wish you luck.  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'll take this opportunity to also mention that I'm just trying to help a newcomer to this forum to stay a member.  I don't mean offense, just be careful what you ask for.

Benefit of the doubt. It's a good thing.

Almost. I maintain the GBA developer FAQ, not a hypothetical DS developer FAQ. I don't have a Nintendo DS, nor a PSP, nor even a PS2.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you can convert .nds into .nds.gba very easily
<br/>
in ndslib, go to the examples/tools directory, and run  (either dsbuild or dsbuilder, i forget)
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">dsbuilder.exe game.nds game.nds.gba</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
and then flash the game.nds.gba to the gba flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
to convert an arm9.bin and an arm7.bin into a game.nds, you can use ndstool.exe
<br/>
<br/>
