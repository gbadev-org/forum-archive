That's just a picture. Without at least an 'alt' attribute on the 'img' element, I don't put much faith in any implication that the WiFiMe project is closed for good. Specifically, right below the image is a link to "Download". The site isn't closed for real until either 1. the downloads are removed or 2. the downloads aren't updated in months or 3. some explanation of the image is added.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Hopefully it isn't permanently.  It worries me a bit though that it would say that on the front page though, and it's not April, so... then again, as far as I know people are working on a Linux WMB app, and Firefly is among them, so that's a good sign.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I mean, yeah it would help the vampire effect a bit, but anyone who has the means of loading a Wifime server on their DS could just SHARE said means and load Flashme on the other.

Demo server is still a good idea, but none of it makes the passthrough methods any easier.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Then again, they couldn't block it without destroying compatability with the game.  That'd be funny.

<br/>
But at least making sense of a disassembly of SM64 WMB code is potentially doable now that the DS Wi-Fi registers are documented. The only potentially critical roadblock is if there's yet another digital signature on the client code.

The same way that Microsoft couldn't block the MechAssault exploit.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
