That's a nice feature for a flash card in my opinion because I always have lots of ideas for simple improvement that could be made to flash cards.

If you don't want the card to DLDI patch a file, you could always remove the magic DLDI string from the file, making it unpatchable. Look for the byte sequence ED A5 8D BF 20 43 68 69 73 68 6D 00 01 0B 0C 00 (0xBF8DA5ED followed by " Chishm" with a NUL terminator).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, yes there are other compatibility problems.  I've been meaning to post about this and ask what the likely cause of the problkem was, but I wanted to do more testing first.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't yet gotten around to compiling specific tests, but it seems like PAFS and GBFS do not work at all with this card.  Homebrews that use either of those embedded file systems will begin to load up, but report that they cannot find their files.   EFS does seem to work, though.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know what the problem might be here?  I think I remember hearing that one or both of those file systems also don't work with the GBAMP, so maybe the reason for the incompatibility is known in the community (assuming it's the same or a similar problem with both cards).
<br/>
<br/>
The other downside of the CycloDS for homebrew is that since the card uses automatic DLDI patching, they haven't released a DLDI driver file for it.  This means that apps like DSChannels or the homebrew launching feature of DSOrganize can't be used.  Nobody has asked Team Cyclops to release the driver, though, so maybe they would, I don't know.  (In fact, I'll go ask on their forums right now.)
<br/>
<br/>
The R4 now supports automatic DLDI patching and also the main non-homebrew (i.e. piracy) related selling point that the CycloDS had when it was released, so I don't really know if there's any solid reasons to pick a CycloDS over an R4 any more, considering the price difference.
<br/>
<br/>
The one thing that the CycloDS still has going for it is a really open and responsive development team.  They have a suggetsions forum on their website and they really seem to be listening to people's suggestions.  They haven't released a new firmware since shortly after the card launched, but it will be very interesting to see how many of the user suggestions are implemented when they do put out a new one.  Many nice features have been suggested, though most of those wouldn't really be necessary (or even applicable) to homebrews.  The CycloDS could end up having the most fully customizable GUI of any card, though, which in my opinion would be a really nice feature.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm totally happy with my CycloDS, but maybe I'd be just as happy (and $30 richer) if I'd gotten an R4.

While I'm fine with 2GB cards for most things, I wonder if it might be worth the better future-proving to spend the extra money? Maybe not. I've yet to fill up my 2GB SD card I've been using for Moonshell and they're inexpensive enough to just buy another one. I'm also wondering if the ability to reset from the ABXYLR menu can be used for homebrew to soft-reset it? Or is it not accessible from homebrew? The SuperCard DS One now offers something like this.

The "Enhanced Mode" menu where you can select soft reset and change the backlight brightness and stuff like that doesn't work with homebrew.

<br/>
<br/>
Apparently the DLDI file you linked to at DrunkenCoders is mislabeled.  It's actually the DLDI driver for CycloDS's slot-2 card.  But I posted on the Team Cyclops forum asking if they'd release the driver for the Evolution so that we can use apps like DSOrganize and DSChannels and the moderator said they would.  Their DLDI driver does pass the DLDI Tester tests, by the way.
<br/>
<br/>
They also released a new firmware today which is supposed to fix the problem with DSLinux, though I haven't tested to make sure it works.  The new firmware is considered a "beta" since they weren't able to get a certain feature working that they promised would be present in the 1.2 firmware, but they wanted to release the firmware anyway since it has a number of other features people have been asking for.

Ah, okay, that makes sense.  Does PAFS work the same way or should those homebrews work on slot-1 cards?

It seems someone already suggested support for soft reset in all homebrew. It would probably be worth mentioning that SuperCard is doing this now. Might have a bit more incentive to make it happen.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

One important feature regarding DLDI imho is, whether the DLDI
<br/>
driver has proper initialization code. Some drivers simply do no initialization (e.g. <a class="postlink" href="http://dldi.drunkencoders.com/index.php?title=R4_DS" target="_blank">R4DS</a>),
<br/>
which is a problem when using WMB to transfer libfat-enabled 
<br/>
programs to the NDS: they simply do not work then, since the
<br/>
SD card is not initialized.
<br/>
<br/>
Therefore I decided recently to purchase an EZ-V, which has 
<br/>
proper initialization code , so I can do a 'make - dldipatch - wmb' 
<br/>
chain for development.
<br/>
<br/>
For DLDI driver without source it is difficult to decide, tough.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I haven't actually tried, but I think it's safe to assume that it does not apply the Evolution DLDI driver to homebrews (it should work fine with other homebrew, though).  The only source change they mention having made to Moonshell was to remove the unnecessary warning screen that gets displayed briefly during boot up.

Of course, the cart already has a DLDI autopatcher, correct?  Are they providing this so developers can release pre-patched versions or something?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah. Sweater Fish Deluxe requested that they release it for the loader apps like DSO and DSChannels or anything else that doesn't work with the autopatching. I added my voice to it and a few more people chimed in. I'm really starting to like Team Cyclops and their support. It's a factor that really swayed me to buy one.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

Here's what TeamCyclops reports:

Download it <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cyclopsds.com/downloads/CycloEvoDLDI_v1.1.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. There have been quite a few changes from the last file released, most notably:
<br/>
<br/>
    * Now contains full SD init code. This means it will work with both standard and SDHC MicroSD cards, and it should work with homebrew executed via WMB (untested) or other alternative loading methods, allowing you to completely bypass loading through the CycloDS Evolution GUI if you wish. We've personally tested the driver by loading homebrew from slot2 CycloDS, which works fine.
<br/>
    * Various workarounds are included to enable support for the various ways in which 3rd party loaders use the DLDI driver. Its been tested to work with DSOrganise (Chishm loading method only), DSChannels and Chishm's standalone loader.
<br/>
<br/>
This is the same DLDI driver which is included in the new v1.2 BETA #3 firmware. Unless you're not using CycloDS Evolution to actually load your homebrew (which would be the case if you're executing code via WMB) then you dont actually need to manually patch anything, even in the case of 3rd party loaders.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
I've tested it with Chishm's NDS_loader, DSOrganize 2.9, and DSChannels Beta 5. NDS_loader and DSO launch and run without issue, but apps launched from DSChannels can't read from the memory card unless they are manually DLDI patched. Considering that DSO seems to permanently patch what it launches, all that needs to be done is launch them from DSO once and they'll work. I'd say this is a pretty substantial update!<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL
