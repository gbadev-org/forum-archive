    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My 4th Generation iPod 20GB broke recently and almost every part is dead except the hard drive which I want to use with my GBAMP. I noticed that you could make a CF card and the HDD 2.5" hdd compatible. Then I found this <a class="postlink" href="http://linitx.com/viewproduct.php?prodid=11521" target="_blank">CompactFlash to 1.8" HDD adapter</a> It looks pretty simple in the way that the pins have to be remapped. Unfortunatly I cannot find the schematics and I do not have enough time to figure it out because I am on vacation right now for 2 weeks. If someone could map this out I would really appreciate it and I would create a tutorial on how to assemble this beast.
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: My iPod HDD only uses 3.3v which means it wouldn't even need an external powersupply.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That adapter goes the other way: plug a CF card into a 1.8" or 2.5" ATA slot, not plug a 1.8" ATA drive into a CF slot. I guess the project of wiring up an adapter that goes the opposite way is something you can look forward to for two weeks.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've seen people make a CF to 1.8" converter to pu CF cards in an ipod, the the other way round should be simple. Natrium42 did this with a laptop drive, both the drives and the CF card use ide so all you need to do is find the pinout for the CF and the pinout for the HDD.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried this a couple of times, but it turned out my HDD was dead so I gave up.
<br/>
<br/>
you will need to remember that th pin layout is different for both devices.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">@tepples: I am 99% sure the other way around does not require anything like a transistor/capacitor. If you look a little harder (but not too hard :D), that is a step-down transistor for the power supply. Also the capacitor and the resistor are for the LED. So basically those have nothing to to do with CF-&gt;1.8" HDD. I would be able to figure out the rest from that picture but the CF connector covers visibility of the traces.
<br/>
<br/>
@spinal_cord: I don't really feel I should follow that pinout if you say your HDD died :P.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I am in iDaho and I can barely find a access point that gives me 2 bars.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I just realized from another product on there that a CFII is compatible with a 1.8" HDD</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The HDD was damaged before I started, I took it out of an ipod. It was dropped too many times, the ipod barely worked (kept not detecting the drive).

<br/>
The pin numbers on the 1.8" are the same as the 3.5" but are in a different physical location..<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After too much research for something so simple, spinal_cord is right. I should be back on Tuesday and I will immediately finish this project (along with 2 other DS hardware related ones). If anyone cares, my two other projects involve changing my Supercard Mini SD Rumble to a Supercard SD rumble, and the other getting a DS firmware developing machine setup. It will be a DS without a topscreen and speakers, and yes it will have a ppflash setup. I hope everybody enjoys that CreeboMe will be tested for bricking.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
