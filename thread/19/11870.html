I am going to buy a Passme1, and GBA MP. What confuses me so is the backup tools, like RAIN/REIN and ETool,  if your wondering I am plaining on running animal map for my acww game, and a few other Homebrew's such as Moonshell and well too many to name as long as I can cram them on my GBA MP. I also am slightly confused by the GBA MP patch to run DS HB on it so if it could be re stated for me that'd be great.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
