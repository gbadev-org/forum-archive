But only after I got my DS did I try to run the libnds examples in emulators. At that point I got discouraged because available emulators could not run them correctly. This would require me to run each build on hardware each time, and I'd have to play <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_chairs" target="_blank">musical</a> CF cards after each build in order to do so. I've been in school for the last few months, or I'd have had more time to play musical CF cards.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

EDIT: Headspin is right. DSemu and iDeaS run at least Chris Double's second tutorial the same way my DS does.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Yeah split this topic :) Anyways, these are the caveats we as programmers face. You can't stop coding for DS because the emu's arn't up to scratch. It's time to accept that testing is harder than usual and go with it. Look at all the software made so far with this issue. If you are really having problems hot swapping then get yourself a wifi card that will allow you to send your stuff directly to the NDS download play. That is pretty quick. Everyone else is finding a way to dev on DS, why arn't you?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Dualis supports that fine, there's something else wrong. It does appear to be related to use of iprintf in some way but not specifically related to the divide.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, the code in this thread
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9359" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9359</a>
<br/>
<br/>
If the problem was the / operator then no code using that would work on Dualis ever. Obviously that isn't the case.
<br/>
<br/>
If it were a code issue - either programmer error or a bug in devkitARM/libnds then it wouldn't work on hardware or other emulators. Since the code works on hardware, DeSmuME and no$gba that isn't the case either.
<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly iDeaS suffers from what appears to be an identical issue</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Not if I have homework due, and I have obligations to volunteer for a few hours at the local veterans' hospital three times a week, and I occasionally have to babysit elementary-school-age cousins.

Because when I originally made my shopping list, I neglected to include a Ralink wireless card because I was not aware of the limitations of the emulators.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
