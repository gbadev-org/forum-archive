I have a DS Lite and an M3 + MML. I want to flash it because I'm afraid the MML is going to ruin my DS slot and consumes energy.
<br/>
<br/>
I have an M3 but I buy all the games I really want. Since that is, still, the main reason for purchasing the Lite in the first place, I wouldn't want to jeopardize that. 
<br/>
<br/>
So: Should I be afraid that somewhere in the future, Nintendo will equip their games with software that hunts down the flashed firmware and stops working? Or Wifi sensors that might exclude me of the network once they noticed my firmware is flashed? 
<br/>
<br/>
Flashing it seems handy, but I don't want to buy a game and find out nothing works anymore on my firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone?

MAX Media Launcher won't ruin your DS slot if you use a utility knife (such as X-Acto brand) to make the locking notch a bit deeper. And it doesn't drain your battery if you eject it once the menu starts.

To prevent an unnecessary lock, I'll rephrase the question without any piracy implications:
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo DS games running from authentic Game Cards do not permanently ban the user from the network if they find modified firmware. Xbox games running from authentic discs do. The question is whether future DS games will act like Xbox games.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>

Indeed, a nice rephrase.
<br/>
<br/>
Like I tried to explain, I don't care about roms not working, but if I somehow jeopardize the running of authentic cartridges by flashing my DS, I'd rather not.
<br/>
<br/>
Realistic fear?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Now that is just funny..  tepples rephrased your question because you are a pirate.. you then thank him for refrashing...  and state again that you are a pirate..  nice..
<br/>
<br/>
If you weren't a pirate, the fact that roms might noy work wouldn't even be an issue nor need to even be mentioned.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"I don't care about roms not working" implies that Ennead is familiar with ROMs. The use of lowercase term "roms" to refer specifically to pirated games (as opposed to mask ROM technology itself) is common on yo-ho-heaven. From this I can see how Lynx might infer pirate motives.
<br/>
<br/>
But the Spirit allows me to give the benefit of the doubt. So let me reiterate the only question that should be discussed in this topic. If this topic remains unproductive in this respect, I'll lock and split it.

Chester buys a DS, a MAX Media Launcher, and some homebrew storage device. He installs FlashMe and uses it to run MoonShell and various other homebrew programs. Is it likely that Nintendo will change its policy to ban Chester's DS from playing new DS Game Cards or from connecting to Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection using a Game Card that supports it?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nintendo do have the ability to block FlashMe with future DS games, but most likely won't due to the problems of keeping track of the multiple revisions of the official firmware. They could get WFC games to download hashes of the official firmware to check against, but then they will lose a few customers. Whether they care enough about FlashMe to do this I cannot say, but be assured that you can change the MAC address of the DS easily. It is not as hard as with an Xbox (where once a console is banned you have to change the EPROM).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, thanks Chism.
<br/>
<br/>
To the rest of you, I said "I don't care if roms don't work" JUST to make sure that the answering focussed on authentic cartridges, and that noone would misunderstand me. I mention the M3 as a reason for flashing, so one could easily assume I'm not just referring to official games. So I tried to prevent that by emphasizing it's about authentic cards through stating it's NOT about the alternative.
<br/>
<br/>
I understand how this could be taken the wrong way too though, so sorry for confusing up the rephrase again ;).
<br/>
<br/>
But Chisms answer is very clear, so I feel comfortable flashing up the Lite. So feel free to lock this now.
<br/>
<br/>
PS: I love how the lowercasing of the word "rom" was interpreted. Very sharp! I buy my games though, wouldn't be asking this if I wasn't.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#105817 - Lynx - Thu Oct 12, 2006 6:51 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It wasn't so much as the lower case 'roms' as the context it is being used in..  And not trying to drag this back into the gutter but here is my point:
<br/>
<br/>
"I don't care if roms don't work" reads to me:
<br/>
<br/>
"I play pirate roms, but I don't care if they no longer work, as long as the official games I purchased still work."
<br/>
<br/>
Where as, someone that doesn't care about pirate roms at all, would not have brought them up, as there is no need to mention them.
<br/>
<br/>
But, now that I reread the original post, none of this makes any sense to me either.. 
<br/>
<br/>
But, I think they have fixed the MML issues.. Check your MML against an official DS game card.  Compare the click in notch to see if they are physically different.  The one I reviewed had a smaller notch, but since, people have posted that theirs looks exactly the same as an official game.  I'd like to here if yours is the same or not.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I compared the notch to an original gamecard, and it seemed about the same size actually.
<br/>
<br/>
It does seem as though the MML is somewhat fatter though, I notice that other cards get in and out a bit easier, whereas the MML tends to be a rather tight fit. This is why I'm somewhat worried.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the size in notch difference is supposed to be real small though, and I just don't notice it.
<br/>
<br/>
If I can find myself a digital camera I can try to make a picture of the notches.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'll try and make a picture of my MML next to an ordinary cart though, and perhaps it can clear up some of the differences that are and aren't.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
