    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you have pretty much anything but a GBA Movie Player v2 (such as a SuperCard, an M3, or a traditional GBA flash card) it becomes even easier.

<br/>
<br/>
But from what you've written, it appears that swimgod has a SuperPass 2 (not a SuperCard) and a GBA Movie Player v2. First we have to find that pushbutton SRAM for Metroid or Mario Kart. As I said, I don't know whether it exists or where to find it if it does.
<br/>
<br/>
Given that time is money, your easiest bet is probably to buy a SuperCard or a traditional GBA flash card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Yeah, the SRAM pause code kinda worked.  If you wrote it to a GBA Flash Cart, and pressed "start", it would continue booting and work find.  If you pulled the Flash Cart out, and inserted the GBA MP, it wouldn't continue.  If you pulled the flash cart out, and stuck it back in, it would work fine.  I think I even tried pulling the flash cart out, and inserting another one (with sram data) and it worked.. can't remember though..
<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, it looked like if the SRAM data wasn't there after the swap, it didn't work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i found out that the most ammount of sram i could find in a GBA official game is:
<br/>
E-card reader (it has 128kb of space :| 1mib)
<br/>
anyway
<br/>
the file that comes with passme2 ".sav"
<br/>
is 32kb
<br/>
and it saves wrong save size when i try to save to it

so how do i make the .sav bigger?

But how much is your time worth per hour? Sometimes, when deciding between SuperCard and <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver#MacGyverisms" target="_blank">MacGyverCard</a>, it is useful to take into account <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost" target="_blank">opportunity costs</a>.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think a better understanding of your goals is relevant here. 
<br/>
Are you intending to write your own homebrew? If so, I would *strongly* recommend following Tepples' suggestion. Time spent running around in circles accomplishing the highly difficult (if not impossible) is time not spent refining your programming skills. Very little that goes into writing a GBA multiboot program is not in some way applicable to DS applications. Some minor details change, but the bulk of what you learn carries across in some fashion.
<br/>
If your goal is to run existing homebrew, then the question becomes which homebrew. As Tepples mentioned, the only GBA homebrew that will work are  multiboot apps. Some NDS homebrew still requires either a flash cart, the supercard, or the m3, as there are things that want more than 4 megs of storage that do not leverage the CF/SD libraries yet. Even if your target homebrew is the subset that will work well with the GBAMP, as Tepples mentions, there is a heavy opportunity cost to the approach you are taking. The amount of time being invested could well exceed the amount of time it would be necessary to do work to get the necessary funds for a supercard. Even if you don't have a regular job, odd jobs are available in most regions to gain some income.
<br/>
And, of course, if your goal is to run commercial games, we don't do that here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Learn to code in C by writing native programs for the PC, using a native compiler such as <a class="postlink" href="http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/MinGW-5.0.2.exe?download" target="_blank">MinGW</a>, a port of GCC to Windows. Start with simple text mode programs (using printf() etc). Once you become comfortable with C, then read through the TONC tutorial and the GBA beginners FAQ. Finally, install devkitARM and try to compile <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/" target="_blank">AGBTTY</a>.

edit:oh yeah i forgot to mention, i noticed that if i remove the offical ds game or put the wrong ds game (according to what i programmed the superpass with) it countines thinking there is no game in the ds's game space...
<br/>
is this a feature of the superpass?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If your DS is flashed, or you are using original PassMe on an old firmware DS, the modified GBAMP firmware would proceed to load _BOOT_MP.NDS. But PassMe2 jumps straight into SRAM, which the GBAMP doesn't have. Currently, to use PassMe2, you have to have the GBA flash and the GBA SRAM on the same SLOT-2 device, which in practice means an M3, SuperCard, or traditional GBA flash card. The GBA Movie Player is pretty much the only popular GBA/DS homebrew storage device that does <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> have GBA SRAM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think there's a version that adds a 'wait for keypress' loop in the SRAM, so you could swap to your (hacked) GBAMP once it's executing from SRAM.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok....
<br/>
<br/>
well anyway,
<br/>
i found out how to make it loop for 2 seconds and i just need what ever makes the .sav
<br/>
(the source)
<br/>
so i can put this loop in before it checks the cart data... after the sram that is..
<br/>
<br/>
so anybody know how these .sav's are being made and if there is a source?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

<br/>
They're written in assembly.
<br/>
So disassembling the .sav will give you the source.
<br/>
<br/>
But due to the limitations of executing code from SRAM, it isn't going to make much sense.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">im a little confussed
<br/>
:S
<br/>
<br/>
so how do i disassemble the .sav?
<br/>
<br/>
and is IT posible to do what i want to do,
<br/>
in the long run?
<br/>
<br/>
and is it a limation that you can't have a "wait" for button press
<br/>
<br/>
or at the least a timer to give me like 5 seconds to switch?
<br/>
<br/>
, thanks pepsiman for trying to give me some info on how this works :)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">
