You can get it <a class="postlink" href="http://www009.upp.so-net.ne.jp/rudolph/nds/reset_mse03.zip" target="_blank">here</a>, includes source. (what was that lib called? libcartreset?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks chuck but, I can't launch R4 menus(to select from Game, Moonshell, Slot2) with my touch screen after rebooting with this file.
<br/>
Is there any new version of this reset library? I hope this problem to be revised soon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can also verify that my R4DS works fine after replacing moonshell reset.mse with the one download from this thread.
