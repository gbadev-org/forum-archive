    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since the spring sememster started at school I've been talking with a buddy that does a lot of console playing and modding.  He was telling me about his NDS which I was really interested in, and having sold my WOW account and had some extra cash I decided to go for it.  But I started researching around the web to ensure I was going about the right plan, and this is what I came up with, if anything doesn't look right let me know so I don't have a nice expensive for a college student paperweight.
<br/>
<br/>
Plans were to 
<br/>
<br/>
A)  Buy a new retail NDS, Silver from the local Wal Mart, date of purchase would be sometime between February 10, 2006-February 20, 2006.
<br/>
B)  Get a Supercard SD
<br/>
C)  Get a Super PassKey2.
<br/>
<br/>
Just wanting to confirm that I can flash a retail silver NDS purchased after the new year to play my back up's and homebrew including emulated roms.  My main question really holding me back right now, is a new retail unit have some firmware that will brick it once I try to flash and play my back ups.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

About right, except you should consider buying the CF version unless you have a huge investment in SD cards. The CF adapters are much more widely supported in homebrew than the SD adapters.

Gbadev.org is a homebrew forum and will not help you play backups. If you want to play commercial DS games, play them from DS Game Cards.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

There was some effort put into trying to track unit serial numbers versus firmware revisions - but basically, there's not too much you can do pre-purchase to guarantee a Passme1 compatible DS.  Buying one with the Metroid demo included is said to be a fairly reliable method, and probably buying silver gives you better odds.
<br/>
<br/>
But whatever DS you buy, a Passme2 would do the trick.  Then if you flash it, just use the latest version of Flashme to make sure it'll be compatible with wi-fi games.<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC
<br/>
I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.
<br/>
Thank you, everyone, I look forward to taking advantage of your work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think the first picture is the truest representation of what the screen actually looks like to a human eye.  the movie makes it look very blue.  I dunno.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Catch-22. Running any DS homebrew is kind of a problem unless you already know what firmware version you have ("blue" v2 vs. hypothetical future "black" v6).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It's also more expensive than PassMe or WiFiMe, as you have to buy an additional compatible game (sorry <span style="font-style: italic">Meteos</span> fans), and if you skipped the GBA, then you have to buy a SuperCard instead of a GBAMP. I'd guess that a lot of people reading this forum are into homebrew development only because they have a lot more time than money.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
