I've been dabbling with DS development for a while now and I decided it was finally time to make the jump from emulator to actual hardware.  My only problem, though, just may be in my hardware decisions; as it stands MMP is definately <span style="font-weight: bold">NOT</span> working as advertised.  There is barely any media support, but worst of all their .nds compatibility is atrocious.  Trying to run the simplest of homebrew code yields white screens.
<br/>
<br/>
I may just be the noob of noobs and if someone is with much more experience <span style="font-style: italic">please</span> school me, as the hardware does seem to have tremendous potential!  As it stands now, some "3rd party" apps exist only to make some .nds files "more compatible."  This strikes me as the device being geared more towards people interested in simply playing homebrew or downloading... "backups."
<br/>
<br/>
That's my problem; I've read that because of the nature of the hardware, it can and will be upgraded in the future, but their website seemed kind of flakey to me (perhaps I'm just haterizing now).  Would it be possible if I use flashme and then use the HDD portion simply as a GBA cart?  I'd just like to get this thing going so I can continue with my homebrew dev!
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">: / tried those things but it didnt work.  Renamed, in fact, just locks it up.  Whats weird is that some homebrew works, some doesnt, most Nintendo demos worked, but some did not.  A simple "Hello world" did not even work.
<br/>
<br/>
-Does anyone know if this is a problem with the software powering the file browser or if this is a limitation of the actual hardware?
<br/>
<br/>
-There are so many other cards out on the market, is it possible that I can take the file browser of another system (or nds launching method) and use that on my MMP?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the feedback!

<br/>
<br/>
I FINALLY got my Hello World app to run and quite perfectly, on the NDS.  The problem indeed seems to be with the software browser and not the hardware (thank GOD!).  What I did instead to make it work was simply having the MMP boot directly into my file.
<br/>
<br/>
For updates, etc, Datel offers a "BOOTME.NDS" to be placed on root and the MMP with simply run that instead of it's built in browser(v1.0).  What I did was rename my file to BOOTME.NDS and it loaded right up.  The next step for me is to see how many apps I can get working like this and then pray Datel fixxed their browser :D!!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Moonshell is supported, but it is run from within the MMP's browser (which causes all sorts of whacky things to happen).  Also, from within moonshell (booted directly or not) I am unable to lauch apps getting the error:
<br/>
<br/>
Not supported adapter?  
<br/>
     :: in the info box and...
<br/>
It is not possible to start excluding "GBAMP/Admovie or Supercard CFI/O"
<br/>
     :: on the debug screen.
<br/>
<br/>
It should be noted, tho, that the Moonshell packed with the device is version 1.1
<br/>
<br/>
I briefly took a look at putting an updated version, but when that failed I returned to working on getting a filesystem working with this device (which I guess could be part of the problem).
