    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I have been enjoying homebrew and what not on my PSP for about a month after I downgraded. I thought that was confusing but now I am fairly comfortable with it. However, I don't even know where to begin with homebrew on the Nintendo DS. I have read many posts and done many google searches for Super Cards, Pass me, etc. . . and I still don't know what I am looking for.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I am interested in for the DS:
<br/>
music
<br/>
emulators
<br/>
possibly reading books
<br/>
<br/>
that is all. What do I need exactly? Also, how am I supposed to connect all of the items?
<br/>
<br/>
Any help is appreciated.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I'm not very clued up on the emulator or reading books scene, but moonshell is good for music. There are a few emulators in the works such as picodrive. This can be found on the DS Misc section of this site</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For hardware, you need a NoPass card, a CF or SD to GBA adapter, CF or SD memory cards, and a CF or SD writer for PC. Unfortunately, the best pages I've found that describe the process are either on Pirate Heaven (which I'm not allowed to link to) or on a retailer's page (which I'm also not allowed to link to). All I can offer is the <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/gbaforum/DS_Lite_flashing.jpg" target="_blank">"what you see is what you need" picture</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so then I need four things?
<br/>
<br/>
A no pass card-what does this do?
<br/>
A CF or SD to GBA adapter- which one is better
<br/>
CF or SD memory card-which one is better and how big of memory do you recommend?
<br/>
CF or SD writer- which one?
<br/>
<br/>
Also I have a V2 DS, does it matter?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">NoPass card tells the DS to run DS code from the GBA slot. Unlike previous solutions, NoPass is compatible with all DS models with no hassle.

<a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompactFlash" target="_blank">CompactFlash</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital_card" target="_blank">Secure Digital</a> are two formats of memory cards most commonly used in digital cameras. CF is based on the well-known ATA standards used by PC hard drives, while SD is much more proprietary. Thus, CF is compatible with more homebrew as of now, but SD, miniSD, and microSD are physically smaller and don't stick out of the DS as much.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Basically, you need to have a NoPass and a GBA flash cart. Plug in the NoPass, put your homebrew program on the GBA flashcart, (plug it in too, silly) and turn the DS on. You want to run the NoPass, not the GBA game. This should effectively run the homebrew stuff for you. In my humble opinion, this is a little easier than PSP, although you have to know what to buy. Any standard flash cart will work fine, if you want the GBAMP, you\'ll need to have the right version and do all sorts of wierd stuff to it I\'m told. As for the NoPass card, I recommend a PassCard3, although any of them should work fine.
