    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
Here's my n00b question... I've tried to find out some clues in the last post but i'm not sure to have understood everything.
<br/>
<br/>
I've flashed my DS with the WifiME trick some times ago with the V4 firmware, and i'm wondering how to upgrade to V6 firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a NDS FlashedME V4 and a gba cartige, i've read this post <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7635" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7635</a> and i suppose i must use Pepsiman .gba firmware. 
<br/>
<br/>
Do i need a passkey to upgrade to V6? I don't really get how to upgrade?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone could help?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by rEkOM on Sun Feb 19, 2006 5:36 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Or you can just drop the .nds file onto dsbuild.exe that comes with Moonshell. It will automatically attach a loader and put the generated .ds.gba in the same location as the .nds. (I find it so useful, I have a shortcut to it on my desktop which I can just drop .nds files through.)<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You should upgrade to at least FlashMe v5, if not v6. Playing (or download-playing) any game that uses Nintendo's wi-fi service will brick (destroy) the firmware of earlier versions. (You can recover with the recovery code and A+B+Sel+Start, but it's better to reflash now and not have to do that later.)<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
