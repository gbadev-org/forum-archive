    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've seen a few other people with a similar problem but no cause or solution
<br/>
<br/>
1) Got a compatible wifi card and the driver successflly installed
<br/>
<br/>
2) Got WMB installed and started
<br/>
<br/>
3) boot up the DS which finds the available download
<br/>
<br/>
4) start the download which then fails with a communications error
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone experienced this and found a fix/workaround.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If these dont work, how are you loading the nds files?
<br/>
<br/>
Through the registry entries, a batch file, from the data folder?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
