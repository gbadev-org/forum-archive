    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I have an old firware DS an Xflash 256mb and I am waiting for a Superpass to be delivered to my place.
<br/>
<br/>
My question is what do I need to do to the DS homebrew to work on my Xgflash. Do I need to patch it to .gba file or what do I need to do. Is there a special method?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks I hope when I receive the Superpass I can go out and play homebrew games without a second thought of what to do.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks
<br/>

Edit: I realise you have to patch the .nds files into .nds.gba to work on the Xgflash, but I have NDS loader and it only patches the roms into .gba files.  What do I have to do to get it into .nds.gba?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

After you unzip it, one of the folders is called "wintools". In that folder is "dsbuild.exe". Drag and drop your .nds files on that program (or even a shortcut to it) and it will produce a .ds.gba.
<br/>
<br/>
I use this method to run homebrew on my Supercard. (SC needs a loader, but needs it called .nds. So I drop it through the program, put the .ds.gba on my flash card, and rename it.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
