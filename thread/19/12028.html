    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Got a PassMe1 device for Christmas, which is what I need as my DS is a US launch model running firmware 1 (screens don't change at all on the PictoChat test). Using the Metroid demo as the authenticating game and an EFA 256mb linker, which dspassme.com says works fine. I also have not flashed the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I've had little trouble with the EFA linker before - just it occasionally losing connection with the PC. In any case, it boots up to the DS booter fine where you select the ROM from.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I've tested this with a few of my own programs, a few of the ones included with DevKitPro, and one from the dspassme.com website itself. Each time I only load one ROM onto the EFA linker (the .ds.gba).
<br/>
<br/>
When I've tested this using my own stuff or the stuff from DevKitPro it goes to the GBA startup screen when I've selected the ROM, but with a corrupted Advance logo at the bottom, and freezes. When I've used the keyboard demo from dspassme.com the Advance logo hasn't been corrupted, but both screens go black and it freezes again.
<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts? Seems that the PassMe cart is working, and it's managing to find the EFA linker, but it's the ROMs that are causing the problems.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

AFAIK this doesn't work, you can only have one single NDS file flashed. You should also take care of your flashing software not to fix GBA headers, as this wouldn't work either (again, AFAIK).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yup.. kinda confusing post, as your saying you are only loading the single .ds.gba (which is good) but that you can't choose the ROM from the list.. Which leads me to believe you are using Darkstar (DarkainMX's Multi-ROM loader)?
<br/>
<br/>
And if I understand correct, you get to Darkstar, but when you select a ROM from the list, it will not launch?  Is this correct?
<br/>
<br/>
If so, make sure you are using the .nds version of the homebrew you are trying to run with Darkstar.  Keep in mind that Darkstar does not work with illegally downloaded warez romz you might find on illegal web sites.. so if you are trying to use them, it won't work.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the help guys. KeithE was right - I shouldn't use any of the loaders (I was using the NDS loader). Works fine now.
<br/>

Merry Christmas too (or rather, Merry day after Boxing Day).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
