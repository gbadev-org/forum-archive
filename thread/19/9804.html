    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I used the picto chat thing to find my firmware version.  I turns out it's a v1 so I bought a passme 1.  Now the problem is that when I try to open the flashme file on my cart, the screens turn white.  I put the flashmev7 on the cart.  Is that the right file for me to run on my v1 ds?

No problem, probably should have explained it in the post.  Mostly I just mean this...is it the NDS from the site, directly, with no modification you are flashing to the flash cart?  If so, it's possible that your GBA flashcart's software is screwing up the NDS in some way (newer NDS homebrew should work even without a loader if the flashing software isn't messing with them, but you can't be too sure).
<br/>
<br/>
Go <a class="postlink" href="http://darkfader.net/ds/" target="_blank">here</a> to Darkfader's site and download ndsmall.bin, part way down the page in the 'DS Development Tools' section.  Then, assuming you are using Windows, open a command window (you can do this by pressing the 'Start' button, picking 'Run' and typing command into the window that pops up).
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't know DOS commands, it's probably easiest to put ndsmall.bin and flashme.nds onto your desktop (I know XP's command window starts there, I think it does in 98 + 95 as well).  Anyway, type the following:
<br/>
<br/>
copy /b ndsmall.bin + /b flashme.nds flashme.ds.gba 
<br/>
<br/>
and then try flashing that onto your flash cart, see if this fixes it.  Alternatively, if you have MoonShell, it comes with a program in the wintools folder called dsbuild that if you drag an NDS onto it it'll create a ds.gba file for you.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

the efa cart should work fine. that's what I used to flash my nds. iirc I just added the loader and unchecked any menus and other fancy stuff.<br/>_________________<br/>go back to coding and stop screaming wolf :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
