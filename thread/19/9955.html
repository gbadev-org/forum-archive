    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I can send DS demos with my PC, and I know long time ago I read something about capturing demos with a card as well. What do I need to capture a game demo? I have a lot of different wireless cards so if the one that sends the demo doesn't work for capturing I can try something else. Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i don't see why you want to capture a ds demo but...
<br/>
<br/>
capturing a ds demo is like capturing wifi packets ...
<br/>
ok it is capturing wifi packets...
<br/>
lol
<br/>
<br/>
just look through the forum for "capturing packets"
<br/>
or something and you will find some programs...
<br/>
the bad part is turning a packet's into a demo is hard work :P..
<br/>
so i suggest you just look on <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.akkit.org/Downloadable_DS_Demos" target="_blank">Stephen</a>'s download list for the demo you want :P
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks. I know about packet sniffing and do it day to day in my daily job. I just wasn't sure if that was what I needed to do to capture a demo. Why would I want to capture a demo? Maybe because I can get a demo that isn't online yet for all you guys to play. Either way I will try capturing it later today. I'm pretty sure I know what to look for while sniffing just not 100% sure on making a working demo. Any help on that part would be appericated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's what I understand as far as capturing downloadable demos and  turning them into something useful:
<br/>
<br/>
1. get a laptop with a wifi card that is compatible with wifime
<br/>
2. either get the special packet capture tool by firefly, or just use one of the generic ones
<br/>
3. Find the channel the DS is downloading on, and only capture that channel (no channel-hopping)
<br/>
4. while keeping the laptop as close as physically possible to the transmitting DS, download the demo at least 5 times while capturing packets
<br/>
5. send the data to someone who can reassemble it into a working demo, or try using the tool which does it automatically (it's somewhere in this forum, search for it)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
