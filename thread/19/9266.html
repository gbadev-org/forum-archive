    <h4>#79782 - Wuschmaster - Sat Apr 15, 2006 11:48 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello! My problem is the following:
<br/>
<br/>
I need a GBA flash cart with the ability to run NDS homebrew (for example the SMT dumper software). I am not interested in M3/Supercard, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I'm now searching for the cheapest GBA Flash Cart with the ability to run DS homebrew (eg. boot if header code is "PASS").
<br/>
<br/>
The size can be anything. 32, 64, 128, 256 MBit. Just the cheapest I can get.
<br/>
And if you know, please also tell where to buy it.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very, very much in advance! ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I tried that, but for some reason, the dumper software didn't boot well on GBAMP when I tried it at my friend's house. Something wrong with the Secure Area. I know a GBAMP is needed for storing dumps, but I'll get that device later.

I'm not interested in running commercial roms, therefore I'm asking for just a very cheap GBA flashcart.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Wuschmaster on Sun Apr 16, 2006 12:32 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">he/she did say they're not interested in supercard/m3 etc. Im assuming etc. includes GBAMP. Too bad...I don't think getting a gba flash cart is cheap in the least. It costs a LOT more than supercards and GBAMP.

So there's no cheap 64M card or something for sale somewhere?
<br/>
I'm hoping to find something around $35 ~ $45 or less. And no CF/SD adapters, please. ^^;

I know my questions are weird, but believe me, I know what I'm looking for ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, it won't work...I'm going to guess it's because the GBAMP's loader software thrashes the DS Card's secure area and/or header somehow on loading (not usually important except in this case).  Not certain though...something similar happens with Dipstar though, so that's my guess.  :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Uh, almost all homebrew (with the exception of a few flashcart reliant games like Tickle Girl DS) will run on GBAMP. The SMT dumper isn't exactly legal, even if you overlook it's purpose. It was built using the official SDK.
<br/>
<br/>
However, if you really are interested in homebrew then the GBAMP is fine. If you are interested in dumping games, then the M3 and SuperCard won't help, since they trash the DS card's header too. The good thing about the GBAMP is the loader is open source, so you can modify it to do what you want. And once you have installed FW Nitro on your DS, it won't matter if the flash cart trashes the DS header, since it can dump to CF media via GBAMP, M3 or SC directly.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
