    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm currently in a bind regarding how the M3 DS Simply loads homebrew files. Apparently, the WRAM on either the ARM7 or ARM9 (I'm not sure which - this is the problem as I've been told, not through experience) is either initiated with a lower size than needed, or has part of the RAM taken up by the loading of the ROM due to how the DLDI is applied (I'd assume). 
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to avoid auto-DLDI patching by prepatching the ROM prior to playing, or to clear the WRAM out after the ROM is loaded?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I'm too vague, or if this is all rubbish talk. The combination of libraries I'm trying to use (ASLib, liblobby, EFS) apparently don't work together on the M3 DS Simply and a few other cards due to the way the homebrew's loaded. WRAM was the only thing cited - DLDI is a guess on my part since it seemed like a likely suspect.
<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts? Leads? I'd appreciate anything to get this trainwreck a-rollin'.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I could be wrong, but I'm under the impression that in order for auto-dldi patching to work on m3 real, you have to place the .nds in the root of your card. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'd suppose, if that were true, that you could put it in another directory, patched with whatever dldi you please. I think the "dldi-compatible" message comes up no matter what. I've noticed that when I run homebrew that's not even dldi-compatible, it still says that.<br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll give that a try, maybe it's the same for the M3 DS Simply.
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, looking around, I believe the problem has to do with EFS and the M3/G6 cards... apparently something about EFS prevents them from being DLDI patched. Not sure if it's related the RAM, but I'm going to keep looking for an answer.
<br/>
<br/>
As always, any help or etc you can give at all is appreciated!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
there is, in fact another thread on auto-patching for R4 (which is the same card, arguably) here:

Mayhap you could squeeze some info from that thread.

I apologize for being unobservant and assumptive, which according to my spell-check IS, actually, a word. Surprised me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
