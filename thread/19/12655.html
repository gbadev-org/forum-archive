    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Couldn't a loader be made that would allow you to write over wifi to a flash device inserted in your DS?
<br/>
<br/>
I guess this would require some kind of app PC side to send the file as well as a receiver program that you would run on the DS.  This should be possible, though, right?  Could you eliminate the need for the PC side app and allow full directory browsing of the PC assuming it was all shared on the network?
<br/>
<br/>
The same system could also be used for transfering MP3s or other media files, too.
<br/>
<br/>
Would there be any limit in terms of filesize that could be written?
<br/>
<br/>
I admit that I know nothing about wifi networking.  I just thought this would be a pretty good idea, but maybe it's not possible.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can try DSFTP, which is an FTP server. From what I've seen it's the nearest thing to what you try to describe.
<br/>
<br/>
Because transferring through air is slower than through a cable, people still prefer to copy files the wired way.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Even if all you have to transfer is a 1 MB file fresh out of ndstool, and the latency of the wired way involves removing the card, inserting it, removing it, and inserting it?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, you'd want DSFTP.  Since it supports, DLDI, it should work with most major carts.  The problem is that, like Lick said, it's rather slow.  I usually get about 30 kb/s when writing to the cart.  
<br/>
<br/>
However, like Tepples suggested, it's great for when you have to transfer a relatively small file and don't want to bother with the card reader.  I have had issues writing many small files at once (tends to make DSFTP freeze and crash) but sending over one file at a time works well.  Not very useful for anything over a few megabytes though.
<br/>
<br/>
It's also a good solution to have on your cart in case for some reason your DS becomes the only thing that can read your card correctly and you want to salvage your files (I've seen it happen before on SCdev)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
