    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been using my xrom for ds homebrew, and  i have a gba movie player 2 laying around.  I read that some people were using the GBAMOV player 2  to play nds homebrew. How are you doing this? Any links for tutorial? Also can you still play movies with it after you rewrite the card? Thanks in advance for the help,
