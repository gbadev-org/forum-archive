<br/>
Can I produce and download code using the WIFI me solution only? i.e. will that download and execute code I produce for the NDS and I DO NOT need any sort of nds or GBA flash card in the system.
<br/>
<br/>
I get conflicting meanings when reading through some of the topics, some seems ot suggest the WIFI me just loads some code that then executes whatever code is on the GBA flash card that is currently in the GBA slot, and some seem to suggest that WIFI me downloads and executes the code you send it, and it doesn't need anything in the cart slots.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">WifiMe is a PassMe alternative, that allows DS code to be run from the GBA slot.
<br/>
<br/>
WifiMe is sent to the DS using WMB (Wireless MultiBoot).
<br/>
<br/>
WMB can also be used to send DS code to the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS will reject unsigned code sent by WMB unless you install FlashMe first.
<br/>
<br/>
Installing FlashMe requires some sort of GBA flash card and either PassMe or WifiMe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If it's not yellow, you can use wifime and a GBA Movie Player to flash your DS, and then you can use WMB to start homebrew code. If it is yellow, you'll need slightly more expensive tools.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

 The whole point of WIFIME is to load whatever is on the GBA cart in DS mode (which is the same thing passme does). The thing is, on a unmodified DS the problem is not trying to send data but the DS will only accept official RSA signed files. To make a long story short........ no, u can't.<br/>_________________<br/>MKDS friend code-
