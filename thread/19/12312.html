<br/>
Things done so far:<ul><li>Firmware update extractor/injector
<br/>
</li><li>Stop auto-booting by FlashMe
<br/>
</li><li>Auto-boot _BOOT_SC.NDS before the SC firmware menu has loaded
<br/>
</li><li>Load normal firmware if L is held or no boot file is found
<br/>
</li><li>Redirect homebrew *.nds file booting to my own loader
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
A hacked firmware (1.7a) has been released. See below for more details.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I have now gotten it booting *.nds files using my own loader. I am aware that the SC Lite could run ordinary *.nds files. However this is based on NDSMP, so anything that booted using that should run with this. This means DSOrganize 2.45 runs on my SC Lite now :D

It still boots *.sc.nds files using the normal loader, so they should still work.

<br/>
As far as I can guess, the DS card header is preserved until you load a .nds file. So if you write firmware for Supercard that hooks the .nds loader to a custom loader, you can keep the DS card header. HOWEVER, you have to keep in mind that if you use swiSoftReset (part of .nds-load-procedure), you inevitably will have to set the reset-addresses (inside the RAM copy of the DS header that you're trying to preserve). I'm not sure, but I think you can use a jmp instead of soft reseting.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dan2552:
<br/>
Nope. The hacks are applied to a .bin type update (really just a .gba file that writes to the firmware) and hence not usable on SC Rumble.
<br/>
<br/>
HyperHacker:
<br/>
Nope. As I said, it behaves like NDSMP, including overwriting the NDS header.
<br/>
<br/>
Lick:
<br/>
You can use bx (no jmp on ARM) instead of SWI 00, but if the CPU is in user mode then it is stuck in user mode until a SWI 00 (or an interrupt occurs).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As promised, I am releasing the hacked <a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/NDS_Projects/sc_update_17a.zip" target="_blank">update 1.7a</a> and the <a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/NDS_Projects/sc_firmware_17a_patches.zip" target="_blank">source code</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
This is only for the SuperCard Lite. To install it, run the update_17a.gba file on your SuperCard. I have left the auto-boot by FlashMe enabled, as I prefer it that way. It will automatically boot _BOOT_SC.NDS using the same loading code as NDSMP (which has proven quite stable). If the file is not found, it will boot the normal firmware. If you run a *.nds file from the normal firmware file it will be redirected to use the NDSMP loader, but *.sc.nds files will use the normal SC loader.
<br/>
<br/>
There are no versions for the SuperCard SD or the SuperCard CF. The source is available, so someone else can make them if they want. 
<br/>
<br/>
To make the patch yourself (for the SC Lite at least, the locations and code may be different for SC SD and SC CF), use extraction tool (posted previously) to extract the firmware from the micro_eng_170.bin update. Make the patches and load.bin, then follow the instructions in patches.txt to hex edit the patches into the firmware. Finally, inject the firmare back into the update file.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

This does not contain a patched compiled firmware, just the source &amp; tools. I'll have to look at integrating chishm's latest work and post an update.

I also added a gba mode boot with the R trigger so its a little easier to get into gba mode on your prefered screen (instead of being stuck with the top screen which the scsd ds mode firmware forces upon you)

Edit:
<br/>
Ok, .ds.gba _BOOT_SC.NDS support appears to work. this means you can have either a .nds or .ds.gba (.sc.nds) as your _BOOT_SC.NDS and it will be loaded.  Detection is based on byte B2 in the header which is 0x96 on .ds.gba's and 0x00 on .nds files.

Ready to use .nds for SC SD and SC MiniSD:

Well then you're out of luck. So far only GBAMP and SC Lite / SD have custom firmwares available. That means there are many other cards to go. 
<br/>
So no, I'm not going to move the data to somewhere else because of the impracticallities of doing this for the dozen flash cards already on the market.
<br/>
<br/>
I've heard that MoonShell doesn't work with 1.7a. Instead of installing the SCSD version, install the GBAMP version and patch it with dlditool to SCSD. This is because the SCSD version has a loader attached to it, and is a (possibly non-standard) *.sc.nds file. 
<br/>
<br/>
It is possbile to go back to the normal firmware by running the 1.70 update.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, this hack can actually run DSOrganize v2.45, which is my main reason for creating it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there some way to be able to create some tool to extract the firmware of the supercard in anyone of their models using bookstores DLDI?  
<br/>
For example to extract the firmware of a supercard lite or a rumble to apply him a "Skin?" from the same supercard or to another unit flash slot 1 (EZV,M3s,R4,SCO,DSLink,DSLinker,ETC,etc,etc,)  
<br/>
Its possible? since this would allow to personalize the style of these units like it happened with the SCsd and SCcf before the version 1.70...

<br/>
As for 1.70 not working with skinning tools, they probably moved the graphics locations (not necessarily intentionally) or possibly intentionally encypted them.  All it takes for the graphics to move around in rom is for them to add some code (which they did) which bumps things around in memory.

Note that while it is able to ID the sclite, it is an incorrect ID because the unlock routine or possibly even register addresses to access the flash chip directly seems to be different. I don't have the lite hardware to test with, so I never got too far looking into that one.
<br/>
<br/>
The new ID for SCSD is above, and added to the firmware list below. It was made to work the same as the older MX chip from the viewpoint of the DS, so all that you need is an additional definition for possible chipID returns.

Since my Supercard CF is half-broken anyway, I went ahead and tried it. It works great. :D
<br/>
<br/>
My Supercard CF's RAM barely works due to one of the pins making a bad connection (I think, since it works when I stick a piece of paper in the slot, but that's not my idea of a solution), and most of the time it wouldn't even load anything because of it. But since this loader (apparently) doesn't use the RAM, my Supercard is useful again, at least for anything that doesn't try to use the RAM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Sorry to report that I have not.  Tried Moonshell for GBAMP and the DLDI patch for SCLite.  Also tried the other suggestion by Chishm to change the .ini files before installing.  
<br/>
<br/>
However, none of that really matters, since it's not specific to MoonShell anyway - no NDS binaries will load after the update to 1.7a.  I was just taking a stab in the dark, since if MoonShell would load, I could maybe load other homebrew throught it.
<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that this issue is due to a hardware change.  I've got a newer SCLite (only 2 weeks old).  Supporting this theory is the following:
<br/>
<br/>
Others with SCLite seem to run LMP-ng fine.  Me, I can load it after DLDI patch, but it plays the first 1 second of the song fine and then the song speeds up with gibberish and then skips to the next song.  Similar issues with the SC SD Moon DLDI patch.
<br/>
<br/>
This also seems to point at a HW change, since again, others report it works fine.  I've done the self-tests for my card, and it passes all of them, so it doesn't *seem* to be a HW issue.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm no developer, so I'm pretty much stuck at this point.  If anyone feels like taking a stab at the code, I'd be happy to test anything.  I've got a GBAMP I could use as a recovery method, and would offer it up for free to anyone who might fix this (shipping on me).  It's not much, but you'd also get my eternal gratitude and respect ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I made a mistake in adding .ds.gba support, by doing so some .nds files are mis identified as .ds.gba files due to the way ndstool works currently.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll be releasing a new version without .ds.gba support later today. This is likely totally unrelated to the moonshell dpg problems, which I'm still trying to figure out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Works like a charm in my SC-CF when i add NDSLOADER.BIN.

EDIT:
<br/>
Could anyone code a standalone homebrew touch screen GUI wich uses "filename.png" as icon for "filename.nds.dsq", calling SC's firmware routine to launch .NDS.DSQ files?
<br/>
Upper screen would show file info, as full name, size, CRC and such. And we could name it as _BOOT_SC.NDS.
