I am using Supercard CF.  I used wmb 1.0 and able to connected to my NDS.  After it went through 100%, I get to a screen on top that has the logo "nintendo" and "supercard" logo at the bottom.  Now I have the screen that has a list of files that I put in to my CF card.   I selected a demo, and it run 'til 100%.   Then both top and bottom screen turned white and won't show anything.
<br/>
<br/>
1.  What do I have to do with the demo I received?
<br/>
2.  What is the "nds loader" for?
<br/>
3.  Where can I find the latest firmware and what I would do with it?
<br/>
4.  Can someone please help me step by step?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The PassMe or WiFiMe jumps to the beginning of GBA ROM space. Unlike a .gba or .mb file, a .nds file isn't a raw executable image. The "NDS Loader" runs from the beginning of GBA ROM space. It parses the appended .nds file's data structures and copies the appropriate things into the appropriate parts of Nintendo DS EWRAM before execution.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
