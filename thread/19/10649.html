    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i only have a mac so i tend to go for the stuff that works without a pc based patcher. just trying to get a list of stuff that works straight from a download, in the hope that a pattern emerges to why some stuff is working and some stuff isnt...
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right i think the pattern is predictably established here. anything that needs to read or write to the sd card after the program in questions initial launch.
<br/>
<br/>
well there we go then :)
<br/>
<br/>
why is it that 'super card' have to change the way the supercards read and write to the sd's? surely they could just try and make a standard - that or send chihsm a new supercard for free with each revision.
<br/>
It's abit annoying having almost everything working perfectly on my supercardSD to having next to nothing full functional on my supercard light. *whinge-whinge-whinge*</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
