<br/>
Either get a GBAMP and a CF card *OR* send your DS to <a href="http://www.aheadgames.com" target="_blank">http://www.aheadgames.com</a> for flashing.
<br/>
<br/>
Might also want to check <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=5718" target="_blank">this thread</a> to see if somebody with equipment lives near you.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The free Homebrews don't work with wifi.(The official demos works) How can I hack the firmware ? In few days, I'm having a supercard. I saw that it's possible with the new driver of the supercard to run homebrew.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You need to get flash card for few minutes and follow instructions - <a href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/." target="_blank">http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/.</a> I think you will able to do this with SC instead of flashcard.<br/>_________________<br/>[ sorry for all mistakes, but my english isn't as good as I wish it to be ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
