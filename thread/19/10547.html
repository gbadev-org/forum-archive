I was surprised to find an M3 for such a ridiculously low price...then I found out that it can't play GBA games. I'm only interested in running DS games and homebrew, so that doesn't really bother me...but will it have an effect? Is there some hidden catch that I'm not seeing here?
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone here have that version of the M3, and is it any good?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought one of those in Den Den town here in Osaka. I paid 6000 yen for it (together with a kingston 1gb mini-sd that comes up to 10000 yen). It can't play GBA games, even though the firmware is the same as the version that can. So you can get into the GBA menu, but it just won't run any roms or games. 
<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the device is essentially the same as the normal MiniSD version. My friend has that one, and the only noticeable difference is that his has a different background. 
<br/>
<br/>
So if you can get a good price, go for it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is this cheaper M3 missing the 32MB of RAM?  Most homebrew doesn't use that RAM yet but moonshell can take advantage of it and more homebrew will in the future.
<br/>
<br/>
Supercard and M3 are very close in homebrew compatibility.  The FAT lib still has problems with SD and especially miniSD devices.  Writing is risky or doesn't work.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I hear deving for  the m3 is a nightmare when doing complex apps because its mainmenu sets the hardware in all sorts of weird states on loading the binaries, my experience with the supercard is very good, it allows me to run gbfs'ed files that are above 4 megs, its fast and most fat apps work on it some thing strange with draw 3 is that the cf version of the supercard is in a sperate binary so im not sure if the fat lib is having trouble with the sd version or the cf?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
