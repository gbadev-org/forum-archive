    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In general, to get homebrew working, you need 2 things:
<br/>
1.  A passthrough device - PassMe, PassMe2, WifiMe, NoPass
<br/>
2.  A method of storing the homebrew - GBA flash cart, Supercard, M3, slot-1 devices
<br/>
    -  Alternatively, you can use WMB if your wireless card is compatible.
<br/>
<br/>
You have the NoPass already, but you need some sort of homebrew storage device in order to get DS homebrew to work.  Since you can use your AR as a NoPass, you do not need WifiMe.  WifiMe is basically a limited "type" or "version" of a NoPass that you can't use on your DS, since you have version 4.  
<br/>
<br/>
Once you have a method of getting homebrew working, you can optionally install a replacement firmware for your DS called FlashMe.  This does a few things:
<br/>
1.  It makes the NoPass unnecessary, as you can now hold a button combination down in order to boot from the GBA slot while in DS mode.
<br/>
2.  It removes the RSA signature check from WMB downloads.  That means that once you've installed FlashMe, you can use WMB to wirelessly download homebrew to your DS.
<br/>
<br/>
WMB however is limiting.  You have to be near your computer to load any homebrew, and the only way for you to get your Nintendo Wifi connector to work with WMB would be to use Linux.  In addition, you STILL need to have a fully working method of using homebrew before you can install FlashMe, so I would not suggest this path.
<br/>
<br/>
For DS homebrew, a GBA flash cart isn't recommended due to several reasons:
<br/>
1.  They are very expensive for the amount of space available
<br/>
2.  They do not have FAT filesystem support, which many homebrew programs now use
<br/>
3.  Unless your flash cart manufacturer has made an effort to make your cart more compatible with the DS, you can use only one rom at a time, and you have to rewrite the whole cart to add a new one.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of using WMB or a flash cart, I would suggest getting a Supercard or M3 or GBA Movie Player v2 CF (do NOT get the SD version of the GBA MP).  These can be found online for various prices.  They will take either Compact Flash cards or SD cards.  You can also buy MiniSD versions that will fit flush against the GBA slot of a DS Phat and MicroSD versions that will fit flush against the GBA slot of a DS Lite.  
<br/>
<br/>
Note that the GBA Movie Player v2 does not have any internal RAM, so you cannot use GBA binaries on them.  There is also some homebrew that does not work on the GBAMP because they use GBA-like filesystems and require that RAM to be present (like SnezziDS for example).  Also note that anything over 4 MB cannot run, as the GBAMP has to load everything into the DS's RAM, which is only 4 MB in size.
<br/>
<br/>
The Supercard has slower RAM than is required for GBA binaries, so you must patch games and homebrew so that the GBA doesn't freeze when information isn't supplied fast enough.  The M3 has faster RAM and does not have this issue, but it is the most expensive of the aforementioned devices.
<br/>
<br/>
You can also get a slot-1 device that sits in your DS slot.  These however are expensive and for the most part, incompatible with lots of DS homebrew.  They are not recommended either.
<br/>
<br/>
The whole world of DS homebrew is confusing.  I suggest you sit down and do some more research before buying anything, as you don't want to end up buying a device that won't suit your needs.  For instance, the Supercard "Rumble" series and the M3 "Pro" series are cheaper because they do not have the RAM needed for GBA compatibility.  Since homebrew is just now starting to use that extra RAM for expanded functionality (DSLinux being the prime example of this), it is not recommended.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmm.. Should I just correct this statement by saying there is not such limit, or should I play dumb and ask how I can play 8MB MP3s on my GBA MP if there is a 4MB limit?
<br/>
<br/>
I'll be nice.. and again.. correct that there is NO SUCH LIMIT on the GBA MP!!  And, if you did want to pretend there was a 4MB limit, it would be on your code.  AKA, not graphix, not sound effects, not music, etc.. just your main.c and supporting files.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be correct to say it would be comparable to a commercial DS game?  I mean, they are not directly addressable and have to swap the game data in and out of RAM as well..  But, commercial DS games don't have a 4MB limit.  I wish someone with some real skills would take some time and "toss" a quick demo or lib together to prove there is no 4MB limit once and for all..  Of course, that's not me, cause I suck a programming.  But, I will finally have something released by the end of the year..  Either for Drunkencoders.com or PAlib (or both?) compos.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as I know, routers will not work for WifiMe or WMB.  It has to be a wireless <span style="font-style: italic">card</span> for your computer, which would generally plug into an empty PCI slot on your motherboard.  If you're talking about games like Mario Kart DS, which have built-in wireless multiplayer, then most routers should be compatible.  I don't have a specific list handy though, sorry.  I believe that the official Nintendo site used to have one up at one point, so perhaps you could search there.
<br/>
<br/>
The CF vs SD thing really only applies to the GBAMP, where it's imperative that you get a CF version.  The only thing I've heard about M3s and Supercards is that the microSD versions (the Lite versions) sometimes have issues with certain homebrew, as they're not fully supported by the FATlib.  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, as I'm not entirely familiar with the specifics here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry.. I should have written it better..  Pirating or 3rd party hardware asside, a standard commercial DS game is in slot 1 and slot 1 is not directly addressable, right?  So, the commercial game must swap data in and out of the 4MB RAM in the DS to allow a 32MB game to be played.  As this "library" must be part of the official development kit, I can't imagine software companies being required to hardcode addresses into their games, so I would assume it is dynamic.  But, I would expect that to be a lot of hard work for a homebrew dever to create, so even a statically addressed version would be enough for a proof of concept as well as for a WW style game where each indvidual game is modulized and loaded above the core menu system that launches each module.
<br/>
<br/>
But, now that you mention it..  Chishm did create a proof of concept that did allow &gt;4MB .nds files to be played and I remember seeing a video of Asphalt Urban GT running, and when the GBA MP was pulled out, it paused the game, and when it was reinserted, it continued.. so I guess the &gt;4MB .nds has already been shown..<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is a bit against the board's policy to discuss, so I won't go into details. That was basically proving that (some) commercial ROMs could run (badly) from GBAMP. Many people said it wasn't possible to do, and this was half a year before the Datel tool was hacked to run on GBAMP. I guess I don't like being told I can't do something.
<br/>
<br/>
However, you would still need to write something from scratch to get &gt; 4MB homebrew NDS files to run.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

Point, set, match.. Facts are facts.  There is no reason someone couldn't write a homebrew to swap data in and out..  So, the first person that does, will be the second person to prove that &gt;4MB .nds files can be run on the GBA MP.  Chock another 1st on Chishm's list! :)

In Ustrat im playing wave files of length up to 2GB. There is no problem.  Even for the "expect to be at GBA address space" problems there is a proven solution via MPU.
<br/>

Actually, the wav files im using in the dev version are 3.84MB ("Ich Hatte einen Kameraden" ger for "I had a comrade"), 4.64MB ("Brittania - Dharmasound") and 3.01MB ("Adagio for strings - Dharmasound") and the 1.96MB Theme from Neocron (by Max Corbacho), and yes they are playing fine in the background while the game cares only about itself.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The important point is surprisingly simple to explain:
<br/>
<br/>
The maximum size of a .nds file you can load is 4MB, or possibly 32MB on flash carts and those with RAM. You can have several gigabytes of resources in additional files on your memory card if you want, or even one file as big as the card can hold, but the .nds itself is limited to 4MB.
<br/>
<br/>
Case in point: Moonshell can easily play a 6.5MB MP3 I quite enjoy. But try to embed that MP3 into the .nds itself (this was possible with older versions, I think the feature may have been dropped) and see if you can load the 7MB .nds file on your GBAMP. I can't.
<br/>
<br/>
Commercial games work exactly the same way: They have the basic program that the firmware loads into RAM, which has to be under 4MB. This program then loads other things from the card. The only real difference is that commercial games often swap code in and out of RAM as well, the first program tending to just be a stub (title screen and main menu routines) that loads other programs from the card, while homebrew doesn't often do this because it's a pain. Even WMB programs do this, which is why you often get a long loading screen from the program itself after downloading it.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

4MB is way more than most little homebrew games would ever dream of filling, I agree with that. But it's not very far away, if you got a team together to create a larger project, filling 4MB won't take too long. Then again, doing that for the DS is difficult, not everyone can run homebrew on their DS's (and, if a non-coder can, they're most likely pirates).

The appended filesystem is appended, there is no link between the file to the appendix other then the windows file managing system. On the flashcard itself, both parts are seperated. The .nds file (=container) is independend from the appendix.

Tepples, you got to search for it, or hardcode its pos (hence i have been asking for argc/argv for some time now) but that does not differ from attached filesystems, they got to search too, and some of them fail to find the appended fs if it appends the ram image instead of the rom image ...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nope. It's a non-standard feature that is useful only with one device. It's more of a "this might be useful someday" feature that I put into NDSMP, but haven't found a use for.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

Saying the maximum size of a .nds file is 4MB is rediculous.  I can give a dozen examples of how this is untrue just based off that "general" statement. So, when you say ".nds file" what exactly are you refering to?  The ARM7+ARM9 data only?  As a .nds file can have a file system within the .nds file.  Does that not count as part of the .nds file?  Ticklegirl.nds, is that not a &gt;4MB .nds file?  Because M$ windows tells me it is.  So, if you want to say the ARM7+ARM9 can't be &gt; 4MB, that is fine, but don't say a .nds file can't be greater than 4MB because it is wrong.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

OK, technically you can use the NitroFS to have more than 4MB, but I've yet to see any homebrew apps support that option.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Let me summarize this topic so far in more standard language:
<br/>
<br/>
A .nds file can consist of a program and appended data such as models, textures, maps, sounds, scripts, etc. The program itself can't be bigger than 4 MB, but while it is running, it should be able to load the appended data into RAM and use it. DS Game Cards work exactly this way. However, most homebrew .nds files (except sc.nds) contain only a program and put other data in a separate file because a program running in the current homebrew environment does not have a standard way to find the .nds file in order to access its appended data.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

You can, but only signed official demos.

Not in windows (which only supports some ralink pci/pcmcia cards). But that doesnt need you need to install a complete linux distribution to your harddrive. LiveCDs (i.e. Knoppix) lets you boot linux from cd and allows you to wmb demos to unflashed DSes, or wififme (= Wireless PassMe) your DS with a flashcard. There should be a howto floating around somewhere here in the forums.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
