    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The SD standard only allows up to 2GB. Any 4GB SD (non-SDHC) cards you see are non-standard, and will not work in all devices. There's no way of knowing if it will work in your device or not unless someone else already tried with the exact same SD and the exact same device.

Just get two 2GB cards, and hide one in the battery compartment or something. (they are frickin' tiny...I almost accidentally inhaled one)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Then I'll probably buy 1 2GB micro SD for now, and then get a second one later if I really need it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
