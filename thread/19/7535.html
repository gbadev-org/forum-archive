    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i am not a developer, but instead a person interested in the world of homemade games. i have a nintendo ds and would like to be able to check out what people are making.
<br/>
<br/>
so my question is this:
<br/>
<br/>
what equipment do i need to be able to play homebrewed games on my ds?
<br/>
<br/>
i know i need a flash card type thing but i would like advice as to which one is best.  
<br/>
<br/>
is it possible to load games from a mac? i can use a pc if necissary, but my main computer is a mac. 
<br/>
<br/>
lastly where can i find these homebrewed games?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
if you want you can tell me to "rtfm" or call me a noob or whatever, i dont really care. as long as some one gives me an answer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Theres various options, I took the cheap and chearfull route:
<br/>
<br/>
GBAMP ~ ?13
<br/>
CompactFlash card ~ various, ?30 should get you at least 512MB
<br/>
PassMe ~ ?10
<br/>
Compact Flash reader ~ ?3
<br/>
<br/>
This set up dosnt allow you to run all homebrews,but it allows you to run most, and many are being designed and built for it as its the cheapest method.
<br/>
Thanks to Fat drivers, homebrew can now save to the CF card itself.
<br/>
<br/>
Also the GBAMP on its own allows you to run NES,MasterSystem and Gameboy emulators. (as well as movies,music and ebooks....but movies are limited to gba res, and you can run MP3's off Moonshell which is far better then the GBAMP's special format).
<br/>
Moonshell works fine on this set up, and is a fantastic little psudo-OS, which lets you run other roms, MP3's and Jpegs.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Be warned however, currently the GBAMP/Passme method will only work on older DS models.
<br/>
When did you buy yours?
<br/>
<br/>
However, as your simply copying files to your CF card, Mac's arnt a problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
