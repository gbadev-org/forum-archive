    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I recently got myself an M3, I have a 1Gb Sandisk CF card and some other 32MB card which work perfectly.
<br/>
But when I try to launch roms off my Kingston 1GB CF Elite Pro I am greeted by two black screens after loading, they flash white once and sometimes the top screen stays white, but usually it's just blackness.
<br/>
<br/>
I have my M3 updated to E18 and I used the latest flashme(form another card).
<br/>
<br/>
Homebrew .GBA files work fine from GBA mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Please help me, if there is any other information you need just ask.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I hope by "ROMS", you meant homebrew stuff, since we aren't allowed to talk about piracy here.  Try start the home-brew using the START button instead of the A button.  M3 loads them differently.  Some home brews require a loader prepended on them.  Search for it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tred homebrew and demos, nothing works, start button doesn't work either, I'm returning this card and getting another one.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll include some more info, might be useful to someone maybe, I'm just a poor clueless user in this whole gba/ds development area.
<br/>
<br/>
The name of the card is Kingston Elite Pro 1GB(50X) CF, the label says 1GB, not 1024MB like the picture on the emuparadise wiki.
<br/>
<br/>
Back says "CG/1GB-S".
<br/>
<br/>
PS: Everything I tried works fine on other cards.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The M3 doesn't turn on the DS components in the way that some homebrew expects. Have you tried running homebrew using the "M3powerloader"?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
