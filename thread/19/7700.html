    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I picked up a compatable Linksys card, installed the drivers from the Wifime kit, and successfully loaded up a game demo.
<br/>
<br/>
 I then tried to boot up Flashme.nds via Wifi me, and everything seems to go fine until the DS finishes loading the app, at which I see a Black Nintendo logo with a white background on the top DS screen. Only the Nintendo logo is all scrambled, and after a second, fades a bit, then that's all. Nothing happens.
<br/>
<br/>
 I thought maybe I was not holding down my connection in the back well enough, so I soldered a connection, which still does not make a bit of difference here, so what's up?
<br/>
<br/>
 How come games and all that crap will load fine, but when I want to get things done with Flashme, nothing happens!?!
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I have an old dark blue DS, it came with Mario 64 a few months ago.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Until you actually flash your firmware, you won't be able to WMB any non-digitally signed (read: un-official) *.nds files.  What you need is a GBA flash cartridge, or an M3/SuperCard style device so you can load the *.nds file onto some sort of removeable media; you then use Wifime to boot to that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I got a GBAMP v2 which I justed did the unofficial firmware update to.
<br/>
<br/>
What next? How do I get it to load code from here?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm fine and figured out why it would not work...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I need the updated multiboot aplication from the top link here:

<br/>
As opposed to the old software in the link in the tutorial everyone is using.
<br/>
<br/>
Shame shame.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
