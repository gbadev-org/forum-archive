    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, 
<br/>
Sorry for the not relevant question but I do not know
<br/>
where to ask. Recently I tried to insert my mario kart cartidge into
<br/>
the DS and although I hear the "click" when pushing the cartidge
<br/>
into the slot, the cartidge does not stay in but comes out again.
<br/>
And I cannot find a way that will let it in.
<br/>
Is this a common problem? Is there an easy way to fix it
<br/>
without sending it to nintendo?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You could open your DS and see if anything is broken (if you are talented enough).

Yeap.. when you use any thing that sticks out from the slot-1 you can broke the mechanism (by puling anything out with brute force). 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I broke my G6 flash USB linker... it is so cheaply made. I just connected cart to the linker and the linker broke. The contact pins are made from cheap metal that aren't flexible enough. Now it's working again with my soldered pins. I know my solution won't last long (maybe) and when it will start loosing contact I will probably have to replace the GB connector (where to heck do I get one?). I could also build the connector with my own, but I'm so lazy to make one.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm.. So does anyone know exactly what is being "broke"?  Is it in fact the "click-in/click-out" mechanism?  Does anyone know what is causing it to be broke.. specifically, not just saying "Super Pass breaks it", but what exactly took place to go from a working DS slot to a non-working DS slot?  Is it the pressure put on the DS slot when the DS it set down?  Could it be that the device doesn't fully "click-out" when removing it, putting stress on the mechanims?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it is the "spring" mechanim :P
<br/>
in the ds Cartrage holder then part that keeps it in and makes the sound is a sprint :D
<br/>
<br/>
if you notice on the side of all ds games there is a little space missing on the other wise smooth game...
<br/>
well it has a clipping spring to hold the game in untill its push futher then it is released again...
<br/>
<br/>
so im gussing its not a broken spring, but instead a peice of plastic it uses at the end of the ds game
<br/>
<br/>
shaped like this

<br/>
<br/>
(just a guess... from other same type holding mechanim)
<br/>
<br/>
so it is basicly a broken peice of plastic...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">
