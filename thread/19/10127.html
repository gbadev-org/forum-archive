I was looking over at winsunx.com, and their prices are very cheap, and i checked feedback so I know their a good store, but they're shipping charge is really high! $18!?
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know a site with prices like winsunx that will ship cheaply to either USA or India (USA preferably. I only ask India cuz thats where I am visiting right now)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the reason winsunx prices are cheaper, is because they jack up the shipping.
<br/>
the retailer feedback forum has a nice list of retailers (who would have thought, eh?). you can go through them all and compare prices.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
