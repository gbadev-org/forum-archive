    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've litteraly did hours of searching, without any result . So now I place my hopes upon the real experts...
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Problems:</span>
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>The FlashMe'd (v7!) DS won't run my Supercard, however it does work when I put in my PassMe1! Don't have a clue why this is. Cause it always worked with FlashMe on my EZFlash 16MB cartridge.
<br/>
</li><li>Whenever I load a .nds or patched .nds file (with Supercard's software) the system just gives me a white screen. Same goes for .gba files. Even when I stick the Supercard in my old GBA and try to load a .gba file. 
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What I did:</span>
<br/>
I searched all over google, technical forums such as this one and read several FAQ's regarding the Supercard. Nothing could be found
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Config:</span>
<br/>
An NDS from the first generation with the latest FlashMe v7. Also the Supercard runs Kernel V1.61 (2006.03.31 update). I've tested it within the supercard software and it also says 1.61. As for the PassMe it's version 1. But I can't imagine that to be the problem...
<br/>
<br/>
Someone please help me out here. I can't seem to figure this one out on my own :(
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">Small update:</span></span>
<br/>
Patched files ONLY seem to work. However, it still amazes me why I can't load it via FlashMe, but still am forced to use my PassMe...</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Spaceface on Mon Apr 10, 2006 7:39 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Some software works only in fail-safe mode, and some software doesn't work at all (it doesn't work with FlashMe or official firmware either). The patcher just makes it the amount loading go too high and never stops, no matter what mode or firmware you are using.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Use the .ds.gba version, if supplied, and rename it to .sc.nds, to distinguish it from a regular .nds file.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
