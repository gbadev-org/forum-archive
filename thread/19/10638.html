    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, pretty much everything I've wanted to know has been answered. Thanks a ton, guys! The only remaining concern I have is whether or not I can download the newest version of Moonshell and put it on the G6Flash Lite. I'll leave the original post + edits I made, below, in case anyone else is in my situation.
<br/>
Thanks again!

<span style="font-weight: bold">tl;dr version: Will newer Moonshells work on G6Flash Lite?</span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Hey guys, I've researched my options, and I'm looking at buying a G6 Lite device. The main concern I have is, well, I can't find any info about the G6 on any of these homebrew-related sites. I honestly have no interest in piracy, I'm just looking for a <span style="font-weight: bold">homebrew + media </span>player for my DS Lite that won't stick out (I currently have a GBAMP but on the Lite it looks terrible). But what I don't get is why no one mentions the G6 Lite. Is it really obscure? Does it go under another name with you fine folks? Is it a piece of trash?
<br/>
Any/all help is appreciated and welcomed, as I don't want to buy one if it's no good or incompatible with homebrew.
<br/>
Thanks in advance.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: In short, I want to know if I can still use my usual homebrew apps (Moonshell and DSOrganize are my favs) on the G6Flash Lite. Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT2: I would also like to know if the G6Flash can do drag-and-drop like GBAMP (for example, I could put an MP3 on my G6Flash and just plug it in and play it with Moonshell) or if I'd have to convert files or make an EXFS compile of Moonshell with the file.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT3: Two more questions, and then I'm done here.
<br/>
How much of current homebrew will be compatible with the G6Flash Lite? (Can I still use DSOrganize? Will things that don't work with GBAMP work with G6Flash Lite, like TickleGirl or whatever it's called?) 
<br/>
It seems I can only find the Chinese version of the G6 Flash Lite, can I still use that or will the language barrier be too difficult to overcome? And will I be able to upgrade it to English at any point in the future? 
<br/>
<br/>
Once I get these questions answered, I'll be certain on whether or not the G6 Flash Lite will be the one for me :p Thanks in advance for any help, guys!</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Yamishi on Wed Aug 02, 2006 6:37 pm; edited 4 times in total</span></div>

Well, what do you recommend for DS Lite homebrew + media usage? I don't mind if it sticks out a bit but I would prefer something that is flush, and for the love of all that is good, no more GBAMP sized devices :p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you have a site where I could check out the specs of Supercard? And if you've got a link for the MicroSD one as well, I'd appreciate it.
<br/>
Thanks!
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Also, what is the power consumption like with this? I don't want to have to recharge my DS every couple of hours when I'm only listening to music :p
<br/>
<br/>
Edit2: Here's the G6 Flash I was looking at: Ack, sorry, didn't realize I wasn't allowed to link to 'em.
<br/>
It's $84.50 CAN for the 4GBit (512MB) version... Although that one is Chinese :/
<br/>
<br/>
Yet Another Edit: It seems that the SuperCard Lite, with higher power consumption, and higher price (after buying a card and all), I might stick with the G6 Flash, but my concern remains: Will I still be able to do all my old homebrew stuff with it? (DSOrganize, Moonshell etc.)
<br/>
Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Yamishi on Wed Aug 02, 2006 4:00 am; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

I checked out SuperCard's official site, and it said the DS could run for about four hours with the SuperCard. That doesn't sound very good to me, when the G6 Flash Lite can apparently run for the normal running time of the DS Lite.

I'd still like to know if the G6 can run all my homebrew apps (DSOrganize and Moonshell are the most important to me).

Thanks a ton! :D That's what I wanted to hear. Which leaves only two questions; 
<br/>
How much of current homebrew will be compatible? (Can I still use DSOrganize? Will things that don't work with GBAMP work with G6Flash Lite, like TickleGirl or whatever it's called?)
<br/>
It seems I can only find the Chinese version of the G6 Flash Lite, can I still use that or will the language barrier be too difficult to overcome? And will I be able to upgrade it to English at any point in the future?

At the moment most of the PDA functions are pretty understandable even if you don't speak chinese :).

As for homebrew, as I said, sadly I am unable to start up my wiki at this time so I cannot make a compatibility list in the way I want to.

As far as I know, Moonshell works if you have the modified version and most .nds (tested DSlinux) and .ds.gba (tested scummVM GBA flash card version) homebrew runs on the G6lite.

Alright, that's perfect then. Even with the Chinese version of the PDA, I don't care much, as that's what I'll be using DSOrganize for (assuming it's compatible). So, although my mind is pretty much made up, I'm just curious; is it possible to run Moonshell without having a modified version? For instance, would I be able to download the newest version and run it?
<br/>
Thanks again, Scorpei, you've been a huge help.
