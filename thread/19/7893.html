<br/>
I got a doubl pack of supercard + superpass because I thought I would be getting a demo pack but I had to get a new one I tried anyway and got these result pluged superpass in, turn on NDS= the screen turns to the warning but does not say touch screen to continue instead it just goes to two white screens.
<br/>
Serial= NEH119----6
<br/>
<br/>
I just want to be 100% sure before I import a PM2 thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, you most probably have the new FW.
<br/>
<br/>
However, SuperCard team just made a simple "JTag" device to re-program SuperPass. More info here: <a href="http://www.supercard.cn" target="_blank">www.supercard.cn</a> .</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Iv'e got exactly the same problem, but the Aussie supplier of Supercards and Superpass (mcivan2005@hotmail.com) let me exchange it for a Superpass2 for no extra charge.
<br/>
<br/>
My serial is on Darkain's site and it says that it's compatible with pass me and superpass, but in reality it's not.
<br/>
<br/>
So if you got your DS in the last few months you most probably have a 98% chance that it is the new firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
