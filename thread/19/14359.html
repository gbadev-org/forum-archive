    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been having a lot of issues with homebrew on my SuperCard SD, mainly homebrew that must do any kind of file writing. It works about 80% of the time, but will corrupt files occasionally. Is this an issue with the SuperCardSD driver, or simply an un-resolved issue in the libraries that everyone else is dealing with too? I am looking into purchasing a new homebrew solution (probably top-slot) and I'm trying to weigh the needs with the cost, as otherwise my slot-2 device works fine.
<br/>
<br/>
For the record, it's an older SuperCard SD Rumble, the kind without the GBA SRAM, so basically the cheap one that only works with .nds files.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!

I believe its the same one as here: <a class="postlink" href="http://dldi.drunkencoders.com/index.php?title=SuperCard_rumble_%28SD_Card%29" target="_blank">http://dldi.drunkencoders.com/index.php?title=SuperCard_rumble_%28SD_Card%29</a><br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

<br/>
<br/>
kk, I'm going to take your advice about the moonshell DLDI, as I did notice that moonshell exhibited none of this strange behavior. However, that may not have been the issue. I came home today to first what appeared to be a corrupted FAT system on my card. Nothing too serious, just a format and a quick backup, except that it now appears to not want to hold a write in. I am the proud owner of a one-month old lightweight paperweight, in the form of a Wal-Mart MicroSD card. $60 too, and it was my first 2G card. I'm using my old 512 as a fallback, but I'm sure gonna miss that extra space...
<br/>
<br/>
So crud on that. I will definitely try the different DLDI and let you know how it turns out.

Will the card not hold a write even if you write to it from a PC operating system?

How long is the card's warranty?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">$60 is way too much to pay for a 2GB microSD. you should be able to get it for $20-$30 online. (i found one place which you can get it for $17 w/free shipping, if you're a new google checkout user). <span style="font-size: 7px; line-height: normal">cue tepples and his 'what if your parents wont let you buy online' ;)</span>
<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, definitely if it no longer works in your PC (test it on another, with a different reader, just to be sure), you should be able to get a free replacement. almost all flash media I've seen has at least a several year warranty, if not lifetime.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hm, are you trying to type in the url with brackets? Because you should be using the %28/%29 code instead for a URL...<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
