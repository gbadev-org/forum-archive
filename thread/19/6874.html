    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My m3 adapter has arrived!  So ive decided to make a thread so if anyone has any questions or a particular rom to test on it, then fire away!
<br/>
<br/>
impressions:
<br/>
flashed to latest firmware which apparently allows for good videos on it but unfortunately theres no way to use this feature currently as the software hasnt been updated to reflect these changes! (how retarded is that?).  So i cant really speak about anything related to its movie functions which are currently identical to the original.  I do like the fact that it isnt as tight a fit as the previous one so i dont feel as scared that my ds will ware away!.  now on to compatability:
<br/>
<br/>
Works
<br/>
SnesDs.ds.gba (with sound yey!)
<br/>
nesDs.nds
<br/>
official demos!
<br/>
dslinux.ds.gba
<br/>
ruby video.nds
<br/>
ds goo.nds
<br/>
heretic.ds.gba
<br/>
hexen.ds.gba
<br/>
scummvm.ds.gba
<br/>
pocketspc.ds.gba
<br/>
<br/>
doesnt work
<br/>
chisms cf driver
<br/>
moonshell (they have their own version but it is v0.3 not 3p1)
<br/>
ds multiboot
<br/>
darkstar multiboot (oddly enough the one on fireflys web site partially works but with garbled graphics and a dead touchscreen but when you try and load a demo you get white screen)
<br/>
<br/>
At first i thought it didnt support much at all but i realised it seem you have to press start to load .nds and A to load ds.gba.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as the gba part goes its pretty flawless even the videos seem a bit improved and emus such as smsadvance work great on it.  The nds functions though clearly arent finished and the interface needs lots of work since its currently just a fullscreen version of the previous one and makes no use of either the other screen or the stylus.  Saying that though this is THE way to run homebrew on the ds nodoubt and once chism can get the cf reading working (hopefully by getting the information out of them!) and video functions working in ds mode this device will truely be perfect!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by El Hobito on Fri Sep 16, 2005 11:30 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds like it always bankswitches the 32MB of RAM over the CF interface, so you can't directly access it.  Maybe a firmware patch could change it, or hacking it to see if it can bankswitch back to CF interface mode.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All the working things you listed - are they the .nds versions or .ds.gba?
<br/>
<br/>
Why do you say this is THE way to run homebrew on the ds?
<br/>
It's no different to the MP currently being used.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

im not even gonna bother answering that
<br/>
<br/>
the m3 is compatable with file regardless of whether they are .nds or ds.gba you just have to press different buttons depending on the type.
<br/>
<br/>
dwedit : but their moonshell mod works like normal so surely its just a matter of finding the controls registers like chism said.  Hopefully though theyll tell us what needs to be done but its gonna take some doing i suggest we all email them asking for info cos if they think we can make their product better than the supercard theyll probably help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't see that the M3 offers anything to the homebrew scene we don't already have.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd be glad if someone could be bothered to point out the advantages.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, but of course, it plays commercial games...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if you had read any of my post you would have seen that i didnt mention commercial games anywhere or even hinted at it.  The m3 has all the compatability advantages of a flashcart due to having 32 megs of ram on it but with all the advantages of cf reading like was demonstrated with scummvm.  And no it doesnt play commercial games they would need to be patched but you would need to do that for a flashcart anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't count on me to hack it. If you can get the information needed to access the CF card, I will put it into the driver. But at the moment I don't have an M3, and probably won't get one for a while. It is a bit hard to hack a piece of hardware when you don't have it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Darkfader probably deserves a free M3 as well. He wrote the flasher used to install my firmware, and he independantly worked out how to read from the CF card. He also showed me how to write to the CF card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
