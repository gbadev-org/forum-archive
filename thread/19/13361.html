Nopass slot-1 +Supercard(with RAM) slot-2
<br/>
- Basically most (if not all?) DS/GBA homebrew support
<br/>
- Defiently can backup some saves, no idea about newer games support (depends if there's a homebrew that can, which I'd assume there prob is)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">~ Boot DS and <span style="font-weight: bold">GBA homebrew</span>
<br/>
GBA homebrew will require a Slot-2 (GBA slot) device. So that:
<br/>
1) rules out all the nice Slot-1 solutions.
<br/>
2) requires you to buy a PassMe device as well to pass to the Slot-2 device. If you are going to flash your DS, this PassMe device is only needed <span style="font-weight: bold">once</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
~ Backup/restore my <span style="font-weight: bold">DS cartridge game saves</span> (type 4 [Pokemon D/P] saves must be supported) 
<br/>
This doesn't depend on the device, but on the software available. I'm not sure if a Slot-1 solution (which involves hot-swapping) is available. Slot-2 is again the better choice.
<br/>
<br/>
~ Is compatible with a <span style="font-weight: bold">firmware version 1</span> release day DS
<br/>
Don't worry. I'm pretty sure all the devices will work.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I guess you're looking for a Slot-2 device + PassMe device. Maybe a Supercard MiniSD + Superkey?
<br/>
<br/>
Of course you also need memorycard (type [CF, SD, miniSD, microSD] depends on the Slot-2 device).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Lick on Tue Jun 05, 2007 3:59 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Scratch GBA homebrew, it is not needed, just DS homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking at a slot 1 or a slot 1 and slot 2 combination to allow me to back up DS saves and boot DS homebrew. Supercard minisd seems a little pricey, I was looking at the R4DS, but that won't let me backup my Pearl saves (how would I use a slot 1 solution to hotswap and back up saves)?
<br/>
<br/>
How about getting an R4DS and a cheap GBA flashcart, flashing my DS with Flashme using the R4DS, and then using software on the GBA flashcart to back up my saves? 
<br/>
<br/>
Would this work? 
<br/>
<br/>
What GBA flashcart would you recommend for this purpose? I need just enough size on the cart to store the backup software and a single Pokemon save.
<br/>
<br/>
It would also be nice if the GBA flashcart had the RAM expansion capability.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm willing to allot:
<br/>
~ $30 for a slot 1 device (Looking at R4DS)
<br/>
~ $20 for a GBA flashcart
<br/>
~ $10 for a MiniSD card
<br/>
<br/>
I'll take a look, thank you your your help. :)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT : Nevermind, I keep changing my mind. Okay, I'll get a Superkey and a slot 2 Supercard combo. I'll be able to boot all types of homebrew, as well as back up DS game saves! Thank you for your help!
<br/>
<br/>
One more confirmation. The Supercard SD DOES work with .NDS files right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Getting a slot-1 device and the EZ-V 3in1 expansion pack combo is becoming an increasingly popular choice.  It gives you the benefits of slot-1 while still retaining the ability to use GBA homebrew via the expansion pack.  The 16 MB of RAM in the device can also be utilized by DSLinux.  You need to use third-party tools in order to take advantage of the 3in1's benefits on slot-1 devices other than the EZ-V itself, but from what I can tell they work very well.  This is mostly popular because the expansion pack itself is very cheap for the benefits it provides, only around $20 or so.  However, you must use it with a slot-1 device, as it cannot function on its own.
<br/>
<br/>
The expansion pack is currently only available in Lite form from most retailers, though a Phat-sized version is currently coming out in a few shops.
<br/>
<br/>
Using SavSender, one can manage cartridge saves from any device, slot-1 or slot-2, provided that you can get the DS homebrew wifi working.  There's a topic at GBAdev here about it.
<br/>
<br/>
The Supercard SD can indeed boot .nds homebrew files as long as you have a passthrough device inserted to boot it into DS mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The cheapest SLOT-2 card you can find is probably SuperCard. Then you can use the R4 as the SLOT-1 card to boot the SuperCard.

Traditional GBA flashcarts are split into two regions: the NOR region, which can be up to 32 MiB but which only specialized software can rewrite, and the SRAM region, which has four banks of 64 KiB.

Some homebrew .nds files will need a loader, but you can use the "magic homebrew patcher" to add that.

Unless one would have to pay $50 more for a Wi-Fi router. Or unless "managing" is more complicated than just backing up. For instance, I'm developing a save viewer for some DS game (it's not Pok?mon) that runs directly on the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've seen the 3 in 1, however I've never seen a Phat version. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have a spare GBA case lying around (my phat rumble pack) so can I just stick the 3 in 1 hardware into the rumble pack (I'd really rather get a phat version of the 3 in 1 in the first place)? 
<br/>
<br/>
What will I need to pair up with a 3 in 1 in order to meet the above requirments (be able to backup game saves, run DS homebrew)?
<br/>
<br/>
When can I expect to see the phat version of the 3 in 1 out in stores?
<br/>
<br/>
I would really just go with a Supercard MiniSD and Superkey, but this option forgoes the extra RAM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As long as you don't get a Supercard Rumble, you should get the full 32 MB of RAM that Supercards offer.  The Rumble series sucks anyway (lots of homebrew applications don't even boot), so I'd recommend getting the regular non-Rumble Supercard anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
You could pair up any slot-1 device like the R4 or M3 Simply or Supercard DS with the 3in1 if you want.  Note that a NoPass device by itself will not count.
<br/>
<br/>
*checks Retailer Feedback section to make sure he can mention the stores*  I've seen Phat-sized versions at BambooGaming and Winsunx so far.  RealHotStuff is where I would normally recommend buying from, but their shipments of Phat-sized 3in1s have been held up at customs for 2 weeks now.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I have a Supercard miniSD myself and can safely say that it runs most DS homebrew that's out there, and it lets you backup/restore savegames fine.  Many people just seem to be switching to slot-1 devices, so the 3in1 is a good way to add GBA functionality to their purchase.  I was just throwing the option out there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The "homebrew was not important" post was NOT made by me. Maybe I just previewed the post and thought I had submitted it.
<br/>
<br/>
Okay so I ordered everything, thanks for your help guys:
<br/>
R4DS
<br/>
SuperCard SD
<br/>
1GB MicroSD card w/adapter
<br/>
<br/>
The R4 is bundled with a SD reader, and I can use the MicroSD with adapter with both the SuperCard SD and the R4DS so I'm happy.
<br/>
<br/>
I should be all set. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
