    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok so I have the Knoppix live cd on my blank CD that I burned it to. Anyways, when I had switched my bios to IDE CD-ROM for the first bootup, then my harddisk, then my dvd driver. So I saved the bios section. I then went into my name on winxp home edition then inserted the Knoppix live cd. Exited it. Then I restarted my computer. Now there's one problem now, there's no part where it says, boot from cd. Usaully your able to do this without going to the boot selection menu. And selecting a drive. Well I had to go into that. Anyways, I highlighted the cd-driver and had hit enter. This is what came up.
<br/>
<br/>
Press F1 to try reboot, press F2 to go to Bios.
<br/>
<br/>
Well I had hit F1 again. Same thing happened again. I downloaded the Version 4.0.2 live cd that I found on <a href="http://simon.teunvandeberg.nl/nifi/howto_win+knoppix.html" target="_blank">http://simon.teunvandeberg.nl/nifi/howto_win+knoppix.html</a> So I had put it on the blank cd. Well since the Boot-up from the linux live cd didn't work. I then tried it out on VMplayer. I booted the data file like I was supposed to that I found on this site again <a href="http://simon.teunvandeberg.nl/nifi/howto_win+knoppix.html" target="_blank">http://simon.teunvandeberg.nl/nifi/howto_win+knoppix.html</a> (its the knoppixnifi file) Anyways, so I uploaded the file on VMplayer. And my live cd was in I had hit create since i was told to. Then I had hit cd. But nothing on the screen happened. Can anyone help with this serius problem that I'm having. Oh yea, I don't have the USB device now. I was wondering if linux live cd would boot up w/o the USB device.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">HidiHi :), I wonder why you didn't post this in the thread I made here when I made the guide.
<br/>
Anyway, I'm glad you didn't as now I can keep that as a kinda changelog.
<br/>
<br/>
As for your question, Knoppix will boot fine without the Nintendo USB device inserted (if you read correctly I want it out until you load the driver).
<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering, when you used VMplayer, did you change the VMDK config file?
<br/>
It is set to work with my system and you need to adjust the location of the iso for it to work.
<br/>
<br/>
As for your Bios, did you have it in your CD-rom drive or in your DVD drive (as you state you set: CD-rom, HD, DVD-rom as a boot sequens)?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, you might want to try a MD5 checker on the iso, maybe your download was corrupt.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Scorpei on Fri Jul 28, 2006 12:04 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok one, I don't have the USB device yet, next part is. I have in my boot sequnce. My A driver (floppy drive for me) C driver, and my cd rom driver. I changed my bios to start the cd rom as first. I had put in my cd rom after windows booted , restarted my computer and usally it would say boot from cd which it didn't, so I went into my other menu and tried booting it from there. Nothing happened. Yes I changed the VMDK file to work for knoppix</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The only other thing I can think of that can cause your problem:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Eum, via a md5 checker.....
<br/>
<a href="http://www.fastsum.com/press/md5-checker.php" target="_blank">http://www.fastsum.com/press/md5-checker.php</a>
<br/>
And the md5 check file:
<br/>
<a href="ftp://knoppix.ftp.fu-berlin.de/KNOPPIX_V4.0.2CD-2005-09-23-EN.iso.md5" target="_blank">ftp://knoppix.ftp.fu-berlin.de/KNOPPIX_V4.0.2CD-2005-09-23-EN.iso.md5</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The code you get from FastSum should match the code in the MD5 file.
<br/>
<br/>
*just calculated mine (btw, FastSum is nagware) and it matches the MD5 file: 1188f67d48c9f11afb8572977ef74c5e</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok here's my code from the 4.0.2 md5 file or w/e the file is. Well I wasn't sure which one was which.
<br/>
<br/>
5B4AC2D912FBE516FEF77ECC6B018A6A *KNOPPIX_V4.0.2CD-2005-09-23-EN.iso.md5

<br/>
<br/>
I don't know which is which. the md5sums file was in my knoppix cd
<br/>
<br/>
The download file is at the top
<br/>
<br/>
and the checksums I think I got in the fastsum folder.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">uh?
<br/>
did you try running the .iso through FastSum?
<br/>
*click files, then select the iso, then let FastSum calculate the md5 if it matched mine it's okay, if not your iso is corrupt.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, I wasn't sure on what to put through anyways, my code is the same one as yours. Anyways, before I had upgraded my vmplayer, I had tried it on the original one that was right below the new release. Then I upgraded to see if it would work and still the same thing happened. So could you tell me which one I should get of VMware player</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm baffeled, have you looked at my videos (the first video I think shows me booting VMplayer)?
<br/>
I really don't understand how to fix your problem (or what is causing it).
<br/>
If I get this strait you can't boot a CD, nor can you boot the CD inside VMplayer yet the CD is good....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The boot up screen of Knoppix?

Try just pressing enter there, it should then boot (see the first video for details).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
