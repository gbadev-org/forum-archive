    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am trying to decided which passkey cart to get, the Datel MAX Media Launcher or the PassCard 2
<br/>
<br/>
Seems the Datel is the best choice from reading this review:
<br/>
<a href="http://forums.maxconsole.net/showthread.php?t=20057" target="_blank">http://forums.maxconsole.net/showthread.php?t=20057</a>
<br/>
and this one:

<br/>
<br/>
But I hanv't seen many reviews on the PassCard 2 or any comparisons. PassCard2 is a lot more available at retailers. Only place i can really find the Datel is at:
<br/>
<a href="http://us.codejunkies.com/shop/product.asp?c=US&amp;cr=USD&amp;cs=$&amp;r=0&amp;l=1&amp;ProdID=321" target="_blank">http://us.codejunkies.com/shop/product.asp?c=US&amp;cr=USD&amp;cs=$&amp;r=0&amp;l=1&amp;ProdID=321</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I could get both the Supercard or M3 (hanv't decided) and a PassCard 2 at either of these Canadian places.

<br/>
<br/>
I am leaning towards the PassCard2 a bit right now, since the retail stores in canada where I would get all my other accesories also carry it. So less shipping and hassle.
<br/>
<br/>
Unless the Datel is better, but I don't know if it is. The both seem the same in the way they don't need a game, and they are both the size of a ds cart, so they fit in the DS nicely.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, they're very different. Max Media Launcher is a NoPass (you could call it PassME3, I suppose, though that's technically wrong), that means you don't need a SRAM enabled device for it to work, just plug and play. Also, it consumes less power.

Does it consume less power? do you know of any stats or links for that?

That would be a good reason though.

I found a PassCard 2 reivew and from reading this I don't see the difference in functionality between it and the Datel MAX

Datel?s device is the second to hit the market that allows you to pass the NDS code without the need for a NDS cart plugged into it. There is another device out there that was released first. Not only is the other device based off a game, it?s larger, only comes with 4k EEPROM, a lot more expensive and doesn?t work on the newer Nintendo DS consoles.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Thanks for the confirmation. Added to my <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/pass/" target="_blank">passthrough methods page</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
And no, the PassCard 2 isn't the same, as it relies on SRAM (i.e. no GBAMP v2 compatibility, and no saving in homebrew on SD adapters).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You're pretty much guaranteed this will come out in favour of MML since it's much more convenient and compatible than the other solutions. The only problem I've heard of so far is that the notch in the card isn't quite the right size for the locking mechanism which can cause it to stick in the DS. Hopefully they're going to retool it, I've heard one report of a damaged DS :/<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

MML &gt; Passcard 2, but the Passcard 3 might be superior to both?

I'm still doubting whether I'll flash my DS Lite when it arrives, or settle for using a card device.

<br/>
Flashing scares the crap out of me, from what I read of it. Passcard's battery abuse sucks too though. Do you think passcard 3, or that improved MML I saw someone talking about, will make for an *actual* alternative to flashing?

Get out your Dremel because the MAX Media Launcher's notch is noticeably smaller. On a DS Game Card, the locking notch is the same depth as the notch next to the pins, but on the MAX Media Launcher, it's about two-thirds of the expected depth. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/max_media_launcher_notch.jpg" target="_blank">Picture speaks</a>, but it would be easier to see with a better camera.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried it using the Select button on my flashed DS, and MoonShell and DSOrganize didn't exhibit the rapid-in-and-out-of-sleep-mode behavior that some people have been reporting. I hope to have a chance to try it on my cousins' systems with v2 and v4 stock firmware this week.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It means that some more cautious DS owners are going to want to carefully use a rotary cutting tool to make the notch bigger.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Nope.  The MML only has a 512KB flash rom chip on it.  There is good news in this however.  Due to the fact that datel was stupid enough to not write their FPGA to only give the first 512KBs,  It is possible to convert the bad dump,  (first 512KBs is bad), into a good dump. (the remaining 15.5MBs of the rom are mirror copies of the actual rom chip,  including the header, the blowfish SBOX/PBOX tables (for decrypting the level 1 commands), and the fully encrypted Secure area.)   Just read 0x80000 to 0xFFFFF, and place that data into 0x0 to 0x7FFFF.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

pokemon trozei makes a funny noise when you shut the lid, the screen flashes for a sec and returns to normal (doesn't turn off)     - is this 'sleep cycling'? not the noise of course, thats the game

With MAX Media Launcher inserted, and the demos launched through MoonShell:
<br/>
<ul><li>Electroplankton demo blinks at about 1 Hz. </li><li>Pok?mon Trozei demo plays the lid closed sound, goes to sleep and then immediately wakes up. When I open the lid, it plays the lid opened sound. </li><li>Brain Age demo behaves normally. It even recognizes "blue" if I say it in a relaxed tone with the DS at arm's length. </li></ul> But if I pak-swap to Tetris DS while in MoonShell, all demos' sleep modes work.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

maybe they couldn't take that code from a real game because if anything else they have done to do this is not illegeal yet, and that would be?...

how about after you launch moonshell you don't replace MML just leave it out?
