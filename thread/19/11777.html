    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Datel is selling what seems to be a NoPass RW, 128 MB MicroSD card, card reader and a CD of 30 homebrew for ?19.99. It's cheaper than X9 and Acekard, but judging from their past record, it probably wouldn't work very well.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow.. that is cheap!  If we can get homebrew working on it, that will be the cheapest method!  And that price is WITH the SD card???
