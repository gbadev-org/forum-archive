<br/>
<br/>
I am looking to purchase a M3, but I am a little stuck on which version I should get.  CF or SD?
<br/>
<br/>
I know there has been a breakthrough on the M3 CF to read directly on the CF with homebrew and that chism will probably add that to his drivers so we can run homebrew with CF access just like GBAMP.
<br/>
<br/>
My question is, do you think the same will happen with the SD version?  Because I like this model better myself but I don't want to loose any benefits that the CF version could give me...
<br/>
<br/>
I'll be awaiting your answer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think SD will be supported for a little while. It was easy to add support for the CF M3, since it has the same style interface to the compact flash card (ATA). SD cards use a completely different interface, which means more must be found out about the SD M3 before it will work.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
