    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys!! I hope someone can help me with this. I recently bought a R4 Revolution and a EZ Flash 3 in 1, both intended for GBA development initially. The problem is, when I load any homebrew ROM in the EZFlash, the screen goes to the Game Boy start screen, but the Nintendo logo below is replaced by some garbage, and then it freezes and doesn't run the ROM. The curious thing is this doesn't happen with the Another World ROM, but then again, it does happen with Elite: The New Kind. Anyone knows what the problem may be?? I'm using the latest HAM distribution for development, as I still don't quite understand the DevKitPro toolchain.

Thanks in advance for your help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can use 'gbafix' to correct the logo. This is a command-line tool included with devkitARM or available separately from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbadev.org/tools.php?section=Header" target="_blank">main page &gt; tools &gt; header</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
