omgomg, my M3 isn't loading anything now... NDS mode it just dies, like blank screen (not white, but power off type of blank). That's for ALL the stuff that I tried... Moonshell and stuff... but GBA mode works... I formatted it to FAT16, but it still doesn't load anything in NDS mode... Nuu Please Help, I am in need of assistance.
<br/>
<br/>
THanks to those who helped =D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds like its firmware is corrupt. If GBA mode still works, then you should be able to reflash it.
<br/>
<br/>
Or, your SD card might be messed up. Have you tried checking for errors and defragging?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The SD card has no errors, and I defragged it alot of times...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
