    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All right, I've been reading about the whole DS hacking thing for quite a while. I understand flash carts, PassMe, and the wireless PassMe. I am a bit confused about something.
<br/>
<br/>
I saw a site that had the E3 Nintendo DS demos avaliable for download. Of course, they're in .nds format. Now, I always thought you could put those NDS files on a GBA flash cart, and launch them. Apparently, its not that easy....
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">PassMe is a device which, when combined with a regular DS cart (like, say, Metroid), tricks the DS (by modifying the cart header) into loading code from the GBA cart slot.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
So, if im understand this correctly, you would need pass me to run the NDS files that are on the GBA flash cart. Fair enough.....but....
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">PassMe DOES NOT work with Commercial dumps!</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
So, now im confused. Now i <span style="font-weight: bold">can't</span> run the E3 Demos?
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I'm just asking what I would need to run those demos on my ds. I'm gonna get a GBA flash card soon, hoping that I would be able to load DS games onto that, and play them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, I see your confusion.  First, to answer your question, yes, you can play the demos using *Me.
<br/>
<br/>
To explain why, you have to understand that on a real, commercial DS game, it expects to run from the NDS cart slot.  It will attempt to load graphics and code from there, since, well, that's where it's supposed to run from.
<br/>
<br/>
Code that's been downloaded, OTOH, is designed to run from WRAM.  So, when the code is downloaded, the DS first downloads the cart header.  The header tells the DS where to save the ARM9 and ARM7 image it's about to download, and then where to begin execution.  So, the DS downloads the code into WRAM, then gets the ARM7 and ARM9 going at the correct addresses.
<br/>
<br/>
With the *Me solution, what we do is place the normally-downloaded code in the GBA cart along with a loader.  The loader copies the code into WRAM and sets the ARM7 and ARM9 executing at the correct addresses.  In essence, it's emulating the Download Play functionality.  BUT, understand, this works specifically because the code was designed to work in this environment.  Real commercial NDS games can't be run from the flash cart this way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, I can run the wifi demo's with *Me and a flash card.
<br/>
<br/>
But what about future games? Like, lets say someone extracts the nds file from a game, like Meteos. I wouldnt be able to put that game on a flash cart and run it with *Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No. Commercial games like Super Mario etc load additional assets from the DS Card Slot, BESIDES just the arm7 and arm9 binaries. the commercial wifi demos have ONLY the arm7 and arm9 binaries, with no additional stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I understand it better now, but I still dont know how you would go about playing <span style="font-weight: bold">official</span> commercial games running on the DS, without actually buying them of course.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Steal them off of Best Buy's shelves and run like hell ?
<br/>
You can't and that's a good thing. We are not a forum dedicated to warez. We make games for fun. Some of us make game for a living... You see my point ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">O.K. I understand your a forum dedicated to homebrew games and such. I get your point. The homebrew games like Darkains look <span style="font-weight: bold">really</span> good, like minesweeper. Im so hooked on that game. 
<br/>
<br/>
its just I dont have that much money, so I cant go all willy-nilly buying WIreless Ethernet cards, Flash cards or PassMe's :P
<br/>
<br/>
But thanks for the help :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#43718 - cocole - Wed May 25, 2005 10:17 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Anyway, I am going to answer your question. 
<br/>
<br/>
Right now, there are only 2 commercial game dumps. They were done by DarkFader of this very board. One of them you already have if you live in Europe or America : Metroid Prime 1st hunt. The 2nd one is Mario 64 DS.
<br/>
The only way you can play these commercials releases is with a neoflash kit. Neo flash kit is starting at $200. It can playing the dumps mentionned (well, patched dumps indeed).
<br/>
<br/>
So hum, let's see : neoflash = $200. Play metroid I already have. So basically it's $200 for Mario 64 DS. Add the fact that saves are redirected to another DS cart which looses its saves then.
<br/>
<br/>
I think I'm gonna buy Mario 64 DS preplayed at ebgames and stick away from the neoflash kit.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in the future, it'll able to dump, play dumps, etc... But not right now !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh ok. I really understand now. I was so confused before :P
<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, I just need to buy a passme and Flash card...I have some money, but I dont know if I wanna spend it on that. I mean, I'd love to play the homebrew games, and Darkains Gmaes (darkain kicks ASS!! :D), but I dont think I wanna spend too much on a flash card. Thanks again for your help!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">neo flash CAN play the metroid dump?
<br/>
do they patch the rom to look in the ds slot? wouldnt that work for passme too?
<br/>
or is there a chip on the neoflash for temp storage of textures etc?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">its been my understanding that with a passme and a .ds rom you can add the ndsmall.bin to the front of it (copy /b ndsmall.bin+rom.nds outfile.ds.gba) and be able to play it (as long as you have a cart with correct save mem space in the passme). 
<br/>
<br/>
of course, youd have to get those golden patched roms from somewhere, and there are only the 2....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yep. From my understanding they are the DF dumps patched and "rebranded".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

From what I gather it works with a *me / <span style="font-weight: bold">XG2</span> cart
