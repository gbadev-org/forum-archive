    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I just got my M3 and Passkey today. I also got some shitty 512 MB SD card. When I first tried using the M3 it couldn't find my SD card, but I fiddled around with it a bit and I finally got it working. 
<br/>
<br/>
Then I went to eat dinner and turned off my DS, when I got back and turned it back on it wouldn't find my SD card anymore. My DS is a Silver one from the EU launch(bought like 10 days afterwards, model number NTR-001). Anyone know what happened and how to fix it(if there's anything to fix at all, maybe I'm just doing something wrong)
<br/>
<br/>
edit: Forgot, my SD card is a Hama 512 SD. Since it's not one of the most popular brands I can imagine it having poor driver support.
<br/>
<br/>
edit2: Ok I've been fiddling around with it some more and found out that it at least detects that a card is in the M3. At least it seems like it, since different things happen when I have the card in and when I don't, but it doesn't seem to be able to read it. It still works just fine(the card that is) when connected to my PC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Currently the best cards to use with the M3 SD are Sandisc and Kingston SD cards.
<br/>
<br/>
In the future, the M3 team will be releasing firmware updates to allow more SD cards to be used.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey i am in the exact same situation mocker... have you tried flipping the switch on the passkey to card and booting into gba mode? my scenario is very similar to you mocker but i can boot into gba mode... this means i can at least do updates if a future update allows better compatibility
<br/>
<br/>
i describe my scenario is a little more detail on the <a class="postlink" href="http://m3-forum.com/viewtopic.php?t=371&amp;start=15" target="_blank">m3-forums</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
