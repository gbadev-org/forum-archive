    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to buy my 10-year-old sister a DS flash card to run Colors!, but she loses things. About the smallest thing she can keep track of is a DS Game Card, and definitely not a microSD card that <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/gbaforum/how_big_is_microsd.jpg" target="_blank">just barely covers most of my thumbnail</a>. So what would you recommend?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try to hunt down a Supercard CF, if you can still find one. Ok, this thing sticks out quiet a lot, especially on a DS lite, but at least CF Cards are quiet big.
<br/>
Also the DLDI for it is pretty good and Colors! works nicely on it (I was using mine until about a month ago, when I finally got a R4). Of course you need to flash the DS for it, but I really guess YOU know that ;-)
<br/>
I guess a GBAmp should be equally big, but actually I never had one...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If that's a DS Lite you're talking about it would be madness to destroy the usability of the handheld with a CF adapter. Even with a risk of losing things, I'd go for R4 with a 256 or 512Mb card - cheap enough in case the microSD gets lost, and unless she wants use the thing as portable music player that's more than enough space for Colors! and other homebrew around.
<br/>
<br/>
Also hopefully she doesn't want to plug the SD card in and out all the time like we tend to do... In fact I forecast that it's likely you'll have to copy the stuff for her anyways. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">N-card/FireLink/D-Link is cheap and don't use microSD. i hear it's no fun if you want to load software often(slow loading time and requires a slot-2 linker), but at about $30 total its cheapest. i don't have one myself but it might fit your needs.  it's what i planned to put in a DS for my 7 year old son until he broke the DS itself! =(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, an internal-memory device like the N-card or one of its clones would probably work.  It has auto-DLDI patching with full read/write support so you don't have to use the read-only file from the DLDI Wiki.  It'll require you to flash it via the slot-2 adapter and linker cable, but it seems like it would work.  You'd still have plenty of space for Colors drawings.  Granted, I don't have one myself either, so this isn't a personal account of it or anything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Acekard RPG has 1G of built-in memory. That would be hard to lose.
<br/>
Of course you could argue that your sister has built-in memory too, and looses that, so i'm not sure what the best option would be.
<br/>
<br/>
Superglue maybe?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it just going to be for colors, or is she going to want to play MP3s and watch videos on it as well.   If that is the case, then non media adapters wont' do (imo).  You'll have to go with something that will use a full size SD card.  You might want to try painting it orange or some other bright color to help reduce the chance of losing it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could glue it into slot-1 for extra security.  Not that I imagine it'd be much good as a DS after the procedure.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?cuyb10fzdz2" target="_blank">Strummer</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?71zxcztscix" target="_blank">Drummer?</a>.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">An N-Card clone seems like the best choice to me.  If she'll be writing stuff to it a lot, there's a USB adapter available for those cards now so you don't have to use the slow slot-2 writer cartridge.
