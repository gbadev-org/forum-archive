Ok, do you have the new firmware?  If you do, you can't  use the GBAMP to boot the NDS using PassMe2 since it doesn't have SRAM.  
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, assuming everything is in order, you need to get Chism's GBAMP firmware hack v2 first of all. (found  at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.geocities.com/chishm1/gbamp/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/chishm1/gbamp/index.html</a>).  You need to boot the GBAMP up as normal, and then go into the NES Game option and launch NDSMP.gba.  Follow the instructions there to update the firmware of your GBAMP (you may need to install an official firmware update for the GBAMP after doing this...old versions required you to do so but I don't think the newer ones do).
<br/>
<br/>
After that, when you get your PassMe, put an NDS file on your GBMP in the root directory named _BOOT_MP.nds.  This can be any NDS homebrew, I recommend a loader or something with a loader built in, such as MightyMax's GBAMP Multiboot or MoonShell.  From there just start up the NDS with the PassMe and the GBAMP inserted and it will boot up the _BOOT_MP.nds file on the card.  :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The <span style="color: red">v4</span> firmware seems to affect only 1. "iQue DS" units sold in China, 2. units with a red, teal, or pink case, and 3. units sold in October 2005 or later. If you bought a silver or electric-blue DS before the end of September 2005, you should have the old (v1 through v3) firmware.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

You're welcome..and I agree with Tepples, you're probably absolutely fine.  :)  
<br/>
<br/>
*edit*
<br/>
I forgot to mention...if you boot up the GBAMP without your PassMe, as you would a GBA cart, it still retains all functionality it used to have, just in case you were wondering.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
