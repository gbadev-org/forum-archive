    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
the subject line is entirely too short. My question is this: Since the DS has got a GBA slot, is it possible to play a homebrew GBA game on a flashcard using that slot, without having to flash the firmware of the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
Is it correct that I only need passme2 and the like if I want to use homebrew applications that are specifically made for the DS (i.e. make use of the dual screens for example)?
<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GBA homebrew will run fine from a flash card without needing to do anything to your DS. You only need passme/passme2/nopass if you intend to play DS homebrew. I could have just said yes.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
