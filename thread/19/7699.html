    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I want to send in my DS so AheadGames can install the flashme update but I have some questions:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Well I have no printer and it says I need to send a printed invoice with my DS through mail so they can install. Is there anyway I can get around this?
<br/>
<br/>
2)With the NDS patcher, when I put the rom in the GBA Flashcart (Xrom)
<br/>
will it save the NDS game data on the GBA Flashcart?
<br/>
<br/>
3)How many saves can I keep on the flashcart?
<br/>
<br/>
Thats all</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1) Go someplace that has a printer? Like a copy shop, in US we have this thing called "Kinko's" (now owned by fedex). I'm sure you have something like this. Or you could go to a library, they usually let you print (sometimes for a fee, at most 10c per page). I don't know why I'm even answering this question, I guess I'm just a nice guy, but finding a printer has nothing to do with DS Development.
<br/>
2) We don't do that kind of stuff here. (this is a DEV aka "Development" board, not a "Help noobs pirate games" board, sorry. try gbat*** or p****t h****n)
<br/>
3) See #2.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, PassME2 is a better solution IMHO.
<br/>
<br/>
You can mod it later or sell it. And if you'll want to remove FlashME someday, it can be done with ease.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
