<br/>
<br/>
I recently ordered a supercard SD from <span style="font-weight: bold">[URL removed by MOD]</span> and i have everything i need (SD card 1GB, sd card reader, supercard SD, and a nopass) now i'm downloading some homebrew rom's and was wondering if they have to all be converted to ****.sc.nds or can i just use the .nds files?
<br/>
also I already have used the utility thing to get the .dsq files and .sav files.
<br/>
thank you very much 
<br/>
<br/>
PS can you link me to a download of the converter if i need it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyway, the converter is called "dsbuild". It converts .nds to ds.gba, and ds.gba is the same format as sc.nds. But due to changes in the init code implemented a few devkitARM versions ago, any recent .nds should work unchanged on the SuperCard.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok i've run into a problem... 
<br/>
i just patched all my roms with the dldi patcher thing for supercard SD and now when I put my sd card in my scsd it says "Not FAT format... Please turn off GBA" 
<br/>
does this have something to do with me reformatting my SD card?
<br/>
Do I have to re download all my ROM's and stuff? (That Would suck!)
<br/>
<br/>
please get back to me on this soon! thanks again
<br/>

EDIT: Also if it helps when i right click on the drive under properties it says...
<br/>
"File System- FAT32" if that has anything to do with it.
<br/>
<br/>
Also if i have to how can I get my SD card to the original state as when I got it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Backup the data on your card to your hard drive.  Right-click the drive in Windows Explorer and hit Format.  When it asks you for the filesystem, choose FAT instead of FAT32.  The Supercard can only handle the FAT16/FAT filesystem.  Once it's done formatting, copy your files back.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, what exactly are you patching with DLDI?  Only <span style="font-style: italic">homebrew</span> with DLDI support will be patchable.  Patching any other file with DLDI will only succeed in corrupting it.
<br/>
<br/>
Also realize that the "Supercard Magic Homebrew Patcher" is not the same thing as DLDI patching.  The homebrew patcher simply makes sure there is a header attached to the front of your file so that the Supercard can launch the file to begin with rather than giving dual white screens.  The DLDI patcher actually inserts the FAT code needed to interact with your filesystem, which is used once the file is booted.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
