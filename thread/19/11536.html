I have decided to use one of the Supercard dvices to store my files. what are reliable and clean sites to buy a supercard product from? I also want to buy a Passcard3 or a Superkey so when you reccommend a site, please make sure it includes Supercard products and Nopass devices. I also want a Usa site. I wont be ordering from some hong kong site that makes me pay $20 shipping. thank you.

This is a commonly asked question on the DS Flash Equipment forum. Unfortunately, the administrators have <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9484" target="_blank">dictated</a> that we are not permitted to promote any single retailer.* Thus, the only answer we're allowed to give you is to go look in the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewforum.php?f=13" target="_blank">Retailer Feedback forum</a> yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
* In practice, an exception applies if the retailer is operated by the product's manufacturer.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
