    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I'm trying to find out if anyone knows a range of serial numbers for the original DS that have the v5 firmware installed. I'd like to buy one that I can flash to enable the backlight levels. Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think there is a special range of serial numbers that has a specific firmware, if I remember correctly it was tested a lot some time ago. You could ask to test play the DS and use the pictochat test as described <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7961" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sadly, I can't test the DS before buying, because it is new in box. Once I open the box, it's mine. I know that a lot of research was done with regards to the issue, but I believe that was before v5 of the firmware came out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
