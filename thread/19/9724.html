I will be one of the select few purchasing a DS lite in north america on June 11th. I will be flashing the lite the day I get it and will be posting my results here.
<br/>
<br/>
So far I have ordered the following items on friday may 27th. 
<br/>
<br/>
1) SuperCard mini-sd from <a href="http://www.kicktrading.ca" target="_blank">www.kicktrading.ca</a>
<br/>

<br/>

2) 2GB mini-sd card from ebay branded "magu". 
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
3) PassMe2 from <a href="http://www.dspassme.com" target="_blank">www.dspassme.com</a>
<br/>

<br/>
I will be flashing the DS Lite with a homemade tool to short SL1. It's a 5/64" drill bit wraped with electrical tape to prevent shorting anything other than SL1.

I will post again once the items come in or new info is gathered.<br/>_________________<br/>hack it till you make it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I know of a good handfull of people here that will be getting one.
<br/>
<br/>
(not to mention me and seven friends)
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: That sounded rude. Good luck with the flashing. I'm also keeping a log of how things go for all of our lites.<br/>_________________<br/>It's 'CubeGuy.' One word. No space.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks, I'm glad someone is brave enough to do it. Hopefully these units won't be any different from the Lites that they're shipping out in Japan right now and all we have to do is have some electrical tape on our utensils.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll definitely be watching this thread before I try flashing mine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I see no harm in flashing a new ds lite. I wanted to get one even before I heard about flashing. The only reason I am flashing is so that I can run mp3s on my ds :). I see it as an investment into an mp3 player/gaming machine instead of an ipod. If my ds gets bricked I will just return it as defective. Yay for the 30 day return policy at most retailers.<br/>_________________<br/>hack it till you make it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry for no updates guys! I havn't even gotten my hands on a ds lite as of yet. I'm going to be flashing the Canadian version. It's probably the same version that is being shipped to america, I will post pics however for your viewing pleasure once June 11th rolls around :). I have no idea how you got a u.s ds before the 11th slinker :P<br/>_________________<br/>hack it till you make it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok so I got it and flashed it, everything is working perfectly. One thing to know is that you can still adjust the light levels NORMALLY AS IF YOU HAD AN UNFLASHED DS LITE!! So no worries guys. I tried out that drill bit and it totally wasn't connecting the SL1, so I just used one of those flat screwdrivers that are used for glasses. You can buy one of these virtually anywhere. 
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly if you screw up flashing the DS Lite because you touched the screw on the right side of the SL1, you have to either 
<br/>
1) have really crappy hand eye coordination
<br/>
2) be blind
<br/>
3) totally be a noob and touch the screw instead of the SL1. 
<br/>
<br/>
It is extremely easy to flash the US ds lite and there are no problems whatsoever. If anyone has any questions and wants pics or a video that can be arranged, just post and I will reply. [/b]<br/>_________________<br/>hack it till you make it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just to remind you all that drill bit tool that I posted totally sucks, it did not make my ds lite go up in the flashing process by even 1%. Just use a flathead screwdriver that is used for tightening the screws on glasses, or get one of those mini PC flathead screwdrivers. ALSO KEEP IN MIND DO NOT BUY A SCREW DRIVER THAT HAS A MAGNETIC TIP THIS CAN DAMAGE ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS. The flashing process took less than a minute, it was surprisingly fast.<br/>_________________<br/>hack it till you make it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just remembered something, to flash the ds lite with a passme2 you need to drag and drop the flashme installer and the SRAM file from the game that you will be putting in your passme2. SRAM files can be found on this website 
<br/>
<a href="http://darkfader.net/ds/games/" target="_blank">http://darkfader.net/ds/games/</a>
<br/>
They are on the right hand side in the colum that says SRAM. Just download whichever sram for the game you have programed your passme2 device for, and you should be fine.<br/>_________________<br/>hack it till you make it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
