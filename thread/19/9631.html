    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been reading all night on DS flash stuff, tons of reviews and forum threads. But I am still not sure what is the best combo to get.
<br/>
<br/>
For the passkey the best options seem to be:
<br/>
- Datel MAX Media Launcher
<br/>
- PassCard2
<br/>
<br/>
for the SD reader:
<br/>
- SuperCard Mini-SD
<br/>
- M3 Perfect Mini-SD
<br/>
<br/>
I would be buying a 2GB SD card.
<br/>
<br/>
But say I want to go the FlashMe route, I don't need to buy a passkey correct? Or would only need one to do the initial flashing. So what is the cheapest way to get the DS flashed with FlashMe? I will be buying a DS Lite, so I tihnk the wifi method is out the door</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I myself am going for a media launcher and supercard sd combo, mainly because I use sd cards daily on my pc and digital camera, plus the media launcher seems to be one of the best for value right now.
<br/>
<br/>
Im sure you need a passme or nopass to do a flash, after that you don't need one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds like the Max Media Launcher is a really good PassMe option. Install FlashMe asap and resell it on ebay! ;)
<br/>
As for the M3 or SC decision... It seems to depend on whether you play a lot of GBA games or not. From what I read the M3 still has better GBA compatibility but since the new SC mini SD has a battery for saving, that difference has gotten much smaller.
<br/>
You said you are going to buy an SD card: Carefull! Mini SD is another, smaller format than the standard SD card!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dont know how much $$$ you have to spend on it, but I was at Fry's yesterday and I think the Datel MML and 4GB HDD unit is not much more than the flash stuff. Here's the breakdown that I paid:
<br/>
<br/>
M3 Mini SD: $90 shipped to my door
<br/>
PassCard2: $50 shipped to my door (had to pay 34 euros since no reseller stocked it that accepted USD)
<br/>
2GB MiniSD card: $78 shipped to my door
<br/>
<br/>
Total: $218
<br/>
<br/>
Price for Datel unit in fry's: $229. Add tax and it would be: $248. So for $30 more, I could have gotten it locally and been playing by now, doubled the space and got a cool HDD unit. Obviously you can save $30 from the 218 if you get the Datel MML for $20 bringing it down to 188. Had I known about the MML, i would have just picked up the Datel device from Frys.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I will not really be playing GBA games, thats not a concern.
<br/>
I still don't know if I will flash the firmware or not.
<br/>
<br/>
Is a harddrive device a lot faster than the SD readers? I am looking at simular prices, and there is a Canadian retailer that seems to have the passCard2 in stock.

How much did you pay for a PassMe2 compatible game (<span style="font-style: italic">Meteos</span> is not compatible) or the CF writer?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.

Yeah, that's good. I went with the minisd and the Passcard2 because i didn't want a passkey2 sticking out of my ds lite. I already have to have the M3 sticking out because of the DS lite's design, so I wanted it to be as small as possible. imagine a M3 CF adapter sticking out below a ds lite! :wow:[/code]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
