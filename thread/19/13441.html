If you want the source, can make a DLDI file, or don't want to see any more topics pertaining to the fact, send an e-mail to a Datel employee now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Locked to delete incivility.
<br/>
Deleted incivility.
<br/>
Unlocked because with the incivility deleted, the topic still has merit.
<br/>
Moved to DS Flash Equipment.
<br/>
Relocked because the topic is redundant to <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=12570" target="_blank">this other topic</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
People buy this because it is sold in major brick-and-mortar chain stores across the United States of America, unlike any non-Datel flash equipment.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
