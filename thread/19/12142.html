    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys, I got your forum from the Joystiq article on turning the DSL into an iPod..very cool if I may add. I have a few questions not only on how to get the iDS [:)], but other things as well.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. What equipment do I need to get the iDS?
<br/>
<br/>
2. Is there anyway to make games/download games for the DS
<br/>
 (homebrew I think it's called?)
<br/>
<br/>
3. Is there a tutorial on how to use the equipment in #1 to set up the iDS?
<br/>
<br/>
4. What can I do with the iDS? (pics/vids/music)
<br/>
<br/>
5. Will this be a simple or a tough process?
<br/>
<br/>
6. Will the cost for everything (assuming equipment only) be cheap?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you! I'm trying to avoid buying an iPod as i'm trying to get a phone with an MP3 player built in but have to wait till May to get a new phone.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

MoonShell software allows you to view pictures, watch videos, and listen to music. DSOrganize software allows you to view pictures, draw simple pictures, listen to music, view and edit text files, keep a day planner, contact list, and to-do list, and go on IRC.
<br/>
<br/>
Some online music stores, such as (CENSORED) and (CENSORED), sell DS-compatible music from smaller labels. Other stores sell DRM'd music from major labels that does not work on the DS.

Copy the files onto the SD card, insert it in the SuperCard, insert the SuperCard into DS SLOT-2, insert the NoPass card into DS SLOT-1, and turn it on.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just so you know, the iDS that you are referring to, which is now known as Lick's Media Player, is severely limited.  It has the whole iPod navigation and all, but only music works, and only in a couple of formats with audible errors.  The last version was the first one to add support for actually playing audio files in the first place.  In addition, Lick has discontinued the project anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Moonshell and DSOrganize are much better media players and give you more refined control over your media.  
<br/>
<br/>
Like DSO, Moonshell can also view text files, evidenced by the new Moonbooks project that aims to reformat public domain books optimized for reading in Moonshell.  
<br/>
<br/>
Note that while tepples suggested getting a slot-2 media device and a slot-1 passthrough device, there are new devices out there that are only slot-1 and have built-in NoPass functionality.  However, they are very new and pretty much unsupported by most homebrew (although the recent overhaul of the file access system is improving the situation).  These slot-1 devices cater mostly to pirates, with homebrew playing second fiddle.  Therefore, tepples's suggestions are highly recommended over a slot-1 card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks man, i've been hearing a lot about Moonshell. I'll probably get that instead :).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: To first reply, i've been doing research and found a MAX Media Launcher and a SuperCard Lite. For # 3 + 4, what should I get for those two items? I might be able to do this within the week :-D.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered a MAX Media Launcher and a SuperCard Mini SD over the weekend (did my research, it's a legit one). I'll probably go to my local office store some time when I get my items to get the last 2 items.

Can somebody tell me what to do next ahead of time? I'm not too great with mods..if you consider this modding so it'd be cool to know ahead of time.

We do not talk about roms here.

<br/>
You copy homebrew into the MiniSD, put it in the SC, then insert the SC into the DS. Insert the MML into the DS.

Looked more like a DipStar reference, or is <a class="postlink" href="http://niggastolemybike.ytmnsfw.com/" target="_blank">NSMB</a> one of the blacklisted games?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

EDIT: Trying to avoid double post...but
<br/>
<br/>
I believe my items (Supercard and MAX Media Launcher) will be arriving tomorrow, Saturday, or Monday. Is there any way to move up a notch on the processing before I receive them? Thanks ;).

<br/>
<br/>
EDIT EDIT: Received MAX Media Luancher today, but according to directions I need the Supercard....which should be arriving before Saturday.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
