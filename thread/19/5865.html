After I have installed the device Ralink RT 2560 in the PC, it shows an error, that I copy here, on the properties of the device. Anybody knows what is wrong? After, when I try to execute the file wmb.exe, the Device find is failed. I think the booth problems are connected. Can somebody help me? And sorry if I write something wrong, because I`m brazilian and I dont know english very well. Thanks...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
