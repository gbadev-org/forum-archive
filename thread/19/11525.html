    <h4>#106892 - reaction105 - Tue Oct 24, 2006 3:07 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a DSLite, which id like to mod. After reading through many websites and reviews, ive decided on:
<br/>
<br/>
- Passcard 3 or Superkey
<br/>
<br/>
- Supercard Lite
<br/>
<br/>
Because this combination requires no altering/flashing of the DS itself. Right?
<br/>
<br/>
I want to use the DS to watch videos, play music, look at pics, and run various homebew apps, including some emulators. I am not interested in running backup NDS games. 
<br/>
<br/>
Im a little unclear on the connection between the hardware and the homebrew software loaded on it - its my understanding that most media formats (ie .mpeg, .mp3, .mov etc) need to be converted to a different format before they will play on the DS; whilst id prefer not to if possible, i really dont mind. 
<br/>
<br/>
Which of the Superkey or Passcard 3 do you recommend? What about the Supercard Lite? Im going to pick up an SD card as well, is it suited to what i want to use it for? Or is CF more applicable?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks alot!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

SOME homebrew will have not be able to run on the supercard lite due to fat driver incompatibilities</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SuperKey, PassCard 3 - doesn't really matter, since they're essentially the same. Though there are some PassCards, that are incompatible with everything but M3 &amp; G6. So, just to make sure, I'd go for SuperKey ...
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: Only video needs to be converted. Most of the other stuff will work just by drag'n'drop.
<br/>
Devil_Spawn: I'm not sure that's entirely true. Most (important) stuff runs fine. The homebrew which doesn't is probably:
<br/>
<br/>
a) Obsolete (and doesn't support most of the newer hardware)
<br/>
b) Easily patchable to run
<br/>
<br/>
No need to worry yourself. :)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What are the tips for making homebrew not "obsolete" without 1. having to wait for devkitARM R20 or 2. losing findfirst()/opendir()?

But does the patcher work on a DS? If not, it must be run on a PC, right? In that case, which operating systems does it work on?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Supercard Lite is fine but don't get the Rumble version since it doesn't have 32MB of RAM (RAM is used by dslinux, moonshell and for running large GBA homebrew).  If you get a Supercard Lite, you need microSD and not just SD or miniSD.
<br/>
<br/>
CF adapters are better supported but they stick out too much and most homebrew has been updated to be compatible with SD adapters or will be updated.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
