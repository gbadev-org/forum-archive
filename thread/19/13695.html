    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone had their R4DS/M3 Simply destroy an SD card?  The reason I am asking, is I recently had this happen.  And it wasn't till I put a few threads on ndshb.com together that I realized the same thing may have happened to them.  Of course, a cheapo SD card can always be a reason, but I was using a SanDisk.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is what happened.  I had just copied a .nds file onto the MicroSD card, pulled it out of my card reader, popped it into the R4, and insert the R4 into the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
It started as normaly, but then hung on the "Loading" screen.  This has happened in the past without a problem, I would just pop it out, reinsert it, and restart the DS.  But, this time it acted as if the SD card wasn't inserted.  I pulled it out and insert it into my computer and it didn't even recognize that it was inserted.
<br/>
<br/>
So,the SD card is totally dead.  Disk Mananger won't even start if it's in the SD reader.  The computer won't even recognize the SD reader if the bad MicroSD card is in when plugging it in..  Not good.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else hear about something like this?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not my Games n' Music or MicroSD, but the fact that an SD card can be destroyed by a device is true.  I had a regular SD card (not micro) in my mp3 player, and it ruined 2 of them...a SanDisk 128MB and a Lexar 256MB, I got a replacement for the SanDisk though.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Havn't had any of my micro-sd die like that yet though.

Havn't tried cleaning contacts, didn't look dirty though...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
