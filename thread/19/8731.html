    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I have a Passme and it works great. The DS is used by my son who is nine so I don't want to make it to complicated for him. But I am concerned about losing or breaking the passme.  My question is after you flash you DS with Flashme is there any thing special that you have to do to play normal DS games.  I thought I read something about some button combination that has to be done? If so do you think it would be to difficult for a nine year old.

Thank you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you leave a GBA cart with DS homebrew program in SLOT-2, then you have to hold Select+Start to boot the DS card. Otherwise, just yank the GBA cart and turn the power on.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The button code to skip the flashme check is just select; select+start goes into the system menu if you have automatic boot mode on.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Lately I bought NDS with flashme v6 installed without passme. Do I need a passme for future flashme upgrades? Or Can I install them without it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you can upgrade with out...
<br/>
all you need is to open the battery cover stick a screw driver in the SL1 hole 
<br/>
and run the flashme update :)
<br/>
<br/>
(a matter of fact, unless the new flashme changes the firmware code that is protected... you don't even need to open the battery case :P)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

Unless your DS is completely bricker proof.  There are a number of DS systems out there produced that way.

A good example is flashing another DS that needs to be flashed for whatever reason.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
