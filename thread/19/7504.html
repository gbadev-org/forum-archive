    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey again, all. My DS is showing fun problems like not wanting to realize a DS cart is in the slot until I take it out and put it back in seven times.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was hoping to send it to Nintendo before it's warrenty is up (probably by an authorized local repair, I kinda know where it is but I want to call first.)
<br/>
<br/>
I've already FlashMe'd my firmware, and I wanted to make sure that:
<br/>
<br/>
a. noFlashMe-ing works / is safe / Nintendo will take it
<br/>
b. A new (if it's not physically repaired, or however they do it) US silver DS will work with FlashMe / WiFiMe. Looking at the compatibility list I don't see any silver US units that don't take either.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a little behind on everything, just having found out that new units only work with PassMe2 or something, and I know that Mario Kart requires the newest firmware version (which I'll upgrade to after I get it sent back.)
<br/>
<br/>
So, I just wanted to know if anyone can answer my above questions, and especially if I need to make sure the sticker is on straight in the battery compartment...
<br/>
Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  I just got off the phone from Nintendo DS and learned about cross-shipping with a refurbished DS. Anyone have any experience with that? I'd like to, but I'm not sure if cross-shipping with a month left on my warrenty (other problems with the new DS) is a good idea.<br/>_________________<br/>AndrewNeo - <span style="font-style: italic">Username disallowed.</span>

So it's got Blinking Toaster Syndrome. Are you old enough to remember that from the NES, with the repeated reseating before games would get a good connection? Have you tried 1. cleaning the DS Game Card's contacts with rubbing alcohol?

Even silver units sold in October or later are likely to come with <span style="color: red">new</span> firmware.

It's not like the PSP. Mario Kart works with old official firmware, <span style="color: red">new</span> official firmware, and FlashMe &gt;= v5. It just doesn't work with FlashMe &lt;= v4.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, a family member had an NES, so I experienced it anyway. That was a pain.

<br/>
Hm. I guess I will have to try cleaning it off.. it seemed to me like it was doing it with all my games but I tried it with each and it appears to be doing it with a few of the games I put in the most (Metroid Hunters, Meteos, Kirby Canvas Curse)
<br/>
<br/>
And sorry, I meant the FlashMe version with Mario Kart, not DS firmware. (which is what I meant by upgrading.)
<br/>
<br/>
I'll try cleaning it, though I was hoping for another reason to return it (though if the contacts just need to be cleaned, I won't) because when the volume's low, the speakers' sound is kind of bad. Oh well, saves me the trouble. I bet something else will go wrong right after my warrenty is up!<br/>_________________<br/>AndrewNeo - <span style="font-style: italic">Username disallowed.</span>
