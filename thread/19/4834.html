That aside, I too would like to know how easy they are to open.  I tried gently prying one open to no avail, but only 'cause I was too chicken to really put ANY force into it.  Hey, I'm not going to break that awesome (cough cough) Metroid demo just to satisfy my curiosity.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

More like calling your CD-Rom a CD-Burner... :D

As already noted, there is no easy way to open DS cards. The plastic will be damaged if you open them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So does that mean that they are still using the expensive type ROM that cost so much on the GBA as oppose to the new media that is supposed to reduce those costs by 70%?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So if this new type of memory is more like a CDR (I assume the analogy means that the chip can be written on, but only once), does this mean that it may, once someone gets their hands on it, be possible to create a card writer and 1x write cards?  Then possibly re-writeable cards?

Given that the general public can't even get datasheets for the part, you're probably right.
<br/>
<br/>
RIGHT NOW: Nintendo uses Macronix mask ROMs.

Remember that for a new chip design that has had several man-years of research and development, the first chip that rolls off the line costs several million dollars. Only economies of scale make inventions affordable to replicate, and it takes a while for economies of scale to kick in. For example, I've been told that the GBA was close to ready not very long after the GBC came out in 1997; Nintendo just sat on the technology waiting for the price of production to fall. Nintendo will switch precisely when it can get OTP cheaper than mask ROM, which may be sooner for niche titles, where the cost of making a mask is a large factor in the cost of replication, and later for titles expected to go platinum quickly, such as any 1st-party title with Mario or Pikachu on the cover.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
