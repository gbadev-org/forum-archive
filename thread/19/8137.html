    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know there are already threads for flashme but I'm not sure if I have a common problem or not...
<br/>
<br/>
I bought a passme 1.4 and used a program for getting my ID getID.ds, then I used the correct program for my ID to flash the memory and everything worked fine.
<br/>
<br/>
I later played download Mario Cart - not knowing it would mess things up.
<br/>
<br/>
So I tried to reflash the memory using the program I had used before but it does not work. I can test my homebrew with my passme but I need to know which version of flahme is suitable... I tried the versions currently downloadable but they would not boot even with passme... where am I going wrong? Please help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

getID.ds.gba?  Isn't that what was used way back for the first version of FlashMe when it was in beta?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, go to here:  <a href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/" target="_blank">http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/</a>

Get the most current version, get it onto your GBA cart and hold A+B+Start+Select...it should get FlashMe to then boot (providing you got it properly flashed in the first place and it sounds like you must have if you played MK afterwards) and you can flash using this much newer version.  It doesn't have the problem of Mario Kart breaking it by saving it's WiFi connection settings over parts of it.  :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hm, did you hold AB Select and Start when you turned on the system?  Also, I don't know what flash cart you are using...try prepending the ndsloader to the FlashMe NDS file.  I believe they have a link to it on the FlashMe page.
<br/>
<br/>
copy /b ndsloader.bin + /b Flashme.nds Flashme.ds.gba
<br/>
<br/>
on Windows XP at least that is how you'd use it.  98 should be something similar.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do'h, I didn't even notice that he said that...I wonder if that is interfering with FlashMe's 'bootstrap' booting process.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
