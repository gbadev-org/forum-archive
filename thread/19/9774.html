When I sent the .nds over wmb it appears to do exactly what wifime does for version 1-3 ds's. Can anyone with a new firmware try to use it to flash their DS? If it works, it would eliminate the need for passme2's!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Would it work with an old style DS with firmware 4? What firmware is you Lite?

I tried ages ago, and WMB works with version 4 ds's; WifiMe just gives you the SM64DS loading screen though.

This is the nds info that I got with ndstool. Does it tell you whether it is signed or not?

If it isn't then never mind. It would be cool if datel released a signed version though.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They always required signing, but V1-3 don't do any boundary checks on the start address which is stored outside of the signed area and can thus be modified as desired; you can just point it to GBA ROM space in a signed binary and away you go. V4+ does boundary checking to ensure it's within RAM, but many game binaries contain some piece of data that you can point it to, that will be interpreted as an invalid SWI call which jumps to GBA SRAM space. Unfortunately with WMB, V4+ uses an alternate header which is inside the signed area, so it can't be modified, but I think this header isn't present on DS cards, so PassMe2 is still possible.

<br/>
<br/>
I just got a new Nintendo DS Lite and I have managed to download the official E3  demos using the linux version of WMB (windows version doesnt work).
<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded the file from <a href="http://us.codejunkies.com/mpds/binaries/MMPDS_101.zip" target="_blank">http://us.codejunkies.com/mpds/binaries/MMPDS_101.zip</a>
<br/>
which seems like a Mediaplayer, however when I tried downloading it to my DS Lite the linux WMB crashed.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason turns out to be that the file is smaller than what is indicated in the NDS header. I poked around with a hex editor and found that part of the file
<br/>
was truncated (including the RSA signature).
<br/>
<br/>
So... sorry. If you have a proper file, let me know. I will surely try again.
