Just shop around a bit. 1GB is a fair bit of space, and the 2GB cards are slower (causes some problems) and much more expensive right now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DS Lite or original DS? The size of SLOT-2 differs between the two models. If you have a DS Lite, you can get one of the microSD adapters and share cards between the two; otherwise, you'll need an SD adapter, miniSD adapter, or self-contained flash card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
