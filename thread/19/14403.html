I followed the instructions for "GBA MP Firmware updater by Chishm" and now my GBA MP isn't recognized. I downloaded update.e19 and put it along with ndsmp.gba on the cf card and powered it up. The DS saw the GBA MP which I selected and then it asked if I wanted to update. I pressed start, it told me that it had updated (press 'A' to continue) I pressed 'A' and one of the screens had the most garbled looking displays I've ever seen. Now the DS can't see the GBA MP. Anyone have any suggestions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
