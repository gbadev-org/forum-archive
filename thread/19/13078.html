    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SLOT-1 cards such as R4 (the same thing as M3 DS Simply) have zero GBA support.
<br/>
<br/>
Among SLOT-2 SD adapters, M3 Perfect has the best GBA compatibility. To use M3 Perfect in DS mode, you'll need a PassCard 3, Action Replay DS, or other NoPass card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

CF can safely be used in larger capacities, as SD cards larger than 2 GB may or may not work in homebrew equipment, but it sticks out considerably.  SD (called "M3 Slim SD") sticks out somewhat, while miniSD sits flush within a DS Phat, the M3 Lite sitting flush within a DS Lite.  Go with whichever one you wish to use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Get the M3 Perfect if you want the most compatibility, as some homebrew games and apps (especially those built around streaming media such as Gleam or Luminesweeper) are bigger than 4 MB.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I'm not entirely sure why you believe this.
<br/>
<br/>
While the R4 and the M3 DS Simply are basically the same hardware they are not identical. Luckily the R4 is cheaper and anecdotal evidence suggests that it also has better homebrew compatibility.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

True, they're not identical, but they are indeed very similar.  For instance, with the first batches, you could convert your device from R4 to M3 Simply and back by soldering or desoldering four pads on the PCB.  While this was fixed later on, it showed that the basic hardware underneath is nearly identical.  The R4 appears to be the original product, which the M3 Team buys and rebrands as the M3 Simply, so getting an R4 is probably cheaper as a result like you said.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
