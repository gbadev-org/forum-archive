    <h4>#47325 - TheMikaus - Thu Jul 07, 2005 2:47 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering three things.
<br/>
<br/>
How do you get the DS to send signals to a particular pin of the gba cart?
<br/>
<br/>
since the gba port is usually taken up by a flash card, is it possible to use the ds slot for the expansion instead?  
<br/>
<br/>
if that's possible how do you send signals to a particular pin of the ds slot?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Probably it would be possible to send a signal over a particular address or data line. You could send 00100 as address, so the 3th pin would get activated, same for data..

Oh really? Can you load everything from the file system before you ask the user to pak-swap? If not, then include your file system into the ARM9 binary other than through appending. For example, GBFS includes a tool called 'bin2s' that converts a binary file into assembly language that can be compiled to an object file that contains the data, properly aligned in memory[1]. Here's a quick example of its use:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">bin2s data.gbfs &gt; data.s
<br/>
gcc -mthumb-interwork -c data.s -o data.o</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Then link data.o in with your ARM9 binary.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[1] The GBA and Nintendo DS examples from the devkitarm site contain a bin2o macro that wraps objcopy, but I could never get it to set an object's alignment to a multiple larger than 1 byte because the last version of objcopy that I tried did not expose an interface for doing that. In fact the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/manual/html_chapter/binutils_3.html" target="_blank">objcopy manual</a> doesn't even contain the word "align".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What if the binary was already 3 megs or so with out the extra gbfs stuff?
<br/>
<br/>
No this isn't the case here.  I'm just saying in theory.  And wouldn't using bin2s defeat the purpose of using gbfs?
<br/>
<br/>
Either way.  I appreciate the suggestions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If the binary is already approaching the size of Nintendo DS EWRAM, then you probably can't use Xport either, as the Xport flash memory is no bigger than EWRAM.
<br/>
<br/>
Another suggestion: Connect two devices to the Xport: one cable to a PC (for loading the rest of the flash) and one of whatever Option Pak you want to use.
<br/>
<br/>
Another suggestion: Disassemble the Super Mario 64 DS WMB stub and figure out how to use Nintendo DS Wi-Fi, then implement IP, TCP, DHCP, and HTTP on top of that and have the program load assets from a computer running Apache HTTP Server in the same room.
<br/>
<br/>
Another suggestion: Disassemble the Super Mario 64 DS WMB stub and figure out how to use Nintendo DS Wi-Fi, then implement IP, TCP, and DHCP on the DS and some sort of server on the PC, and use an Option Pak attached to a USB port of the PC.
<br/>
<br/>
And no, bin2s does not defeat the purpose of GBFS. I include bin2s with the GBFS distribution because at least on the GBA, it's a lot easier to use ELF debugging with bin2s than with appended data. That way, the programming department can use the bin2s version while the asset department uses an appended data version.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">but I thought one of the advantages of using gbfs w/ the ds was to be able to store on the cart than what could be held in memory for later access.
<br/>
<br/>
Why would I have to have to do that stub thing if I could just use the ds card slot as the expansion slot instead?  Which was part of my initial and unanswered question.  Can the ds slot be accessed as an expansion slot and if so how to send to the pins in code?
<br/>

If your posts are to imply that it's not possible then. ok. :)

You are right, there is a direct mapping since EEPROM uses SPI:

Don't know about GC, but MMC do use SPI. (SD cards are backwards compatible with MMC.)

Anyway, firmware could be modified to load from SD/MMC connected to DS slot. GBA slot would remain unoccupied for extension cards, etc.

I think the GC does.  or at least there's the right pins for it.  Because of the SD adapter that's out (Which is where I got the pin layout for the SD card), one of the better people to ask is anyone of the people who worked on the libogc or gclib since they would have had to implement memory card routines (I think, maybe it's built into the hardware)
