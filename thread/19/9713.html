    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can someone show me a picture of what part EXACTLY i need to short on a DS Lite?
<br/>
<br/>
I know there is a screw above the metal part of SL1. Is that what I need to short? Do i put a flat-head screwdriver into the middle of that screw? 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance

There are pictures here also if you can point it out to me:

See the split contact? That's what you need to bridge while flashing. You also need to make sure you don't accidentally touch the contacts next to it, or the DSLite may turn itself off. If this happens too soon into flashing, the DSL is bricked.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In that picture it looks like it's raised. But I've seen other pics where it's actulaly flat.. could it be a screw that's covering it in that picture you point out?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Note, I don't have a DSL, but I've seen a lot of pictures.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
