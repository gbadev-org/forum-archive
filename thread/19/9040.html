    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Anyone out there try building stuff with Nintendo's official dev kit and then flash it to the system?  I can't get it to work - system stays at a white screen (but works fine for homebrew stuff).  I think the problem is it needs to be altered ala commercial roms, however not completely, because it hasn't been signed to a card or anything.
<br/>
<br/>
Any idea?  Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Why not use LibNDS or PALib?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

"Why not use libnds?" Because the final binary will not use libnds, and developing for libnds and porting to Nintendo's libraries for the retail version might not be cost efficient.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Maybe they only have a few and he wants more people than that to be able to do beta testing (without paying a no doubt hefty premium to Nintendo)?<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can you give us a little bit more information:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Is this going to be a DS Download Play or DS Card ROM? (I'm guessing DS Card, but it's best to be sure)
<br/>
<br/>
2) What flash equipment are you using? Brand and model?
<br/>
<br/>
3) How old is the SDK you are using? Code built with the newer SDK has slightly different iCard routines, that the patchers have trouble patching.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry, been a while.  Anyways, yeah, these are legally acquired dev kits :)  The thing about official flash carts, they take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to burn.  GBA dev carts, for example, take 15-20 minutes for 8 MB carts.
<br/>
<br/>
What I'm trying to use is an EZF-Advanced GBA flash cart (which works fine for homebrew demos, like Dragon's Lair) with SuperPass DS (I have a launch DS).  I tried running a ROM through NDSPatcher, but it errors out, while it says something about removing card signing or something.  As for SDK, not sure, it's probably the newest that Nintendo has put out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If Nintendo allowed him to post a prototype of his game, signed and all, it'd be pretty simple for him to "accidentally" forget to check a buffer length in some wifi code since he hadn't got around to bug testing yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you're not using an nds filesystem then theroetically prepending a loader will work for you. Use dsbuild from devkitARM - you'll probably need to rename your .SRL to .nds first. Homebrew nds files have an embedded loader.
<br/>
<br/>
You could probably also use ndstool on your arm7 and arm9 binaries to produce an nds file with an embedded loader ( you'll need to specify the load and start addresses manually in this case).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
