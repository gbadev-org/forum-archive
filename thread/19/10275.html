    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone know if it's a good idea to replace my GBAMP and get a Max Media Dock? It seems like it's a bit more capable. But does it have at least the same compatibility with homebrew as GBAMP? Does it match up to Supercard's compatibility?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know if MMD has SRAM?
<br/>
<br/>
It might be a good idea for people who are just starting out with homebrew to get the max media dock. It comes with a NoPass for free, which is $20, so it's like the Dock itself is $20.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">MAX Media Dock/Player is nowhere near the level of SuperCard, and it even has disadvantages vs. GBA Movie Player v2 CF: <ol type="1"><li>Not yet as compatible with DS homebrew (no support for .nds files over 1000 KB or for Chishm's FAT access) </li><li>Does not appear to work with GBA multiboot programs or NES or GBC emulators </li></ol>
<br/>
SRAM has two uses: booting PassMe2 and saving. MAX Media Launcher and other NoPass cards don't need SRAM to boot, and the software on the MAX Media Dock/Player has the CF card for saving.
<br/>
<br/>
And in some countries (such as the United States), you can find a GBAMP for $25 including shipping if you put your mind to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.whatis-it.com/" target="_blank">it</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heck, my local mall "gaming accessories" (AKA, ooh look at the mod I just did on my ds.. yeah.. it's just stickers, but isn't it sweet?) shop sells GBA MPs for $25 + tax..  I'd guess you could get them even cheaper offa ebay.. but again, you have to be careful of shipping fees.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What I did when getting my cousin's GBAMP on eBay is take $25.09, subtract the listed shipping fee, and then set that as my max bid. (The .09 is to outbid people who bid $25.00 minus shipping.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I already got myself a GBAMP, so i don't need to worry about gbamp costs or anything like that (which is why I said "replace").
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if the Max Media Dock will EVER match up to gbamp and supercard?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Much of it depends on whether someone can crack and overwrite the firmware with something dual-capable for GBA and Nintendo DS modes, just like a GBAMP with the NDSMP hack. If the MAX Media Dock firmware is a mask ROM instead of flash, then it won't happen.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
