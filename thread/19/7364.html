After looking at natrium42's excellent guide <a class="postlink" href="http://natrium42.com/projects/jtag.html" target="_blank">http://natrium42.com/projects/jtag.html</a>,
<br/>
i noticed that the JTAG connections for the superpass are layed out differently to the original passme's.
<br/>
<br/>
After a bit of hunting on the net and testing i worked the order of the superpass's:-
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">VCC, TDO, TCK, TMS, TDI &amp; GRD</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.wendylady.eclipse.co.uk/SUPERPASS.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I managed to reprogram it using the 'SuperMario64DS-EUR-PassMe.jed'
<br/>
initially i had a error saying it is 'write protected' it turned out there wasn't enough power in my batteries on the JTAG cable, so i wired up a 3v psu &amp; the problem was solved.
<br/>
<br/>
Tried the reprogrammed superpass &amp; a European Mario DS on a friends European pink nintendogs pack DS today, 
<br/>
&amp; was able to update the firmware with v4 of flashme, so everything seems to have gone ok. which i was happy about. a thanks goes out to natrium42.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
