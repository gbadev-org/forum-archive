    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, so today I FlashME'd my DS, and when I went to test it with my SC, it booted into GBA (single-screen) mode.  I tried again, this time with my GBA MP, and it booted into NDS (dual-screen) mode.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if I need a boot file for the SC at all (since I know you need one for the GBA MP), or if I did something wrong?  Oh, and another thing, I used a PassME with the SC, and it still boots into NDS mode, so I'm truly stumped.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have you got <a class="postlink" href="http://eng.supercard.cn/download.htm" target="_blank">the most up to date kernel</a> for your SC, and has it been installed?
<br/>
<br/>
It's possible that the latest kernel for SC causes it to pretend to be a GBA cart with the DSBooter game-name header, and your current kernel doesn't do this. If this isn't present, you can force a FlashMe'd DS to use NDS code from the GBA slot, try holding A+B+X+Y on bootup.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum.
