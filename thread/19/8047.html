I'm looking to order an M3 CF, and I'm just wondering if there are any places that have it in stock (for reasonable shipping)? This seemed like a good place to ask, but I apologize if it's not appropriate. KickTrading has it on back-order, but they don't seem to know how long the delay will be...

<br/>
Thanks again!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Any reason to use .CN when .COM ships from North America? (other than how many they have in stock; I don't mind waiting a few extra days for the cheaper shipping costs ;P)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">$17?  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.divineo.cn/php/affstart.php?affcode=tetrinet&amp;prod=ds-m3cf" target="_blank">www.divineo.cn</a> only charges $5 for airmail.  The china site has a better rating than the US site, they get stock first and they are often cheaper.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
