    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i bought a hawking hwc54g and that did not work :( i guess this rev uses texas instraments chips set....
<br/>
<br/>
too bad it was cheap and on the list....
<br/>
<br/>
i wanted to try to load software to my ds wirelessly badly.
<br/>
so i was trying everything with a desprate hope... my netgear wg511t,orinoco silver, and smc failed they will not let me install the drivers.
<br/>
i fig that would be the case but i had my fingers crossed...
<br/>
<br/>
i ended up ripping apart my netgear mr814 wireless router.
<br/>
in side it is a ma401 pcmcia card.
<br/>
i got it into my laptop and it let me install the drivers!
<br/>
now it gives me an error and will not start because of the error.
<br/>
pci tree will not show anything since the card will not start.
<br/>
i tried to change the irq and memory range. not luck.
<br/>
the card will try to start for a few sec the led on it will flash then i get the same error again.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so after that i did a search to see what the chip set was for sure in this card.
<br/>
it is listed to have prism chipset.
<br/>
<br/>
is the prism chip set close to the Ralink chipset?
<br/>
<br/>
i just dont under stand why it even loaded the driver if not?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
