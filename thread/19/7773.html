    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does any one know if you can send supercard back to have it repaired? I have been able to test its sram with flash2advance but can't use it to write the firmware back on or even know if the SD adapter burned the card. I would like to see if this is possible before I replace the card with another. I have used the e-mail address on the website but have had a reply yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You know... one of mine had some issues, and after opening it up, it had a trace that was not fully closed where the SD connector connects with the circuit board.  I resoldered it, and it worked fine after that.

I've heard that the Supercard has had issues with poor solder jobs....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
