    <h4>#42051 - hoagie - Thu May 05, 2005 3:27 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought a wireless adapter from the wifi list but when I try to install the DS drivers, it says "The Specified location does not contain information about your hardware", which usually means that i have the wrong chipset.  However, its the Zonet ZEW2500P <b style="color:#FFA34F">USB</b> wireless adapter, which is on teh working list.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on how to get the <b style="color:#FFA34F">driver</b> to install?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What part of "PCI or PCMCIA" don't you understand ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">cocole's right. It's pretty clear that only PCI and PCMCIA cards work.

You're probably also wrong that your adapter is strictly 2500. 2500 is a generic chipset with differing implementations, and if you read further on the compatibility page:

<br/>
<br/>
...it seems that non-<b style="color:#FFA34F">USB</b> (PCI or PCMCIA) adapters use the RT2560 Mac/BBP IC interface, while the RT2500USB adapters use the RT2571 Mac/BBP IC interface. I suspect this is what makes the <b style="color:#FFA34F">USB</b> adapters inherently incompatible, at least because their <b style="color:#FFA34F">driver</b> should differ.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Cocole:  you dont have to get your panties in a bunch over it.  Its not like you were the one who just wasted $20 or anything.

It would help if this was more clearly stated for those of us who are a little less developmentally savvy</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's been said a number of times in the forums that <b style="color:#FFA34F">USB</b> will not work and probably never will due to timing issues with the <b style="color:#FFA34F">USB</b> bus. The "list of working adapters" was written by someone else who is not connected with DS development and is only as a list of RT2500 family cards, not just the compatable RT2560 cards. And besides, you should still be able to return the card, most stores are pretty good about hardware returns.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I'm not mad about it.  I'll prolly just keep teh <b style="color:#FFA34F">usb</b> card for something else.  My own fault for not reading all the threads.  I just figured I wouldnt have to read all teh threads if I just read the "how to" page.  And I'm saying that its a little ambiguous when it comes to the <b style="color:#FFA34F">USB</b> adapter.  It said dont use 2570 <b style="color:#FFA34F">usb</b>...so i checked and it said 2500, so I thought I was good.

Well, it's stated on the official help page that <b style="color:#FFA34F">USB</b> doesn't work. You ask and I answered and then you ask once more. Cant you imagine people answering twice are botherd about it ? Especially when for their 1st answer they clearly stated what was good or bad ? I even took the pain to copy / paste the statement and link to the page.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
