What is NinjaDS and what makes it different from all the other flash carts. Also, any word on price?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, the MK2/3 doesn't need a flashcard to work, no. The gba-flashcard is for playing gba games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You still need someway to install flashme on your DS in order to use a MK2/3 without a gba flashcart. 
<br/>
And I don't think there's any way to install flashme using ONLY a MK2/3. So you will always need an additional device along with the mk2/3 (even if it's just borrowed from someone else to install flashme)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
So flashme with mk2/3 works kindof like a slot 1 flashcard. But something else is needed to install flashme.
<br/>
<br/>
mk2/3 with mk4 also works somewhat like a slot-1 flashcard, and if used to load Flashme, the mk4 can be put aside, as it would not be needed each time?
<br/>
<br/>
If that is correct, and ninjads is like a combination mk2/3 and nopass (mk4) then it is quite likely a pirate's Dream, especially if it only emulates the EEPROM and saves the EEPROM data to a file on the SD card.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm betting piracy will be the main market for that device. 
<br/>
Now some of it's "specs" are confusing:
<br/>
"2MBYTES FLASHROM - 1Mbyte Available for HomeBrew Flashing"-
<br/>
is this part of the device? What is the need for that if it supports SD cards?
<br/>
<br/>
It claims it does not need any GA flashcards, yet claims:
<br/>
"COMPATIBLE WITH ANY GBAFLASHCART,NF,SCARD,M3,etc"
<br/>
<br/>
I assume that means it can load games from those, but again, what is the point if it can run games from the SD card?
<br/>
<br/>
"WIFI FILES TRANSFER UTIL"
<br/>
<br/>
What is that? Transfer files between two DS's with ninjads? send files between computer and DS? Using TCP/IP or requiring a wifime compatible wifi card? Very unclear.
<br/>
