<br/>
Around when did FlashMe fail?
<br/>
How did the attempt fail?
<br/>
What is your DS doing?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was shorting the SL1, and it had just started, and stopped at 1% and the % was blinking.  I thought i breached the SL1 short, so i turned it over to peer through the plastic hole. i figured that it was shorted again.  I turned over the ds to a black screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Then i turned it off (probably the worst mistake &gt;_&lt;)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now my ds's green led lights up, and i hear the sound initialize.  (not the ds's dinging, but as if you were turning on speakers.)  both screens stay black or off i cant tell.
<br/>
<br/>
And thanks for the help in advance; as well as that link picklesworth</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, first you can attampt the recovery, by leaving flashme.nds in the GBA port, "Hold A+B+select+start, THEN turn on your DS"
<br/>
<br/>
If not, the next option would be PPFlash..  This one can be ugly if you don't have soldering skills, but if your DS is dead, how much worse can you really make it?
<br/>
<br/>
Finally hope, is to e-bay it..  But, I wouldn't let it go for cheap, as it's not really broke (unless there were other issues with it prior to flashing) and anyone with soldering skills can fix it.
