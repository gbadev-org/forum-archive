    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've just order this card (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16833315041" target="_blank">EDIMAX EW-7128G</a>) from NewEgg and I'd just like to make sure it's compatible with WiFiMe.
<br/>
<br/>
I've done lots of searching on several forums and it seems like this card uses the 2561 (??) chipset but apparantly it still works (??).
<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me ASAP if this card isn't compatible so I can cancel my order :)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had a 2561 and it didn't work, but others have said their's did, but i'm guessing i probably got a different revision of that card, which changed to a 2561 with the revision change.

I'd say make sure that if you open it, you can return it. It it doesn't work, return it and order a passme from dspassme.com. The PassMe cost less than half of this wifi card, and you can be pretty sure that it's a lot easier to use. (dspassme.com is a great site, I got my passme really quick from them and it worked great)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Rest assured, it'll work. I bought that exact same model from Newegg last december and I actively use it for NDS development. Good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I ended up getting a little nervous so I canceled the EdiMax card and ordered a PassMe.  Hopefully it will today or tomorrow...
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the information though!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
