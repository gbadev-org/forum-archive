    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i dont have my supercard yet but i figured i might as well program the superpass 2 to work with my mario kart that i got with my mario kart bundle. So i installed the superpass2 software and connect the programmer that they send to the superpass 2 and connect the thing to a usb, not knowing about the parallel port stuff, and choose mario kart, it says waiting then playxsvf501b.eve has encountered a problem and needs to close screen comes up and i close it and then it says that it succeeded. This was the same way when i put the eeprom in the back into the parallel port. So , reinstalled the software and the installation goes off without a hitch. So i put the superpass in the eeprom, switch the switch on the side of the superpass down, connect the usb to the eeprom, connect the usb to a port that my ipod uses, put the eeprom in the parallel port, opened the software, selected mario kart, and it gives me the error:
<br/>
"Error!:
<br/>
1. Hardware not Connected to PC
<br/>
2. USB cable not connected
<br/>
3. SP2 Key switch not open"
<br/>
<br/>
