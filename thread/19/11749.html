Isn't the MAX Dock expensive? Also doesn't it have poor compatibility?

Which is almost the same thing as the MAX Media Dock.

You're probably thinking of recommending MAX Media Launcher + GBAMP + CF writer. You have to buy those online, which means you have to pay shipping and (if you're a minor) pay a relative for the use of his or her debit card. This can can cost up to $60 depending on shipping prices. MAX Media Dock costs $40, and it includes a NoPass and can act as a CF writer, and it is available at at least one brick-and-mortar store close to where I live, which takes cash.

That depends on the FAT library. Google tells me that MoonShell (music, video) supports it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">youtube also has videos showing max media dock with moonshell (mp3 and video) running
<br/>
<br/>
but my question is, what else do i need to get homebrew running? only max media dock? if so, how to upload them?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You will also require a CompactFlash card of any size over 8 MB (I recommend 512 MB or more). Then, you can just put the binaries, music, etc. on the card and boot them ... But keep in mind that Max Media Dock is the worst possible product you could buy. It look huge in DS Lite, the homebrew support is really bad, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
tepples: Max Media Dock isn't available in the stores outside of your country (with a possible exclusion of Canada and United Kingdom). The only Datel product I could find in my entire city is Action Replay.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As was mentioned earlier in this thread, the absolute cheapest way aside from the Max Media Dock would be to get a GBA Movie Player v2, Compact Flash edition (not SD) and a Compact Flash card.  Then you need some sort of passthrough device so that you can boot the the DS from the GBAMP in the GBA slot while still retaining the DS features.  Here's a list of them:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">    * EZPASS-3 from the EZ-Flash company.
<br/>
    * MAX Media Launcher from Datel, also sold as part of the MAX Media Player package, limited support for sleep mode.
<br/>
    * MK4-Key from the company behind NeoFlash, barebones NoPass.
<br/>
    * MK4-mini from the company behind NeoFlash, with some extra features.
<br/>
    * Ninjapass Media Launcher from the company behind Ninjapass DS Flash.
<br/>
    * PassCard 3 from the company behind M3 and G6.
<br/>
    * SuperKey from the creators of the SuperPass and SuperCard product lines. 
<br/>
<br/>
PassCard 3 and SuperKey are reportedly identical in all but the label on the card."</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Of these, the MML, the Superkey, or the PassCard 3 would probably be the cheapest.  Search various online shops to find the best prices and shipping charges.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, lets check:
<br/>
<br/>
NDS Backup - SuperCard LITE (Micro-SD Version) inkl SuperKey , 84?, free shipping
<br/>
<br/>
ii already own a micr-sd 512mb card, so thats the version which is the best for me
<br/>
<br/>
is this ok? able to run most homebrew applications?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The current generation homebrew "out there" won't support SCLite as it's still  new; actually, it's not, but the development packages haven't been updated to support it.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the cheapest hardware is: GBAMP CF + CF memory + CF reader (PC) + Superkey. That will run most homebrew.
<br/>
I would go for the Supercard devices though.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That would be perfect, assuming you have a DS-Lite...
<br/>
<br/>
The SuperCard Lite is too small to fit in a DS Phat...
