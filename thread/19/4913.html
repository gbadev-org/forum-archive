Needed skills:
<br/>
* Generic electronics.
<br/>
* Digital logic.
<br/>
* Computer architecture (computer memories, busses and processors in particular).
<br/>
* Basic PCB etching and soldering.
<br/>
* CAD (somewhat optional in this particular case).
<br/>
* VHDL/Verilog.
<br/>
* Machine level programming/hacking.
<br/>
* Know how to use equipment such as logic analysers and oscilloscopes.
<br/>
<br/>
That about sums it up.
<br/>
Some of these skills are "real world skills" that not all modern colleges teach. (PCB etching, soldering, equipment usage and machine level programming/hacking in particular).
<br/>
<br/>
I can't tell you the name of the college classes to take, since such names vary _alot_, and not all colleges teach all these skills.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, I assumed he meant what skills are required to come up with something like this from scratch rather than building a copy of someone else's work from step-by-step instructions.
<br/>
"digital signal processing" courses are not at all relevant for developing this kind of devices.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My apologies, I agree. I got confused a bit thinking about relevance to working with FPGAs. I did address the question of building one from "scratch" with experience in circuit design, but I wanted put forth the reassurance that it shouldn't require such skills to duplicate the effort in the meantime. [Edit: I wanted to emphasize the motivation of this as he doesn't say his goal is to duplicate the passthroughs, but following along with DS development breakthroughs seems to be a large interest in these communities. I spoke more in general than to him.]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The titles and subject splits vary *widely* between universities, but some keywords would be:
<br/>
<ul><li>Digital Logic (boolean algebra, k-maps, maybe getting into gate level stuff, depending on the level the course is taught at) </li><li>Computer Architecture/Organization </li><li>Whatever class teaches some assembly language (it may be lumped in with Digital Logic or Comp. Org, or it may be one or more seperate classes) </li><li>Discrete Math (boolean and set algebra, really a vital class to take if you're doing anything even remotely related to computers, even with zero hardware) </li><li>VLSI design (this is likely to be a high level course, and only in EE depeartments), getting down to transistor level and then back up to VHDL/verilog HDLs </li></ul>
<br/>
And of course, you should know how to program, data structures, algorithms, etc...
<br/>
<br/>
Granted, as others have said, you'll learn a lot more by doing rather than taking a course, but courses can help you get started, or help reinforce the knowledge and terminology.   By the time I took any of these courses, I'd already covered most of the material in my own projects on my own time, but now I know the terminology and can communicate in a common manner with others (and a huge collection of overpriced, sometimes useless text books, yay for un-needed revisions!).
<br/>
<br/>
My advice: Go to college no matter what, although this is a no brainer (and if you're already in college, stick with it)
<br/>
Order a LED kit (blinking sign or tree or heart or whatever) or something simple, to teach yourself how to solder, and try to understand how it works.  Build up from there.  Check out a book on computer arch. from your library or go to a local university library (if you're not in college yet).  You can almost always get in, you just won't be able to actually check the books out.
<br/>
<br/>
phantomdjp/tepples: In the short term, nintendo have announced that Euro DSes will also come with Metroid First Hunt, but the existing passthroughs can be reprogrammed to work with any given cart (you just need to dump the header and compute the checksum over it with our modified exec address).  With a little additional effort (and ~19 macrocells more in e.g. a CPLD), we can compute the CRC-16 in realtime as the data flows through, and thus make it work with all carts without having to reprogram the FPGA.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll be adding this into the next version of my passthrough when I get the time, unless I figure out a way to skip the passthrough completly (it certainly seems feasible, as long as the BIOS doesn't CRC any forced encryption commands).<br/>_________________<br/>Joat
