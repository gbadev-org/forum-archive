    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As the title says, can this new "Colors!" photoshop DS thing be transfered onto an action replay as a ROM? Or does it have to be a .rom file?
<br/>
And yes, I have both "Colors!" and an AR'DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and if I could do it with Colors, could I do it with any other .nds filed ROM?

<br/>
to my knowledge there is no alternate firmware for action replay DS and even if there was, the ARDS does not have the hardware required to execute DS homebrew.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Dont get any other datel devices. They sux, you would have more troubles with them than you can handle. Get yourself R4, or M3Real, or CycloEvo, or SuperCard DSONE SDHC, but stay away from Datel, yuck!
<br/>
<br/>
Action replay cannot run no software.  It only can install cheats for games played from other cartridges.
<br/>
You need flash cart to run homebrew, Action Replay is no flashcart.

Do you recommend any flash cart that can be purchased with cash? Or in your estimation, do the system requirements for Colors! include a credit card or checking account?

But Games n' Music is. I just patched Colors! 1.06h with gmtf.dldi and ran it on my GnM, and it worked fine once I calibrated the pressure, although with slower loading and saving than my R4.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I CAN buy R4 and Super Cards in a brick and mortar shops here (Poland), probably other cards too, but i never even checked for others. Not in the big supermarkets, but small gaming shops - they have them.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't see a problem buying things over the internet through shops or Ebay. You can always pay with COD - with cash.

I heard enough stories from people unsuccessfully trying to run homebrew on G'n'M. Not everybody is technically inclined like you. And you know that  better than i do. This site is full of threads about how bad G'n'M is, and how people cant run things on it.
<br/>
<br/>
I would rather recommend a card that works without problems than one that i know that will be hassle to get colors working with.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>
