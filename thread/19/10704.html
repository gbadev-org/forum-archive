    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, I've been doing homebrew with an EFA Linker for a while. It's a nice card, but it requires a Windows driver. I'd like to start doing some heavier development, but I really don't want to have to keep moving the binaries to Windows just to write my card.
<br/>
<br/>
So, what card would allow me to stay completely in Linux for everything?
<br/>
<br/>
I presume that the card needs to look like a pure USB drive, so which one qualifies? Alternatively, a solution in which I can remove a Compact Flash, miniSD, etc. card and use a generic reader/writer would be fine too.
<br/>
<br/>
What do the folks here recommend? Price isn't particularly an issue.
<br/>
<br/>

I believe Tepples kinda cryptic reply was down to the fact we can't promote companies or products on these boards.

Based on recommendations from here and DSLinux, I ordered a Supercard CF.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm kinda waiting for things to settle out a bit before jumping into the newer stuff.  I have a DS Lite, and really like the idea of some of the smaller solutions, but I'm going to wait a bit to let other people test the compatibility.

As I read the rules, product recommendation is OK; <span style="font-style: italic">retailer</span> recommendation isn't.

None for the CF that I know of, but it appears that some makers of adapters are releasing patchers for homebrew that ran on older SD adapters to run on the company's newer SD adapters.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
