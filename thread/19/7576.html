    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, I got a blue DS a few days ago, and I've just upgraded my passme into a passme2.
<br/>
So, programming was successfull, I inserted my M3 adapter, ran <a href="http://pepsiman.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/passme2_mb.gba" target="_blank">http://pepsiman.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/passme2_mb.gba</a> and turned my DS off.
<br/>
<br/>
I then inserted the passme2, but it wouldn't turn on! Not even a light. I've tried changing battery, no go. When I try to charge it, the light just flashes once then goes off.
<br/>
<br/>
What could have caused this? 
<br/>
<br/>
Possiblities: I didn't actually remove the solder off the back of the passkey 2(I just cut off the ends of the wires), could that have caused a short circuit? Um...the passme2_mb.gba was corrupt?
<br/>
Also, I had forgotten to put my game in the passme2, could that have caused it?
<br/>
Also, it's not the M3, I just tried running it on another DS and it works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You should never short GND and VCC. The back of the DS slot is metallic and connected to GND. So if the VCC (of JTAG for example) touches the metal case, there is a short circuit. If that's what indeed happened to your DS, the internal fuse is blown and needs replacing (or bridging).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm just asking what possibly could have caused it to stop functioning completely. 
<br/>
I'm also wondering if there is a way to possible fix it or something...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds like it is almost definate that you shorted the PassMe with the metal inside the DS.  Do a search on replacing the internal SMD fuse.  I think DarkFader even posted pics.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, thanks natrium.
<br/>
*sigh*, now the branch where I bought it doesn't have any in stock.
<br/>
<br/>
Ah well, that's what I get for not waiting for my brother to come home and remove the solder...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#61767 - tdk - Wed Nov 23, 2005 4:06 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just wondering... When you open it is there some paper or something that indicates that the case has been opened(and therefore the warranty voided)? 
<br/>
Because I was thinking of trying to fix it(well, my electrician brother ;), and if I fail I'll take it back.
<br/>
<br/>
If I do have to take it back, it'll be the second replacement. The first one had a faulty backlight :(.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You're warranty is already void and attempting to claim warranty at this point would be dishonest.  If you're brothers comfortable with a soldering iron see if he'll replace or short out the fuse marked F2 on the DS main board (you can see it near the power connectors in <a class="postlink" href="http://home.utah.edu/~u0422123/iQue/ique2.jpg" target="_blank">this picture</a>).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Darkfader,
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for your response. 
<br/>
<br/>
I had use ppflash to recover my NDS. After completed flashing fw.bin, I try to reconnect the pin 28 and startup my NDS. However, it cannot startup, there seems no power (green light not light up). I am sure the battery is fully charged.
<br/>
<br/>
I had checked both Fuse (F1 &amp; F2), F1 is break and F2 is ok. I had fixed the F1 with a think wire. But there is no help. 
<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any idea or  suggestion for me to trouble shoot this problem ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
