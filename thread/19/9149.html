Ralink chips, same as on Windows. But with a bit luck, you can get USB Ralink chips to work (including the Nintendo wifistick). But if you have to buy one, get a non-usb card, that will be easyer.
<br/>
Ndiswrapper doesn't work and will never work (too hi-level).
<br/>
The official demos work with every DS (every firmware, with and without flashme), because they are signed by Nintendo.

I heard it definitly can be done, but i haven't tried it myself (it's simple with a pcmcia card). I read somewhere, that it's a bit more work to get it running (and with the usb stick linux only).
<br/>
<br/>
A tutorial how to set it up is here: <a class="postlink" href="http://tobw.net/dswiki/index.php?title=Set_up_WMB_for_Linux" target="_blank">http://tobw.net/dswiki/index.php?title=Set_up_WMB_for_Linux</a>

<br/>
<br/>
rt2500 based cards (PCI and PCMCIA)

rt2570 (sometimes called rt2500usb) based cards (USB including the Nintendo Wifi dongle).
<br/>

Others may work but I have used both of the above.

You can get both the rt2570 hacked driver and a linux WMB host from:

srry, but it still isnt clear.....can i use my Nintendo WiFi dongle(USB) for WiFiMe?
<br/>
<br/>
if yes, pls tell me :)
<br/>

that wiki page doesnt make any sense about how to use the Nintendo WiFi dongle(USB) for WiFiMe.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes you can, under linux, use the Nintendo Wifi Dongle to do wifime.
<br/>
You can get a wifime capable WMB host application from my website. To do wifime you just add the -w option when running the app.
<br/>
<br/>
There always seem to be confusion with regard to WMB and wifime.
<br/>
<br/>
WMB - this is the process of downloading a demo/program to your DS over a wireless link.
<br/>
WifiME - nobbling the WMB download so that it causes a DS to run software from a flashcart/gbamp in the GBA cart slot. This only works with DSs with firmware version 3 or less.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

thank you very much for your help, masscat. I really appreciate it.

EDIT: does VMplayer affects any official driver? is VMplayer just a program, or is it a utility? 
<br/>
And if I use it, can i still go online on Nintendo WFC with that same nintendo WiFi dongle?

My Nintendo Wifi dongle is sat on a Windows machine running the SoftAP software. Whilst running VMplayer the dongle was taken over by linux so I could not access it as an AP but I could do WMB transfers, which is fair enough as both windows and linux cannot access the hardware at the same time. As soon as I quit VMplayer control of the dongle was handed back to windows and I could access the AP as normal.
<br/>
So yes you can use the same dongle for WMB and go on Nintendo WFC but you will not be able to do it at the same time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">@ masscat hehe, of course you can't use the dongle for both things on the same time, i already knew that, but my question was, can i use the dongle (after using VMplayer) for the "normal stuff" again, and i read that the answer is yes.
<br/>
<br/>
but you use the SoftAP software for that. Is it possible to keep my "official Nintendo WiFi USB dongle software" running, after using VM player?

you have been very helpful, thanks for that</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by iceman7 on Fri Apr 14, 2006 3:14 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

according to Simon's site...: "I'm not sure if this is different for every system (I think so), if you want to know what to type here, type mount and replace sda4 with the other sd you find in the output." (from halfway part 5)
<br/>
<br/>
Mount /dev/sda4"
<br/>
<br/>
i get a error, which sd do i have to use? :S

<br/>
(btw...do you know simon personally?...I think simon is dutch, just like me, so i can talk to him easily)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: i might know why it doesn't work. The usb data stick that i use is actually a MP3 player, you have to install something with it, but the software is on it. Example: When i bring the Mp3 player with me to a friend, and i use it on his computer, the MP3 player installs himself and after a few seconds it ready to go. I don't know if Knoppix installs the software automaticly...perhaps i have to find a normal USB data stick.....but i hope my MP3 player works as well.
<br/>
<br/>
let me know if this is the problem, thanks in advance
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT2:can i use a cd-rw instead of the USB data stick?
<br/>
EDIT3:I did it :D, i used a floppy instead of the USB data stick,because i didnt have to mount it, but a floppy is limited, i want to use a cdrom, is that auto mounted like the floppy?
<br/>
if yes, what is the last command?(wmb -i ninusb0 -c 13 /mnt/?????/zelda.nds
<br/>
<br/>
pls help me wth this, i'm so close to the final solution :)
<br/>
<br/>
it's MP3player or CD-ROM, floppy(with the Brain Age demo) did already work :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
