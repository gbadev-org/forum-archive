    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I logged into deviantart adn saw that hideyoshi (hideyoshi.deviantart.com) had posted a new picture using "colors" so i tried it on my G6real, thought it would work since it was an nds file, it didnt work, so then i patched the file (some games need patched with a g6 so i wasnt to bothered) so anyways it still didnt work.
<br/>
<br/>
I then looked at jannis borgers tutorial (http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=109672)
<br/>
<br/>
and was told to install firmware for  R4 or M3, but that only really works on micro-sd  NDS-cards.
<br/>
<br/>
so im pretty much screwed, i did try to install R4 and M3 software but no luck at all, no load at all really.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
my G6- as stock, loads the file and then ends with 2 blank screens.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading xD

i get the message

<span style="font-weight: bold">"Filesystem could not be initialized
<br/>
make sure your flashcard has the latest update.if you still are having problems. try reading the colors! FAQ.You can find it on the colors! homepage"</span>
<br/>
<br/>
if i patch the file to work on G6, it just loads and turns black with no message at all, kinda wondering what else to try now
<br/>
<br/>
ill just see what i can do hope it works, colors looks amazing<br/>_________________<br/>=Look out its Aegno with a daft question=</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
