<br/>
<br/>
i'm wondering if there is an existing app (to run from a slot one card) to boot a slot two cart in nds mode, or even better, one which gives the option of slot two gba mode and slot two nds mode.
<br/>
<br/>
i know some flashcarts have this feature built in.
<br/>
<br/>
edit: i should have searched first, i found a passme type app.
<br/>
but still, is there one which gives the option of booting in gba or nds mode?
<br/>
<br/>
or is there a physical passkey which has this option&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by OSW on Fri Sep 21, 2007 1:03 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
