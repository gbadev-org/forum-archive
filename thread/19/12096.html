    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got my GBAMP today, but have not yet received my MML card. So I decided I'd mess around with the GBAMP purely in GBA mode to check out playing music and stuff. I put Update.e19 on my CF card, cause I figured I might as well get the latest firmware on it.
<br/>
<br/>
I put the GBAMP into my DS, go to the cartridge selection menu and hit the GBA Game slot. GBAMP detects the firmware update, asks me to install it, and I say go for it. After it's done updating, it goes to the main menu and the graphics are messed up with your standard random colors everwhere screen. Purple, yellow, blue, etc pixels placed randomly everwhere.
<br/>
<br/>
So I turn my DS off, put the CF card in my computer and kill the update file, since I wouldn't need it anymore anyways. Put the CF card back into the GBAMP and tried booting it up again. This time the DS insisted that there was no GBA Game Pak inserted... I can't get it to see the GBAMP anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
All I have on the CF card is a converted MP3 file using the MP Software and I even tried putting the Update.e19 file back on, but to no avail.
<br/>
<br/>
Is firmware e19 meant to be used with a NoPass device? That doesn't seem logical due to it being an official update for the GBAMP, meant for GBAs... NoPass's are only used for booting nds stuff after Chishm's patch has been applied, yea?
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't installed Chishm's patch yet because it's unnecessary for running .GBA files, or at least that's my understanding. The only other thing I haven't tried yet is a different CF card. Is there anything I'm just missing or don't know about?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time,
<br/>

EDIT: Tried reformatting the CF card to both FAT and FAT32, and still the DS refuses to see it in the GBA Slot. The DS doesn't see it without a CF card either, is it supposed to be able to? Also, even if I wanted to update it with Chishm's firmware patch, I can't anyways...
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT2: Firmware update was bad... Ordered another MP from Hong Kong... Sigh.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
