    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">People over on the dslinux forums have got the linux WMB host program and rt2570 driver running on Knoppix running under Vmplayer on Windows. It does work as I have tried it.
<br/>
So you Windows users can now use your rt2570 wireless devices to WMB/wifime without even leaving your desktop.
<br/>
<br/>
Please post questions and the like to the dslinux forum thread as I am not actively developing this approach and am just posting to let people know.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A nice addition to that (which I don't think was mentioned, sorry if it was, I haven't tried what they mention in that thread yet either), is to set up Samba so you can easily access part of the filesystem inside VMware/VMplayer via Windows Shares. What I do is develop with Visual Studio, but part of my Makefile automatically copies the NDS over to the Windows share, then it's just as simple as re-running the WMB host to broadcast the new NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm by no means a Linux pro or anything, but I've been doing the above with VMware Workstation 5.5.1 running Gentoo Linux 2.6.15-r1. Never used Knoppix so I'm not sure how easy it would be to set up a Samba server to allow access to the Linux virtual disk via Windows shares.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Perhaps I should try out the stuff he provided to get it going... from the screenshots seeing "/mnt/sda4" looks like he's doing something similar (maybe not Windows shares, but something else.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT2: Nevermind, apparently I overlooked it in a reply post where he mentions using a USB stick. :P Well whatever, just so you all know, Windows Shares is another way heh.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Though it seems if you were going to go though all this trouble, with the VMWare setup and Samba shares, it would be easier to just install Slackware or something on an old computer, and put the WiFi card in that computer with the same Samba shares.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I agree it would be easier to just install a real system, but for people that don't have a spare system (like I do :D) this could be very usefull.
<br/>
I'm also using it quite frequently now, since I can't seem to be able to write to my CF correctly via Linux.
<br/>
Anyways, enjoy the VM-ing, and check the site since there is a howto there and may make it a bit easier for some people :).

*If you can write a nice bit of script that brings up a general samba server (since it's VMplayer it should be okay for everyone) I'll add it to my vmdk image. Good idea for some people (but it does require a bit more Linux knowlidge). I do feel that it may be a bit more system/network specific (which is why I choose for the use of a USB-stick), perhaps the easiest way would be to explain how people can add their .nds file to the VMDK image and howto make a shell script that automaticaly runs the WMB with that .nds file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You do understand that that isn't the real system install correct?
<br/>
That's VMplayer.
<br/>
The files should work, if you use them the same way though.
<br/>
<br/>
To get this strait:
<br/>
You put the files from the ZIP file on your USB stick.
<br/>
Then you started VMplayer and booted Knoppix.
<br/>
There you mounted the USB device (your USB storage).
<br/>
You typed:</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
sh /mnt/sda1/hda/shell1
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
sda1 can be different depending on your system.
<br/>
<br/>
Then you put your Nintendo USB/rt2500/rt2570 device in your computer (and plugged it in in VMplayer).
<br/>
Then you typed </span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
ifconfig -a

The real system version works with all video cards supported by Knoppix (I think that coveres most if not all cards).

And you do not need to boot from USB, but from CD (I need things that are on the CD or DVD for that matter).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That should be fixed now.
<br/>
And as for the tiny distro, it could be done...but Knoppix and Kanotix are quite well known live distro's.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've spent all day writing my howto into Dutch!
<br/>
Just follow the old link and it should be pretty clear :).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering weather or not you got the RT2500 PSI cards up and working again with this distro.  I have tried over and over using the real-system way as well as the VMplayer and I cannot get the driver to recognise my RT2500 PCI card.  VERY VERY annoying :(
<br/>
<br/>
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't looked at it much (as I do not have the hardware), but I seem to remember Knoppix indeed didn't like the rt2500PCI cards.
<br/>
Which is why I switched to kanotix for the rt2500PCI :).
<br/>
Have you tried the rt2500PCI "version" of my howto?
<br/>
<br/>
Working on this howto is not really a priority anymore.
<br/>
I'm pretty busy with school these days, and most people do not WifiMe/WMB anymore.
<br/>
The addition of the VMDK file is simply because someone on the DSlinux forums asked me to as he didn't have an USB data device.
<br/>
I'll put everything on there (including the rt2500PCI drivers).
<br/>
Possibly it may take a bit longer as I want to change the scripts for this release too.
<br/>
<br/>
*ps as stated earlier, I killed my hosting by having to much visitors this moth :) (never thought that would happen), so any updates will have to wait untill at least next month (two days or so).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If you have more then one you could try the other devices by changing the shell script to match them (changing all eth0 arguments).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can only see one network device, well except for the lo ofcourse.  The problem with that is that I have 2 of them, I have a gigabit lan card as well that is built into my motherboard.  I'll see if I can turn that off and try again.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well it seems that the Knoppix doesn't even recognise my card as being there.  When in windows its all sh*ts and giggles, when linux looks, it turns a blind eye.  
<br/>
<br/>
No idea how to fix this so I think I'm going to try and just sell it and get another one that works or get another device. :\

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I really find it strange, maybe kanotix helps? (as rt2500 support is broken in Knoppix in the last version I tested 5.0 I think).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
