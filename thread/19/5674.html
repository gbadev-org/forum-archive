    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can confirm that the Belkin 802.11g PCMCIA card model #: F5D7010au Version: 3000au does indeed work with Firefly's (Tim) driver. The model number and version are written on the outside of the box - look for it before buying.

You can pick up this card at most computer stores and at Myer Megamart for around $70.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cworld.com.au/info.php?ID=116149" target="_blank">MSI CB54G2</a> is $49 AUD at <a class="postlink" href="http://cworld.com.au" target="_blank">Computer World</a> but it took them a while to get one in stock.  It works fine for DS but it's a low power card 14 dBm, so the range isn't great.
