I'm only interested in homebrew, since I like to buy my games so piracy-options doesnt matter much. The only thing I need is a slick flashcard that doesnt stick out of my ds lite :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It never hurts to wait a little, you may be more satisfied.

O rly? When I was shopping for flash equipment in early 2002, I couldn't find <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> new Game Boy Color flash equipment for sale[1], even though Nintendo was still making a handheld system compatible with Game Boy Color games (and continues to make the GBA SP v2).

A <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.pocketheaven.com/Block_device" target="_blank">block device</a> is composed of sectors, or blocks of data generally 512 bytes in size. Each type of block device generally has its own procedure for reading and writing sectors; code that implements this procedure is a "sector driver" or "block device driver". A working file system implementation includes 1. block device drivers for common storage media, and 2. a file system that groups the sectors into files.

<br/>
If it supports one .nds file at once, then how can a homebrew program access data past the first 32 megabits (size of DS internal RAM)? Official DS games treat the Game Card as a block device with a Nitro-FAT file system, but homebrew will need an appropriate block device driver before it can do the same.
