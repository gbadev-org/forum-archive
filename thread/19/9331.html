    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">my friend doesn't know whether its greyish-blue (ver3)
<br/>
or dark blue (ver6)
<br/>
<br/>
is there a way to check firmware with the barcode?
<br/>
<br/>
or do you think since he got his ds about 5 months ago (estimate; maybe more but probly not less) that its ver3?
<br/>
<br/>
also, does a passme 1 (which i have) work with ver3 firmware (if he has it)? im gonna flash it for him using my passme so he doesnt have to buy one himself.
<br/>
<br/>
please reply soon, i need to let him know, thanks :)<br/>_________________<br/>popcorn</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
i remember letting him use my passme and my gbamp to play that hockey-e3-demo game awhile back. so i assume he has ver3

<br/>

Can we force the DS to "unflash" into v2 and v6 respectively?
<br/>
<br/>
I'd do it, but I only have a PassMe v1, so I wouldnt be able to go back to v6 :(, but perhaps someone else might do the job? :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">IIRC, loopy added that feature into noflashme.nds, such that if the firmware version is not known, it defaults to version 3.  If the firmware version CRC is known though, it will default back to that version.  Pushing a certain button will allow you to change which firmware version is installed.   It would not however be a good idea to install anything greater than version 3, if you only have a passme 1.  Also, IIRC, version 6 is what DS lite has.  Unless the latest version of flashme identified your DS as a DS lite, (via PM register 4, bit 6 == 1), it would not be a good idea to install version 6 onto it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you heard about <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/white-balance.htm" target="_blank">white balance</a>? This is the most common problem that ppl don't get. They just use automatic settings and that is no good. To set the white balance you could just use a blank white paper with your digital camera and manual settings to take correct pictures.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

Just a quick warning to anyone who tries this: Make sure you have a PassMe2 or a NoPass before flashing to official firmware versions above v4.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I might just do that next week at school, when I can borrow one friend's camera phone and another's SuperPass2. Then we can have "same-conditions" pictures of all the colors.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
