    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, 
<br/>
<br/>
Ah i was in anouther forum on <a href="http://www.atomicmpc.com.au" target="_blank">www.atomicmpc.com.au</a> and i was asking for help regarding issues with the Nintendo DS and i was eventually told to come here for the best advice and help.
<br/>
<br/>
A couple of days ago i purchased the original Nintendo DS because i'm not all that fussed about the DS Lite... anyways i really wanna do the following 4 things on it:
<br/>
<br/>
* Run Moonshell on it
<br/>
* Play movies on it
<br/>
* Play music on it
<br/>
* Download homebrew games of the net to transfer to an sd card and use on my DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to mention that i don't know my firmware but i only purchased my DS a few days ago if that helps, and i do wish to be able to do these things via sd card if thats possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Could someone please explain what parts i need to do this? and what the individual parts do?
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and could someone please tell me which (Australian) website i can order these items off.  Please give me one website and not a range of them.  One package which has all the items would be the best thing for me instead of buying the items individually.
<br/>
<br/>
Thankyou very much everyone and i look forward to your responses.
<br/>
