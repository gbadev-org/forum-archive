    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone. I'm pretty new to all this DS and GBA homebrew.  Cool stuff.  I have come across a little quirk with my EFA 256 though.  
<br/>
<br/>
I have already used FlashMe on my DS, and it will run DS stuff, but only if I don't use the loader menu.  If I uncheck the "use loader" option in the EFA Client, the DS app will run as soon as I turn on the DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
If I try to use the loader menu to try to run a DS app, the screen turns white, and nothing happens.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else had this problem?   Anything I can do to fix it?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!
<br/>
