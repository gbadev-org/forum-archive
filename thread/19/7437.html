    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I cant answer all the questions, but Id say the M3 is awesome to the max and I would order from Divineo.cn because its a little bit cheaper because its in China (M3 w/Passkey for $90 +$5 shipping).  But if you did order from Canada you would pay in American currency which is like $100 (you can pay in Canadian currency if you really wanted, but you would end up paying the same anyways).  And I buy my flash cards at places like Best Buy, Office Depot, and NewEgg.com</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I actually just got a really good deal on a 1 gig compact flash card on eBay...new, sealed, unopened card and everything, a good quality card (Kingston, not some weird off brand), so I would suggest checking out eBay.

Well, not sure what you mean...I mean, you can play Nintendo DS games using Nintendo's Onnline service later this month, but if you mean DS homebrew using wifi and the internet...it's definitely getting there.  :)  It sounds as though sgstair has progressed by leaps and bounds in the last few weeks (and yes, if DS homebrew uses Wifi and you can run homebrew, you could use it).

I rather like mine...for the most part runs just about any DS/GBA thing I've tried, including DS homebrew that usually requires a flashcart to run, and the most homebrew that uses the compact flash card. Pretty handy if you want a device that can run just about anything.

I got mine from the site Jakelshark mentioned, but from the US section.  Came out to about the same as his, maybe slightly more because I got kind of hosed on the shipping cost.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
