    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So this guy has been working on making this homebrew game for DS.  It promises to be a fantastic game because well...its a port.  Its for Cave Story (if any of you haven't played this game, it is QUITE fun)
<br/>
<br/>
in any case I know my brother is going to want it like...REALLY BADLY.  But heres the deal.  he refuses to use a nopass device or a gba slot solution...you know basically anything that would ensure that he could play this game.  He is quite paranoid (he wont get integrated wireless on his laptop because hes afraid that someone could hack the on\off switch on the wireless card and break into his computer.  yes THAT paranoid).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway so I thought it'd be a nice gift for him if I just wrote the game to a standard DS card.  I had thought that someone figured out how to do this on the metroid prime demo cards but I can't find any info on it anymore.  Is it possible to flash commercial DS cards?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">that doesnt really make sense.  they put a flash memory chip into those things.  Even if it is an EEPROM thats still rewritable.  CD-Rs are not rewritable because you've burned a laser into the ink on the CD-R...but that is not how silicon chips work.

Well I guess nobody here knows about this.  Its possible it requires special hardware that is not widely available.

DS Game Cards are not EEPROM. They are either mask ROM or OTP (one time programmable) memory.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Official game cartridges for pretty much every game console ever are either ROM (not modifyable at all, the data is hardwired) or OTP (One-Time Programmable, only modifyable once which is used to put the game in). You could do as people often do with older consoles and build a cartridge with flash ROM or replace a game's ROM with flash, but given the DS cards' size, buying one is probably much easier.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">that I've already done...theres just no way to convince him.
<br/>
<br/>
now what do you mean about buying that card...do you mean just buy like a flash card like a ds-x or ninja pass?  or is there a way of buying a vanilla DS card and write to it?
<br/>
<br/>
Basically if I do set something up I dont want any boot loader on it or anything...I want it to just directly load the game.  Cause then if I DO get something like a ninja pass I can just stick a sticker over it and it'll look like a DS-card and he'll not whine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why the heck is your brother so paranoid about flashcards anyway? I mean, the only way you can get a virus that will destroy your DS is if you download commercial ROMS on unsafe <a class="postlink" href="http://p2p.ytmnd.com/" target="_blank">PP2P2P2PP2P</a> stuff. Homebrew does not contain virus and stuff. The chances of you getting a virus on your DS is like 1 in 100000. And once you flash the DS, a safety mechanism is installed and you can use the recovery firmware feature to reinstall your firmware. Comparing using homebrew on a DS with shopping online is a remarkably stupid thing. 
<br/>
<br/>
If he still isn't convince then this is what I think you should do.
<br/>
Buy a Supercard Lite, flash his DS, and load the game. Do not let him know that he's using a flashcard. Once he enjoys the game and stuff, reveal to him that he's using a flashcard and that it's safe. It's like pushing someone down a waterslide when they're a bit nervous and after the ride they find out it's actually fun.
<br/>
<br/>
If your brother is still not convinced then he's incredibly ghey. Sorry, I just had to say it. Even my father who's an online-paranoid person isn't paranoid with the use of flashcards. o_o

the only way you could do d that is with a finger 0.o
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Scenario1: guy wants to make money, so he buys 100 copys of some really cheap game, writes an expensive game to it, sticks a sticker on, then markets it for a ?20/$40 profit.
<br/>
<br/>
Scenario2: ingame bug gets through beta testing stage, which isntead of saving writes to the ds game card, massive amount of recalls and game company makes huge losses on game
<br/>
<br/>
this is why they are ds ROMS [READ ONLY memory]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#108884 - geminiwave - Sun Nov 12, 2006 5:23 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry.  First scenario is unlikely because the more expensive games are usually much larger.  buying a cheaper game really wouldn't help you out much.
<br/>
<br/>
The second scenario is also not really likely because it'd be easy to make the DS not be able to write to the sector where the game is written.  You'd need a DS card burner of sorts...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway the point is that I am unable to write to a DS card which is what I was hoping for.  My next best options are trying to build one myself (somehow i'm betting this is extremely difficult and not the best idea) or buy a really cheap slot one solution (cheap in the relative sense.  probably go with the low-memory ninjapass) and figure out how to force Cave Story DS to auto boot instead of going to the ninja pass's OS.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help guys!
<br/>
<br/>
edit: and biohazard...i know for a fact hes not flashing his DS.  I havent flashed mine yet either (good thing too since the hinge cracked...that suckers going back to nintendo next week).  I actually have some concerns about flashing so I KNOW he will have tons of concerns.  Fact is that he is very much a game nazi.  Everything has to be pure.  the game must be in pure commercial format.  Now if this was all about supporting the companies and such then I would say thats a noble and fair way to be...but no.  He has little care for such things.  No his fear is that l33t h4x0rz will find a way to destroy his precious things.  its paranoia.  unreasonable and inconsolable.  All I can do is find something that looks legitimate.
<br/>
<br/>
The sad thing is that if I write it to a commercial card, he says thats okay.  Whats the difference?!?!?  Bah.
<br/>
<br/>
and yes hes kinda a dumbass..  though I wouldnt go so far as to insult the "ghey" community by pigeonholing him into that group.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The DS-X has an option to instant boot the last .nds file you ran (can be skipped by holding A during boot).

yea and his progress is pretty good.  Last I heard the game should be finished pretty soon.  though it seems like not much has been done (just maps and music stuff written) my understanding is that most of the hard stuff is done.  theres just some tedious stuff left to do.
<br/>
<br/>
oh and theres one other authorized port.  The one done by Variant turns out to be legit.  I guess the rumors flew around cause someone emailed Pixel about it, and since Pixel's English isn't so good he basically said he had no idea what the guy was talking about...in the literal sense.  big misunderstanding.  
<br/>
<br/>
its pretty cool that an indie game designer is getting his game published.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
