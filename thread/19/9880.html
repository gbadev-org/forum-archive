You have to load the appropriate SRAM onto the SuperCard in order for any PassMe2 to work.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

-------------------------------------
<br/>
Thundrestrike,
<br/>
You're lucky you've got me! I had to figure it out all on my own!
<br/>
But since I did, and I know what a pain it is, let me write you your own personal walkthrough.
<br/>
<br/>
Step 1: To use the passme 2-z, look on the little box it came in and find the 4 digit code written there. Ex. AP2E (my code). That code identifies what game card was used to make your particular passme.
<br/>
NOTE: If you do not have the box, be prepared for pain, because I do not know of another way to retrieve the number.
<br/>
<br/>
Step 2: Go to <a href="http://darkfader.net/ds/games/" target="_blank">http://darkfader.net/ds/games/</a> and find your code listed in the Passme SRAM column, on the far right. Download the file there.
<br/>
To find it faster, while on the page, click Edit and then Find on this page, and type in the code in the dialogue box provided.
<br/>
<br/>
Step 3: Flash said file to your flash cart. Start your flash cart up in GBA mode.
<br/>
NOTE: You cannot start the flash cart in GBA mode while your Passme 2-z is inserted fully in slot 1 of your DS. After you flash the file to your cart, just make sure the Passme 2-z is not fully inserted when you power the DS on. You must insert it again after you have reached the "Game Boy" splash screen after selecting "start GBA game" from the DS's main menu. Then you may select the file.
<br/>
Step 4: Execute the file in question.
<br/>
Step 5: Quickly power down your DS and power up again, and you will be taken to the flash cart in DS mode, finally.
<br/>
NOTE: In the unlikely event that it doesn't work, start again from step 4, but this time hold A,B,X, and Y as you execute step 5.
<br/>
<br/>
There, you now have acces to DS mode with your supercard. Congratulations. I recommend next that you flash your DS's hardware with flashme, because with the passme 2-z, every time you wish to launch the supercard in DS mode, you have to go through steps 4 and 5 to do it. And that is a pain. I don't know how old you are, but if your parents bought you the DS Lite, you should check with them about flashing the DS. As you may know, if you fail at flashing your DS, it can destroy it. The flashme is a program that replaces the DS's internal programming, allowing you to bypass the security system within the handheld so that you can run homebrew and other unsigned code in DS mode. If you accidentally short the wrong contact (easily done) while nervously waiting for flashme to reprogram your DS, the system will be shut off, and you will not be able to start it up again, because the programming inside of it will be corrupted. Use caution!<br/>_________________<br/>popcorn</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
