Is it a desktop PC or a laptop?
<br/>
<br/>
If it's a Desktop pc than it's a 99.9% chance that it does. Wheather or not you have a free one is another problem! If you look on the back of your case you'll see it's segmented up, these are your PCI ports, you might have blanking plates on empty ones, if not it's easy enough to get rid of say, that old 56k modem you'll never use again! (incidently what i took out to put my new wireless card in!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
