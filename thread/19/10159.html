    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all
<br/>
<br/>
I've had my hardware for about two weeks and i'm desperately trying to figure out how to flash the firmware and am at my wits end.  Hopefully some of you guru's can help me out.
<br/>
<br/>
I have an MK3-2006 bundle (neo-key cart / slim loader / mk3-512Mb / kingston 128 MB /  and a passkey2.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried everything under the sun, but cant seem to make it happen.  My latest (and i think closest) attempt was :
<br/>
<br/>
flash the passkey2 v4 (K2_RAM04.gba) to the neo-key cart.
<br/>
put the cart into the GBA slot of the NDS
<br/>
put the passkey2 into the device
<br/>
put switch on passkey2 into the passkey1 mode
<br/>
boot up - go into the menu, select my game (brain age / US) - code = ANDE
<br/>
it says okay
<br/>
then pop brain age into the NDS slot of the passkey2, turn off device, switch passkey2 into the passkey2 mode (as opposed to the passkey1 mode)
<br/>
turn on NDS
<br/>
-boom- white screens.
<br/>
also tried putting flash me onto the cart after turning NDS off/on
<br/>
<br/>
btw- never keeping the device off more then 1-2 seconds while switching passkey modes.
<br/>
<br/>
and thats it.
<br/>
<br/>
cant figure it out   =(
<br/>
<br/>
any help is GREATLY appreciated.  I honestly have scoured all the forum posts i could find and havent found a solution.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, and i think the issue is / could be the writing of the sram?
<br/>
<br/>
my understanding is that the first thing i need to do is program my passkey2 device to work with a game i have.  (i'm attempting use of brain age US btw).
<br/>
<br/>
so that is the app i'm trying to start up, which is in fact starting up as expected.
<br/>
<br/>
when i boot into the K2_RAM04.gba app from the neokey cart, the application pulls up, i select the correct game by serial ( ANDE ) - hit okay, it says its loaded.
<br/>
<br/>
now, I am not sure at this point, where it has loaded it, and what that exactly means.  has this done the sram that is needed for passkey2 - or is that something else?  From what I understand, it has at that point set up the passkey2 for my game, and i should be able to then use passkey2 to boot some code off of the flash cart (such as flashme) - i dont know.  
<br/>
<br/>
does this help any?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks again for any help, its much appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
