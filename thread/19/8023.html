    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what I can tell the answer is "no" - as so far I've only seen the Windows WMB program and the Linux one (which I'm excited and happy about - though if I could use my Powerbook, which already has 802.11 built in, all the better...) and from my searches so far (here and elsewhere) I haven't seen anything.  But I thought I'd ask anyway - any WMB or other Nintendo DS-related 802.11 apps for Apples with built-in 802.11?  It'd be very nice to have such functionality when I'm away from my home PC.  If the answer is "no" and people would like to share their technical knowledge of what's involved and what obstacles exist (I'd hazard a guess that diverse Airport chipsets and incomplete support at the API level for activities not directly related to normal IP protocol usage are likely obstacles...)
<br/>
<br/>
(BTW, right fine job by MaHe et al on the Pictochat method of checking firmware rev...  Hopefully once I'm able to perform that test I'll find my silver DS likely to be WifiMe-friendly...  Beats ordering and waiting for a Passme - though I find all these contributions to the homebrew scene to be absolutely fantastic...  I get to enjoy the fruits of all your labors!  :))
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">(EDIT)</span>: Should have read the whole WiFiMe thread first.  it was very enlightening, on those pages where a nugget of useful information on the requirements for communicating with the DS (data rate, precise control of packet format, etc.) was buried amongst loads of questions almost exactly like the one I asked above.  :)<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC

I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.
<br/>
Thank you, everyone, I look forward to taking advantage of your work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
