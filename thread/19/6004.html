    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since the XG2T2005's work with a passme to play commercial dumps (using the neo flash soft, or course), has anyone tried it with FlashMe instead? I'm not too sure on the specifics of FlashMe as opposed to PassMe, but since it allows unsigned data to run from the cart, it could work, right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i did.  the flashme only works with the first two releases by gst, the new ones u need the magic key or pass me.  all the homebrews work nicely.  ive played the e3 demo of hockey so many times my fingers hurt from gripping that tiny stylus</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It certainly is a fun game :P Thats strange, what does the passme/magickey have that FlashMe doesnt? Do the later releases check for an original game?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i think the new roms are coded to locate the info in the pass me in the ds slot, the flash me just loads from memory.  this is just my thought not proven by anybody.  just for the record, i know nothing</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
