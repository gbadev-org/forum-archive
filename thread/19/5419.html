<br/>
I'm not sure yet how to protect the firmware from malicious code, since only first 512B or 64 KB (more likely) are protected.
<br/>
Perhaps we can exploit the firmware loader so that only first 512B/64KB can hold some recovery code.
<br/>
Nintendo might not have planned any firmware updates. So we have to do it ourselves. Loopy is making the first patch to original firmware to allow execution from GBA cartridge.
<br/>
Any more suggestions of what to put into the new firmware?

As ecurtz said, it will allow running code without needing a PassMe. But you still need either a PassMe or WifiMe to program the firmware.

If the firmware were to be updated at all, my best bet would be that a new DS game or something would do it. Requiring a computer isn't too practical in terms of how limiting such a procedure would be.

They wouldn't want to make it something anyone would be fooling around with. By putting the pads and ports (I am assuming VR1 and VR2 in the picture are ports of some kind) accessable from behind the battery door, they make it so normal users will never notice them, yet Nintendo technicians could still access them if they ever needed to reflash. Also, by making any flash writes require a short across SL1, they prevent any future wifi viruses from changing the firmware without the user's consent.
<br/>
<br/>
As it is, it looks like Nintendo could pop the pattery door off, short SL1, connect to VR1/2 (assuming they are ports of some kind) and reflash the unit without much trouble, but the average Joe would never notice/screw around with it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just think, you pop in your new Mario Kart DS or any other Wifi ready game, and while it sets up, a new update is loaded and you get the lovely message, " please turn off the system, updates installed"

The thing is that the DS hardware is capable of TCP/IP but they actually use their own protocoll to communicate with each other. 
<br/>
Games can use a TCP/IP stack if they provide the driver along with the game. This will most likely be the case for the upcoming onlinegames because otherwise they couldn't be used with any wireless hotspot.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem with tunneling is that you will need your own driver that actually supports the custom protokoll that Nintendo is using but that can't be done on all wireless adapters. 
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know all the technical information either but there is a 36 page thread that explains all this.

<br/>
Changing the Firmware so that DS Code can be run from GBA (everyone want's it ;)).
<br/>
<br/>
Other thing about the Update stuff: I believe that once, the new Wifi and Online Games are coming out, these games will update the firmware. Anyone EVER played XBOX Live? Microsoft does it the same way! Firmware upgrades for the XBOX System are done by the Game itself if there is no online connection. And updates and patches for games are being put on the Gamediscs too. So I believe the online update will be done by a game cartrigde in the beginning. Lager on, there will be wifi updates too.
<br/>
<br/>
So where resides Pictochat? Pictochat is almost a game itself. It does not run in the DS System itself. It runs apart from the system and you have to shut down the DS when you quit the game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Couldn't the firmware be updated to run DS code from the GBA slot?

No, that's the eeprom, not the firmware (or as the xbox scene more commonly calls it the "bios").  The TSOP on board the xbox motherboard is write protected in exactly the same way as the DS: you must solder some jumpers to enable flashing (rewriting).
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, back on topic here.  I guess Im a bit confused as to what was figured out with this discovery is it:
<br/>
<br/>
1.)  You could read out the entire firmware and rewrite it all except the first 512 bytes, after soldering the jumper, you can write the 512?
<br/>
<br/>
2.)  You can only read/write 512 bytes.

The firmware isnt writable at all.  ConfigMagic can only write to the EEPROM which holds configuration data for the Xbox (video mode, serial, live code, region etc...) - this isnt the firmware at all.

If the latter than starting by compressing the original firmware and always use that one if a button is held down at boot would make sure that a broken hacked firmware wont be the end of the world.

<br/>
If space is tight then modified firmware could be stored as a set of patches to the original, and keeping the button pressed just skips the patching.

<br/>
If there is enough free space, a function that could download and flash executable code over wlan would be a nice feature for people without a gbaflash (but who has modified their bios at a friend :)

Lynx... basic text browser... should be small enough to cram into whatever 64KB or (just how BIG IS the firmware...?).

Also like others have asked, this no doubt will disrupt the ability to play commercial games... how about a easy revert option?

Also isn't the firmware a library BIOS too? don't commercial games use functions from it as well??

I assume you are including a TCP/IP stack in there as well...

don't forget a ping/trace/netstat in there as well as basic WiFi configuration.

The patch, with the clever name of FlashMe, works perfectly for the testers so far. It boots DS homebrew automatically if it detects it (hold select to override) in about 0.1 seconds. Expect a public release soon.
<br/>
<br/>
For those scared of connecting the sl1 bridge we have good news, it will stop flashing if you don't short properly, and it will continue automatically when you re-bridge it. Do NOT, however, turn of your DS before it says patching is done, that will brickify your DS.
<br/>
<br/>
FlashMe can be run from Passme, or from WifiMe. After the flash you do not need these methods to boot homebrew, of course.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

*IF* it was a possiblity, it could be done the same way it detects comercial GBA games vs DS home-brew games on a GBA cart.... just read the unencrypted header information.  have some special ID that is specific to home-brew roms, and use that.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

A few random questions though - Has anybody flashed more than one unit? Do I need to register a separate id for each machine, or is the firmware identical? Anybody flashed a Japanese import?

Also, it seems to require the newer style of header, so make sure you have an up to date demo for testing. (At least I had trouble with an older demo that does work on the hardware passME.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I like how easy it is to remove the patch, though.  Just put in a cart with the patching program, and start the removal.  I didn't remove it, but when I tested it out that was the program still on my cart...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

each machine will produce a unique code... and each code will generate a slightly different firmware download.  so yes, for each unit, you must register.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

<br/>
<br/>
I realise that Nintendo may release it's own Firmware upgrade for the online service, but if it doesn't, it may depend on some small code factor embedded in the current version of the firmware.  Perhaps there may even be a system which checks to see if your DS is modded, and boots you from online, much like what Xbox Live has done in the past to modded Xboxes.

neoflash is just a passme + gba flash cart + linker in the same box... nothing special about it at all.

Re the neoflash being as you explained - "it is nothing special about it at all".  If that is the case - what is the missing "magical" link that allows them to claim they can load nds files?

<br/>
<br/>
Hope am not getting off on the wrong foot with you.  I wholeheartedly agree with you - it looks like a passme, a flash cart and nothing special!! I just wonder why on earth they make such impressive claims as to being able to play nds etc.  It's certainly got everyone talking at the very least.  It is nowhere near as impressive as the elite crew here (yourself included) who pioneered this stuff.  I take my hat off to you (and the crew), and bow down before thee.  I am totally not worthy :).  I am just incredibly curious when people make such claims as neoflash have made.  S'pose only time will tell... and I can see already - you will be telling me "told you so" ;).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

All of those formats are supported by apps that already exist for GBA. (except for nds of course) It has nothing to do with the hardware, only the menu that is loaded onto the flash cart. Most likely all the other formats will run in GBA mode (they might release updates so they work in DS mode once that becomes available, who knows).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The answer to all of your previous questions were already mentioned in the thread. So, telling you to read the thread was a good idea.
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah there's about 500 pertinent replies between the 3-4 most important topics, but don't you think it's easier for people to just read already posted info rather than making everyone else answer the same questions again and again every 2 days?
<br/>
<br/>
Beta testing isn't always public. You let a few dozen people in, close registration, and that's how it works. You don't risk <span style="font-style: italic">everyone</span> trying something and breaking their DS, when you can limit it to a fraction of users. Once you are certain it's safe and/or make necessary fixes, then you release. Everyone else will have to wait until beta testing is public again or there's a public release. As I quoted earlier, DesktopMan suggested that a public release would be soon. I don't know if he was speculating or informing, but it's encouraging to hear.  I bet it's released in a matter of days or weeks so until then it's no big deal to just use pass-through a short while longer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

20 days ago Darkfader had a CRC error when modifying the firmware, and since then has obviously perfected firmware modifications and it is now possible to completely rewrite the firmware without errors.

Yep.  If if it doesn't find a homebrew game (it searches for gamecode "PASS" or title "DSBooter"), or if you hold Select when turning on the DS, it will load the normal firmware.  As I understand it, the patch coexists with the regular firmware, and doesn't actually modify Nintendo's code.  Doing so would be much more complicated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yes, or better yet, disable the signature check completely when the user holds down a button during boot up.
<br/>
<br/>
A theorethical way to do this, without requiring a flashcart, would be:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Disable write protection on firmware using current technique.
<br/>
2. Modify header to MarioDS to start execution at the address of the Logo information.
<br/>

passme - run homebrew code from the gba slot

official firmware - run the official nintendo firmware from the gba slot
<br/>
<br/>
notes
<br/>
passme - the way the cracked firware currently works
<br/>
dspaint - how big is the firmware chip? i thought it was 256k if so this wont fit :(
<br/>
wifime - let a friend use wifime, maybe even to install the firmware with no need to get a special router or a passme
<br/>
official firmware - used to play official ds and gba games can someone confirm whether we can run the firmware from the gba slot or not?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A theorethical way to do this, without requiring a flashcart, would be:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Disable write protection on firmware using current technique.

2. Modify header to MarioDS to start execution at the address of the Logo information.

The flashing program won't start until it detects a good connection, so you don't have to cross your fingers or anything.  I think I've heard of people using fork tines or paperclips... a paperclip might work better, since you can bend it to the right shape, but it'd be harder to hold properly.  Does anyone know what happens if you *don't* keep the SL1 connection until it finishes flashing?  Insta-brickification?

It doesn't matter if you lose contact with the SL1 - you just reapply contact (takes a little bit of fiddling) - I have flashed the firmware twice (once to add and once to remove) and had multiple occurrences of losing contact (hell I even went off and answered the phone halfway through!!) ...  you must have made the fatal error or not completing the flash process.  A warning to all others that has been said time and time again once you have started the process going you must finish it - DO NOT REBOOT YOUR DS UNTIL YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE FINISHED MESSAGE.  Can't say much clearer than that.  Bad luck Gally!!!  Either you didn't follow the instructions properly or you are the only person I have heard of that had problems.

Sorry man, from everything I have seen, your screwed. Losing contact with the bridge does no actual harm, you can just close the contact again, but if you freaked out and turned your DS off... there is a good chance your DS is a very pretty paperweight.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

<br/>
For example,  If the ID was CREM57I27HWAK (an invalid ID BTW), the mistyped version that would pass through is CREM57I27HWBK.

These key pairs you have to watch out for.

C/D, G/H, K/L, M/N, O/P,  2/3, 4/5, 6/7.

potentially, you should also watch out for E/F, I/J.

I started to flash but after a minute of a flashing dot and numbers not changing I assume it was not right.

If it stopped at 100 and you turned it off, you're screwed.  Basically that means it only managed to flash the very first block when you lost connection.  Extremely rare, but I suppose it could happen.  If it did make it past 100, restoreFW SHOULD be able to fix it.  Hold A+B+select+start, THEN turn on your DS (with restoreFW cart plugged in).  Hopefully that fixes it for you.
<br/>
<br/>
Folks, if you slip up and lose the SL1 connection, DON'T freak out and turn off your DS.  The flasher program will keep trying until it's done, so just make the connection again and everything will be fine.

Agreed. It works well in my testing (I stumbled across it, no official announcement of the new version)
<br/>
<br/>
Apparently includes the multi-boot hack and also a redundant boot block for people who want to muck around with the firmware (without having to short SL1 and live dangerously)

The "getID" was apparently one of the teething pains - used to determine what version of the firmware you have. The current version appears to handle all the cases (and the uninstall handling all cases - which is why it is so big)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks, I was wondering if the multi-boot feature was added. I am still waiting on my DS from eBay and 2 more I bought with my <a class="postlink" href="http://club.cs.ccsu.edu/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=NDS+Development+Guide" target="_blank">Computer Club</a>, so I am still waiting to test on hardware.

After a few quick tests, I found that holding Select while hitting the power button loads the original health warning and boot menu.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm quite amazed at how resilient the polka-dot stickers are, the one covering the SL1 contact. I practically destroyed one when trying to remove it, but I was still able to replace it just fine! It seems like a hardware tampering detection device, the kind for voiding warranties, but it's almost <span style="font-style: italic">meant</span> to be removed and reapplied.

I agree; version numbers with a version history would be very nice. I've already started keeping new firmware updates (webpage and files) stored in their own folder by date.

I think the firmware developers have just been too busy getting the real work done to bother with version numbers, much less announcements or documentation!

<br/>
Yeah, one can wish. It makes these tools less valuable (especially cost-wise), but they are not obsolete at all. Obviously, they are quite necessary; you can't have wireless multiboot or direct GBA cart booting without the firmware patch, and you can't have that without using pass-through (PassMe or WiFiMe) at least once to run the firmware install. You need it to get rid of it; quite the catch-22.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">IMHO, the only thing that appears obsoleted is PassMe.  Once you've got your firmware patched, you don't need a *Me device of any kind.  And in order to patch your firmware, WiFiMe is certainly the least risky (don't have to buy hand-rolled hardware from folks you don't know), most cost effective option (since you can just return the card once you're done with it :).  Finding a card is the only slightly tricky bit, but even that's quite easy... the Linksys rev4 cards are all over the place (since they're the latest revision of the card) and work perfectly with WiFiMe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
For some people, yes, unnecessary once the firmware is patched. The PassMe is still just as good a pass-through device as WiFiMe though. You can potentially construct your own rather than having to buy a wifi card at all, and there's a very small risk getting one from Lynx or another well-known developer (risk in damage during shipping).
<br/>
<br/>
Some people don't have the luxury of their own computer, though. They are the ones that might not be able to install a wifi card if, say, they use a public computer or one at work or school, and installing new hardware is forbidden. They can still plug in a USB device, though, to use a GBA cart, which will require the PassMe if only to patch the firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
As much as people want to say these things are obsolete, they're simply not. They just become unnecessary to a certain extent.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's not super fast...it's kind of a gradual fading in.  It doesn't take more than a few moments though..I mean, it still boots quite a bit faster than it would have with having the health screen to click through.

I think the future requirement to short SL1 was removed with your Version 1. I'm using V1 and when there was an update (V2) it said I don't need to short SL1, I just haven't bothered.
<br/>
<br/>
There would also be a Version 0 which required getID and registration of your serial number to download a version of FlashMe that works only for your DS. Future firmwares MIGHT require SL1 shorting, it just depends on whether the first XX bits of the firmware need to be changed.

I can confirm most of these details as I cached copies of the webpages and files from several dates.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There must be a version 4. I had a version that removed the RSA sig check and the fading backlight, but I have subsequently downloaded it again and the file had changed. Hence my original question.

<br/>
I am thinking of replacing my Firmware, but id don`t want to run in Problems later when Online-Play, etc. starts.
<br/>
<br/>
On the Homepage of the Firmware-Replacement it says it can be uninstalled, BUT IT WAS NOT RECOMMENDED?
<br/>
<br/>
Why isn`t it recommended? Is it more likely to break the DS in this way? Might it be Nintendo will later on recognize the false Firmware an i can not use official features in the future?

I WANT to get rid of this healthscreen, but i dont want to risk too much fpr it...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The whole thing about uninstalling the flashme being not recommended, is because doing so also erases the failsafe code, and unfortunately, the failsafe code is the first thing overwritten.  This means you have to make doubly sure that you have power connected, or that you have enough battery power left to complete the flashing, or else you will have a high tech brick.
<br/>
<br/>
At least with installing a new flashme update, Even if SL1 shorting is required, the failsafe code will not be overwritten, and you can recover if the flashing does fail to loss of power.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, when flashing from beginning, failsafe code is present when at least 2-3% of the firmware has been flashed. (Well, technically, should be 1%, but loopy forces 1% to be displayed if even the first sector is overwritten, and the failsafe code takes up 3-4 sectors of the firmware.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You almost exactly described the version of the firmware I've been using, one that's already out there. Difference: I must hold Select for normal boot when I have homebrew on my GBA cart, and the GBA cart homebrew boots directly with no key presses (using gamecode "PASS" or "DsBooter").
<br/>
<br/>
I would be really annoyed if they released dozens of special versions just to make everyone happy. If the getID version is considered v0, then I'm using v1 which leaves the healthscreen/backlight intact, but disables RSA signature check and allows future firmware updates to be done without bridging SL1 contacts. I am happy with this so I haven't bothered with the 2 new revisions since then.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I know that a lot of people have had problems with this cart (it's the imitation one...from linker4u.com) but even reading everybody else's issues, i still haven't found a solution.  It says "CRC32 ERROR! Please write again!" when i try to write the newest flashme to the flash cart, but it doesn't give me the error message if i use the "fix header" option in GBATA.  The farthest i've gotten is having it write to the cart, and when it starts up it shows "Gba file is corrupt." where the usual text is supposed to be.  I have gotten all of the E3 demos to work though.   Does anybody have a solution to this?  don't tell me to use the "search" button, cause i've done that and it hasn't gotten me anywhere.

You won't lose saves just for flashing your cart with a different ROM.  You can always back up your save to the PC...I always do this when I reflash my cart just to be on the safe side.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmm...what software are you using?  If it's Littlewriter, as much as I like Littlewriter I've had no real luck using it for backing up my saves.  And if you're using PogoShell or something you have to make sure you back up the entire 256k of SRAM or else it will probably not be working when you reflash it, that's just because of how PogoShell's SRAM saving system works.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, as I understand it...some menu type applications that come by default with the various flash carts (for loading more than one ROM on a cart) assign different SRAM banks to different ROMs in the loader, going by their order.  That's how it usually works I believe.  Like...the first ROM is likely Bank 1, 2nd Bank 2, etc (SRAM on flash carts is split up into banks, generally of 32k a piece).  If you tried it and it doesn't work it's possible that you either saved the wrong SRAM bank or backed the save up to the wrong bank.  About the only way to know this for sure is to check the documentation that came with your flash cart, although actually you could just back up the whole bit of the SRAM, and if you reflash the sane ROM you flashed before it should be fine and find the save just fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and if any of this is wrong, someone please feel free to correct me.  I'm always wanting to learn more about this kind of thing, and I'm sure some of you know way more than I do about these things.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not sure firmware changes would be overly useful for cheating. Much more useful to implement more intelligent methods that protect globally against cheating (I remember "Game Programming Gems 1" had a long section on checksums, preventing packet replay, etc). These are used to protect PC online games, where the computer is potentially completely at the user's control!
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, a friend told me that hacked Xboxes are permanently blacklisted from using the Live service, not just denied on a per-session basis. Don't know how true that is.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Back onto FlashMe, and I just completed this a few days back. I was so pleased when I saw a demo running using my PassMe, that I just had to flash straight away! Unfortunately, it went to 1% then refused to go any further no matter what object I shoved in the hole! (you'd be surprised just how non-conductive a lot of screwdrivers seem to be) Eventually I found a small piece of low voltage wire, frayed the end, and that did the job a treat!
<br/>
<br/>
One question, though: if SL1 only protects a small section of flash, why can't the update continue on its own once this section is complete?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sounds a lot like an urban legend to me... flashme ds can't be bricked has there's recovery in the sl1 protected part...
<br/>
Even if it's nintendo intention to keep the flasher away from the gaming scene, which I doubt because keeping all customers is important, they will never make such a move as bricking a ds for two reasons a) it's really some kind of asshole revenge, a businness company can't afford to have it's image downgraded like this b) if for some strange reason the code jump to the bricking code, legal customers will get bricked... 
<br/>
So all in all it'll be something deeply aftecting only nintendo reputation and non flashed ds...
<br/>
Far more possible version : mario kart ds detects a flashed ds, when you want to play online it sends this info to nintendo server which bans your address mac for this reason and maybe try to track you by following the ds serial number... A much more smart move for them.

He had flashme, so could recover it. Today we will confirm with other user; but it seems that access part of the firmware writable, and maybe this makes flashme don't work properly.

With some gba flash software you need to prepend an nds loader to flashme.nds before flashing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nope. The healthscreen data is saved in the non-protected part of the FW, so no worries here.

The health screen is text, rather than graphics.  The text for this screen is contained in part 5 of the firmware,   which is decompressed by the firmware.  Firefly is the only one who currently has a compressor for parts 3-5 of the firmware.  I am working on one however, as I want to do something similar, in replacing the heath screen.

Here is the decompression code I have worked out so far. compression code will soon follow. <a href="http://phpfi.com/94981" target="_blank">http://phpfi.com/94981</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Now let's see. We all want to start a custom written FW project, right (at least some of us)?

I've searched the forums for suggestions and ideas and put them on a list:
<br/>
<br/>
- Basic PDA functions (calendar, notes, alarm)
<br/>
- Calculator
<br/>
- Custom splashscreen (healthscreen)
<br/>
- WiFi HotSpot finding, Nintendo WFC setting editor, WPA support (if possible)
<br/>
- Pictochat P2P (that's a idea of mine - if two persons with DSs are to far away to chat, but one DS is in the middle of them, they still could do it via the one between them, I hope you understand)
<br/>
- Password protection
<br/>
- Recovery code (a must)
<br/>
- Extendable FW functions using GBAmp/g6/m3/supercard FW space
<br/>
<br/>
Although I'm pretty sure we cannot fit everything in 256KBytes of space, unless someone figures out a really good compression system...

Great idea, then make a chain of 16 users and now you have 16 x 30 meters reach :) That would be cool though. Maybe expand the PDA functions a bit more?

<br/>
Things I'd like to see in an extended firmware:
<br/>
<br/>
- From what I understand about Flashme firmware (I haven't run any DS homebrew yet, I'm afraid...) it boots from the GBA slot automatically if there's a Passme-specific GBA header on the GBA slot.  I prefer to boot to the menu and then launch my game (which can be done, as I understand, by holding select at boot time...) but from what I understand Passme can't boot DS homebrew from the menu screen.  I'd like to be able to boot DS stuff from the GBA slot, from the DS menu screen, and have any options related to auto-booting from the GBA slot respect what's selected in prefs.
<br/>
- Proper support for card ejection/insertion events when at the menu screen (I believe that's possible, right?)
<br/>
- If the config and pictochat apps are replaced, provide the ability to exit back to the main menu without reset.
<br/>
<br/>
The relay-mode Pictochat sounds interesting, but unlikely to be backward-compatible...  And the whole point of Pictochat is that everyone has it, so if you're in a room with a bunch of DS users in a situation where people are more likely to be chatting than playing games, you can go chat with a high degree of confidence that there'll be people there to talk to.  People in that situation may not even think to look for a WMB-download of an alternate chat program, and if they do, there's still the problem that we wouldn't be able to WMB-broadcast a pictochat replacement to people with stock DSes.
<br/>
<br/>
I adore the notion of having more Wi-Fi capabilities at the menu.  A WEP cracker integrated with Wi-Fi setup would be quite handy.  :)
<br/>
<br/>
It's all fun to think about - but for now I'll be quite happy just getting WMB/beacontest and Flashme set up and playing homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC
<br/>
I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.
<br/>
Thank you, everyone, I look forward to taking advantage of your work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought about the whole menu-shuts-down-system thing a while ago. It seems to me that this is required due to the way it loads the programs. However, it might be possible to fake it... is there any way to soft-reboot the DS? (That is, your code can reset everything, back to the health screen and logo, as if you'd just turned it off and on again.) You could add a 'bypass' bit (stored in the firmware) in the startup sequence, that if this bit is set, clear it and jump straight to the main menu rather than starting the game or showing the logo/health screen. Then hack the soft-shutdown routines used by these programs to instead set the bit and soft-reboot, and it looks just as if it went back to the menu. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Also on the subject of new features, one thing I think would rock and be really easy to do is to change some text. That is, when you boot up without a GBA game, at the bottom it says 'no game pak inserted'. I'd like to be able to change that text to have like my name or something in it. It'd provide a pretty easy way to identify the system if it were ever lost or stolen. And you could show it off. :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Now let's see. We all want to start a custom written FW project, right (at least some of us)?
<br/>
<br/>
I've searched the forums for suggestions and ideas and put them on a list:
<br/>
<br/>
- Basic PDA functions (calendar, notes, alarm)
<br/>
- Calculator
<br/>
- Custom splashscreen (healthscreen)
<br/>
- WiFi HotSpot finding, Nintendo WFC setting editor, WPA support (if possible)
<br/>
- Pictochat P2P (that's a idea of mine - if two persons with DSs are to far away to chat, but one DS is in the middle of them, they still could do it via the one between them, I hope you understand)
<br/>
- Password protection
<br/>
- Recovery code (a must)
<br/>
- Extendable FW functions using GBAmp/g6/m3/supercard FW space
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Things I'd like to see in an extended firmware:
<br/>
<br/>
- From what I understand about Flashme firmware (I haven't run any DS homebrew yet, I'm afraid...) it boots from the GBA slot automatically if there's a Passme-specific GBA header on the GBA slot.  I prefer to boot to the menu and then launch my game (which can be done, as I understand, by holding select at boot time...) but from what I understand Passme can't boot DS homebrew from the menu screen.  I'd like to be able to boot DS stuff from the GBA slot, from the DS menu screen, and have any options related to auto-booting from the GBA slot respect what's selected in prefs.
<br/>
- Proper support for card ejection/insertion events when at the menu screen (I believe that's possible, right?)
<br/>
- If the config and pictochat apps are replaced, provide the ability to exit back to the main menu without reset.
<br/>
<br/>
The relay-mode Pictochat sounds interesting, but unlikely to be backward-compatible...  And the whole point of Pictochat is that everyone has it, so if you're in a room with a bunch of DS users in a situation where people are more likely to be chatting than playing games, you can go chat with a high degree of confidence that there'll be people there to talk to.  People in that situation may not even think to look for a WMB-download of an alternate chat program, and if they do, there's still the problem that we wouldn't be able to WMB-broadcast a pictochat replacement to people with stock DSes.
<br/>
<br/>
I adore the notion of having more Wi-Fi capabilities at the menu.  A WEP cracker integrated with Wi-Fi setup would be quite handy.  :)
<br/>
<br/>
It's all fun to think about - but for now I'll be quite happy just getting WMB/beacontest and Flashme set up and playing homebrew.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I agree completely. These seem like more rudimentary things that <span style="font-style: italic">should</span> be done on the firmware level. A calendar, calculator, and wifi tools would be very nice (maybe even a web browser?), although all of those could probably make for better homebrew projects (there's already a TI-85 emulator). And extendable firmware functions to a flashcart seems like it would require the flashcart to be permanently connected to the DS. I'm also not sure how they would differ from just running a DS app to provide the function instead. That's what homebrew is all about, is it not? That way, there can be more than one of the same kind of app so people can have a little variety if they desire. The firmware, however, I'd prefer to be from a single source and built for reliability of the DS operation on only a rudimentary level. This isn't Windows here. I'd hate to see it get overrun and bloated by "features".<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh yeah and we need to add a kitchen sink. Seriously, as cool as it would be to have a calculator, notepad, web browser, WEP cracker, toaster etc built right in, keep in mind that there's not a whole lot of space for firmware. Also the more we change it, the more we risk breaking compatibility with both commerical and existing homebrew games. Current versions of FlashMe will automatically boot whatever loader you have on the CF/SD card or flash cart (unless you hold select). Just write a loader that does all these things, maybe a simple OS. :p You could even make it look like the Nintendo firmware. Heck, if Moonshell had the option to boot the currently inserted DS/GBA game (GBA so I can use the GBAMP's built-in features), I'd practically never need to go into the main menu. (And since it can load a .nds from the flashcart, it probably wouldn't be difficult to just put one in the root directory that does these things.)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not criticizing you guys for having such wild ideas, after all, that's what makes life interesting. (And some of these ideas are pretty damn good.) Just keep in mind the limitations you'd have to work around. Like I said, it'd be a lot easier to just put all the functions you want into a .nds and make it the startup program (_BOOT_MP.nds or whatever your cart uses), with basically the same effect.
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Pictochat relay, though, that gives me an idea. I'm guessing 'hell no' but since DS can decrypt the WMB apps, could it encrypt them too? So once we have a program running on our own DS, we can encrypt WMB apps and send them to others with non-modified firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That would be a lot more helpful to be able to actually configure that information without having to insert a gamepack each time. I would have thought that Nintendo would have used the WiFi enabled games to add a configuration menu to the DS itself and just access said menu through the games, instead of the other way around. Makes me wonder if that means that some games later on will have more advanced WiFi features.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

With all the advancement being done with the DS WiFi libraries, could it be possible to connect 2 to 4 flashed DSes via WiFi and emulate a GBA link cable connection? That way, when you launch the GBA game, it thinks the DSes are wired to each other for GBA multiplayer. It seems like it would need to be done on the firmware level, I just wonder if it would even be possible. I also know that the WiFi libraries are still being worked on, but it seems like remarkable progress is being made on them. Perhaps this could be possible?
<br/>
<br/>
And while on the subject, I know it's probably been mentioned before, but would it be possible to use the Y and B buttons for B and A respectively in GBA games? Or is this not possible due to how the buttons are connected to the ARM7 and ARM9 chips?<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

I wonder about GBA mode and the X/Y buttons though. Couldn't you have some loader just set up everything the way GBA games expect it to be, put ARM9 to sleep (or have it run code from parts of RAM that aren't used in GBA mode) and just have the ARM7 jump to the GBA game's start address? It wouldn't be <span style="font-style: italic">exactly</span> the same but I'd think most games would run fairly well. Homebrew games could then be coded to access DS hardware when it's present, maybe existing games hacked to swap buttons. (Though I wonder if SWI calls would work anymore.)
<br/>
<br/>
For that matter, can whatever the hardware does to enter GBA mode be emulated? Do it all the same, but don't disable this or that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA mode switch is a single bit, which triggers some sort of internal state machine, and then invokes a virtually unmodified GBA BIOS.  There are no half measures.  It shuts down the ARM9, remaps one of the 2D cores to capture video from a *3rd* 2D core that works like the GBA did (conjecture, but considering the way the borders work, a well founded one), maps in GBA compatible sound hardware, changes register behavior, half-clocks the CPU, etc...
<br/>
<br/>
More reasons:
<br/>
<br/>
Timing is wrong (video, cpu speed, and timers), screen resolution is wrong, video modes aren't the same, ARM7 can't access OAM, palettes, etc...  GBC compat sound channels are missing, swis are different.
<br/>
<br/>
Give me time and I could come up with half a dozen other problems.
<br/>
<br/>
I still don't understand how come people care so much about remapping the buttons, it's 5 minutes of playing to retrain your hand to deal with it (and after all, the GBA had B A in the same order as the DS, or as the NES for that matter, just at a slightly different inclination).
<br/>
<br/>
If you really must do it, it's a hardware hack.  No software short of a full GBA emulator is going to do it, and a GBA emulator on the DS is absurd on a couple of levels.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat
