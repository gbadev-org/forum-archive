    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I am new, and want to send homebrew content to my Nintendo DS. It is an original DS, I got it the day it came out. I downloaded the wmb files, but I cant get them to run. I have a Linksys WMP54G v4.1 PCI wireless card, and Fedora 7 Linux identifies it as having the RaLink RT2561/RT61 chipset. How do I get this to work?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If it's a Ralink chipset, you should be able to use WiFiMe to install FlashMe, but I think that involves a Windows driver, so you'll need to use a Windows PC with a Ralink chipset or dual-boot Linux and Windows (not hard, I dual boot Windows and Ubuntu on most of my PC's).  Though, I don't have any Ralink chipset devices, just Broadcom :( so I don't know how to use WiFiMe.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was under the impression that as Flashme isn't signed so it needs some form of Slot-1 solution to install it.  I think with WifiMe and an unflashed DS you can only successfully send official Nintendo demo's that have been signed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought FW's 1 to 3 had an exploit that let WiFiMe install homebrew or FlashMe.  He says his DS was from release day (I got mine release week, but haven't flashed it) so it should have the exploit.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
