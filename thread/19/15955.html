    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Trying to build a download station for my son and seem to be 95% there.  I have my NIC installed, driver loaded, launch wmb and specify my .nds file.  The final like in the window states:
<br/>
<br/>
Sending multiboot beasons &amp; waiting for authentication
<br/>
<br/>
I turn on the DS, it detects the demo,  I click on it.
<br/>
<br/>
"Would you like to download this software?" - Yes
<br/>
<br/>
Downloading.....
<br/>
<br/>
approx 1/2 second later
<br/>
<br/>
"Communication Error, Download not Competed"
<br/>
<br/>
The DOS window never shows the auth acknowledged like I have seen in screen shots.  It's as if my NIC is sending but not recieving.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Try checking the Device Manager. Right click on My Computer on the desktop, then click Properties. Click on the hardware tab, then click on Device Manager. Do you see a Nintendo DS icon for the WMB driver? Click on the plus tab next to that icon, and double click on the item that appears. Check if Windows detects any problems. Next, click the driver tab, then click Uninstall Driver. After the driver is uninstalled, reinstall the driver with the instructions you followed. I guess the instructions you followed was <a class="postlink" href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php" target="_blank">this?</a>
<br/>
<br/>
But before doing the reinstall, try this, as said on that tutorial:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>'WifiMe'/WMB driver install tutorial wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">
<br/>
Q: I am pretty sure my card is on that list, but the driver still isn't working.  What now?
<br/>
<br/>
A: Download PCItree.  Make sure to read the directions and copy HLP.SYS to the correct folder.
<br/>
     Launch pcitree.exe and make sure the VID/PID is 1814/0201.  (screenshot)
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Don't try doing the reinstall if the VIP/PID doesn't match the VID/PID in the quote/tutorial Q&amp;A.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
