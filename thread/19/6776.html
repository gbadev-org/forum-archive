Ah, so you mean you can send WiFiMe (the PassMe...'simulator') but when you try to upload anything else it does this crash?  How many have you tried?  I was wondering if it was an invalid NDS or something, but when I've tried to send a bad NDS I don't think I ever remember it crashing.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Make sure you have the latest driver (v 1.0.0.8) and latest wmb application (1.4 BETA 1). Open a command prompt and find the folder containing wmb.exe. Then type "<span style="font-weight: bold">wmb.exe -data (.nds file)</span>"and put a ".nds" game name at "game" .eg- "<span style="font-weight: bold">wmb.exe -data demo.nds</span>" . Make sure you put that ".nds" file in the data folder.
