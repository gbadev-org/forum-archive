    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just purchased NDS Lite.  Picked up R4.  Updated the firmware no prob with version 1.18.  Installed moonshell 1.71 on card with no prob.  I boot up NDS lite and I see r4 version 1.18 and I see moonshell 1.71.  I have converted files with the built in DPG tool and I have converted files with Batchdpg (various versions).  All my files were AVI music videos.  All the conversions work fine.  I see my DPG file when I am done.  I then drag and drop my DPG file onto my SD card.  Insert it in my NDS lite.  I see the file.  Everytime I hit the file or video to play, I get an ERROR MESSAGE. It says, "this type of file currently not allowed to operate".  I have been on the web for over 2 days trying to figure out what I am doing wrong.  Can someone PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME OUT !!!!!!!!!!!   I don't know where else to turn.  My email is <a href="mailto:Lavala62@yahoo.com">Lavala62@yahoo.com</a>.  I will keep my fingers crossed someone reads this and wants to help out a Noobie.  Thank you so much and keep up the great work with this site.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Some very basic advice could be to make sure everything is up to date.  Specifically, Moonshell is up to version 2.x (not sure the exact number) and you'll probably want to use that in combination with videos converted with the version of DPGTools that comes with Moonshell.

Actually wait, before you do that... you are *launching* Moonshell before trying to select the file, right?  As in, you get to the R4 menu (which is itself Moonshell based I think), but navigate to the "Moonshell.nds" file, launch it, and then use THAT file browser to select the *.dpg file, correct?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
