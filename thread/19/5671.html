<br/>
I'm currently searching for a hacked firmware for the supercard that can disable the menu, so I can use it with WiFiMe...

I think that the supercard works like the darkfader's CF Adapter, so if someone can help me, post...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I someone can hack a Supercard firmware and make it that the supercard doesn't have a Bootloader Menu,  i think that there can be opportunities to make it works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">there's only 2 ways that a supercard could work w/ ds homebrew: (as far as i can see)
<br/>
1. you put your homebrew program in place of the loader/firmware (not on a CF card)
<br/>
2. you write your own firmware/loader that runs in DS mode and loads from the CF card, and replace the built in loader/firmware with this one.
<br/>
<br/>
number 2 would be fairly difficult, you'd have to reverse engineer the current firmware to see how it accesses the CF card, as i don't believe there is any documentation on it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
you only have to take the .gba version and rename it to .nds ...
<br/>
ScummVm, DSlinux, Moonshell, TickleGirl, ... it all works fine without extra ndsloader.
<br/>
Only saving (e.g. in ScummVm) is a little tricky ( Quickly restart the DS ).<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my bad English, Im German...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
