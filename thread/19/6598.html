    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All 32-bit PCMCIA cards use the CardBus protocol. But in fact CardBus is just PCI in a smaller form factor, in the same way that CompactFlash is just ATA in a smaller form factor. I can't guarantee so, but my educated guess is that the steps should be about the same.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The steps are the same, since installing a driver for a PCI card or PCMCIA card are practically the same. Manufacturers usually supply an install cd-rom that will automatically install the driver (often along with monitor software and the like).
<br/>
<br/>
In the case of wifime, the driver by Firefly is a basic driver and nothing else. You simply point windows to the directory containing the extracted files when Windows detects the new hardware. In the case of an upgrade (going from version 1.0.0.7 to 1.0.0.8 for example) you need to go into Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;System-&gt;Hardware-&gt;Device Manager. Find the driver under "Network adapters", under the Driver tab, select Update Driver...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I managed to get the driver working on another computer with a Belkin F5D7000 PCI card without any problem.  However after plugging in the PCMCIA card and selecting the driver, I get an error saying Windows could not find suitable software to install the driver.  
<br/>
<br/>
No previous driver for the card was installed, though in the process of trying to get it to work, I did install the manufacturer's driver, and the wireless card worked.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Some revisions of Belkin F5D7010 have a broadcom chipset.  You need a card with rt2560 chipset.  You have to be careful when buying a card from that list with a * next to it.
<br/>
<br/>
* - chipset depends on card revision/version (could be Accton, ADMtek, Agere, Atheros, Atmel, Broadcom, Conexant/GlobespanVirata/Intersil/Harris/PRISM, Envara, Inprocomm, Intel, Marvell, Realtek, SiS, Texas Instruments, VIA, ZyDAS or some other voodoo).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
