    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I currently own a Flash Advance 512 and am looking to upgrade.  I am drawn to the Super Card SD for its ability to have a huge amount of storage space, but is this a good choice or not?  I will most likely be using FlashMe on the DS with this cart if this means anything.  Also where is a good place to buy in the US?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have a couple GBA flash cards, but i want a one card solution to run both gba and NDS homebrew, have large storage capacity, and it wouldn't hurt to have some Mp3's on there too.
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about the M3 card, but is it really all that much better than the movie player?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

SuperCard and other CF/RAM combo cards are currently the only thing that can load Nintendo DS and large GBA programs without swapping or rewriting cards.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Could you elaborate a little more on this?  I am starting to lean toward the M3 after doing some checking last night.  It seems the CF version of the M3 should be in stock soon at Divineo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"Movies" can't exactly be full-screen on the GBA, which has a 3:2 screen, or the Nintendo DS, which has a 4:3 screen. On the GBA, a 16:9 movie plays in 240x136 pixels, with 12 pixels at the top and bottom lost to letterboxing. On the Nintendo DS, you might get 256x144 pixels. Or you could use the full frame/pan and scan edits, but especially on movies produced before home video revived production for 4:3, that cuts off a lot of important parts of the picture. The PSP, on the other hand, plays in 240x136 scaled to fit the 480x272 screen (for movies on Memory Stick) or 480x272 (for UMD movies).
<br/>
<br/>
TV shows, on the other hand, would fit the DS screen, as they're produced for the 4:3 ratio of low-end TVs from day one.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
