    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">PassCard 2 is probably either a PassMe2 <span style="font-style: italic">with a built-in authentic game chip</span> or a NoPass. Advantage over PassMe2 is that 1. it doesn't depend on which DS games you already own, and 2. you don't have to run the risk of bricking a DS Lite while trying to flash it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
