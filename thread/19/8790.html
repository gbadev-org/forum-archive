    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to know which card is best to use with PassMe2 (maybe M3?). I don't know. I need one that supports Compact Flash cards and works very good and is less expensive than some other ones. Also, I should install new firmware onto Nintendo DS unit using it and then still load software from it. Can the shell menu on the M3 be replaced by adding a _BOOT_MP.nds file to it? Other cards I know you can, this one I'm not sure. Anyway, is it possble to add function to DS firmware code to read file from it, make better compatibility?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have a M3/CF.  I renamed MoonShell to _BOOT_MP.nds once, and that doesn't replace the default M3's shell.  I think M3 plans to replace their own shell with MoonShell though, not sure if they will implement the _BOOT_MP.nds mechanism by then.
<br/>
<br/>
Chishm's FAT driver does support M3/CF right now.  So it is better supported than the SD format.  But M3 is definitely not on the cheap side.  I like my M3, but I don't have any other flash cards to compare it to right now.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

SuperCard CF should do. It's nearly as well understood as the old standby GBAMP v2 CF.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't want to use MoonShell, the reason I want to replace it is so it will run the program automatically without entering a shell. Now I have Supercard CF (well, I ordered it, it should come in the mail). If Supercard CF doesn't support that function, I would need a code on my new FWNITRO firmware that can search for _BOOT_MP.nds and if it exists, start it automatically without entering the shell. Although what would probably work better, is if the shell can be changed in the SuperCard CF, it can be changed to simply look for a file called _BOOT_MP.nds and execute it.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
