Yeah, I reckon I know how to do this - you'd need to use the PU and some exception handlers to get this to work. You'd be better off writing some kind of network DLDI driver which accessed a remote filesystem in order to fetch the data files required by the program. This wouldn't allow you to stream an executable though...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can't run a program without at least some of it being in memory. If you used exception handlers, only a small part of the program would be in memory.
<br/>
If you used a network DLDI the whole program would be in memory, but the data files would be on another machine. This would be an alternative to using a program with an appended filesystem, like ticklegirl.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

"Network DLDI"? You mean a DLDI driver that reads and writes a FAT-formatted block device over TCP, like an <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISCSI" target="_blank">iSCSI</a> initiator? Under iSCSI, you might have to devote a separate partition of your PC's hard drive to your DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Another solution is a separate file system (not libfat) that could mount an NFS, CIFS, HTTP, or FTP server as a drive, much like KDE's kioslave system. For instance, it would mount <a href="http://192.168.192.168" target="_blank">http://192.168.192.168</a> as a drive and then translate

Your downloader app would probably mount the server as "http1:/" and the memory card as "fat:/".
<br/>
<br/>
fopen() is not a libfat function. It's a newlib function, which calls libfat through a function pointer table called "devoptab" that gets populated when you mount a file system. There would be no problem with simultaneously mounting a FAT volume in SLOT-1 as "fat1:/", a FAT volume in SLOT-2 as "fat2:/", an HTTP server at 192.168.192.168 as "http1:/", and an HTTP server at 10.3.2.1 as "http2:/", as long as they have different drive letters.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Nah, I was thinking more like a flat file on a remote system which you access as a filesystem (like a loop block device in Linux). The network protocol wouldn't be http, just some custom DS hoo-ha :-)

BTW I'm too lazy to write this, so all this chat is pretty academic! It would be really interesting to do though. Where would you put the wifi init code? In the DLDI driver?

What about a slower (internet connection speeds) connection?

I mean, I could see a sweet server based front end that "we" have been talking about for a long time that would allow you to browse all the homebrew available, and then stream that homebrew to the DS.

<br/>
In theory, the DS should be able to download at ~256KB/sec, right?  Or did I do the math wrong?

2Mb x 1024 = 2048Kb

Minus overhead of TCP/IP, etc.

I see it as object-oriented in a way: multiple implementations (FAT, HTTP) of the same interface (open, read, write, close). Should people have to call different functions to read from FAT or NTFS or ext2? Heck, Microsoft Windows already implements this for CIFS and has done so since Windows 95.

Look, FAT NTFS ext2 are all local filesystems that more or less have the same interface. HTTP or any other networking protocol, does not work the same and to make it transparent would be plain stupid. (Think PALib. Easy, but stupid.) Documentating it well, still would not make any difference because it's just stupid code design.

Well, okay, you do...

Still, it would be cool, although rather pointless...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Isn`t DLDI used for accessing raw sectors? And not the filesystem? Of course I suppose fatlib could deal with it, but it`s not really suited for this. I have written something similiar with use of devoptab. It`s still have some speed issues (writing/reading) mainly because of newlib voodoo tricks, like transparently breaking all the reads/writes in 1KB sizes. 
<br/>
I`m thinking about releasing it as library when I`ll have this problem solved.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
