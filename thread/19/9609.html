    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, ive been looking for a while to a question ive had, didn't find it, so i figured i'd ask myself.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to use the DS to send a WMB signal?? the reason i ask, i have a cardbus card thats compatable with the hacked Ralink driver, but after a few months of use all i get now is an error code 12, no matter what i try i cant get it working. i have 2 flashcarts, a F2AU 1G cart and a M3 Mini SD cart. 
<br/>
<br/>
Im trying to run FlashMe on a friends DS. i was just wondering if with my hacked DS if i could send a Wifime code to her DS, then run Flashme with the other cart??
<br/>
<br/>
also if anybody else has had an error code 12 problem with their Msi Cardbus cards
<br/>
<br/>
any ideas would be really appreicated</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's possible but the software hasn't been made yet.  Wifime also only works on old DS firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
I have an MSI cardbus card but I haven't had that error before.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i wonder if somebody were to tweak the data in a game that sends a multiboot signal, like tetris ds or meteos, with their own code, maybe you'd be able to transmit homebrew that way... makes me wana get my hex editor :P, but i dont even know where to start when it comes to finding the location of the WMB file in the game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Modifying second and subsequent stages of a multi-stage loader is called WiFiMe2, and nobody seems to have the time to investigate this.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
