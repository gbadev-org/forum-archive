    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i saw the compatibilitylist (http://ralink.rapla.net/), and checked if the usb connector i wanted to buy was compatible, it thought it needed a RT2500 chipset, but couldn't find if mine had it, so can you guys tell me if mine is compatible, cause i think it's kinda weird that so little sticks are compatible out of all the sticks a company makes, well, they said double check so i'll let you guys do it, here the stick i want to buy:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Note that the list at <a href="http://ralink.rapla.net" target="_blank">http://ralink.rapla.net</a> isn't a compatibility list for WiFiMe's WMB utility, it's just a list of adaptors that use the RT2500 chipset.  The WiFiMe driver doesn't work with USB adaptors, but it is expected to work on anything PCI or PCMCIA-based from the Ralink list.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice, for sure, to have a driver for the USB adaptors for the people who use Windows and want to do WMB...  Much more convenient to plug in a USB device rather than a PCI device, and less wasteful in a sense - it has been requested numerous times already.  Tim (author of WiFiMe and the WMB.exe utility) seems not to be interested in doing it, though, and one shouldn't expect other people to do that kind of work-on-request without some kind of compensation.  So probably if you want that functionality you have to do it yourself or else just keep waiting.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus, the adaptor you listed (Sweex LC100040) isn't on the Ralink list.  The Sweex LC100060 is.  The LC100040 is on the Zydas list.
<br/>
<br/>
On Linux the story is a little different.  The WMB utility for Linux is working (though not quite perfectly, it seems - and it can't perform a WiFiMe exploit yet) and its ability to work depends mostly (I think) on your ability to set the right mode to your WiFi card.  It seems one can get USB adaptors to work under Linux, but it may be a bit fiddly and it most likely does depend on your adaptor having a particular chipset that's well-behaved in terms of doing what it's told.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, this is a FAQ.  I don't think it accomplishes much to give people a hard time for re-asking FAQ's (I'm just as <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=8062" target="_blank">guilty</a> of that <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=8023" target="_blank">sometimes</a>), but assuming you're working on Windows, the answer to this question is certainly out there...  Have you read the WiFiMe tutorial?

I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.
<br/>
Thank you, everyone, I look forward to taking advantage of your work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
