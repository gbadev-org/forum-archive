    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A drill will also take care of the trick..  But, before you go that far, you can get "stripped screw" removers.  Basically, they look like a screw that is threaded backwords.  So, when you are turning it, it is digging into the head of the screw, but you are turning it the direction to remove the screw.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I'd gently pry the battery cover upwards/outwards while unscrewing the screw. That'll get it off. Then you may want to use some threadlock (the kind that doesn't permanently lock it) and put the screw back in.<br/>_________________<br/>2 x Enamel Blue DS lites V5, V7 FW whatever

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I stripped a screw inside a PowerBook once.
<br/>
The easiest way was to just superglue something to the screw and undo it (i think i glued a cheap hexagonal bit to it).
<br/>
But it was only a heatsheild screw so it didn't matter so much.
<br/>
If you can find a replacement screw then use glue.
<br/>
Or you could use glue while you unscrew and screw the screw and then try and break it off once you've screwed it back in.
