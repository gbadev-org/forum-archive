Furthermore could an extra 128Mb or any other size be added to so that the DS could participate in other activites such as a slightly better SNES emulator or such.<br/>_________________<br/>If anyone needs a dragonball online email me @ <a href="mailto:aaronthejester@hotmail.com">aaronthejester@hotmail.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA slot can't address more than 32MB and that's more than enough to hold a few SNES games.  I really don't think soldering more RAM onto the Opera cart is practical, best to just buy a 32MB RAM cart.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can blame Windows poor usage of the swapfile for this particular urban myth.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">having more memory will make a system faster if there is more data than will fit in memory at one time. if you need to read from disk all the time because you can not cache it in memory than having more memory will make your program/system faster. in the case of windows it will prevent the virtual memory from paging physical memory to or from disk as often.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

...at any given time.  You could bank switch.

Yes, swapping to disk slows things down.  The GIMP freaked out and issued a warning when I tried to scale the image to a size that would require 58.5GB by mistake.  Aside from not actually working, that would have been an extremely slow operation to carry out; I only have 2GB of RAM.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That was an idea I had a while ago, to have 32+ MB on the cartridge, but only maybe 1MB mapped at a time. An OS could use it as a sort of fake MMU (each app gets one or more 1MB pages that can be swapped in at the same address).<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

that is quite sure, but i guess buying a M3 perfect or such (which embedds 32MB) is much better than the trouble to mod opera rom caridge... (might be a fun diy project trough...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
