    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am seriously thinking about getting a M3 adapter + passkey.
<br/>
<br/>
My question is: Is the M3 compatibile with all DS homebrew? Or most? If not all what are some examples of homebrew that doesnt work.
<br/>
<br/>
I am very interested in trying out the Heretic port and other similar ports.
<br/>
ScummVM, and just any other homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
also I hear a new version of the passkey is comming out soon, and it will support the newest firmware version DS's. However I have an orignal Silver DS (bought it a few weeks after launch) So I'm not worried about compatability with passme devices right now, but I was also wondering if once I get Mario Kart DS and connect to the Nintendo WIFI service, will Mario Kart or the online service update my firmware like new PSP games do?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

no it doesnt, and update 4 is the first update unfortunately so you cant downgrade it back to the original.  like i said it would only take 5 seconds to fix the compatability problem.  I think someone with a little more influence than me(tepples?) could do with spreading the word about this, credits though to pepsiman for coming up with the idea (the g6 has the same problem).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The M3 cannot play a lot of homebrew, there is a partial list on the M3 wiki at <a href="http://leo.rampen.ca/m3wiki/index.php/M3_homebrew_compatibility" target="_blank">http://leo.rampen.ca/m3wiki/index.php/M3_homebrew_compatibility</a>

Edit: I only have E04, E06 and E08 in my back archives (I think) I'm going to search my computer and see if I can find it.

Edit again: Unfortunately, I cleared out my temp files, where I think it would be, a few weeks ago :(

You talking about the SD version?  That's the same as the current one except it will use SD cards instead of compact flash.  SD cards are potentially somewhat faster than compact flash, so there may be some kind of benefits that way.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
