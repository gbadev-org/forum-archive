    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys I have one question. I know that there are different firmwares of DS on the market. Some of them can be used for home brew some maybe not (maybe everything can be used with the correct pass key).
<br/>
<br/>
Can you help me to choose the correct firmware? And how I suppose to recognize it, I know that some guys usualy says what is the color of their DS (red or not). Is this the way to recognize it?
<br/>
<br/>
I have some flash equipment from my GBA. I have M3 adapter SD + passkey (version 1). If there is something general changed in the lastest firmwares but thay will not work with my passkey. It's not a problem to take a new passkey or passme or whatever.
<br/>
<br/>
Just recomendme how to choose my DS and do I need to order a new pass key?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are really lucky, you can still pick up an older generation DS. Buying the colored ones (except the electric blue) will automatically force you to buy PassME2. Which may happen anyways.
<br/>
<br/>
You can't really recognize DS' firmware until you actualy use it. If you want better chances, get a silver one.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: My bad ... You won't need to buy PassKey2 since reprogramming v1 it to v2 is fairly simple :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK. So it looks like I need to buy this PassME2. It's not a problem I just don't want to use a "force power" to make it work.
<br/>
<br/>
If I understand correct PassMe2 doens't support the firmware of the electric blue. 
<br/>
<br/>
What I need to order to not make any strange hacks on my DS. Can I just use any DS (not the electric blue) with PassMe2 like I use my M3 adapter in the GBA? Without any strange hacks, reflash, opening my DS, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
yes according to what i read all over
<br/>
is all you need :P
<br/>
suggest you flash your DS
<br/>
because you have to re program your Passme2
<br/>
and the Sram your in flashkart
<br/>
everytime you use a new nds game in the passme
<br/>
<br/>
...
<br/>
so flash it baby, flash it<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

Thanks for the answers guys.

My last question:) Is there a way to run homebrew on DS without flashing the DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, put the passme2 in everytime you want to run homebrew. I can give you a thousand different reasons why you should flash it, it takes up less battery not having a passme inserted, you dont have a big thing sticking out of the ds, you have a recovery method if your ds dies. I was a bit reluctant at first to flash it, but trust me its extremely easy to do, its like so easy a 10 year old could do it. Just make sure the battery doesnt fall out when flashing and follow the instructions, you'd be an idiot not to flash</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Although you void your warranty. If you use M3, you don't need to mess with that SRAM stuff anymore once you have done it.

<br/>
It is possible to use the DS without flashing, but it's certainly easier if you do it. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tip: Certain sizes of screw will fit snugly into the SL1 hole and can be screwed right in for a guaranteed secure connection. Just be careful not to screw it in far enough to damage the board. (Just do it while the installer is running, and keep turning until it starts.) Then all you have to do is hold the battery in and watch it flash. :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sure it is.  The law just can't be enforced (right away).
