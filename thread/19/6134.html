    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I have been trying most of this afternoon to get the firmware flashed on my DS. First off, I have a wireless card that allows me to run the official nintendo wireless demos.
<br/>
<br/>
So far I have done this:
<br/>
<br/>
- combined ndsloader.bin with flashme.ds.gba (and I have tried not combining them and just using flashme.ds.gba) and then flashed to my F2A Ultra 512Mb card using F2A Usb 11
<br/>
- Then on the DS menu, I select the option to run game from GBA Cart
<br/>
- I then get the GameBoy logo and then a blank white screen
<br/>
<br/>
I am really stuck and have tried other things but am lost. I have searched this forum and visited the various sites relating to this but I am still having difficulty. 
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,
<br/>
<br/>

You shouldn't do that. Instead, Use WifiMe or Passme.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

From <a href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/:" target="_blank">http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/:</a>

"Download the installation file and flash it on a GBA flashcard and boot it using PassMe or WifiMe. Also available as an nds file for when your firmware is homebrew WMB capable already."
<br/>
<br/>
I'm unsure what to do from here (and have tried several times)? I have flashed flashme.ds.gba to my cart. I'm now confused at how to boot this using WifiMe?
<br/>
<br/>
Note: If I try to Wifi the flashme.nds file, it loads and then when I select it on my DS I get the black nintendo logo which begins to fade and then freezes having faded slightly...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if u downloaded the ds.gba version u dont need to combine with the loader, only the plain nds file.  burn as is but if i were u id flash with ac plugged in. positioning the sl1 short for the first time could take a bit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Did you setup WifiMe? Can you put homebrew on your flashcart and run it using WifiMe? And I don't mean sending the file. if you have wifime setup , just run it without sending any files, so it does the same thing as passme.  
<br/>
1)Put the flashme.ds.gba on your flashcart.
<br/>
2) Put it in your DS, and run wifime from your pc(without sending files)
<br/>
3) On your DS, go to download play, you should see one thing called wifime. Run it. After, the flashme program will boot.
<br/>
4) Use instructions to flash your DS.

Sorry if I didn't make something clear, as I don't have WifiMe myself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's strange. I don't know why I'm finding this so hard.
<br/>
Ok so I have done everything up to step 2. The problem is WMB.exe requires the -data param to run. So once again I'm sorry but I am stumped. 
<br/>
<br/>
PS: Thank you for the information on bridging SL1 etc.

If you have the WMB setup right, and your SuperCard is updated already from GBA mode (You DO need a retail/origional DS slot type game for the SuperCard to boot to its menu in DS mode or all you will see is the nintendo logo in an oval or a white screen of death) you should get the SuperCard menu, from which you can boot the flashme.ds.gba (rename it to flashme.nds for the SuperCard)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
