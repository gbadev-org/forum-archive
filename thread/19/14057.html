    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Im sort of a begginer on ds things, but I do know the basics, and I am starting in a project that can send large files over wifi.  I have a 64M falsh cartrige, and am looking for a larger size, but for the mean time I am looking for a solution application that can open larger nds homebrew games(DSDoom,ticklegirl) over wifi and play them. Can anyone shed some light?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as I can tell, DS_BoY wants some way to mount a folder on the PC over Wi-Fi as a DS file system. It's doable in theory (mount a CIFS in devoptab), but it would be even slower than the Games n' Music, and it appears nobody has the motivation to implement CIFS on the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thats right :) just how slow is the Games n' Music?  If you mean like a download time thats ok, but im not sure about a lag in the gameplay, like tepples said in theory i could mount a seperate part of my hard drive or even a full unused hard drive partition to the ds filesystem and then mayby by modding the DLDI a bit make a file transfer application that after parsing the files in said filesystem executes bit by bit,  ..right???</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe a wifi DLDI driver?
<br/>
Even still every app would need to have wifi code in their arm7 binary.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DSFTP turns the DS into an FTP server, allowing it to send data to and from a PC in the same network your wireless network it, I'm sure that it can be done in reverse, but its very slow,
<br/>
<br/>
and also, i have a 2 gig, and the smallest size you logically buy is 128mb, which is PLENTY. So what indeed is the purpose?<br/>_________________<br/>laos,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually it does seem like a pretty cool idea to me. I'm totally spoiled on sending .nds files over wmb, so I rarely play games that require me to swap cards around to copy files. If you could just wmb and then connect back to the PC for game data, you wouldn't even need a storage device at all.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
