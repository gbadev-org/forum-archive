There are no technical downsides to flashing your DS, however, we cannot be 100% certain that it will not have some effect on future network play. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, Because a passthrough device (like passme) is needed to run "Flashme", and a passthrough device is relatively inexpensive, It seems kind of unlikely that Nintendo would seek to penalize those who flashed their firmware. (being that a passme is easy to come by, and that flashme is SECONDARY to having a passme) 
<br/>
<br/>
Just in case, I am not going to flash my firmware until after Nintendo's wifi network service launches this Fall, and I can be certain that flashme works with it; or until i can be certain that it is possible to restore original firmware.</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm honestly not worried about this.  They haven't show any signs of doing anything like this yet (like Sony has), and even if they do you can just as easily flash your firmware back to the original firmware if you desire.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The only thing they could really do, is detect a flashed firmware, and blacklist your DS.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone know anything about that red DS?  I don't think I've seen this for sale anywhere...at least not yet.  Then again I haven't been to EB in a week or two.  Does WiFiMe work with it?  If so, I'm wondering if it's firmware is different...if it apparently doesn't work with PassMe, that really stinks.  I don't think that's prolly gonna stop anybody from running homebrew for long though.

Well, unless your DS has a unique serial number, like the Microsoft have done with the Xbox.<br/>_________________<br/>Rohaq</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I really dont think that nintendo would block anyone from using DS after this firmware change. They (nintendo) know about Passme, flashme and all the other ME's and they know that it is upgradable now without the contacts closed. I would think they would just force an update on you. hey nintendo probably had a way of updates( without Closing SL1)  before PassMe anyway.

Downgrading means nothing if you're already banned though ;)
<br/>
<br/>
The reason to ban people from using the online service with different firmware is mainly to prevent cheating, although reflashing people's firmware would be much funnier ;)<br/>_________________<br/>Rohaq</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
