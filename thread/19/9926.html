    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi !
<br/>
<br/>
I'v been hanging around here for a while (even asking a nicely answered 
<br/>
question or two :p) and well, the DSLite hits the stores here the 23 june,
<br/>
so I'll by one to test my homebrew code on it :)
<br/>
<br/>
So far I'v used a friends flashed DS and his supercard, but this flash thing
<br/>
seems to be a bit complicated (you have to find someone who can do it for
<br/>
a starter) so I thought that starting the simple way could do it for at least a while.
<br/>
<br/>
So... my question is, is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.yangke-games.com/pack-supercard-superkey-minisd-1gbyte-p-194.html" target="_blank">this</a> the (only) things I need ?
<br/>
<br/>
(Supercard + mini SD + SuperKey)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'v heard that the shop is OK, please tell otherwise :)
<br/>

<br/>
Besides that, everything's correct, if you just want to run homebrew. Be sure that you get the correct version of SuperCard, since it comes in a CF, SD, and the new miniSD type.
<br/>
<br/>
You can also get a PassMe2 instead of the SuperKey, but you'll have to program the SRAM to be the same DS game that you're using for this.
<br/>
<br/>
I suggest flashing it though, it's not really that difficult, even on the DS Lite. I find it more comfortable to have it flashed, but I think that SuperKey might do the trick for you anyways.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unless Superkey is a NoPass, it requires an original game to work. As for sleep mode, I think the problem is with interrupts. When the game goes into sleep mode it sets the interrupt register to wake it up on any hardware event, such as the lid opening or the card being removed. Without a card inserted (or even with some unofficial cards) it fires the "card removed" interrupt right away, then it goes back into sleep mode, over and over forever.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Whoa, nice site! That saves me about 30 EURO compared to where I originally planned on buying a flash cart. A nice 30 EURO I can use to buy an SD card cuz as soon as I add the 3 piece set the lowest shipping is EMS 19,90 and with the 2 piece set I can pick airmail 4,40. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I got some general Supercard questions for ya. Does it play GBC roms? The official site just says GB but maybe they meant the GB series as a whole? I still have some unfinished business with some Zelda games that I can't play on my DS so... Oh and can you just drag your roms to the card or do you have to put them through some converter?

Well that's all. Can't wait to try some of my already developed junk on an actual DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well is it really piracy when I have the original games? Like I said, you can't put GBC titles in a DS but you can emulate them on a DS. But sorry if that counts as piracy. I'm not planning to use my flash cart in illegal ways and mostly for devlopment anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi guys,
<br/>
<br/>
so  where does this max media launcher fit into everything? It replaces the passkey, so all i need is a flashcart (?) or one of these supercards with an sd card? 
<br/>
I know these questons get asked alot and I'm sorry about that, but I have been doing research for a while now and am a bit confused.
<br/>
I basicly want to go the way of the max media launcher but there seems to be sooooo many options to stick in the gba slot! 
<br/>
I guess an option to beef up the storage via some kind of flashcard would be best, so it wouldnt matter if I started with the smallest, cheapest option.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers for any help or links.

The Max Media Launcher is indeed the same thing as the Superkey, Passkey, Passcard or anything else you put into your DS slot. It launches stuff on your GBA flashcard as DS game. Well MagicKey 2 and 3 supposedly can launch DS games without the GBA flashcard cuz it has an SD slot in it. So far the cheapest set I've seen is on the site the TP posted but it depends where you live. Supercard + Superkey + SD/CF card. That's all you need. You could also get a Supercard + Max Media Launcher + SD/CF card but I don't really know why you should. It's called Max MEDIA Launcher so I guess it comes with some multimedia stuff right out of the box. You should check if it's compatible with the Supercard first though. Differences between Passkey and Passcard is that Passcard (just like the Media Launcher) is a Nopass and doesn't require an original DS game thus is normal DS cart size. Same goes for Superkey and Superpass.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One thing that seems nice with the "Supercard + mini SD" is that you
<br/>
can pull out the mini-SD card without removing the Supercard, AFAIK
<br/>
you can't do that with the "normal SD" version.
<br/>
<br/>
So if you want to do homebrew and test a lot, at worst it's the

Supercard or the mini-sd card who gets its contacts all used and not

your precious DS :p
