    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have flashed a DS Phat with flashme 7, and the screen calibration tool is stuck in a loop and will not work.
<br/>
<br/>
I have reflashed with noflashme and flashme 7 again but the problem is still there.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a known fix for this yet as I'm not the only person this has happened to?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've seen the recalibration loop happen on another DS Phat. It has nothing to do with the flashme as far as I am aware as it occured on a non-flashed DS.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem was solved by turning the DS off and checking very carefully around the edge of the screen (the gap between the screen surface and the surrounding plastic) and using a pin to clear out little flecks of dirt. One was big enough to be pressing on the screen and interfering with the calibration.
<br/>
<br/>
Let us all know how it goes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Good to know it's not related to flashme though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>

It's cleaned out around the screen edges and still stuck in the loop.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
