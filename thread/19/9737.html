    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering what tool(s) did you use when bricking your ds lite? Let's try to make a compilation of tools  that DO NOT WORK, and should not be used. This will help out future flashers in picking a tool that will give them better chances not to brick their lite. Also pics would be nice.<br/>_________________<br/>hack it till you make it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're using a screw driver or something, I suggest you either be very careful or wrap everything but the tip in some sort of insulating material as people have suggested doing with things used to flash the DS Lite.  Something small like a paperclip should work, but it might take you awhile to 'hit' the right spot with something like that.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
