    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I'm trying to get started writing DS stuff. So I downloaded devkitARM r21 and ndslib and such, and installed it all, and started noodling around with the examples and such.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, everything works fine in DeSmuMe, but when I load the .nds onto my EZFlash V (running the latest 1.61 firmware), I just get two white screens. This happens with everything I write and all of the given examples. 
<br/>
<br/>
The weird thing is PAlib examples usually work fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know how to fix any of this stuff?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

EZFlash supposedly fixed that a few firmware versions ago, but I suppose it wouldn't hurt to check; they do tend to screw up as many things as they fix each update. I kinda wish I bought an R4 instead, but I wanted GBA homebrew too and the package with the 3-in-1 was so cheap at the time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
