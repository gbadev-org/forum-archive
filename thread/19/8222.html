I could care less about the speed when copying from my computer to the card.  I just want to know if it makes a difference in the supercard CF in the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm pretty sure it does.

Before I burned my Lexar, It was slow as hell, it even had trouble loading some mp3s on moonshell.

With my new SanDisk CF, everything runs so smoothly, I was amazed it was just a 'brand change'.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I've been looking online at different CF cards and can't decide which one to get.....the slow cheaper ones or something slightly more expensive but faster.

<br/>
Does anyone else have any person exlerience that could share?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unless you have a GBA or DS game that streams movies, mp3s, tiles, etc. from CF. For instance, I was planning on porting Luminesweeper to the GBAMP once I got time based on popular demand over at lik-sang.com.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
