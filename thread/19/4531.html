    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it depends.  Because when you send a multiplayer game to the DS it only retains it for a short time.  Perhaps they only use like 2mb of RAM to do this.  Then you might have a limitation with what you can upload to it.  I think the best furture flash cart would be one like XD memory. It is small.  And if it could be made to pop into a little adaptor that goes where the DS game cart goes.  You wouldn't be limited by how many different carts you could have.  Also you would be able to use a generic XD reader/writer to copy the games to.  Just drag the game image file to a drive in My Computer.  I have used the X-Rom.  The little writer utility is a pain to use.  Plus you have to pay for another 512 megabit memory card. When you could just purchase a 64 MegaByte memory card for $30.  64Megabytes equals 512 megabits.  I got suckered when I bought mine.  I thought I was going to be able to put tons of 8MegaByte games on my 512 mb card which isn't 512MegaBytes.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That depends on your definition of "need." Do you really want to have to re-download boot code every time and have everything stored in RAM always?  This means you have to be by your computer when you want use non-official apps/games, and you have no way of permanently storing data, and that all your code and data has to fit into 4MB. We know that DS code can access the GBA slot, so maybe you could use that for permanent storage, but then you still need to load the bootloader wirelessly...not too convenient, to say the least, and kinda defeats the purpose of, say, a PDA app, unless you want to load it, leave your DS on the whole day, and make sure you don't shut it down if you want to use the app again. This WiFi hacking is just baby steps to getting code on the DS, from there we still need other solutions for making something useful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

However, there will come a time where 4MB isn't enough, and streaming at a speed of 2Mb/s (256KB/s) or whatever speed via WIFI/NIFI just won't cut it either. Hopefully at that time some group will have managed to make some sort of flash cart to use on the DS.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But should HK pirates make a DS trojan card that loads code from an existing GBA flash cart, it just might not slow down. Remember that the throughput from a GBA cart (at 3/1 timing) to GBA VRAM is about 11 MBytes/s, compared to 1x DVD-ROM at 1.4 MBytes/s.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Except some sort of virtual memory might be necessary to push the system. Lots of GBA games <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/managing-sprite-vram.txt" target="_blank">load sprite cels from ROM directly to VRAM every frame</a>, and they mix audio using samples loaded directly from ROM. One would imagine that DS games would want to store models and samples in ROM, load them just in time, and cache them in RAM, as on the GameCube.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
There's been talk about not being able to crack the DS Game Cards, that they're too well protected.  But, the wireless seems to be fairly un-protected, and good progress is being made to crack it.  Add in that a DS game can access the GBA slot, here's my idea:  Make a GBA slot device that sends code wireless with a range of 6 inches - low power, hopefully low cost because of small range.  You plug some kind of card into it that can transfer data at 11 Mbps (max speed of 802.11b wireless?) and now three things happen:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Memory becomes inexpensive and readily available (use SD or CF memory cards, or something of that sort)
<br/>
<br/>
2) No more limits, as in don't have to be by computer, and don't have to work with 2 or 4 MB (whatever the DS allows for Multiboot games)
<br/>
<br/>
3) No urgent need to figure out the Game Card.  Yes, it must be done, but at least we will have something to play with!
<br/>
<br/>
So, I don't know how <span style="font-style: italic">practical</span> this is, and chances are it's <span style="font-style: italic">not</span>, as most of my ideas really aren't practical, they're just nifty.
<br/>

How can you be sure that "future employers or publishers" will provide an 802.11b compatible computer on which they will permit you to install the hypothetical DS equivalent of mb.exe (the MBV2 linker software)?

At the moment, with the direction that the community seems headed, I'm guessing that mymateo's suggestion of "a GBA slot device that sends code wireless with a range of 6 inches", which sounds like the DS equivalent of a Xinga Super Memory Stick, would probably work best.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

How can you upload an app wirelessly in the first place if your PC won't take a wireless adapter? Remember that the wireless adapter needs to be a PCI or CardBus card; routers connected to your PC via 100BASE-TX Ethernet don't work because routers assume that layer 3 is always IPv4, not Ni-Fi Layer 3.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I glossed over that point.  Sorry about that.  Buy a new PC?  Not a cheap solution.  Buying a DS flash cart when they become available will probably be cheaper for some parties.  It looks to me like one with a spare PCI slot may be able to get by cheaper at the expense of mobility.
