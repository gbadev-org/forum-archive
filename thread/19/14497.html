    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been thinking about getting these for a while now and since my GBAMP just died I'd like to get at least one ASAP. Anyone have any complaints or praise about these cards? I'm particularly worried about durability and speed (music, videos, and GBA homebrew are among things I intend to use). Are they delicate? Can they stand very cold weather? ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Also does the 3in1 stick out of the Lite? And am I correct in understanding that the Acekard has either 4GB or 8GB (depending on model) of flash ROM built in, that I can just put files on and use like any other card?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As I understand that page, the Acekard file system is not FAT in the same way that ISO 9660, UDF, NTFS, Ext2/3, NitroFS, and Reiser4 are not FAT.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There was an update to Acekard+ for Acekard, which allows cards being formatted in proprietary AKFS as well as FAT (at least that's what the changlog says on that yarr-page, anyways). Its DLDI allows reading and writing according to <a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/" target="_blank">chisms DLDI page</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
But isn't HyperHacker referring to <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=14052" target="_blank">AceKard RPG</a>? At least that's what I would get nowadays. Can't go wrong with a card that offers "open source" firmware and a USB port...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, yes the RPG. I didn't realize there were other products by that name. So it's only 1GB of flash ROM? In that case I probably won't be using it much anyway. My 4GB CF is nearly full as it is, having most of my music collection on it. :-p
<br/>
<br/>
Max card size is 4GB? Odd. Any reason it couldn't support more? If it can do more than 2GB then it must support SDHC, right? O_o<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What bitrate do you use? Through the DS's cheap DAC, I can't really hear a difference between Vorbis at quality 2 and at, say, quality 4. And you can carry more than one card, you know ;-)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Depends on the file, anything from 128kbps to 320kbps MP3, and equivalent for OGG. I don't re-encode for the DS because I'm impatient and some of these files were never in a lossless format. You have a good point about carrying multiple cards though. One for homebrew and music I actually listen to, another for the rest of the music. ;-)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">in my opinion, buying a slot-1 flashcart plus a slot-2 ram card is dumb. just buy a slot-2 cart that does both things, probably save a few $$, and you can keep legend of zelda in your slot-1 :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You'll still need a NoPass card to install FlashMe, and you can get a cheap SLOT-1 flash card for the same price as a typical NoPass.
<br/>
<ul><li>Games n' Music: $20; EZFlash V 3-in-1: $20; microSD writer: included with GnM </li><li>SuperCard miniSD or Lite with SuperKey: $60; SD writer: $10 or more </li></ul>
<br/>
But I will add that a SLOT-2 SD adapter allows easier backup of DS saved games.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
