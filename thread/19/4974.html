No, I wouldn't say that is the case at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Current work is being loaded from the GBA slot, but that is in conjunction with a pass-through device.
<br/>
<br/>
The eventual end result of the work is going to be DS flash cards, no GBA card or pass-through required.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, I'm not sure that's the case.  As ampz mentioned, there's a real issue with cracking the encryption, not to mention the cost of developing a custom IC to emulate that encryption on a flash cart.  
<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, and this is just a guess, it seems more likely that a type of boot cart would be developed which would be used to load code from the GBA slot.  These suckers would likely be far cheaper (since they only need to contain a valid header and enough pre-encrypted data to get the DS to start loading from the GBA cart), and would allow people to leverage the existing population of GBA flash carts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not really. It can easily be done in a cpld.

Pre-encrypted data is not possible since the encryption key is generated from the RTC. (You would have to stop the RTC).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe go even futther to use the DS download play feature to write the application directly to the DS cartridge?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
From what I understand, the DS doesn't do anything *strictly* out of spec, but it does stuff that nothing else has ever bothered to, like use the duration field as an extra ID (which is allowed, but even the Sweex stick fills in that field with the duration, thus breaking Darkain's code).
<br/>
<br/>
It also acts partly like an AP, sending beacon frames and so forth, which I gather a lot of PC cards don't support, since they never act in that manner.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat
