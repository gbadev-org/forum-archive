The default is FAT, but I saw the other option, and that's why I bring up this question.

Oh, and I have a 2 GB Micro SD Card that I use with my Games n Music card. And I heard something like, you can't save as many files on a FAT. And I save a ton of files, not big, just tons.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

All file sizes on a FAT or FAT32 volume are rounded up to the next larger whole number of clusters. Each cluster is a power of two bytes in size, and there are about 32,800 to 65,500 clusters on a typical FAT (FAT16) volume. This means that on a 2 GB volume, each cluster is 32768 bytes. But on FAT32, clusters are usually 4096 bytes. So if you have a lot of small files, more of them will fit on a FAT32 volume of the same size.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
