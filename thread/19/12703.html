    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thought I'd start a fresh topic for this, to gather information in one place. Apologies if it's a duplicate, but I didn't see anything else.
<br/>
<br/>
My verdict is that it's not worth it at the moment, without DLDI support, not unless you want it for the video and MP3 support, which seems pretty decent.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't much like the UI, which is pretty but not very responsive. The double-tap to launch seems to not always work, and there appears to be no other way to do anything (no support for d-pad and buttons, for example). Also the device didn't start properly when I had a GBA game in slot 2, it just went to a white screen after the splash - I don't know if that's common to slot-1 flashcards? (Or even if it was just that game?) It bypassed the startup screen anyway, so there was no way to start the GBA game. (I should probably also mention that my (phat) DS has been flashed, although I suspect that's not the issue.)
<br/>
<br/>
I tried a few of the existing slot-1 DLDI patches, on the off-chance, but none of them worked.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall, I'll stick with my Supercard SD for now, and hope someone comes up with a FAT solution. I'm quite happy to experiment myself, but I don't really know what I'm doing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
it would be nice to find a solution for it, cause it works fine and the solution is cheap and available easy (in europe). but I fear there is no way, datel don't want such a solution.

we cannot dump the firmware.

we cannot change the firmware.

we don't know nothing about the hardware of this card (controller).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
