    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just got the K6 SuperCard (NCard clone), but I can't get it to connect to my PC (it's supposed to show up as a disk drive, right?) The thing seems to boot up fine (or at least did until I tried doing a quick format of the card, which may or may not have been incredibly stupid - it needs the xmenu.dat file now.) I tried different USB cables, different USB ports, different PCs (One WinXP, one Vista) and can't seem to get it to show up. Any ideas?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't know if this helps figure out what's wrong, but the DS firmware recognizes the slot-2 linker as an option pack. Not sure if that's correct or not.

<br/>
Also, the DS is a version 1 phat with Flashme.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That sucks.  Same thing happened to me when I bought my N Card.  You can try contacting the retailer you bought it from and hopefully they will tell you something better than what I was told.. which, was to send the whole thing back and they would replace it.  But, shipping alone was around half the price of the card, so it wasn't worth it..<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Apparently the problem is the card (not sure if it's the slot-1 part or the slot-2 part) isn't recognizing that there's a USB connection. Apparently there's a menu that's supposed to come up to choose between USB mode and the normal game menu. I've been able to coax that to show up *a few* times (and copy stuff over and run them successfully), but only a few times and it takes a whole bunch of tries.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.
