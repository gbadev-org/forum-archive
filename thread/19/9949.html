The 512Mb Ultra FlashPass is 30 GBP, and looks like you can buy it from only 1 store. It appears to be a re-writable DS cartridge. Anyone have one of these? It seems to be 55$ US...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So maybe 2-3 DS games depending on which ones you get, and by the looks of it, it has no menu of any sort and so could actually only have ONE DS game on it at a time. How it saves.... not sure. Maybe it makes a .sav file, maybe you need to make one for it. Eitherway, it's good for one rom at a time, but it's getting closer at least. Change it to 512 megaBYTES and a menu and I'll think about it. Seeing as how you don't NEED FlashMe, and it needs CLEAN roms, you probably couldn't run homebrew on it without Nintendo's little signed header. With FlashMe installed, maybe you could... maybe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Huh? Is there even one DS homebrew game that fills 32 megabytes? Or are you talking ScummVM games?

Unless you stick all the homebrew games in some sort of MS-FAT or Nitro-FAT file system and then load them as needed.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

With the DS Lite and all, it would be nice to run homebrew and show your friends your work without them saying "hey whats that thing sticking out??"

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are any commercial ROMs less than 128MB? Anyway I don't think you'd need FlashMe to use it. AFAIK the cards aren't signed, just encrypted, and the encryption was broken quite a while ago.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
