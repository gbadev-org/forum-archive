<br/>

i saw on <a class="postlink" href="http://users.belgacom.net/bn967347/" target="_blank">http://users.belgacom.net/bn967347/</a>
<br/>
that you can run polarium demo without a gba flash card.
<br/>
<br/>
How can i modify my homebrew so that i can direct upload it to the nds memory?
<br/>
<br/>
Or can't it?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx you for help!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Running GBA .mb files on a Nintendo DS through Wi-Fi is probably impossible, but we might be able to run DS demos if we find a DS Download Play game that loads code and assets in two separate passes and is vulnerable to buffer overflow. Then we could send, say, SM64DS's signed DS Download Play bootloader and then overflow the slave with unsigned code posing as an oversize asset. Has anybody disassembled the SM64DS bootloader to see if it has any such vulns with which a standalone version of WifiMe could "interoperate"?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

You could also patch the Nintendo DS firmware so that it will no longer check the signature. IMHO this will be the only/easiest way to multiboot homebrew.

You could maybe borrow a Flash card, and WifiMe shouldn't be a problem since you would already have a compatible Wifi Card.
<br/>
Otherwise there would be no sense in patching for wireless boot if you have no equipment to boot at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But you still need a flash card to flash your firmware so it will be usefull too!

Of course, all this would be solved if the EFA people would make a version of the card that works even when plugged into a GBA or Nintendo DS system that has been powered off.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
