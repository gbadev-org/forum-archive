    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, welcome to the forums.
<br/>
<br/>
We're going to need a bit more information than that. What exactly is it you're trying to get to run? (Sounds like WiFime, but just to be sure, please specify?) Which operating system are you using? What exact model of wireless card do you have?
<br/>
<br/>
More importantly, do you have any software firewalls enabled? (like the windows one) I've known those to be a bit of a hassle when it comes to things like this. However, without a little more info, we can't really help too much.
<br/>

PS: You might consider a more descriptive title while you're at it. "Please Help!!!" doesn't really give us a clue what you're asking about. ^_^<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also I believe wmb.exe is a command line app, if you say a window pops up, and then dissapears (I presume you are running windows). You might want to try running it from command-line so you can read any messages that are output and potentially any error messages.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Something else that <span style="font-style: italic">might</span> work (not tested because I don't use wmb, though I do use the Windows command prompt):
<br/>
<br/>
Create a file in the same folder as wmb.exe. Call it <span style="font-weight: bold">wmbsend.bat</span> (not wmbsend.bat.txt). Its icon should resemble a little window with a gear in it. Open the file in Notepad and put this in it:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">wmb -data %1
<br/>
pause
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Then drag .nds files on top of this batch file.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

And another FYI dieferber17, you should not ignore PM's from mods or admins. You can find your PM's by <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/privmsg.php?folder=inbox" target="_blank">clicking here</a> or by clicking on the (Im assuming it says something like) "You have 1 new message" at the top of your screen.
