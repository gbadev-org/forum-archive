    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry, I know this has been posted 20 Gazillion times but here I am.  I would love to use WiFiMe.  It seems like the most painless non-intrusive way to get homebrew code running on the DS.  Unfortunately, I'm one of the few who doesn't have Windows XP.  I can't really see spending $200 on an OS to use the hack either.  Is there any current development for Linux Drivers that could use the hack?  I figure I'll need a wireless networking card anyway to play the DS online and this would be an awesome solution.
<br/>
<br/>
I ordered a PassMe, but it got lost in the mail.  Looking for another inexpensive solution.

Thanks,
