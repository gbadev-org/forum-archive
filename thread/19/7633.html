    <h4>#62271 - other - Mon Nov 28, 2005 10:03 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been thinking about getting a (silver) Nintendo DS bundled with Mario Kart DS, and then a <a class="postlink" href="http://shop.01media.com/en/info.asp?ProductID=15790" target="_blank">SuperCard (SD)</a>, a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ec.kingston.com/ecom/configurator/PartsInfo.asp?root=us&amp;ktcpartno=SD/512&amp;referid=28" target="_blank">512MB Kingston SD card</a> and a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.twinmos.com/flash/flash_p_cardrw8in1.htm" target="_blank">Twinmos 8-in-1 Card Reader/Writer</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything wrong with these pieces of hardware, would it be smarter to get something else (another SD card for example (I just thought Kingston was good quality), or another card reader)? 
<br/>
<br/>
What real pros / cons are there with choosing the SD card version instead of the CF card version? I didn't find any good answer in the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7523" target="_blank">CF vs SD thread</a>. What does tepples mean by <span style="font-style: italic">chishm's CF drivers are more mature</span>? Does anyone know if the SuperCard SD is as tight to fit as the SuperCard CF? What I like about the SD version is that the SD card is secured since I'm not going to take it in and out a lot.
<br/>
<br/>
With just these things, I'll be able to run GBA-stuff on the NDS, right? And to get it to run NDS-stuff I'll have to get a PassMe2 and (preferably) flash the NDS with FlashMe (I'm pretty certain of this, I just said it so that no one would add it ;-)). Assuming I do get a PassMe2, I wouldn't need anything else (than what I've posted here) to flash it? Just get the PassMe2 with the correct SRAM for some game I have?
<br/>
<br/>
Another question I have is, is there anywhere in Sweden I can buy a PassMe2, or do I have to order from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dspassme.com/oscommerce/catalog/index.php" target="_blank">dspassme.com</a>?
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, do I come across as being ultra-worried? Yeah, that would be correct. :) I haven't bought a console in years, and it is a lot of money involved in this purchase, I just want to make sure.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because the CF driver has been around significantly longer than the SD driver, the CF driver has had much more testing by its users and is thought by those users to be reliable.

The M3 is secured in the same manner as the GBAMP and the SD versions.

The M3 is slightly more compatible with GBA software than the SuperCard because the M3 has a better save circuit which does not require more save patching than would be used with a typical NOR card.

You'll have to buy a compatible game. PassMe2 is not compatible with Meteos (which is what came with my old DS).

Doesn't the SuperCard just need a button combination to save? Or is this after each game is patched with their software? From what I understand it has a realtime save-feature, which seem to be enough?

There are a few NDS games I'm interested in right now, but it's mostly about Mario Kart. But since I have no GBA, and haven't played any GBA games, there's a lot of those that I want to play. Right now I don't think I would consider a GBA since they're not really cheaper.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A couple of more questions:
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any limit to how big the games can be that are played via the SuperCard? I read that it has 256Mbit storage built-in, so there is no way to run bigger games than that (I'm thinking about NDS games, aren't they sometimes bigger than this)?
<br/>
<br/>
I assume I wouldn't have to worry about saves if I use the realtime save-feature, so there is no battery in the cart that I have to be worried about expiring?
<br/>
<br/>
I'll probably think about some more questions later. I must be really annoying.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is the drivers that the NDS use to read from each card, correct?

<br/>
<br/>
A button combination is needed to save, both for regular saving and realtime saving. The SuperCard seem to suffer from slowdowns in some games though, anyone know where I can find a list? And also where I can find a list of which GBA games are incomatible?

<br/>
The USA version seem to work, not sure about the European one (which is the one I will be getting if I get a DS).
<br/>

<br/>
It seems that for each executable file you can choose if it should be run from the built in 256Mbit storage or directly from the SD (/CF) card. But what cons are there with running it directly from the SD (/CF) card?
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">I assume I wouldn't have to worry about saves if I use the realtime save-feature, so there is no battery in the cart that I have to be worried about expiring?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Each save file is temporarly loaded (if the game has a save file) when a game is started. Then you have to press L+R+Select+A to save it to the SD (/CF) card before you quit. So there's nothing to worry about I would assume, is this right?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is all of this correct? Again, I'm looking for a list of GBA games that are incompatible with the SuperCard. I found one for NDS games on scdev.org.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Physically bigger: it might be bigger than a GBAMP, but it's bigger in an area that your hands aren't going to touch during gameplay.

<span style="font-weight: bold">Commercial games:</span> There is no limit to the size of commercial Nintendo DS games that you can play using an original DS game card. In fact, you can play a DS game card without any SuperCard inserted at all.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Homebrew games:</span> In general, the only Nintendo DS homebrew games that are larger than 256 Mbit are Lucasarts games running in the ScummVM emulator. ScummVM currently supports reading games directly from the CF card on a GBA Movie Player and will soon support other adapters (M3 CF, SuperCard CF, M3 SD, SuperCard SD).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
