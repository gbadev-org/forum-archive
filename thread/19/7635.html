    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Putting to Rest Some Common Questions</span>
<br/>
<br/>
To start off, WiFiMe cannot be used to update the firmware on new DS's. It would seem that it never will be able to be, either. Nor can any of the following bypassing devices get you into NDS mode on your new DS, until and unless, FlashMe is installed:
<br/>
<br/>
-PassMe*
<br/>
-PassKey*
<br/>
-SuperPass
<br/>
-Any of the MagicKeys
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, what DOES work is PassMe2 (and, if/when it comes out, PassKey2) working in conjunction with an SRAM device. Please bear note that the GBAMP is NOT one such device. 
<br/>
<br/>
The three SRAM devices that DO work are:
<br/>
<br/>
-SuperCard
<br/>
-M3
<br/>
-GBA flash cartridges (e.g. XG Flash, EZ-Flash, QBus, et al)
<br/>
<br/>
Which of the three is better is rather subjective. The SuperCard is the most economic choice, but does not support FAT32 and is of lower manufacturing quality. The M3, on the other hand, is a little over 2 times the price of the SuperCard, however supports FAT32 and is of better construction. GBA flash carts are a good choice for those who already have one. The only limitation of the standard flash cart is its capacity, but that depends entirely on your storage needs.
<br/>
<br/>
*The PassMe and PassKey can both be reprogrammed to act as a PassMe2, following the instructions on the DarkFader page (see links).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">On the PassMe2</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Moving on, the PassMe2 that one needs to buy/make is game-specific, which means that it has to be programmed to work with an original game. For example, if you own Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, it will be programmed with the game code on the cart of the game (which, in this case, is ACVE). One does not need to do this him/herself, instead you can buy a pre-programmed PassMe2 on Natrium42's site (see links at bottom of post).
<br/>
<br/>
However, the PassMe2 is only necessary but not sufficient, to bypass the firmware. One will also need to write that game-specific SRAM to the SC/M3/GBA flash cart. 
<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you programmed your PassMe2 to work with Mario Kart (game-code AMCE), you will also need to program the SRAM to work with the AMCE code.
<br/>
<br/>
A list of game-codes can be found on DarkFader's site. The link is provided at the end of this post.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The SRAM</span>
<br/>
<br/>
The simplest way to write the game-specific SRAM is to run Pepsiman's .GBA SRAM writer from your SC/M3/GBA flash cart.  As this file works as a .GBA file, it can be run just as a Gameboy Advance ROM is run. 
<br/>
<br/>
Once you run the program, you'll see a long list of game-codes. There, you'll have to choose the game-code your PassMe2 is programmed with. Upon doing so, one should see the "SRAM Written" message and turn off their DS -- turning it on after inserting the PassMe2-original cart combination.
<br/>
<br/>
The SRAM's is not permanently imbedded into the flash-device, however. After running an NDS file, the SRAM will consequently be purged. So, this SRAM-writing process must be done after <span style="font-style: italic">every</span> single run of DS applications, unless one FlashMe's his/her DS.
<br/>
<br/>
For your convenience, Pepsiman has made a FlashMe-bundled SRAM writer, too. If you are unfamiliar with FlashMe and the procedure for installing FlashMe on your DS, please search these forums for more information.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">M3 Issues</span>
<br/>
<br/>
There are instances of M3 owners (myself included) who followed the above steps, yet get only two white screens when restarting the DS. For this, there is a process that seems to work. The procedure is as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Load pepsiman's SRAM GBA file 
<br/>
2) Scroll down to your game (BUT DON'T PRESS "A" YET) 
<br/>
3) Take out your M3... wait 4 seconds... 
<br/>
4) Pop it in and press "A" 
<br/>
5) Repeat step 3 and 4 
<br/>
6) Turn OFF DS 
<br/>
7) Pop in PassKey with that game you chose in the list 
<br/>
8) Turn ON DS

Hm, does Pepsiman's SRAM writer application support swapping carts?  If that's the case you could use a device like the GBAMP if you have it to load the GBA file, swap carts with a commercial GBA game using SRAM and use that to to boot some other device in NDS mode (might be a much cheaper solution for some people, but the PassMe2 code would need a 'wait for keypress' thing to allow inserting a different cart after the initial booting...does it have this?).<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Only on old firmware. If you try it on <span style="color: red">new</span> firmware you get Super Mario 64 graphics. Unlike the old firmware, the <span style="color: red">new</span> firmware uses a run address within a digitally signed area.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had a lot of trouble with two white screens using superpass 2 (programmed for and loaded with Super Mario 64 US) and M3 mini-sd.  I used the ASME-0.sav from the superpass2 folder.  After three hours of effort I found the information I needed here:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.ndshb.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=61" target="_blank">http://www.ndshb.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=61</a>
<br/>
<br/>
All I did was rename ASME-0.sav to sram.dat and flashed it along with flashme.nds to the root of the mini-sd.  Slapped it into the M3 and the superpass finally worked.  I ran flashme, shorted sl1 (using the drill bit wrapped in tape method) and it worked perfectly.  Hopefully this will help someone to not lose three hours of sleep like I did.  I've previously flashed two original NDS's with my Supercard with no problem.  This is the first time I've done it with the M3 and only because the Supercard is on vacation right now.
