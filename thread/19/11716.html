    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I recently bought a Max Media Dock for my DS. I mostly just needed the Media Launcher as a passme device, but decided to spend the extra $20 on the dock as well. Now my problem. The dock itself seems to function perfectly fine when it's plugged into my DS. When I plug it into my computer, Windows XP is *supposed* to register it as a USB Mass Media Storage Device. However, nothing happens at all.
<br/>
<br/>
My other USB Mass Media Storage Devices work fine (external harddrive and a flashstick) and there's nothing wrong with CF cards I'm using with the dock (8MB and 32MB).
<br/>
<br/>
So my question is, does anybody know how I can get my computer to respond in any way to my MMD? Currectly, it acts as if it isn't even there.
<br/>
<br/>
(I've tried flipping the CF cards both ways and have ensured that they are connected fully and properly. I've also tried using a different USB cable.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't have one personally, but if it just accepts the CF card, can't you use your CF Reader/Writer instead of the MMD?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I should be able to use a CF reader/writer, sure - but I don't have one. Don't even have a camera or anything that uses them. I'd really like to get the MMD's read/write capabilities working...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it has voltage issues with some PC USB ports.  Try different ports or a USB hub and do a search for MMD USB voltage.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I opened the unit up again to see if I missed anything. Turns out, a wire wasn't connected to the solder point. Resoldered it, and bam! Works great now.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
