    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Due to the remodeling of the DS Lite, flashing with the SL1 has become a bit harder because they moved a 2nd connection close to the SL1.  The problem many people have found is that their DSL will shut off in the middle of flashing it.  What needs to be done is finding something with a metallic tip to short the connection, while the actual piece that you put down in there is not metallic.  What i found worked best was taking a toothpick or something skinny and non-metallic and wrapping a tiny piece of tin foil around the tip.  This will help you to not hit that 2nd connection that resets the DSL, while successfully bridging the SL1 connection.  A spare DS stylus (original stylus) works well also.  The best bet is to use something non-metallic and fit the tip of that with something metallic to short it.  Hopefully this helps a few people to not brick their pretty  new DSLs :-D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
