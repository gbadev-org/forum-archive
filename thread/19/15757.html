If so, how much does it cost for ~100 cartridges?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I remember correct, it was something like $1,000 for the flasher and then something like $20 or $25 (or was it $15?) each for the cards.. and I thought they held 32MB (or was it bit?).
<br/>
<br/>
I doubt this helps much.. but for 100 cards you can expect to spend around $2,500 - $3,500, and that is just the cards without any labels or packaging.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm sure they will come looking for you if you actually have $3,500 to put toward this.  So pop onto a few of the IRC channels looking for information and see what you find.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sounds like a risky way to drop $3500 to me.  Why not just follow proper channels and go publisher shopping?  =P

Because you'll spend a lot more than $3,500 and we all know how "easy" it is to get a game published..  Not to mention one that was written using DevkitPro instead of the official SDK.

If your going to make that point, everyone already is.  Unless you only own a Datel Games N Music card, you have already given money to the "pirating supporters".  There is no way around that one.
<br/>
<br/>
But, speaking of that.. if someone was able to hack the Datel Games N Music card firmware to remove the Datel name on startup, you could repackage them for sale with your game on it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Has anyone heard of the Vision DS? It seems to be Nintendo's own, official (multimedia only?) card?

That wouldn't be a bad thing (in terms of supporting piracy through inofficial deviced), if it could be "massaged" to make homebrew run (I don't care about commercial ROMs.)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

Not if the part that launches a program is in a non-flashable part of the adapter. Unlike the DS firmware, DS Game Cards are either mask ROM or OTP.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

yes, the wifi system to load signed code was hacked before there was almost no way to run homebrew on the wii, on the DS where you already have plenty solution to run homebrew there will prolly never be enough interest from the comunity to hack the dsvision signature...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's too bad the Games'n'Music uses microSD, though, so it'll never look like an "authentic" DS game.
<br/>
<br/>
There used to be a 512MB version of the N-Card around a few places and it was only $20 at the time.  I haven't seen those for sale anywhere in a long time, but if you could somehow track down old stock somewhere in some warehouse in Hong Kong and buy a few hundred of them for $12-15, those could make for a very nice finished product.
<br/>
<br/>
I looked into this a while back, but was never even able to get in touch with the N-Card's manufacturer.  Couldn't even get firm information on *WHO* the original manufacturer was, in fact., which I suppose isn't too surprising.
