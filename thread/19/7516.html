    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've bought my wife the blue nintendogs bundle for xmas and I'm trying to put together the things I need to run nds roms off a CF card. I ordered a M3 cf adapter and a passkey before I found out that the newer DS's do not work with the old passkey. I've tried building a jtag to flash my current passkey but for the life of me I cannot get it to work. Can someone tell me straight up what I need to buy to run ds roms off an adapter. Can i just pick up the new passme2 or what. Please help, the ds homebrew <span style="font-weight: bold">removed by MOD</span> scene seems alot more complicated then the xbox/psp scene which I'm used to. Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

thanks, the bundled version of nintendogs isn't the same as the nintendogs lab and friends that i can use with it is it? Is there a way to find out. I'll be more than happy to send you my passme1 for the price of shipping.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, one more thing, under the passme2 instructions it says
<br/>
<br/>
sram.bin file stored on your Flash Cart
<br/>
<br/>
does that mean a specific file stores on my cf card that plugs into the m3 or what?
<br/>
<br/>
One more thing :)
<br/>
<br/>
do I need to keep the passme in the Ds at all times?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Look at the DS Game Card's label for an alphanumeric code that begins NTR- and then match it to one of the codes listed on the passme2 order form.

For the M3, you have to use the instructions that were posted elsewhere to set the sram.bin as the save file for FlashMe.

You can remove it after booting.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
