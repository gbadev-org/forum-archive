it's to be noted, I have a few microSD's on which this function dosn't seem to work. could never figure it out. seems hit or miss. it's also to be noted that said microSD's are <span style="font-style: italic">well used.</span><br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I have a brand new kingston micro sd...and it didn't work.  I didn't format it though...it came formated.  I'll format and try it tonight.

Thanks for the tips :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've found a weird one where if the file is called "default.nds" it doesn't work, but if it's in 8.3 format "DEFAULT.NDS" it normally does work. Windows seems to de-capitalise 8.3 format names when it's showing them in explorer, so you can't really be too sure what the name of the file is. I normally use cygwin, so I can see which files are lower case and which are upper.
<br/>
Renaming these files to upper case doesn't seem to work, but it seems ok if these files are created with upper case to begin with.

This is my experience with it, ymmv :-)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
