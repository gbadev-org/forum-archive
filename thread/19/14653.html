    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a really interesting situation. I own a SuperCard Rumble SD, which sucks in the general working department, but I've been able to make it work most of the time using the moonshell driver for it, which is a fairly common situation. I came across this problem though. I switched to a different SD card, and the driver stopped working. (Same exact files, copied from the other card where (when copied back) they still work fine.)
<br/>
<br/>
The reads on the new card work, the writes do not, it crashes every time like my other driver did with the old card. (The other driver fails in general on the new one.) 
<br/>
<br/>
Here are the specs on the two SD cards:
<br/>
<br/>
Old (working fine) card: 
<br/>
Type: MicroSD in an adapter
<br/>
Brand: SanDisk
<br/>
Size: 512 MB
<br/>
<br/>
New (not working quite so well) Card:
<br/>
Type: Regular Ole SD Card
<br/>
Brand: DANE-ELEC
<br/>
Size: 2G
<br/>
<br/>
Besides the obvious size and speed differences, both cards seem like they should operate the same. There is one catch that I have not been able to try testing for though. My new card was formatted on a Vista machine, whilst my Old card was formatted on an XP machine. Same machine, actually, just a different OS. I have yet to try formatting the old card on Vista because I'm worried I might lose my Homebrew ability.
<br/>
<br/>
For the record, both cards (as far as I can tell) are FAT type, since the rumble does not support FAT32 or NTFS, and to my knowledge neither does most homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
Any insight on this issue would be really grand, as I don't quite have the necessary cash to upgrade to an R4 at the moment. ^_^

Super Card dont handle unaligned writes/reads too well.
<br/>
Surprisingly on some smaller cards it works, and only fucks up occasionally - rare enough so you could miss when it does, or it could never happened for you. On bigger card the problem is more noticable, or should i say, it makes homebrew unusable.

You cannot do anything about it untill you have source code and can fix it yourself.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have tried using the hacked moon driver, it's in fact the only one that really works well. I did not know, however, that the problem would arise with size, and that makes sense, seeing as how it is the smaller card which seems to be working ok. So it would seem, unfortunately, that I'll be needing an R4 if I wish to really store my entire MP3 collection on my DS. :cries:
<br/>
<br/>
Well that's unfortunate. However, the card will still work for now, my little 512  MB card has served me quite well. I do not think the MiniSD driver will change things, but I will go ahead and try it out on the new card just to see. (My current working is a microSD, not a MiniSD).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the advice though. *goes and puts an R4 on his christmas list*

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's not necessarily a matter of size.  My 2 GB miniSD card works fine with the standard SCSD.dldi file but my 1 GB one requires SCSD_moon.dldi for anything to work.  I'd try getting a different card before you give up on the Supercard entirely.
<br/>
<br/>
Give Barni's DLDI file a try, it might work for you.  That page states that someone successfully tested it on a SCLite, and it works on my non-Rumble Supercard miniSD, so it seems to be fairly universal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
