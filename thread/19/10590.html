    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys. I bought my DSLite in Hong Kong, and it already came flashed. Except the brightness now will only go on and off. Before coming to this forum, I didn't know that other people also had this problem. :p
<br/>
<br/>
So I've looked around, and what' i'm still confused about is if I need PassMe2 to Flash this DS again? Do you only need it for the first time?
<br/>
<br/>
If I do not need it, would the procedure just simply be to transfer the flashme.nds to my SCSD mini and run it? (and obviously do the shorting part)
<br/>
<br/>
Do i need that Ram file the IQram or something? :p
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
You need to use the newest version of FlashMe (version 7) to enable the brightness levels but I'm not sure if you will need a passme device. I think you can directly flash your DS to FlashMe V7 without returning it to the original FW. Just make sure to use the latest version. Haven't tried it so I'm not sure.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there.
<br/>
I have the same issue. After flashing V7, I've lost the brightness control.
<br/>
Tried V6, did'nt help either.
<br/>
My DSLite was bought in Japan mid-July 2006.
<br/>
<br/>
@elmnt61: did you fix yours?
<br/>
<br/>
UPDATE - PROBLEM SOLVED
<br/>
My V7 version was probably not good (thought is was indicated FW7 on the DSLite
<br/>
This thread helped me:

It's ok if you need a brick...
<br/>
Better use a Screwdriver or something and isolate everything exept the tip of the tool (tape, tesa whatever).
<br/>
You can brick your lite if you shorten the SL1 with the screw next to it, thats why you should be carefull and not use a toothpick with lots of tin foil around ( that worked on the ds phat).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
