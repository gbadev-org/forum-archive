1) I have every version of FlashMe, if you wanted a specific one (not counting the original beta since that would only be usable on my old NDS that I had to exchange because of a weird failure of the L button :P)
<br/>
<br/>
2) Er, well, no source available, and I don't think you can flash the firmware from the GBA side of things like you were saying (using the GBMP), so it's size would be kinda irrelevant, but no, it's larger than that.  I don't think any of the versions were that small.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ok...the nds.gba file is not really a GBA file.  It's an NDS format file with a loader attatched to the front of it (that also has a GBA header just for the flash cart software mostly).  The code is NOT GBA compatible, it's meant for the Nintendo DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think you can use a stock GBMP with PassMe (it isn't going to know how to load something from the Compact Flash card)....Dark Fader's work on cracking the GBMP's firmware may change this though, so if you really are hell bent on using the GBMP wait and see.  :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Personally I want some kind of a 'repeater' program...something to rebroadcast demos and such using the NDS itself.  Can't do this until someone figures out the Wifi though, heh.  Actually, another idea I thought would be cool is a "Netstumbler" type of program...detecting NDS wifi and/or regular Wifi activity....maybe saving a list to GBA SRAM.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so... how silly do i feel
<br/>
after being told that a flash cart is the only way, i ordered one...
<br/>
40 of my finest pounds for a quite poor cart, but i was desperate.
<br/>
<br/>
so now ive flashed my ds. but the flash cart hasnt even SHIPPED yet. yup. did it with all chisms stuff. like i said was possible in theory.
<br/>
<br/>
i love the man, but i feel dumb as ass now. know anyone who wants a cheap flash cart? can anyone think of what use it is? blah.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
