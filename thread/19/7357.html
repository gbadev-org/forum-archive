    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, I've finally decided to give the whole NDS homebrew scene a try.  I wanted to wait a little while and see what evolved, and now that stuff like SCUMMVM, Hexen, Heretic and the like are hitting the scene, along with other excellent homebrew applications and games I want to start this whole thing up.  For the last 3 hours I've read around these forums trying to see what the best things to get are, and I'm so confused about what to get it hurts.  Basically I have a Blue DS, NU112 are the first digits of the serial number, and I do not want to flash my system at all.  What is the best set of cards or whatnot to get?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Basically all I need to know is what equipment do I buy?  Which has the most support and has true DS functionality?  I didn't buy the original GBAMP because it was only for the GBA, but I've seen that the M3 has support for both screens and a load of DS software.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would go for a Movie Player, M3 or Supercard. They are all pretty good supported since all are supported by the FAT driver and allow access to the CF card. M3/Supercard are newer than the movie player but they also cost more. If you only want to use em for homebrew than there is nothing the Movieplayer can't do what the others can.
<br/>
<br/>
I would not go for a flashcard since the above mentioned adapters are generally not only cheaper but provide more features as well. You might also have other devices where you can use the CF card wich is another advantage over traditional flash cards.
<br/>
<br/>
You have 2 option to start Homebrew applications if you don't want to flash your firmware. You will need a passme device or a wireless PCI or PCMCIA card with the RT25xx chipset from Ralink to use wifime. You can find a complete list of devices that use the chipset <a class="postlink" href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
You can order passme from <a href="http://www.dspassme.com/" target="_blank">http://www.dspassme.com/</a> and you can get a movie player there as well.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know however about the Firmware issues with new DS's. I think the Blue DS has a new firmware already so you will need passme2. I don't know if Wifime works with the new firmware. Theoretically it would not because it works the same way as the passme. Can someone who knows more about the firmware issue confirm that?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The current version of WiFiMe does not work with the newer firmware versions and i havent heard of anyone trying to make a new version, so for now, the only option if you have a new firmware would be to buy a passme and not a ralink wifi card. At least until you can flash your firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
If you dont want to flash your firmware because of the recent scare with mario kart and other TCP/IP wifi games, then you will need a passme.
<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend buying a GBA/MP and CF card to load your homebrew with a passme. Its cheap and it works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i think your best option would be probably to go with the m3 as long as you dont mind its extra cost.  I believe they are working on a passme2 which is compatible with your ds so you may have to wait for that.  Plus in the future you may end up with a decent movie player too when they decide to release the converter</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Though many DS homebrew programs can run on the GBAMP, the M3 and SuperCard can run more GBA homebrew programs than the GBAMP can.

There's blue, and then there's <span style="color: red">blue</span>. Teal DS (Nintendogs bundle) = <span style="color: red">v4</span> firmware. Electric blue DS = new firmware only if you bought it in the last month or so.
<br/>
<br/>
WiFiMe does not work with <span style="color: red">v4</span> firmware, as the <span style="color: red">v4</span> firmware now checks the WMB header against more (presumably signed) parts of the .nds header. Somebody's going to have to actually crack SM64DS's protocol and use that to boot homebrew code.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you bought your DS prior to October 2005, then the GBA MP and PassMe should be fine.  If you bought it after October 1st, 2005, you may have new firmware (which, there doesn't seem to be a way to tell what version you have till you try a PassMe on it)..  If you have new firmware, GBA MP isn't going to work, as PassMe2 requires SRAM.  In that case, for the money, I think the SuperCard may be the next best option.  But, as the prices climb, you have to do more personal reseach as to what exactly you want to be able to do with it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got one of the regular blue ones, not the new teal one.  I've got the original firmware, I've already checked the compatibility with the passme list.  The M3 is really tempting, however it's quite expensive with the CF card.  Looks like it'll be about $130 after shipping and such.  So this will work with all the good stuff like SCUMM and the emus?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the m3 supports pretty much everything and is the best way to play scummvm, snesDS, dslinux etc.  Unfortunately though later revisions mess up heretic and hexen so if you do get one dont update yet.  The gbamp has no onboard ram so it cant play snesds, heretic, hexen but is fantastic for moonshell and scummvm</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wow yeah, that kind of sucks, but I can deal with it.  I probably won't get the actual thing for another 3 weeks anyway, so I can always wait.

As far as wifi play goes, that would be so amazing.  Is the wifi cracked yet?  I know it was getting close.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, he released a lot of information, but no sample code or anything yet.  Sounds like he's nearly done writing his own IP stack now to use with it.  It's nice to see nearly everything with that green 100% rating in his progress box. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
