    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The message board is swamped with ppl that say they have the auto bright feature, others say then dont. The flashme site is down. And today, the 11th is the official release of the DSLite and many of us are going all over the place getting random flashme's. I'm a bit confused, I've downlaoded a few from different places and i'm confused as to whcih one I should actually have. I just got my new DSLite this morning  (US release date).
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone please link the REAL working DSLite flashme firmware that works flawlessly with the DSLite (you know, with the extras like brightness feature and what not).
<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate all the help and time :)
<br/>

Hmm...I am uncertain.
<br/>
This link links to a zip file containing noflashme.nds, flashme.nds and flashme_stealth.nds.
<br/>
However the flashme.nds appears to be twice as big as the two copies i have (from different sources).
<br/>
Version in the zip:
<br/>
538185 bytes 19 Apr 00:38 flashme.nds
<br/>
MD5 = fa220267edb05f4386025d97e2168f3f
<br/>
mirrors.kicks-ass.net:
<br/>
276041 bytes 22 Mar 05:34 flashme.nds
<br/>
MD5 = 0762f6957fcfb3a942f2474a1a2383a2
<br/>
<br/>
However the modification date is later on the zipped version.
<br/>
People have been reporting problems with the brightness levels using the copy that I found (mirrors.kicks-ass.net).
<br/>
Someone with a DSLite should check them both.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

Flashme = it will remove the startup health screen and it will start your DS smoothly (backlight)
<br/>
Flashme_stealth = You wont see any changes.. its a Stealth Flashme mode (this one holds the bootscreen)

With my bad shorting device i only flashed up until 1% and could get it any further. But I just didn't panic (my DS was plugged in)  and looked for a better one what kept me 5-10 Minutes. Came back with the netter shorting device and flashed the rest of the 99% :D

Open the battery box on the back of your DS with a common four-prong (+ end) screwdriver. There should be three holes next to the battery. Two of the holes contain potentiometers that control the screen voltages; don't touch them. The other one is the SL1 hole and should have a sticker on it; move it on top of one of the other holes. Carefully stick a standard (- end) screwdriver into that hole to make the % on FlashMe stop blinking.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The Windows version of WMB doesn't work with DS Lites, basically. It seems the DS Lite is more sensetive to sothing like the timing of packets sent or something, which is slightly off with the WMB server. The Linux version works, though. If you do't already have Linux, you could get a Live CD so that you can boot Linux without having ot install it.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It seems that the WMB client a lot of us use for sending our homebrew to our DS systems doesn?t quite work for the new DS Lite. The reason for this happens to be the 2nd range of MAC addresses (00:16:56 rather than 00:09:BF) that Nintendo has is being used on the Lite. The new version supports both ranges so now you can send to both DS systems.

When I turn on my system and the two white screens come up for a second (just before the DS menu) I see a random smattering of colored pixels on the right side of the top screen.

Before I flashed them, my DS had purple firmware and my friend's had magenta. What does this mean? They were supposedly both from the same batch since we both got them same day from the shipment the repair shop had just recieved.

hey, i flashed my ds once and it was stuck at 66 % ... nothing would work anymore, then i saw that my sl1 port contacts was very much from eachother, since it was on 66% i thought it would be save t turn it off. i was scared as it wouldnt boot anymore :(
<br/>
then i read about abxy start select and it worked :)!!!
<br/>
i found me s toothpick in aluminium foil and guess what?
<br/>
me is having an nds fat flashme7 + brightness settings :D
<br/>
so: never shutdown a nds when flashing even at 99 percent you might become scared of the result, even IF it can be fixed.
<br/>
btw, where can i find contact with darkfader ? thanks :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It scared me at first because it started to a white screen, but I plugged in an actual DS cart, it booted fine, and now boots fine even without one. Weird...
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I broke the laws of coding and flashed it on battery power. It worked fine, because the flashing went by in about 15 seconds, and my battery was fully charged anyway. Weird... I was using the paper-clip method of course. I assume there is something that can be shorted in there that would have caused me to lose battery if I were not carefull, yes? Sorry for being risky. Another success story goes down in the books. Oh yeah, btw, Im confirming that the tinyurl link does indeed have the proper backlite support, it works fine on mine. Thanks yall!

PS: NOOOOOOOOO!!! I started up mariokart DS, and the sound at the beginning has changed. It sounds like its on a regular old DS now. NOOOOO! Is there a version that fixes the firmware detection on the DSLite so that DS games detect it properly? Sob...
<br/>
<br/>
PPS: Im seeing all sorts of weird bugs here. If I put the PassCard3 in the slot, it freezes on boot. If I have a GBA FlashCart with DS code in the slot, the only way I can get to the menu is by holding Start+Select. (It doesnt appear to respect the manual mode setting for homebrew games.) I dont have a sound drop thankfully. 
<br/>
<br/>
I just discovered that I can get the passCard3 to boot by using the Start+Select trick. Odd. Not that I really need it anymore, but still. I assume there are still quite a few kinks to work out in the Lite Version. Its not bricked though, and I can run homebrew without a passcard (so I can give that to my friend) and that makes me happy enough to wait for the next release. Yay.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

Do i need the superkey/pass/device to run flashme? or i just paste the files on my SD and run it from the supercard?

<br/>
I just want to check my Flashme Version, i dont want to flash it.
<br/>

*NEW EDIT*
<br/>
Ok my flashme version is 6... if i want to upgrade to 7, do i need the passkey, superkey, magickey? also do i need to short SL1? what tool is recommended for this on a DSLite? Is there a way to isolate the *dreaded screw of death* from the process?
<br/>
<br/>
As i have intended to do this is:
<br/>
1 Copy flashme on SD mini
<br/>
2 Boot ds with supercard on it
<br/>
3 Select flashme on the supercard menu
<br/>
4 Accept prompt
<br/>
5 Short SL1?

6 Flash complete =D

If your DS is not already flashed, you can use the SuperCard only with the the Game Boy Advance compatibility mode of the DS, which does not allow flashing the DS firmware. (SuperCard rumble series does not work in GBA mode.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Noflashme is to go back to the original firmware. If it fails mid-flash, you may be able to recover so long as the FlashMe recovery code hasn't been overwritten, but I wouldn't risk it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also the installer doesn't recognize my firmware. DSLinux says it's the European version. o_O I dumped it before trying to flash. I also used my ARDS to run DSLinux before ever doing the initial setup when I first got it, and dumped it then too, so I would have had a dump of the brand-new firmware before you did anything to it. Unfortunately my card's filesystem was corrupt so that dump got sucked into a black hole.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">With a Slot-1 card you don't really need WifiME.  Most Slot-1 cards use microSD cards.  You can plug these into your computer with a USB adapter (sometimes supplied with the card) and copy across what homebrew you want.
<br/>
<br/>
You don't need to install Flashme when using a Slot-1 device.
<br/>
<br/>
The only reason you should get a Slot-2 cart would be that if you wanted to run GBA homebrew or if you wanted to run homebrew that uses the onboard memory found on these devices.  Pretty much &gt;95% of DS homebrew and all of the popular DS homebrew doesn't require Slot-2 GBA RAM to work.

Then you are giving bad advice.  
<br/>
<br/>
Both of these devices you mention are several times the cost of an entry level Slot-1 cart.  From the looks of it kevin1gamer doesn't require a Serial port and video playback can be done on any Slot-1 card with Moonshell.

The point I was trying to make was that there are much cheaper methods of running DS homebrew than you ones you stated.  Remember that we don't care about commercial game compatibility here.  The only reason I would ever recommend the iPlayer over a cheaper generic cart would be the fact that it <span style="font-style: italic">used to be</span> the only cart that didn't promote piracy, all that changed when the GBA emulator came out for it.
