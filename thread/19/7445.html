<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">edit: i just received a e-mail with very good news!
<br/>

<br/>
here is my e-mail:</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Hi Stefan Vermunt ,
<br/>
Please send it back to us for repair .
<br/>
If you change the format setting of maintance utility , Your cart has 2 partitions and the MaintenanceUtility
<br/>
can't format it again .
<br/>
It is no way to format it again , you need send it back to us for repair .
<br/>
<br/>
Regards
<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold">so i suggest that you sent g6 an e-mail, and then everything is going to be fine. oh yeah, i also asked if THEY can upgrade the firmware for me, because i am afraid to do that again.
<br/>
i will let you know the answer</span>
<br/>
<br/>
[b]edit: i just got a answer, I have to sent my card together with my usb burner and my printed e-mail ,and he wil repair or replace it and upgrade my firmware before he sent it back to me.
<br/>
