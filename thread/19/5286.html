 If that was true, does it just ban the current games list by the name and future ones will work?

See above.  Simply put, that would be too simple.  The passthrough is a hardware hack to get code to run on a DS.  Think about how you would have to structure a program to get it to run from both the DS card slot and with a passthrough.  They are mapped to different address.  I don't know much about patching, but I'm sure the orignal game doesn't support the dual support feature.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Commercial games are compiled to read files from the Nintendo DS slot. They'll need patching to read files from the GBA slot instead. This sort of patching is already commonplace on the GameCube and may eventually become as commonplace as SRAM-patching is on the GBA.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Anyway, PhoenixRising and I are working on a couple of demos that we are hoping to show some ways around what is believed to be current limitations.  Don't want to give to much away incase we can't meet expectations..  ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it has been stated that the passme will not work with Non-PD roms.<br/>_________________<br/>Comming Soon: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.spyingwind.com" target="_blank">http://www.spyingwind.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
