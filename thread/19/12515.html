    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lately I've found it's behaving much like an NES; if it's not inserted just right it won't boot, and if you touch it there's a good chance it'll break the connection. I can run a program displaying the GBA cart status and often any slight vibration will make it cycle through OK/bad logo/nothing inserted repeatedly. Curiously, this doesn't seem to hurt much - I can keep it in my pocket and play music with Moonshell fine, and I can even pull it out and put it back in and still browse directories. (Moonshell even resumes the song right where it left off.) However, it's an annoyance for a few reasons:
<br/>
-Takes several attempts to boot
<br/>
-Touching it may freeze the official firmware (as it does when the cart is removed), making it a pain to use WMB
<br/>
-Lost connection during file write could be pretty nasty
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, it won't boot in GBA mode at all. The Nintendo logo shows, then it's just a black screen. Has anyone else had these problems and managed to resolve them? Does M3 CF suffer from these issues as well?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you tried the same procedure I recommend on NES games? <ol type="1"><li>Moisten one end of a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol. </li><li>Scrub the "golden finger" of the Game Pak with the moist end. </li><li>Scrub the "golden finger" of the Game Pak with the dry end. </li></ol><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My two month old Ninty MP3 player does this... but it's rubbish anyway.  It crashes whenever you insert or remove headphones, quite frequently when entering and exiting sleep, all the time if it is knocked, and sometimes when changing files quickly.  Any Americans out there will probably have a more finished product, however.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well cleaning it worked for a few days, but then it got just as bad. I stuck some cardboard in there and it's certainly tighter, hopefully that does it.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
