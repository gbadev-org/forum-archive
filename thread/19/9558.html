    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I just got a passme (I got the system at launch) and am trying to run SNES DS on it... all I'm getting, however, are two white screens. Can someone walk me through to process of getting this to work? I am apparently incapable of doing this by myself... thanks for your help</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have you tried running something simpler such as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=3" target="_blank">DesktopMan's Tetris clone</a> first? Then try running MoonShell or DSOrganize (see the respective topics in DS Misc). If you can get those to work, then try asking on the <a class="postlink" href="http://boards.pocketheaven.com/viewforum.php?f=36" target="_blank">official snesDS support board</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
