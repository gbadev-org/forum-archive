    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had a question , when having NDS stuff on my SuperCardSD and I boot up a DS running FlashMe , it can browse to a NDS "rom" right? cuz some crap I read said you had to have it named certain thing and can only have 1 rom on the card
<br/>
<br/>
You can have multiple NDS files and browse to em , right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if u mean the "roms" offered by homebrew, then with super card u can have as many as you want on there.  just make sure that u are using a ds.gba renamed to .nds, or what i did was gba.nds<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds" target="_blank">http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">NDS files are normally homebrew. People make them not the official companies. There are two versions. .nds and .ds.ga. The supercard uses the '.ds.gba' type, but you then just rename it to '.nds' no special software required as long as it ends in .nds. For official NDS games, you run the game through the converter software and you get a .dsq or .dsi file.
<br/>
<br/>
So what I'm saying is... you can have as many files on the card as it'll hold and you just pick the one you want to load from a list.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
