<br/>
<br/>
While looking for something else on the Datel site, I noticed this:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://us.codejunkies.com/shop/product.asp?c=US&amp;cr=USD&amp;cs=$&amp;r=0&amp;l=1&amp;ProdID=321" target="_blank">http://us.codejunkies.com/shop/product.asp?c=US&amp;cr=USD&amp;cs=$&amp;r=0&amp;l=1&amp;ProdID=321</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It appears to be a production answer to the PassMe. Instead of diverting execution to the GBA slot from a retail DS game, this actually <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> a retail DS game that loads executables from the GBA flash. For not sticking out of the DS, and only being $19.99, it seems like a fair deal (assuming it doesn't break compatibility with current binaries or anything).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know any more information about this? It looks like a great opertunity for people wanting to get into DS homebrew, but on the other hand, I remember the horrors with their MAX Drive Pro for the GameCube, which also promised to be an easy method of loading homebrew, and was delayed many many times, to finally release and be overall pretty terrible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">interesting...
<br/>
it seems they have bought out the company that is making passme2-z
<br/>
or w/e its latest name is :P...
<br/>
but funny how they have all this stuff for the ds now...
<br/>
when the security on nintendo ds firmware is getting more advanced ;)...
<br/>
could nintendo be behind this company?...
<br/>
could they be monoplizing the ds's whole market :D
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:looks like they released a head set too :D...
<br/>
$15 :P...
<br/>
btw, the movie player version for $150 is avalible on there site right now...
<br/>
if someone that was planing on buying it would buy it,
<br/>
then dump the cartraide that would be great :D...
<br/>
i think the $20 card is enough to find out that stuff tho :P...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

If it loads a .nds into RAM (as official carts do), and the .nds sets up the execution environment as for PassMe and jumps to the PassMe entry point, then yes it would work with Chishm's NDSMP.

<br/>
vb_master: There is a difference between a single-card PassMe2 and a NoPass-based PassMe. A PassMe2 jumps to an out-of-range SWI that jumps to SRAM; a NoPass jumps to custom code that may jump to ROM, and it would work with GBAMP.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

All they need to do is implement enough of the ds cart commands, so that when the DS boots and tries to read the DS game, it sees it as a valid game, the only difference being the actual code in the arm7 binary is simply a 'bx gba_rom' and the code in the arm9 binary is 'loop: bx loop'

If you can, try to dump it once you get it.  There are only 2 possible cases for dumping only 128KBs of a rom.  The first one is if the read value of rom size is 0x00.  The other one is when the rom size reads 0x0F (I never bothered to fix that bug, so that it properly dumps 4GBs, rather than 128KBs in this case.)

So it's a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/pass/#nopass" target="_blank">NoPass</a> device. And it seems awesome.

<br/>
Wow..  I wonder how they pick who will review a device.. cause that guy doesn't seem to have any idea what he is talking about.  And, of course, you can't post comments.. to correct half of the review.
<br/>
<br/>
"These devices are used to ?pass? code (hence their name) from the Game Boy Advanced? cartridge slot to the NDS slot allowing you to boot homebrew and backups. "
<br/>
<br/>
HUH?  So, the PassMe is passing data from the GBA slot to the NDS slot now?  Wow.. that's pretty cool..  UHH.. WRONG!
<br/>
<br/>
"The first PassMe units were produced by Natrium42 and were large, bulky ..."
<br/>
<br/>
Well. That's kinds true.. as the PassMe name was created by Natrium42 so they would be the first "PassMe"s.. but, as the name has become "standard", wouldn't the PassTHROUGH units (using an FPGA dev kit) be the real "First" passme.. and hmm. I think they were just a little bit bigger... The PassMe looked pretty damn small and compact compared to them!
<br/>
<br/>
"The Max Media Launcher is by far the best ?PassMe? solution"
<br/>
<br/>
Come on people!  PassMe is the name of Natrium42's PassTHROUGH device!  This is NOT A PASSME!  It's a replacement!
<br/>
<br/>
"Previously, all PassMe type devices required a data file to be loaded into them or placed on the removable media they use per each backup you wish to boot. This means each time you want to boot another backup you have to either reprogram the device or copy a new file onto your card."
<br/>
<br/>
Has this person ever even used a PassMe2?  You only need to load the SRAM data for the game your PassMe2 was programmed for.  Why would you be changing it based on the media?
<br/>
<br/>
"The days of turning your console off, turning it back on, programming the device, turning it off again and loading your images are over."
<br/>
<br/>
Wow.. this guy must have only used the reprogrammable PassKeys.. and must not have realized that you only need to do this once.. for the game you plan to insert..  Oh yeah... Hasn't he heard of FlashMe?
<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion:
<br/>
<br/>
Datel's device is going to rock, and why they sent this guy one is beyond me.  So, instead of reading all those "writing books" maybe he should have spent a few hours actually researching the topic?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But at least it helps rationalize development for DS, as anybody can run your program by buying a used DS ($100), a GBAMP ($55 incl. CF card and writer), and a NoPass card ($20). Contrast with PSP homebrew, where 2.7 isn't cracked at all and 2.6 requires a PSP Value Pack, a copy of the <span style="font-style: italic">old</span> version of GTA, and residence in a country where possession of the GTA game is not banned.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

NoPass, in theory, acts like an official NDS game due to it's encryption. It simply tells the DS to run whatever is in Slot-2. There is no way for Nintendo to block this method without a lot of careful planning.

<br/>
Another method possible, would be to special case the MD5 of all of the officially released game ARM7 binaries, and add a RSA signature to future ARM7 binary updates.  (Since the developers can't use the ARM7 directly anyways.)  If the ARM7 binary does not match one of the special cased ones, then it could check to see if the RSA signature is valid, and fail to execute the game card if it is not.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, SHA1 is more likely to be used, since the firmware already has that function built into it.  (WMB uses SHA1 for its signature, plus it is harder to make a SHA1 collision than it is to make an MD5 collision.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They could put a blacklist into DS firmware... Of course, it would still be possible to PPflash or solder a modded firmware chip -- unless they modify BIOS, which is on the die of the CPU.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Doubt it, and i disagree to tepples with the blacklisting. Blacklists do not secure a system (too easy to aviod), a whitelist would do, but that would just be ... contraproductive (reads: stupid) to do for arm9 code. Even for arm7, this would prevent future updates to the binaries.
<br/>
<br/>
So no, i don't think Nintendo is able to do something against NoPasses without breaking either future or past (by changing the verification process) cartridges.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, I'm trying to find ways Nintendo could block the purportedly invincible NoPass. In the past, Nintendo has blocked FireFly's WMB by switching to a part of the (secret) spec that FireFly's WMB does not implement.

Then datel could just steal one of the official arm7 binaries. I'd imagine the arm7 binaries are not all that secure (since this was probably never a design/programming consideration), and are susecptible to hacking by the arm9 (which there are way too many already to whitelist, I would think)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But, with all blacklists, would NoPass manufacturers just have to keep changing their MD5s?
<br/>
<br/>
I understand what you are saying, about the WiFiMe and PassMe1 blocks.. but, as with PassMe2, there always seem to be a way around it.. So, if they did blacklist the current NoPass(es) on the market, wouldn't there be a way around it?  Even worse, to the point of duping a legit game handshake? (which, incase this confuses people, I would totally be against!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And, as tepples suggested in the other NoPass topic, it should be pretty simple for an "Online Media Launcher" to be designed based off of the NoPass method.

Jeez, how incredibly cheap is that?  It says all this about playing MP3s, movies, blah blah, and what do they do?  The use MoonShell.  Now, MoonShell is awesome, don't get me wrong, but when they promise all this you would expect they might possibly *try* to make their own software that works with the bloody thing instead of hyping it all to hell then just using stuff that's readily available (and an older version at that).
