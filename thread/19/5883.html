    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to buy a flash cart, and i need the rundown.
<br/>
<br/>
some sites say to plug in the cart to the computer through the multiboot port, and the DS doesnt have one. Do they all require the multiboot port to transfer data?
<br/>
<br/>
also, (this might sound dumb), but once i transfer the data to the GBA cart, can i unplug it and run it on the gba( or does it need to be plugged into the computer to run).
<br/>
<br/>
any suggestions for a cart? 
<br/>
prefferably 128 mb
<br/>
<br/>
thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most use multiboot to transmit data.  A few (such as extreme flash advance) connect the cartridge itself directly to a USB port, so they are DS compatible.  Others use external linkers, which also make them DS compatible.
<br/>
<br/>
Once data is written to the cart, it can be removed.
<br/>
<br/>
Watch the units, flash cart makers sell them by megaBITS, not megabytes.  So a 128mb cartridge actually holds 16 megabytes.  The GBA cartridge bus can address up to 32MBytes before needing to bankswitch.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">EFA and EZ Flash II are generaly considered good choices.
<br/>
EFA comes in 256 Mb and 512 Mb (to my knowledge).
<br/>
EZ Flash II comes in 128 Mb up to 1 Gb.
<br/>
<br/>
I personnaly recommend buying a card form a retailer in your geographical region. That will save you some cash in shipping (because I hate to pay something $30 and add $30 in shipping).
<br/>
So here are my recommandations :
<br/>
Europe -&gt; TotalGBA.com (starting at ?70 for an EFA 256)
<br/>
USA -&gt; Jandaman.com (starting at $65 for an EZ Flash II 128)
<br/>
Asia -&gt; winsunx.com (starting at $40 for an EZ Flash II 128)
<br/>
<br/>
As I live in Europe, I ordered the above mentionned EFA 256 form TotalGBA.com and service and cart were both flawless.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm currently using an <a class="postlink" href="http://www.jandaman.com/games.mvc?p=gbaezfa256&amp;Category_code=GBADEVKIT" target="_blank">EZFA 256mbit cart</a> to develop games with. It requires the use of a multiboot port, however, so if you only own a DS, you'd have to try a different cart or buy a GBA. :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You need a GBA to flash the F2A carts so it may not be suitable for you and is probably going to be a pain to dev with.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not anymore. According to the <a class="postlink" href="http://flash2advance.com/" target="_blank">F2A web site</a> there's now an external F2A USB writer.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?

-- You know, the human.

Yeah, that's the only place I know of in Australia that has sold flash carts, but they've apparently been sold out for the past couple of months.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
