    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My brothers computer has recently decided that it does not want to send anything to the DS
<br/>
<br/>
There was a time when it was working perfectly but then for no apparent reason, the computer still acts as it should, but the ds recieves nothing
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried reinstalling the drivers, unzipping the program again, tidying cabling etc incase of interference and checking the antenna for errors
<br/>
<br/>
I got it to a stage where the item appears on the menu to be downloaded, but when you choose to begin, the signal strength display drops to zero, turns from red to green and displays "communication error", the DS then returns to the begining searching for broadcasts again
<br/>
<br/>
Two DSs will communicate perfectly when nearby - This has been fully tested :)
<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering what you thought the problems could be
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I managed to get it to work after finding that neither changing the pcislot or specifying a different channel changed anything. The problem was sorted when i discovered that official demos loaded perfectly. I opened an instance of wmb advertising a homebrew game and left it for a while with no luck, I then started another instance of the program advertising wifime while leaving the other open in the background to check that it was recieving wifime still, when i chose to download wifime, the homebrew app downloaded but did not recieve de-auth but the wifime did not download and recieved a deauth.
<br/>
<br/>
The homebrew app was loaded through the edited registry from a different location on the same drive and the wifime was loaded through cmd from the data folder. Loading homebrew through cmd from the data folder works flawlessly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It also works if i run the file using this batch file:
<br/>
<br/>
path=C:\DSDev\Tools\rt2560_app_wmb_1_4_beta_1
<br/>
wmb -data C:\DSDev\...\file.nds
<br/>

Would there be any reason that it would work like this but not through the registry?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
