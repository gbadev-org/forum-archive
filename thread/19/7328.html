    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a new black nds with unfortunatly the new firmware, a m3, a passkey, a pcmcia wifime compatable device, a flashadvance card and metroid demo(eur).
<br/>
<br/>
Actually:
<br/>
  - passkey does not work with new firmware (tested)
<br/>
  - wifime does not work (not tested, but red in another thread)
<br/>
The only way to go now is the jtag cable to flash the passkey. Schematics are available for passme, but not for passkey.
<br/>
So, here are some pic of my passkey. On the rear, we can see 6 pins wich should match the 6 jtag pins, but no infos is printed on the board.
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone have a look and bring some light ?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I looked at the photographs a bit, but I could only trace the lower 2 connections of the JTAG pins, which are GND and VCC. I can't see where the other 4 pins go to, since the connector is in the way.
<br/>
<br/>
So you'll have to do it yourself. Just pick a pin of the JTAG connector and check (with a multimeter) to which pin of the CPLD it is connected. Look up which function that particular pin has (It's in the datasheet, but I have included a table to look it up), and with a bit of luck it should match a pin of the JTAG fuction.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, pin 1 is next to the dot in the lower left corner of the IC. From then on, count counterclockwise.

<br/>
To do this week end:
<br/>
 - build the jtag cable
<br/>
 - flash the passkey to passkey2 for one game cartridge.
<br/>
 - load my flashadvance sram with latest flashme
<br/>
 - flash the nds firmware

<br/>
I works !
<br/>
I build a JTAG cable for passkey, load the sram of my old gba flash extreme, merge a loader to the nds flashme V5 and write it to the flash card and it works like a charm !
<br/>
Just have to erase the xilinx chip first (to overwrite the write protection).
<br/>
<br/>
I will post full procedure and maybe photos on monday !

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">check this page out for latest guide, but I think its pretty final now
<br/>
<a href="http://leo.rampen.ca/m3wiki/index.php/Jakel_passkey2" target="_blank">http://leo.rampen.ca/m3wiki/index.php/Jakel_passkey2</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tools Needed for Flashing
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>PassKey
<br/>
</li><li>Screwdriver
<br/>
</li><li>JTAG (will give directions on assembly) and a means to connect to PassKey (solder/header)
<br/>
</li><li>PC with 25 pin printer port
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tools Needed for JTAG Construction
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>Printer cable ($5) OR 25 pin male port
<br/>
</li><li>Soldering Iron  w/solder
<br/>
</li><li>1/4 watt 4.7  KOhm resistor
<br/>
</li><li>2x6 header (optional)
<br/>
</li><li>multimeter (optional but very useful))
<br/>
</li><li>power source (2 AA battery holder)
<br/>
</li><li>2 AA Batteries
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">It will be about $10 total in costs if you already have Solder Iron, solder, and multimeter</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Removing the PassKey from the covering
<br/>
Take apart the PassKey, there are 8 screws (4 large and 4 small) to be taken off.  Carefully remove the top outer two, then the two outer on the next row and remove the two pieces that come off.  Then remove the 4 small screws and pull off the card (suggestion to tap the LED out).  Now, CAREFULLY bend the pins holding the clear cart insert so you can remove the plastic below it (about 20-30 degrees).  Push on the plastic parts holding on the circuit to loosen and pull it out.  And you SHOULD see 6 small headers (2 larger than the other 4)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
JTAG Construction
<br/>
If you already have a JTAG or can borrow one you may skip ahead.  There are two main ways to construct a JTAG, one is either cut up an extra 25 pin printer port and then use a multimeter to tell which wire is which pin, or you can buy a male header and wires (this is easier but costs more, but only like $3).  Now the pins you want (or wire touching this pin) are 2, 3, 4, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 25.  You can simply refer to this hopefully easy to understand diagram
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Recap on Wiring
<br/>
PIN 2 = TDI
<br/>
PIN 3 = TCK
<br/>
PIN 4 = TMS
<br/>
PIN 8 = solder together with 11 and 12
<br/>
PIN11= ^^
<br/>
PIN12= ^^
<br/>
PIN13= solder to TDO and 1/4 2k4OHM resistor
<br/>
PIN15= solder to VCC, positive power of the power source and also the resistor
<br/>
PIN25= solder to GND and negative power of the power source
<br/>
<br/>
Solder all the wires to the right heads (or use the 2x6) and also solder the 3 wires together and also put in the power source and resistor.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Programing Part
<br/>
With your PassKey hooked up to the JTAG, hook the JTAG up to the PC, insert batteries and run this software (download <a class="postlink" href="http://www.xilinx.com/ise/logic_design_prod/webpack.htm" target="_blank">this </a>after registration).  Now run iMPACT.  Start a new project and click on "Configure Devices," "Boundary-Scan Mode," "Auto connect and config cable." Hit ok and then select the JED file.  The JED file you want can be found  <a class="postlink" href="http://darkfader.net/ds/games/" target="_blank">here</a>.  Please note that the list of compatible games is updating and changing.  Now that you have selected the JED, right click the chip and select "erase" and check the option to take off write protect.  Then right click the chip and select program and check erase and verify.  And now you have a PassMe2!  Remove the chip from the header/solder and put it back into the casing
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">New Method</span>
<br/>
From darkfader's site, download the sav game for the game programmed for your PassMe2.  Rename the sav to sram.dat in the root and make sure you have the latest firmware (e11 or up) on your M3.  Launch into GBA mode without your PassMe2, then pop it in and turn off the DS.  When you launch it should go to NDS mode.  You should never have to write to the SRAM again.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Old Method</span>
<br/>
Preparing the M3
<br/>
First you want to download <a class="postlink" href="http://pepsiman.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/passme2_mb.gba" target="_blank">this gba file</a> by PepsiMan, and put it on your M3
<br/>
<br/>
Using the PassMe2 steps
<br/>
Remove PassMe2
<br/>
Insert M3
<br/>
Turn on DS
<br/>
Go to GBA mode
<br/>
Run the GBA program*
<br/>
Select the correct setting for the SRAM write and press A
<br/>
Insert PassMe2
<br/>
TurnOff DS
<br/>
TurnOn DS
<br/>
Enjoy M3 in NDS mode
<br/>
<br/>
*<span style="font-style: italic">Note: Some people have had problems with this part, you may want to remove your M3 after running the GBA program and putting it back in before you select the code and write to the SRAM.  But this is just an extra step you can take if you are having problems.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Notes from the Editor:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>After flashing your PassKey to a PassMe2, the LED and switch no longer work and so far there havent been any sucessful codings to make the switch and LED work.
<br/>
</li><li>The correct SRAM code can be found on the back of your DS cart or <a class="postlink" href="http://darkfader.net/ds/games/" target="_blank">here</a>
<br/>
</li><li>I <span style="font-weight: bold">HIGHLY</span> recommend installing FlashMe because the PassMe2 Steps are long and annoying
<br/>
</li><li>I, Jakelshark, am not at this moment in the buisness of selling PassMe2s, reflashing PassKeys, or JTAGs.  Maybe at a later date, which I doubt as the commerical PassKey2 is about to ship

I tried both USA versions -&gt; no go.. :( I even tried the EU version. (/desperate)
<br/>
<br/>
Since then i've gotten myself a copy of polarium, but was not able to reflash the passme.. maybe i've shorted something on the chip.
<br/>
So I guess i'll just order a passme2, and hope the same problems does not occur. (really shouldnt be a concern?)
<br/>
<br/>
When you buy a preflashed passme2, is it only able to hold data for one game passthrough? in that case, how to know which version of the marioDS passme? 
<br/>
<br/>
I've got the Chihuahua Pink Daschund &amp; Friends DS (EU edition)

Then, i have a DS wich needs a passme2, and i have got a passkey1.
<br/>
i?m trying to build the Jtag to convert it into a passkey2, but i?m wondering why, the file with the connections(TCK, TDO, etc) on the Xilinx chip (thaht file is passkey2.gif) has been deleted from wverywhere it was on the net.
<br/>
<br/>
my passkey1, doesn?t have the 6 pads to solder on the back of it. then i have to solder on the xilinx but the schemes have been deleted i dont?know why.
<br/>
Would you please help me on identifying the connections on the xilinx please, or maybe anyone has the *.gif and could e-mail it to me.

I create a new project
<br/>
choose "Automatically connect to a cable and identify Boundary-Scan chain"
<br/>
then my Passkey card red light turns on and at 11% (in less than one second) a dialog pops up titled "Question" - Ther eare many unknown devices being detected. Press Yes to continue or press No to stop. If I choose yes, iMPACT will freeze. No way around it.
<br/>
2. XSVF Player method-

<br/>
ERROR at or near xsVF command #8. See line #8 in the XSVF ASCII file.
<br/>

Recap on Wiring
<br/>
PIN 2 = TDI
<br/>
PIN 3 = TCK
<br/>
PIN 4 = TMS
<br/>
PIN 8 = solder together with 11 and 12
<br/>
PIN11= ^^
<br/>
PIN12= ^^
<br/>
PIN13= solder to TDO and 1/4 2k4OHM resistor
<br/>
PIN15= solder to VCC, positive power of the power source and also the resistor
<br/>
PIN25= solder to GND and negative power of the power source
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone confirm that these two peaces of info are correct?
<br/>
Here are my two results when attempting to program the card:
<br/>
1. iMPACT method -
<br/>
I create a new project
<br/>
choose "Automatically connect to a cable and identify Boundary-Scan chain"
<br/>
then my Passkey card red light turns on and at 11% (in less than one second) a dialog pops up titled "Question" - Ther eare many unknown devices being detected. Press Yes to continue or press No to stop. If I choose yes, iMPACT will freeze. No way around it.
<br/>
2. XSVF Player method-
<br/>
ERROR: TDO mismatch and exceeded max retries
<br/>
ERROR at or near xsVF command #8. See line #8 in the XSVF ASCII file.
<br/>
Execution Time = 0.015 seconds
<br/>
No light turns on with this method
<br/>
<br/>
well that's pretty much where I'm at. Please someone help.
<br/>
Let me know any info you guys can offer.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Trust me--I learned the hard way. Just buy a passkey 2! :D
