    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unfortunately, homebrew products for game consoles tend to become commercialized only once someone figures out how to unlawfully copy proprietary programs using them. Perhaps once the knowledge of how to "dump" commercial ROMs spreads and somebody makes a patch for Nintendo's libraries to make them load assets from GBA ROM rather than a DS card, then the HK manufacturers might introduce a commercialized passthrough.
<br/>
<br/>
It's sad that only pirates can provide the economies of scale to support a market for affordable homebrew tools.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

itll be available on July 21st, 2005...
<br/>
<br/>
no, seriously tho... we cant just go and throw out a date for when things will be commercially available.  the sooner the code is cracked, the sooner itll come out, thats about all i can say.
<br/>
<br/>
if you *really* wanna work on home-brew, figure out how to make your own pass-thru device, or hack the wireless, like others are doing... because... *SOMEONE* has to do it!<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, to pose a question... what are the odds that the old code for the I/O which you claim may be in alternate use are acutally in use through the GBA port itself. In standby the system does recognize both slots as active and can even detect what type of information is in one of them, what if the GBA slot can actually cross communicate with the DS itself.
<br/>
<br/>
Could the GBA port actually just be a com port for the DS? Or is this a totally out there concept? If not... I may start some experimentation...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The flash carts are for GBA, right? Then where is the need for cart swaping if option paks fit in the GBA slot?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, I do very well.  I also remember a rumble pak that had a slot to put your memory card into so that you could use both at once.  Hopefully, that won't ever become necessary.  Hopefully, Nintendo will FINALLY have learned that "Hey, people don't like it when we give them an either/or option, and force them to choose between two things they may want equally".  Seriously, I love Nintendo, but somebody has got to slap some sense into them if they botch it up one more time.

actually, it was a GBA movie player, the one that uses CF cards for storage.  and even stranger than getting the message about a rumble option is that i haven't been able to recreate it since, so it might have just been a fluke.  has anyone with a GBA rumble cart managed to get this message?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
