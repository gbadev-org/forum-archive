<br/>
Just got back from Target and picked up Tony Hawk while I was there. I went home, played for a bit, then I naviagated over to the wireless menu. It asked me if I wanted to pair the cart with this DS, and I said "yes." It then said "Saving" for about 30 seconds, and then my DS locked up completely. 
<br/>
<br/>
I was sure it had messed up my firmware, but then I rebooted and my DS came back up fine. I selected the Tony Hawk game again, and it said my save was now corrupt.
<br/>
<br/>
Just posting my experience to see if anyone else has had this problem.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by UScr00ge on Thu Nov 17, 2005 1:15 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just replying to my own thread because I think it might be a problem with the game itself. i.e. not flashme.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, just one more reply. I've spent about an hour fooling around with this. My conclusion? It's a server problem.
<br/>
<br/>
When you connect for the first time to the Tony Hawk servers, you DS / cart are "paired" and that info is sent to the server. Well, if the server screws it up, then you DS can and probably will crash, resulting in your save being lost. 
<br/>
<br/>
I waited about 30 minutes and tried again after all my original trouble, and managed to get past the "pairing" stage and into the actual Wifi server menu. I immediatetly disconnected, powered down, and powered back up. My save was still intact, and I could easily connect again. I actually tried connecting about 5 or 6 times with no problems.
<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line: Looks to not be a flashme problem at all, which makes sense because Mario Kart works great. I also expect Metroid Prime Hunters and Animal Crossing to work great as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
