    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I've searched high and low.. can't find any reason why I'm experiencing the following problem..
<br/>
<br/>
When I try to flash my DS w/ wifime, it hangs saying "loading game data..", then fails to find a "player" to connect with. In other words, won't find the flash file on the cart..
<br/>
<br/>
I've loaded up the polarium demo successfully using wmb, so I know I'm going through the process correctly..
<br/>
<br/>
I've also tried sending flashme.nds directly over wmb, but all I get is a corrupt logo and the unit hanging about halfway through the fadeout.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using a EFA Linker 512 cart, with no loader. I've also tried the methods for the SuperCard SD. They work fine in my buddy's DS, but not on mine. I'm fairly sure I don't have a new firmware, but then this DS just came back (different unit than the one I sent in) today from warranty due to a bad pixel, so you never know.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess my question is this.. Is this symptomatic of new firmware issues (and therefore SOL until someone with a lot more skill than me figures it out), or is there a way for me to flash this unit? I don't have access to a PassMe, but if that's what it takes I'll go and order one..
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My guess is it's a new firmware issue.

If you do have "red" firmware, are you willing to open your DS and potentially sacrifice your DS for science?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
If all three answers are yes, then try running darkfader's ppflash. It might be able to downgrade your firmware.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">k.. I've looked through the PPflash info seems simple enough.. got a couple of questions..
<br/>
<br/>
where do i connect the VCC/VSS wires? (i'm a wee-bit of a newb at parallel stuff)? For VSS, I see it going to pin 2 of the RFU, but is that extension just for labeling? As for vcc, I just have no clue..
<br/>
<br/>
secondly, any ideas on how to unscrew those damn screws without finding a dedicated bit? Worst case scenario, I can pull out the handy dremel and try to make my own, but if anyone has a tried and true method of pulling this thing apart without the dedicated bit, it would be appreciated
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I'm pretty much ready to go to give this a shot..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
