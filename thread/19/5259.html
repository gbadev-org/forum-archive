<br/>
i've finally found a disassembler, so is there anyone here who's interested in translating assembly into c++ or know of a program that can recompile it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's already a list of carts that work in GBA mode... <a href="http://www.bottledlight.com/ds/index.php/Main/GBAMode" target="_blank">http://www.bottledlight.com/ds/index.php/Main/GBAMode</a>

I bet they all work in DS mode too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
