I literally just bought this M3 Simply and I can't boot anything through moonshell except the homebrew program NitroHax.  I have patched the .nds files with DLDI, but still it says something about bad adapter type.  Am I missing something critical here?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
moonshell is for audio, video and ebooks
<br/>
<br/>
it's not really a launcher for homebrew or roms</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have use moonshell for years to launch homebrew from gbamp and it has always worked. In fact I don't think I've found a homebrew yet that doesn't launch from moonshell.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Both, I installed the latest moonshell because the one that came with the R4 firmware doesn't boot much. Bot usually say "not support adaptor type".<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
