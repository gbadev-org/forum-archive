    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Some people don't have an access point (single computer connecting to internet for example).  By converting the computer to an AP, then their DS can connect to the computer and then connect to the internet (or connect to other devices on your wireless network).  There isn't a gigabit ethernet port for the DS yet. ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It also gives one the option of running a separate access point for their DS - in case they don't like having their main access point limited to WEP (Worthless Encryption Protection).<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC

I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.
<br/>
Thank you, everyone, I look forward to taking advantage of your work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
