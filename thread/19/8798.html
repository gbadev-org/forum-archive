    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm having some trouble getting my Passme/EZF Advance III to work... I was wondering if anyone else could guide me in the right direction?
<br/>
<br/>
From doing a lot of Googling, I've established that the Passme is working- I get both screens white when booting with certain roms booting (DSLinux, specifically)- other, usually smaller files just boot into the normal DS menu screen. Running the GBA cart at this point boots in the old GBA style and then both screens go blank.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem is flashing the files to my flash cart- various websites say that my EZF Advance III should work, but I can't get it to. I've tried writing the .nds.gba files to it using the supplied software, as well as replacing gbloader0.gba (the multi-boot selection menu) in the EZF Program Files directory with what I'm trying to write on there with it. When doing the latter though, I've had to add an additional file through the standard way to get it to write on the cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Any idea where I'm going wrong? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
