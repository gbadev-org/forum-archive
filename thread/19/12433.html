    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I am just starting out programming on the DS. However I find it really confusing as to what flash carts to buy.
<br/>
<br/>
The M3 and r2ds / Supercard, I gather provide an all in one solution which will work on any DS.
<br/>
<br/>
The question is which ones the best. I want to code a game for the DS and put it onto cart and try in a real DS. I suppose I will be coding using Devkitpro.
<br/>
<br/>
I prefer the all in one solution as apposed to pass me and all.
<br/>
<br/>
Can you give me some advice and links on where to buy for the UK.
<br/>
<br/>
Many Thanks,
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For slot1 only device, get an R4.  It's cheaper than M3 Simply but identical hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
Slot2 Supercard Lite + Superkey is still a good option, slightly more expensive than an R4 but it can run GBA homebrew, it can be used as a RAM expansion and it can run homebrew that uses an appended file system.  Just don't get the rumble version since it has no RAM.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
