I tried patching Colors! (originaly R4) to SuperCard DS ONE and i get errors when writing files. This software saves 3 files: thumbnail, strokes and png image. It works perfectly on R4, but on SCDS-1 png gets corrupted, while other files are perfectly ok. 
<br/>
<br/>
Firend of mine tried this on SuperCard SD (slot2) with proper patch and gets no file saved and hangs up.
<br/>
<br/>
Other software can save to card no problem - we tried saving PNGs from DSOrganizer and it worked fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Any idea what might we be doing wrong?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
