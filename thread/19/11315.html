    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry if this has been answered, but I can't find a good answer through search. I've been looking for a good way to get some good DS homebrew going, but for cheap lol. I already have a GBAMP v2 CF and was reading about this whole process of flashing it and using a passme with it to play DS roms off of it. That page is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=26" target="_blank">here</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I have two questions before I go further into this. 1. Which passme would work good with it, cause I know you need one that has Sram. Would the Passcard 3 I think it's called by the same people who make the M3 work? If not that, then what would work?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, are rom sizes limited to 4mb, since thats how big the DS's RAM is, or is it limited to whatever your CF card is?
<br/>
<br/>
It may look like I'm a noob lol, but I had an account on here awhile ago, but I cant remember the password or somethin</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Passcard 3 works with everything.  Passme2 won't work because it requires SRAM and the GBAMP doesn't have any.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have an old phat DS with firmware v3 or lower then you can use Passme1/Passkey1 but that won't work on a newer DS or a DS Lite.  I think the Passkey2 has a switch to change to Passkey1 mode, so that should also work on an old DS.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Which specific "DS roms" are you talking about? Most people on this board don't use the word "roms" to refer to DS homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry I didn't know how to refer to them otherwise....?

The latter, provided that your CF adapter is supported. Likewise, if I wanted some MS-DOS games, or wanted to start making them myself, is everything limited by the 640 KB limit of the PC RAM, or is it limitless except for the hard disk drive size?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The only GBA homebrew that will work on the GBAMP would be multiboot programs that are less than 256 kb in size, like a few of the programs tepples made, available on his <a href="http://www.pineight.com" target="_blank">www.pineight.com</a> site.  Other good ones include Herg's Solitaire and Herg's Yahtzee.  
<br/>
<br/>
In this case, everything IS limited by the 256 kb of RAM that the GBA has.  This is because CF is too slow for the GBA to handle, so only stuff that fits into its RAM will be playable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, GBA homebrew can also use the "limitless" CF card if authors so desired (libfat compiles for both NDS and for GBA). However, I don't know of any games/apps that do this. (Perhaps the 256KB requirement is too restrictive. Whereas on the DS, 4MB is plenty for most things).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

We'll see about that once libfat becomes the default in the next devkitARM, provided that devkitARM doesn't suffer from the same fate as DevKit Advance.

64 KiB was enough for the C64 and Apple II. But another reason that most GBA homebrew programs run directly from a NOR card is that 1. GBA homebrew early adopters all bought NOR cards, and 2. the DS was already out by the time the GBAMP was cracked. Perhaps some of it is my fault for not making an fopen() style wrapper around GBFS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
