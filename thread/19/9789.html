If I flash my DS I will have protection from bricking from other homebrew, right?
<br/>
<br/>
If I flash how will the main menu be when I first turn my DS on? Will it boot straight into homebrew or what?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I would not turn my DS off, if i have shorted the SL1 even if its 0%, i'd keep trying, and trying until its flashed and finished.<br/>_________________<br/>Pure White DS w. Flashme v7

"Should I flash my DS? I have a Max Media Launcher which has made me happy for the past however long i've had it."
<br/>
If you have MML, the only reasons there are to flash are:
<br/>
1) Bricker protection (though some DSes are unbrickable already)
<br/>
2) Ability to send homebrew through WMB (DS Download Play)
<br/>
3) Not having to carry around the MML
<br/>
4) Not having the health warning or the Datel logo (it boots immediately).
<br/>
<br/>
"If I flash my DS I will have protection from bricking from other homebrew, right?"
<br/>
Yes. FlashMe and FWNITRO both add a recovery function to the read-only (when SL1 isn't shorted) area that you can use to restore your firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
"If I flash how will the main menu be when I first turn my DS on? Will it boot straight into homebrew or what?"
<br/>
With FlashMe, it fades in the backlight then jumps straight to whatever homebrew is on the GBA cart. FlashMe Stealth shows the warning screen, then jumps to the GBA cart. Both of these also allow unsigned code to be used with WMB. Otherwise they're the same as the original firmware. FWNITRO shows a menu where you can choose what to run.
<br/>
<br/>
"is it safe to turn off if progress is 0% ?"
<br/>
If you haven't shorted SL1 yet, then yes. Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest you do. It prompts you to press a button sequence before it flashes though; you can shut down at this prompt safely. Also if it stops counting you can just keep fiddling until you get it shorted again; it will just keep waiting as long as the power supply lasts.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
