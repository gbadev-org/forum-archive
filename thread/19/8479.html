I read in one of the other posts that it would be a help if someone could dump this firmware and send it to Loopy.  I have a supercard sd and superpass2 and a fairly good technical knowledge.  I've been reading about and since its an SD it looks like I have to use the dump to SRAM program.  My question is how do I get the firmware from my SRAM on to my computer?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Supercards don't have battery backup for SRAM, so you're out of luck.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you think I should just go for it and flash it?  Flashme said unrecognised firmware and I won't be able to revert back.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not so, you just have to make several blank sav files on the SD card, dump the first part to SRAM, quickly power cycle the DS, and use the SC menu to write the SRAM to the sav file. Repeat for as many blocks as it takes, and concatenate the .sav files to produce the dump.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Press right on the SC menu to access the saves, and select the sav file to write to.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In retrospect, that method wouldn't work - to boot with a pass-2 you need to rewrite the GBA SRAM every time you boot, which would prevent you from using it for saving the firmware.

<br/>
Hmm... I wonder if the other dumper could be rewritten for direct SD access. (I wouldn't know how, but I know there are SD FAT drivers out there.)<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried it with natriums help but with no joy.  So I just decided to flash it anyway and it worked.  So from here, v5 is flashable, other than flashme giving an "unrecognised firmware" message.  I'll leave the firmware dump to someone with better equipment than me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unless you dump a section of the firmware and then save it to a file <span style="font-style: italic">from GBA mode.</span><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
