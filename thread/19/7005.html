    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good thing about Divineo, if you buy from your own affiliate link, you get 15% back (although they only payout when you have a certain amount).  With their cheapest postage option, it only took 3 days to get my M3 from China to Australia.  Buy it from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.divineo.cn/php/affstart.php?affcode=tetrinet&amp;prod=ds-m3cf" target="_blank"> this link</a> to give me commission :)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Wed Oct 19, 2005 8:09 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

This topic was supposed to be a warning against divineo but it's turned into an advertisement.  That's some good marketing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Hang on, wouldn't Credit Card be the best bet, as in that case the payment can be taken back by the card company, and the bill footed by them too. Sounds a little dodgy to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
