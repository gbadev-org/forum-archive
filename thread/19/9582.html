    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">my passme is starting to break, i think. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. i think it's the contacts. so, while it still works, i think i'm going to go ahead and do the flashme (stealth for me). i was thinking about it, making sure i wouldn't be doing anything i'd regret later, and a thought entered my head. will this erase the link between my DS and nintendo wi-fi connection? if it's going to make me get all new friend codes, i think i'll pass.
<br/>
<br/>
are my friend codes safe?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">friends codes are stored on the game cartirage,
<br/>
flashme to my knowlage will NOT affect anything relating to wifi or game codes (excluding the fact that the OLD flashme wrote in an area that was used for wifi connection data..., but that it corrected now :) )
<br/>
<br/>
i flashed my ds,
<br/>
but i don't have that wifi connector so i can't tell you for sure it will not effect it,
<br/>
but it makes no sense that it would.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the first time i set up the WFC, i linked my DS with my nintendo.com account name. i see what you're saying about it not writing over the configuration settings, and i suppose if anything else is stored, it's stored there.
<br/>
<br/>
ok, i'll do it when i get a chance, and i'll post what happens when i'm done.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: i did it, all is well. i was really worried, but it was really, really easy.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks, man.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
