    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you talking about Wi-Fi demo dumping or about demo cart dumping? If you're talking about the former, you need to put a suitable Wi-Fi card in your laptop, sneak it into a convention where Wi-Fi demos are offered, run a packet capture of about 10 demo downloads, and send it off to someone for developing. If you're talking about the latter, take it to Pocket Heaven.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It's because you don't NEED any special documentation to do it. It's no different from capturing WiFi packets between two PC's.
<br/>
Special hardware and software is only needed to communicate with the DS, but not to just listen.

You were the one who originally suggested sending it to someone who knows how "for developing."

But yeah, as Maverick said, if you want to re-assemble it yourself, you've got to figure out what data is what yourself because nobody has really documented that well. Though, at least you can get the demo captured so it can eventually be used.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok...  so, there is no real tutorial on capturing demos.. which is what I thought..  So why doesn't someone that knows how to do it, write one?  It's easy to say "capture the traffic, and build these .bins" but unless you know what your looking at, that is useless information.  Of course, your standard person isn't going to have the skills to figure out what is what in a capture.  But, having the information there would be nice for the rest of us to "learn" even if we have no plans of ever doing it.  How about what capture looks like, and what things you can make out to decide what is what..
<br/>
<br/>
Telling people to bother FireFly isn't the answer..  an nice "step by step" tutorial (high level or not) would be nice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We're talking about this as well in the Nintendogs thread under DS Misc.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you know anyone BESIDES firefly that can put these packets together? If one of these knowledgeable people can teach us these things, that would be ideal.
<br/>
<br/>
Firefly was happy to do it for the E3 demos and even the PokePark demo. He went so far as to decode it, then NOT release it according to the capturer's wishes. He's a good guy. Asking him about this is quite a bit different from "bothering" him.
