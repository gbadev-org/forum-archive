    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As I'm getting more and more in the homebrew world (and even begun coding) I started to feel annoyed by the health screen. I decided to remove it from the DS via FlashMe. And I also didn't need a PassMe then. Well, I started flashing and at 2% my third party battery pack fell out :/ Now my DS doesnt start anymore.. what can I do? :P<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.picfront.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold">www.picfront.com [ Upload your pictures ]</span></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Although almost impossible - try this "standard" revive method:
<br/>
<br/>
Place FlashME on your FlashCart (or GBAmp) as a PRIMARY application (rename it to _BOOT_MP.nds) using no loaders.
<br/>
<br/>
Insert it in DS and hold A+B+X+Y during boot.
<br/>
That may help though it's improbable.
<br/>
<br/>
Other options:
<br/>
<br/>
- Take your DS and lie that it got broken somehow (if the shop assisstant is stupid enough)
<br/>
- Waste another 150$ for a brand new DS (with the new firmware, yay!)
<br/>
- Perform PPFlash. If TheOtherOption #1 fails, you have nothing to lose.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First option didn't work (sadly enough) for me, the second also didn't work. The one at the shop told me to contact Nintendo and let them make it. Third option I'm going to pass, and the last one could be done, but need some more in depth explanation about it. Maybe I can try to send it and maybe I can be lucky to recieve it made or maybe a new one (A). Is there someone who managed to return a DS without firmware? I mean, if the firmware is erased (only writed 2%) who will now? Should I give it a try or would it be to risky?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.picfront.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold">www.picfront.com [ Upload your pictures ]</span></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because people are confused about the difference between what goes on during a recovery boot and what goes on during an ordinary header override.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
