    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I am planning on getting a flash cart to use in my DS and I was wondering about which carts are compatible...I know it has been mentioned before that some do not work with the DS. Could everyone who has confirmed certain flash carts to work/not work with the DS please post the results in this topic, in order to build a list here?
<br/>
<br/>
If I can scrounge up the cash, I would like to get one of the biggest ones available (which I believe is 1 Gigabit). Can anyone tell me their recommendation on the best 1Gb cards? It needs to use a loading procedure that does not use the link port, since I don't have a GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My visoly 256 FlashAdvance does not work, it doesn't fit well in the DS.  I plan to maybe modify it to fit... But as of now, if I force it into the DS the games boot and immedietly lock up.[/url]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
