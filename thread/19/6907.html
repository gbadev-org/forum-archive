    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After looking through the Dslinux.org forums, I came across the ram extension cart armedeus is making, which is just an sd reader with ram added to help with Dslinux. Would it be possible to modify a GbaMP to include onboard ram in case Dslinux supports ram upgrades, because I'm really interested in turning the DS in to a linux handheld.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought that Supercards were modified Gbamp's, but I probably overlooked something. Once armadeus finishes up his memory extension cart, I'll try getting a pcb together and attempting his project. I just wasn't sure if that with chrism doing so many modifications to the firmware of the bamp already, whether or not it would be possible to make a ram modification.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. Probably just me misunderstanding your post, but you can't add ram by modifying some code. It would involve soldering on a chip with lots of tiny pins, and most likely modifying the case to the gbamp somehow to make it fit (cutting etc)
<br/>
<br/>
2. the Supercard and the M3 both include onboard ram, very similar to the 'dslinux ram extension.' the gbamp does not (which is why it is much cheaper probably)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most likely, for the time/money to add RAM to a GBA MP, it'd be cheaper to buy a SC and hack it's firmware to make use of the onboard RAM (in a way not designed by the manufacturer).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You're probably right Linx, I just wasn't sure if it was easier to reverse engineer a supercard, or if it was easier to add ram to a gbamp, which is basically a supercard without ram, and modify chishm's firmware. I forgot how expensive those parts must be if they're non-massproduced.

Thanks everyone,
