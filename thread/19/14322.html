    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My GnM just died...the microSD won't click in like it should.  I know this has happened to many people, but how am I supposed to fix it.  Is it best to just return it and get a new one (though the warranty is probably over) or is there a way to fix it?<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

<br/>
Lots of people have had problems with the springs in microsd slots (not just on the GnM), a lot of people remove the spring and clicker from them.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It won't click in, I push the microSD in and it just pushes it back out.  Right now I have it held in with a piece of tape, but that's not good if I need to remove it.  You can't take apart a GnM because it doesn't have screws, the plastic is fused together on the sides.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
