    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've pretty much decided to buy an R4 (and a microSD obviously), but I want to buy something for slot two that is both capable of booting DS homebrew (using the R4's boot slot two thing) and also be run in GBA mode for GBA homebrew. Does such a thing exist and if several exist which is the best? I have a very old EZ-Flash II Powerstar that's wearing out (and was never very good for homebrew in the first place). Any recommendations/advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks.<br/>_________________<br/>I can't be bothered now...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

the m3 lite perfect is a better card imo, but costs 3-4 times as much as the ez flash 3-1</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GBAMP is probably the cheapest and it is natively supported in libfat (no DLDI  needed most of the time).<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

But that would not satisfy the "GBA homebrew" aspect, unless eyeball226 only wished to run the few GBA games that fit entirely into GBA RAM (known as multiboot).

As far as I am aware, both of those are correct.  I know Phat-sized 3in1s exist, and I know GBA-sized M3 Lite shells exist, but I don't know if the shells still come included with the M3 Lite perfect purchase.  An M3 Perfect MiniSD would sit flush in a DS Phat without needing the shell, as would a Supercard miniSD.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oops...didn't read the part about GBA homebrew...
<br/>
<br/>
So, that leaves you with the M3 series, the SuperCard series, the EZ-Flash, and others (G6, GBA Flash Carts, etc).  I <span style="font-style: italic">THINK</span> the SuperCard CF (CompactFlash) is natively supported in libfat, I'm not sure because I don't own one.  I also think it has RAM and runs GBA programs.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, with Slot-2 devices (when using any DS apps, not GBA), you need a passthrough device.  The R4 can act as a Passthrough (actually, a nopass) but you might need to either remove the microSD for it to function (you have to on the Games n' Music), use a software passme (I found a PASSME.NDS that I use so I don't have to remove my microSD), or the R4 may have the option to hold down a button or a firmware setting for passme, I don't have an R4 so idk.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
