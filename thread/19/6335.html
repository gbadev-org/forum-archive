    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently emailed them, this is the reply I got, with the original questions I asked
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Hi ,
<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, how would we be able to run Nintendo DS games on our Compact Flash
<br/>
carts? Would we run them as dumped .nds files? Or would there be a different
<br/>
format that only your adapter would use?
<br/>
Many people are concerned about DS Clean Dump Rom. Someone recently announced
<br/>
that Dump Tool of DS can dump original DS rom successfully. We had tested the
<br/>
latest program, and indeed can dump original DS rom. However, rom can not run in
<br/>
any Flash Cards. It can run in the Flash Card after added the suitable header &amp;
<br/>
patch . Our plan is that make G6 Flash run all clean dump rom.Due to we are
<br/>
developing this product and have not put them out. We would not give any news
<br/>
out now. But we will announce it later. We are sure that our products will be
<br/>
more convenient than NEOFlash which only can run GST rom.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, what would the costs be for this item, I hope you won't set the
<br/>
new M3 Adapter at a price that's completely ridiculous such as NeoFlash's
<br/>
kit which is currently priced at ~$250.
<br/>
 We are undecided the price temporarily .Due to the market has been changed
<br/>
continuously, we knew that the price has been decided competitor's price
<br/>
very much..But the price is more inexpensive than NEOFlash .We will inform you
<br/>
later .
<br/>
And finally, are we going to have to use any patches or PassMe style boot
<br/>
methods to run these Nintendo DS games on Compact Flash cartridges?
<br/>
You must use with PassMe or Passkey.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They're being really cautious with the amount of information they share.. I think they might be doing the same as GST though with releasing either patched roms or patches for the roms so that they will load, as I can't think of another method to force real NDS games to run on a flashcart + passme, unless something in their M3 firmware does it for you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If a PassMe redirects execution to the GBA slot, what's the problem?  Do real games look for data in a certain place that the PassMe can't negotiate?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Commercial Nintendo DS games that are intended to run on DS cards look for asset data on the DS card. They would have to be patched to read assets from the GBA ROM rather than from the DS card, the same way pirated GameCube games are (auto-)patched to read from the broadband adapter rather than from the disc.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
