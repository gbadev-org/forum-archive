    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the m3 real is probably the best cart at the moment
<br/>
<br/>
it's having a bit of launch problems, but overall is pretty good, and SDHC support is a very nice thing to have
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've got a m3 ds simply + m3 lite perfect which is a great package, but if I had it to do all over again, I'd trade them both for a m3 real perfect bundle</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"Really good compatibility" with homebrew would seem to require a SLOT-2 solution, as you can't run Game Boy Advance homebrew from SLOT-1 without copying it to a card in SLOT-2 first. Fortunately, you can use your GnM as a NoPass for any SLOT-2 card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, the popular SLOT-2 cards can run homebrew that connects to the Internet.
<br/>
<br/>
The two most popular SLOT-2 cards historically have been SuperCard and M3. M3's RAM is faster so <span style="font-style: italic">some</span> GBA programs will run faster.
<br/>
<br/>
Next question is which size of SuperCard you want. <ul><li>SuperCard SD sticks out about 1 cm from a GBA or DS and about 2 cm from a DS Lite. It takes Secure Digital (SD) memory. </li><li>SuperCard miniSD is the size of an official Game Boy Advance Game Pak. This means it fits flush in a GBA or DS and sticks out about 1 cm from a DS Lite. It takes miniSD memory. </li><li>SuperCard Lite fits flush in the DS Lite, just like the SLOT-2 cover that came with the DS Lite, but does not fit in a GBA or original DS. It takes microSD memory. </li></ul>
<br/>
Here's how I got my cousin's SuperCard SD to run DS homebrew on a stock DS: <ol type="1"><li>Remove the microSD card from your Games n' Music adapter. </li><li>Insert the GnM in SLOT-1 and the SuperCard in SLOT-2. </li><li>Power on the DS. </li></ol><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But make sure not to get the SuperCard with rumble. Those have a vibrator in place of the RAM chip, and without the RAM chip, you can't use GBA software.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If all you have is the Nintendo USB Wifi adapter, you'll need to turn it into a softAP for homebrew to connect to it.  If you've got a home network via a router, you should be fine out of the box.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
