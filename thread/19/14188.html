    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all, I need to delete a file off of my MK5 (Slot-1) without the linker card. Any chance I could patch DSFile with GBAMP's and MK5's DLDI drivers? I tried patching it with the MK5 driver and running it off my GBAMP but it didnt detect a slot-1 card inserted.

NOTE: I cannot boot into my MK5</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DSFile only supports one DLDI patch at a time.  This isn't anything on my part, but I used Chishm's libfat in DSFile, and libfat can only be patched with one DLDI.  You could boot DSFile FROM your MK5, patching it with the MK5 driver, then deleting the file, but I'm not sure, if MK5 uses flash memory, you probably couldn't get DSFile on there in the first place (never heard of MK5, so I don't know how it works).  There's a problem where DSFile won't boot from Slot-2's, but this must be an issue with Libfat, as I use the normal inits and stuff.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Seriously guys, how hard is it to simply TRY something yourself?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've gone through and realized that multiple patchings is not possible. I had a other thought though; what if I made a custom driver that would disguise the gbamp as a mk5? If its a matter of the bootloader I could easily do that too (GBAMP is very simple in booting afaik). I looked into it a little and it looks like I would have to change both the loader and the driver.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It could be feasible if the DLDI patcher could recognize the difference between Solt-1 and Solt-2 and patch them to 'sectors.'  But then, programs would have to have a 'switch' of sorts and be able to tell if there is 1 or 2 patches.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
