    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As a proud new owner of a shiny DS Lite, I have yet to decide on a method for developing homebrew (with all the crazy combinations of NoPass, Supercards, etc). I've been lurking for a couple days and out of all the possible combinations, the M3 DS Simply seems to be the easiest and most reasonable solution.
<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts from the seasoned pro's of NDS development?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The name screams Engrish.  It won't be able to run any homebrew that has an appended filesystem like GBFS.  Anything that tries to save to GBA SRAM won't be able to save.  It has no RAM, so it's not great for dslinux or viewing extremely large images with moonshell or running large Genesis games.  Anything that uses a FAT library will need to be updated.  They say they will release source code when the product is out, hopefully that's true.  SC DS One already has usable FAT code.
<br/>
<br/>
DS homebrew will slowly start becoming more compatible with slot 1 devices, so it's not a bad purchase but don't expect to be able to run all existing homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Mon Jan 15, 2007 8:40 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So what you're saying is that homebrew that isn't supported yet, could be supported in the future?
<br/>
<br/>
The things I was most interested in was the mp3, movie, and picture capability as well as being able to run something like DSorganize. It's also pretty neat how you can back up games, which means you don't have to carry all your cartridges with you and risk losing them.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, I'm going to wait for some reviews of the M3 DS Simply before I make the investment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How's homebrew compatibility?
<br/>
<br/>
If you could run a quick test of a few popular ones, say:
<br/>
Beup, dslinux, dsdoom, NESDS, DS Organize, MoonShell, MegaETK
<br/>
<br/>
and anything else you want.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
