Simply put, it means that MagicKey3 contains 256/512 Mbit of flash memory (like in G6 flashcart ) to store homebrew ROMs , and 8-16 Mbytes of RAM (like in SuperCard or G6 ), for launching these ROMs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, it has similar functionality. You can buy one or another - it's all the same.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks Kir. So with the last options there's no need for a flash card in the gba slot then because you already have the rom/ram with the Magic Key? If so this is a VERY good price.<br/>_________________<br/>-Unrequited</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, you still have to put a GBA flash cart into GBA slot. It is required to boot MagicKey.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If you use the Magic Key 2's MMC / SD slot for storing homebrew, what's the point in the v3, with its on-board extra space and 'zip' ram?

Still, interesting to see the memory cards slotting into the PassMe itself, rather than going through the GBA slot. Shame you still need a GBA flash card, really.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This feature is useful if you don't have a SD or MMC flashcard. In that case you use internal memory for ROMs storage.  And even if you have SD card, 32 Mbytes of spare SDRAM  (it will be "ZIP ram"  in engrish :) ) could be quite useful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So what it sounds like is for someone like me who has no flash cart or anything, I'd be better off getting the M3 which can do all of this only with a CF card, without needing an SD card or flash cart or whatever. Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But the rest is confusing me. So does this thing eliminate the requirement for something to be stuck into the GBA slot?!<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

I do dislike the Neo Flash for other reasons as well. Their site looks like it advocates piracy, and the prices I've seen are a bit obscene (it's far cheaper to buy a PassMe, a GBAMP, and a CF card, as I'll likely do).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I run the firmware test with the Pictochat trick and I have 2 green screens...
