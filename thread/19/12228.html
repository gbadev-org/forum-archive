    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now, I'm sure everyone knows I'm a huge supporter of FlashMe and it's "insurance" with the Recovery code.. But, now that Slot-1 devices are becoming more and more popular (and are usable for homebrew thanks to Chishm) people still need to install FlashMe for the security of knowing they won't end up with a $130 chunk of plastic.  But, if they only own a Slot-1 device, they will still be screwed as the recovery code force boots the DS to Slot-2..  Uh oh..
<br/>
<br/>
So, if there was every a time to pull FlashMe out of the dust and put out a V8, this would be a good time..<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah.. Something tells me he doesn't realize the risk of running unauthorized (homebrew) code on the DS without FlashMe installed.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is certainly a valid concern. FlashMe's built-in recovery code is incompatible with slot 1 devices, so if your firmware got corrupted, you'd have to buy a slot 2 device to fix it. :-/ I do wonder though if there's even any chance of fitting slot 1 boot code into the failsafe region. Apparently FlashMe's already pretty stuffed, and the code would probably be more complicated than slot 2 (so even making a version supporting only slot 1 may not work); since they emulate/are a DS card, you'd need to do authentication and all that fun.
<br/>
<br/>
I might just try to write my own custom firmware, there's a few things about FlashMe that bug me, such as forcing the backlights on. (Not to mention the legal issues.)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
