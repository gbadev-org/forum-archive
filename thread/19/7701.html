Can I use either of these to fix my GBAMP?  I know that I can use Pocketnes with two GBAMP's as a fix, but I don't have another GBAMP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And put the .nds file on M3. Start it in NDS mode and load ndsmp.nds. When it runs, pull out M3 and insert GBAmp. Voila!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Chishm would have to change the program to allow for a cart swap for that to work (or someone else could do it since the source is available).  The only other solution I can think of would involve using a WiFiMe-capable wireless card to send Chishm's program to your FlashMe'd DS with the GBAMP already inserted.  I've done that to update his firmware hack without having to write the file to my CF card (I'm lazy).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The GBAMP is almost unkillable.

Unless you erase the flash and then remove it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

can you tell me how you send flashmp to the ds with out using the flash card.I have used the wmb -data flashmp.nds command and I can't get it to work.  I have a wifi setup and need to recover my supercard. Don't know what happen but it has 2 white screen. it's not seeing the unit at all, just as if there was no firmware, thought I try this before trashing the supercard sd
<br/>
thanks
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Well, that's the command I use.  What error are you getting when you run it?  You are sending the program to a FlashMe'd DS, correct (just making sure)?
<br/>
<br/>
Here's my setup:
<br/>
<br/>
-WifiMe compatible card with Firefly's driver installed
<br/>
-FlashMe'd DS
<br/>
-GBAMP
<br/>
<br/>
Procedure:
<br/>
<br/>
-Start up DS with GBAMP inserted while holding Start+Select
<br/>
-Run command: wmb -data flashmp.nds on PC
<br/>
-Select Download Play option from DS menu
<br/>
-Follow instructions on DS to flash GBAMP
<br/>
<br/>
Does this help?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I didn't notice you were trying to fix a supercard using a program designed for GBAMP (even though your post says "supercard" three times, guess I was tired last night).  Unless the supercard makers have a similar .nds update file, you can't use the same procedure.  Anyone with a supercard know how to help pg65?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Man oh man!  My attempts to help you have been the worst misreading mistake I've ever made on any forum.  In my defense, flashmp.nds was the name of Chishm's file to flash the GBAMP with his firmware hack (he's recently changed it to ndsmp.nds).  Anyway, as I don't own a supercard and I'm not familiar with Darkfader's version of flashmp, I'm going to stop embarrassing myself with any more attempts to help you.  Sorry for the confusion and good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It was called flashmp because I used DarkFader's flashing tool to install my hack. But this got confusing, so I renamed it to ndsmp, which is also a better description of what it does (NDS for the MP).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
