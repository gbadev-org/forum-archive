    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">both are about the same for current homebrew, however older homebrew sometimes has troubles with scsd, only a few games/apps, but there are a few</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, but i believe list files/directories is very slow for sd cards at the moment, but thats not too much of a problem. i own a supercard minisd and the only things i have had problems with (that i can blame on the card) so far are nethackDS and hereticDS. otherwise sometimes things take a little tweaking with patchers and other versions, but ive gotten them to work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, libfat definately does. I believe the official version of the old gba_nds_fat does not, but there are several modified versions that do. (dragonminded's, wintermute's, probably more).
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure on compatibility with the minisd or microsd ones. I would assume it's the same as SD, since mini/micro/SD are all electrically compatible, but it's possible the supercard internals have changed somehow.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Supercard SD... I have a Supercard Lite and superkey as of last week and it runs everything... plus it has the extra RAM built in for future apps.  I don't know why anyone would go with anything else.

I'll tell you right now though, you are gonna need more than 265MB.... I have a gig and i was up to 600MB used in a couple hours, hah.<br/>_________________<br/>Nintendo DS Onyx :: Supercard Lite :: Superkey :: 1GB microSD</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
