Now I doubt I could find the Metroid Demo boxes still, so is there a chance that a barebones silver DS has the old firmware on it?

Maybe I'll just try a used one from Gamestop or EB, anyone know how much they go for?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You'd probably have a better chance new with a silver one that isn't part of a bundle, but even so if it doesn't have the Metroid demo you have a chance of the new firmware...if it's used I would guess you probably wouldn't have this risk though, or at least a diminished risk.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
