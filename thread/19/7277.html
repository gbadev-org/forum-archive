I have put both the .bin file and the.nds on the flashcart and also in the wmb folder and then flashed wifime2 to the DS. All I then get is a demo of a air hockey game!

I presume this was suppose to be a test to allow the new flashme to be run on the new DS i.e. Blue, Pink etc

Current processors can execute around 2^32 operations per second (~4.3GHz CPU, being generous here). So if a RSA check can be done in one clock (which is unlikely, but whatever), we need 2^57 CPU seconds which is roughly 4,569,862,636 years. With one million computers, each checking RSA keys at a frequency of 4.3GHz (yeah, right), you need 4,570 years.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You will see people were saying the exact same thing about the NDS cart encryption.. but you know what?  We have it..  Or.. people have it.. ;)

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Actually, by using a marvellous invention called a 'calculator', we can estimate how long it might take. If you assume 1bn keys/sec (which is ridiculously generous), you'd need 9.5 million years of CPU time to search the entire keyspace. By way of comparison, seti@home has so far accumulated a mere 2.2m CPU years over a period of 5 years.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
And that project lasted.. what?  5 days?  I mean, I missed a day or so, and got screwed in "the race".  So, did the small collection of homebrew computers have more power then the seti@home project, or are we all quick to make up numbers and not really know what it would take to crack the encryption.  Like I said on IRC..
<br/>
<br/>
The only way to be sure that we do not crack the encryption is to not try.  It only takes 1 lucky guess to crack it, and if that lucky guess is the 5 or 6th guess, then it will have been cracked in a few minutes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You will see people were saying the exact same thing about the NDS cart encryption.. but you know what?  We have it..  Or.. people have it.. ;)

Mostly because they managed to read low ARM7 BIOS in some undisclosed way. And reportedly, it contains the encryption/decryption seeds.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, DS cart encryption is many orders of magnitude easier to crack than 1024-bit RSA. DF could have used a FPGA with parallel checking units to do that, instead of a bunch of computers :P<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's a really big non-Mersenne prime, but still a prime of a special form :)

I can guarantee you that they didn't check the entire range, and used some smart algorithm. In fact: <a href="http://wiki.seventeenorbust.com/index.php/SeventeenOrBust" target="_blank">http://wiki.seventeenorbust.com/index.php/SeventeenOrBust</a>

So what your saying is, you can still use WMB to directly send and load demos but wifime just cant boot stuff from flash card anymore

So WMB still works fine but wifime wont boot on new DS firmware or something like that

<br/>
Yes, but you need to reflash the superpass, and figure out the pins for the cheap JTAG cable.
<br/>
You then need to go to <a href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">www.ndshb.com</a> and get the sram.bin file and new CPLD file for a game you own. 
<br/>
This is easier with the passme because the pinouts well known/easy to find. You can then run flashme from a GBA flash cart.
<br/>
Throw away your superpass.

Well, DS's replacement just came back, and I'm pretty sure it has the new firmware. How can I tell for sure? It's silver. When I try to use Wifime to run Flashme it hangs at Nintendo's 'Loading Game Data' screen.
<br/>
<br/>
If it does have the new firmware, will I be able to use a passme2 and my supercard CF to run the new Flashme? From what I have gathered, this involves loading a bin into the sram, and I don't know if this is possible with the supercard.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I bit the bullet 2night. Went out to buy one of those tiny screwdrivers sets, downloaded the latest flashme_stealth.nds prepended the ndsloader.bin to make a flashme_stealth.nds.gba that i flashed to my advance pro 256 flashcard. card in the gba slot, opened the DS peeled of the little sticker with this pincet that came with the screwdrivers (very handy). Launched wmb -data wifi , booted up the DS downloaded the wifime and launched the flashme from theflash card. X+B+X+B fidled with the pincet to short out sl1 and voila a beautifully reflashed DS is the result. Thanks to guys who put all their effort and knowledge in creating these fine pieces of software and of course this forum for providing us with endless threads of info on what and what not to do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, new theory:
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be possible to build flashme into the actual wifime program? That would eliminate the need to redirect code execution to a flash cart, but I'm not sure the limitations of the Mario 64 header.<br/>_________________<br/>It's 'CubeGuy.' One word.
