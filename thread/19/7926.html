    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, it's not that bad, but still - I inserted the device to test a couple of homebrew, later took it out and inserted my Advance Wars DS only to see "There is no DS Card inserted". I took it out, peered inside the slot to see that four of the reading pins were bent out of their place. I tried to put them back with a small, flat screwdriver, but they passively refused. What can I do? It's past the warranty date :/. I have an appropriate screwdriver from back when I was installing the Afterburner to my GBA but I'm afraid to break the slot completely. Are there spare slots on sale somewhere? :&lt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On one of my Ds's, the SuperPass spoiled my Ds slot. I cant put cartridges in there anymore. When I do, it just pops back out...<br/>_________________<br/>It's so easy to be wise. Just think of something stupid, then dont do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow.. how do you do that?  I've inserted a ton of PassMes into my DS, as well as my own PassMe a few hundred times and I've never bent a pin yet.

Maybe I just need to push harder?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you force the passme along the top side of the DS cartridge slot (the side with the pins) i imagine you could bend them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
