    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just found one of my really old pieces of GBA-homebrew and wondered if there was a way to launch it on Nintendo DS using the GBAMP CF that I'm using for NDS-homebrew. The game/demo is quite small and I seem to remember I was running it on the GBA without a flashcart - not sure how I did that.

Who knows how?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The program has to be smaller than 250 KB or so, and it has to be linked for multiboot. If you were running it on the GBA without a flash card before, you were probably doing it through an MBV2 or XBOO cable.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks, that worked somewhat. The latest version of my old demo was too big though, so I can't boot that. Any way to boot that as well? I might have just used an emulator back when I made it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think there is, unless you buy a gba flash cart, they should be cheap by now.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
