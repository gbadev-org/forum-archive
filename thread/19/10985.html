    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi all! im new to the ds homebrew,ive just got today a passcard3 with a m3 mini sd , but im having some doubts. 
<br/>
<br/>
Is the extend option the moonshell interface?because i cant run games from this "extend" option... i understand that it runs behind the gba movie player.
<br/>
Also when i choose the extend mode is it supposed to use the two screens?because at first i thought it was to "extend" to the upperscreen, but it doesnt do that. it just switches to the windows style navigator and it only uses the lower screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Also im trying to run scummvm ds with this combo but i cant run the games because i dont really know the rules for my passcard3 + m3 mini-sd combo, i've tried to create zip files with folders inside, folders with zip, and even folders with the game uncompressed and i always get the "zip file check...Not in use!".....Any help?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
