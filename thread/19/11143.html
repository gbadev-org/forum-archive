yes, you CAN use it in your gba.
<br/>
g6flash has 2 menu's:
<br/>
1 for nds and 1 for gba.
<br/>
just try it and you should see that it works</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm pretty sure that you can use the G6 Lite in GBA mode by either removing your NoPass or by holding Select to skip FlashMe. If this works, then yes, you can try putting the G6 Lite in a GBA cart case and it won't know the difference.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
