    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">what card is it? if its a ralink 2561s (not 2561st) then i dont think its right. the vid/pid dont match what the tutorial sez u need to have. Also, i had tried a Zonet ZEW1601, which looks to be a RT2561S and it doesn't work. I've never heard of ralink 2561st though. it's not even on the page of cards ur supposed to check.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
