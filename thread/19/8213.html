    <h4>#67890 - Auron - Sat Jan 21, 2006 3:33 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been closely following the DS Homebrew movement, and finally waiting to get the neccesary utilities, so I can begin testing code. 
<br/>
<br/>
But, before I throw away money, I just want to make sure what I should throw it on. I have a low income, so I can't afford too many mistakes.
<br/>
<br/>
I recently bought a DS with the Mario Kart bundle. I've already used the test method by a member here, and I have a yellow screen. (Firmware version 4, I believe). This means I need a PassKey version 2. 
<br/>
<br/>
Because I wouldn't want to risk my in-store warranty, I'm afraid of flashing it. So I was wondering, what flash writers/readers/whatever would be the best to run homebrew software on.
<br/>
<br/>
NDS PassKey 2 and M3 Adapter CF version, NDS PassKey 2 and M3 Adapter SD version (I seriously don't know any differences of the SD and CF cards, other than incompatibility), Smart Card Linker for NDS/SP/GBA, MK3 (MagicKey 3) inc. 256M Flash, and MK3 (MagicKey 3) inc. 512M Flash 
<br/>
<br/>
Please, I don't want childish answers, I've seen users on here respond like clueless apes. If there was already a topic like this, I'm sorry, I may have over looked the search then. 
<br/>
<br/>
Expecting an answer soon, with regards,
<br/>
<br/>
Auron.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm personally a fan of the M3...all current compact flash using homebrew I can think of work with it and it's onboard memory allows it to simulate a GBA flash cart for anything that needs to run from a flashcart.  It's pretty compatible, I've only found a couple of things that don't run, or don't run quite right.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I prefer the CF version mostly because it seems like there isn't so much homebrew support for the SD version as of this time it'd seem.  Other than that I'm not sure of there being much difference.  I think the software and the firmware of the M3 CF and SD are pretty similar as far as functionality goes.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and whatever you do, avoid any 'Magic Key' Neoflash stuff like the plague.  It's all way way overpriced, especially the 'normal' flash cart type ones.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, so it seems I'm better off with the M3 CF then. One last question, will I need to flash my DS in order to transfer homebrew software on the DS to work? Or is it redundant, if I have the PassKey 2?

Any more help appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But you have to carry the PassKey2 around with you, and you have to play with SRAM. For the most part, FlashMe means you can skip loading SRAM and leave your PassKey2 at home.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

This means either using FlashMe and booting your code via WMB (you need a compatible card for this), or a loader someone released a while back which runs from a flash card and downloads them (essentially the same but works with any card; never really used it though).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Except that as of yet, you can't use passme2(and clones) with a gbamp. 
<br/>
<br/>
There is a workaround that lets you use passme2 + commercial gba cart + gbamp, but last i heard, nobody has gotten it to work. (the buttonwait / pushstart sram code).
<br/>
<br/>
supercard is a bit cheaper than m3 ($50 vs $85), and does pretty much all of the same stuff. both of them should work with passme2. 
<br/>
<br/>
and using flashme is HIGHLY recommended. passme2 is somewhat of a pain to use, requires fiddling with the SRAM on your gba cart, plus it has the big thing sticking out of the back of your DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
if you're worried about your warranty, install the 'stealth' version, which leaves the health &amp; safety screen in-tact.

Unless you followed the GBA homebrew scene. In that case you can put FlashMe on a GBA card that doesn't enforce use of a GBA-mode menu.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Alright, I'll be sure to use this version of FlashME. (That is, if I ever Flash it)

I always thought the GBAmp was the better choice (my friend has one also), but the thing is, I heard that the quality of video is pretty crappy. Yeah, I want to watch episodes of like 24 or House. Got a problem? :p

Another question, will I still need the PassKey if I Flash my DS?

Alright, thanks again, I accidentally ordered an M3, but I already cancelled it. (Called the idiots at the site.) I'll just wait for a bit before I get what I need.

You should use MoonShell's DPG (DSMPEG video) capability.  I personally think it beats out the M3 even on video quality (only caveat is audio will be mono, but the video quality is quite good with small filesizes).

Once you flash your DS, you can put your PassKey away (since FlashMe pretty much adds the PassMe function into your DS, eliminating the need for a PassMe). I'd keep it around, just in case (once in a great great while I'll encounter something that boots via PassMe that doesn't in FlashMe).<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, sorry for the bump. It seems that Moonshell does look like a very promising program, so I think I'm going with the cheap solution of a GBAmp and FlashME instead.

Well, I just checked the list, there's only one guy in Toronto, and he doesn't have anything at all (same position as me pracitically.)

I'm just gonna have to look forward to shelling out some cash for the M3 then. Or I could always wait till the summer.

Well, thanks alot everyone for your help. If I find out some weird type of hasty solution I can come up with, I'll be sure to post here, and verify, if i'm doing the right thing...

Given your post count and join date, I'm guessing that you never got into the GBA homebrew scene. (Otherwise I would have suggested using a PassMe2 or clone with the GBA flash card that you would have already had.) But you can still use the SuperCard, which might be a bit cheaper at stores such as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.kicktrading.ca/index.php?currency=CAD&amp;cPath=23&amp;sort=3a&amp;osCsid=762197329154640f050a0e4ff153a96e" target="_blank">Kick Trading</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Alright, one of my last few questions.
<br/>
<br/>
Let's say I bought an M3 CF, with a PassKey2, would I need to program it myself? I'm not looking forward to that part, as I suck at hardware stuff... (I'm only a software guy)
