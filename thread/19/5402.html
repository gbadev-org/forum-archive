    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought about it... it could be RAM-based also. There are other dev-cartridges and those are flash-based for sure since they don't have that PCB connector.
<br/>
Anyway, they are too expensive for you and me... just wait a bit for cheaper cartridges :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The real one I've seen (I had a chance to play on a pre-production devkit at work a few months before they came out when a publisher visited) was similar - a big long thing poking out the back with some sort of connector at the end for debugging and stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
1 - you have sufficient skill with the proverbial soldering iron
<br/>
<br/>
2 - access to the appropriate parts

<br/>
3 - enough Metroid cards to spare
<br/>
<br/>
4 - no qualms about header copyrights
<br/>
<br/>
How hard would it be to build something like those two, but unlike the Passthrus?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The PCB connector at the top is to plug a tiny daughterboard which has the game save chip. They did it this way to let developers mix and match the cartridge size they want with the game save size they want. As far as I know, they are all flash based, although they come in different size and layout, and now they seem to come in a more robust plastic casing ( as in <a href="http://gbadev.org/ds_flash.jpg" target="_blank">http://gbadev.org/ds_flash.jpg</a> )
<br/>
<br/>
These aren't that expensive, but you have to be an official developer (that you can be if you are a development company with some track record or support from a publisher) to order these.
<br/>
And you need a development kit to flash them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Of course, gaining "some track record" with commercially published titles will usually have to be on PC with OpenGL (pushing the developer toward the PSP) or on PC with DirectX (pushing the developer toward the Xbox).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
The more capacity the longer it is.
<br/>
The connector at the end is for the save game memory
<br/>
It is programmed with the official devkit then it is used just like a regular cartidge.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
