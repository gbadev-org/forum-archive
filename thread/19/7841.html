    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering, since I have gotten my M3 SD, I have no SD card to use from &gt;_&gt;... so I was wondering which is the best... or are able to run most things (from what I heard, some homebrew don't work with SD but CF it works).
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I want personal opinions... not the PHWiki Site for M3, as some of the products aren't available over here. (Australia)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

is a compatible list;

keep in mind: FUNZIONA, in green, is work; NON FUNZIONE, in red, is not work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe the beginning of that list was taken directly from the M3 wiki Italian translation (The castlevania test was envisaged on the M3 wiki, and the numbers decided by a contributor.)
<br/>
<br/>
The Wiki can be found at <a href="http://leo.rampen.ca/m3wiki/index.php/M3" target="_blank">http://leo.rampen.ca/m3wiki/index.php/M3</a> - the Compatibility list for SD and CF cards isn't as comprehensive as the one on that forum though - perhaps someone with knowledge of italian could update the wiki with some of those cards.

I bought a Sandisk 256MB card today and it is working. After the firmware update my 512MB Toshiba card is working, too. Before the update it was not found by the M3.
<br/>
<br/>
DO NOT BUY KINGSTON. My Kingston Elite Pro (most expensive card ever) does not work!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
