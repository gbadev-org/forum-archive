    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Recently, a batch of fake R4 was discovered. Some persons stuck a R4 sticker to some kind of a card, put it in a box very similar to the R4 box, and tried to sell it as such.
<br/>
<br/>
Important distinguishing features:
<br/>
The fake card uses internal memory. R4 uses MicroSD cards. If it doesn't have a MircoSD card slot, it's fake.
<br/>
If the box has a "2GB" sticker, it's fake.

<br/>
<br/>
Edit: It was claimed that it is a Firelink card, but the Firelink card company <a class="postlink" href="http://www.yxjzy.com/bbs/read.php?tid=24265" target="_blank">said</a> it is not their product.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDSh" target="_blank">Nintendo DS homebrew on Wikipedia</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by felix123 on Sun Mar 18, 2007 10:28 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
