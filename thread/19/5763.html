<br/>
I went out and bought a new router from the list compatible with WiFiMe.
<br/>
Everytime I try to install the router it automatically finds a driver for it and doesnt let me choose my own. I have searched google for over an hour and nothing works. Ive done an HD search for the driver filename (RT2500) and deleted all of the driver files from my harddrive and it recreates them. Ive gone in the registry and disabled hardware autodetect and it still autodetects it.
<br/>
My OS is Windows XP and the router is a Linksys WMP54G v4 PCI
<br/>
Has anyone else had this problem and been able to fix it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ack, it was so simple.
<br/>
As soon as I posted this I thought of something and it worked!
<br/>
I went into Device Manager, chose Update Driver, I will choose the driver to install, and picked it. It works great!
<br/>
I dont know how I could have forgotten that, I feel a bit stupid now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had the same problem when trying to install the latest version of the driver. Even when I tried Update Driver, it auto-installed the Linksys driver without prompting me (with autodetect off, too). I ended up uninstalling everything, removing the PCI card, restarting into WinXP without it, shutting down, then reinstalling the PCI card, booting into WinXP, and THEN I had the choice of driver again.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
