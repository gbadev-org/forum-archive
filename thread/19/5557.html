    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i think order a play yan for its sd cards capabilities (witch fit just well on a gba cardridge not like CF). Do you think it will be possible to allow code execution from a sd card through the play yan with the help of a firmware modification. I just begin to learn coding (java and now C++) and if the experts of DS hardware say this is not an impossible, i'd like buying this stuff and working on that.

I doubt it, since the play-yan is a strictly GBA device which just happens to run on the DS. It's rpetty much in the same position the SuperCard is.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and you're English is pretty good. I wouldn't worry about it really, especially since this is the Internet and native English speakers don't do so well either. They are all like "let's go pwnz0r some fags, yo, and ir213374u"

So if it is like supercard, i think remember have read that Darkfader is implementing CF reading in the firmware. So maybe it is not impossible.
<br/>
<br/>
If you read this Darkfader, what do you think about it ? And of course someone else may know...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Cool, I taught English in Nagano six years ago! Are you at the engineering campus or the "everything else" campus? Ahhh, memories...<br/>_________________<br/>"Jesus saves, but everyone else in a 10 foot radius takes full damage from the fireball."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
