    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've looked at the rumble feature of my SuperCard SD Rumble every since I got it. Although I have never had the chance to actually feel it, it seems like it would produce a muuuch better rumble than the DS Option pack. Problem is, I can't figure out a way to actually test that.
<br/>
<br/>
I have two DS games (real carts, not ROMs) called Diddy Kong Racing, and Star Fox Command, that both use the rumble feature, and both work with my Official DS Rumble Pak. Essentially, I'm looking for a way to convince them to work with the rumble feature on the SuperCard SD Rumble.
<br/>
<br/>
I really think there should be action replay codes to do this. I sort of remember one being mentioned for Metroid Pinball, but I can't remember for the life of me where I saw it. I also think this might work if there were an action replay code that could cause the game to think there was an option pak inserted, although I cannot be certain if the Supercard's rumble feature is accessed the same way.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else on-site wondered these same things? Does anyone possibly have a solution? Any help here would be great, as I present to you my severe lack of understanding.

PS: For starters, if there is a homebrew app that can run the rumble, that would work. I really want to see if I can get it working with my commercial carts though.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the only software provided by the company is a rom patch for Metroid Pinball. Maybe you could see what is changed by the patch and figure out how to drive the rumble.
<br/>
<br/>
And you can feel the rumble using the self test mode. Hold L+R then power on.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDSh" target="_blank">Nintendo DS homebrew on Wikipedia</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Problem is that's not going to work. I want this to work on a real (legal) cart, so I'll need to be able to create an action replay code with this data, and then implement it using Nitro Hax. Although using a ROM would technically be ok, sortof, I don't really want to, as I prefer to use original carts for my official gaming needs. ^_^
<br/>
<br/>
The patch will help a lot though, as I'll be able to figure out just what has to be done code wise. Thanks!

Hmm... I used the startup test, and I'm not sure I really prefer this rumble either. It works (which is a plus compared to the official pack) in that it actually vibrates the DS. It works a little too well though, and this may have something to do with the shape of the actual card. (I have the big fat one.) It vibrates the card itself within the DS, causing the actual rumbling to be (if possible) louder than the DS speakers. Not a nice trade off imho, I was kinda hoping it would be quieter... If I hold the card in with my hand while it vibrates then it works like it should, which definitely tells me I need to look into a different card for my slot2.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh well. Here's hoping Nintendo does something bright and releases a Rumble Pak 2 that works properly... (I'm not holding my breath...)<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
