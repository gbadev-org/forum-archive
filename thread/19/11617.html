    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I?ll tell the story.
<br/>
<br/>
I~m here with a couple of friends on a DS players meeting and we started flashing several DS?s.
<br/>
<br/>
We got one Lite, started the flashing and around 10% it turned of. No recovery method would work (A+B+ST+SEL or the other one). So, what we did was open a working one (flashed already) and do the bios changing thing.
<br/>
<br/>
First, we took a working bios and plugged on the bricked DS. It woudn?t turn on at all. Weird!
<br/>
<br/>
Then we took the "bricked" bios and put on the working DS. It booted with the fail-safe feature. We opened the Flashme and it continued from where it stopped (11%). Okay, it flashed to the end. We have 2 working bios.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, the DS that had the bad bios won?t turn on with any of the bios we put on it! =( If we try to turn it on, nothing, nothing happens. If we plug the charger, the orange light turns on and then turns off.
<br/>
<br/>
What happened to this DS?? Is there any way to ressurect it??
<br/>
<br/>
Any, help, tip or anything is appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nope, selling flashed bios is not my intention at all... We did the bios swap thing since it was a theorical last resort for a firmware upgrade failure, but, after that, we saw that the problem was not with the non working firmware, but with the DS itself.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll look on those blown fuse things. I think that is the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know what caused it??
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: nope, when we try to turn it on, it seems that the unit is completely dead. No light turns on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yup, it soulds like the fuse..  Shorting something that shouldn't be is most likely the cause.  Normally it something to do with people messing with slot-1 devices, but shorting more then SL1 could do it as well.. Though, I had my DS Lite turn off when I was playing around with what was causing it to turn off and didn't blow the fuse..<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I read that when shorting the contact to flash a ds lite, there's a piece of ground right around it, sort of like playing the old time game operation. so people were wrapping tape around their metal paper clip or whatever to prevent this.
<br/>
<br/>
if you did in fact blow a fuse, that page is a good guide on how to bypass it. I would recommend however that if you bypass the fuse, then you better never do anything the average ds user wouldn't do, such as flashing the bios, or toying with the ds or a game taken apart. I've blown 2 snes fuses just by inserting the game cart backwards (direct short.) so next time you mess around with the ds, something more important is gonna fry, and it won't be easy to fix.
<br/>
<br/>
if you wanted to you could probably get a replacement fuse from digikey.com or some other website. it looks like an smd fuse. to get a decent ballpark guess divide the wattage of the ds by the voltage. my fat ds says 5.2v 1.6w = 0.308 amps, which is 308 miliamps. getting a fuse as close to that as possible would be best, but even anything under 0.5 amp would protect your ds better than thin wire.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A few points here.
<br/>
<br/>
1) FlashMe only modifies the firmware. The BIOS is read-only and stored inside the CPU. Firmware is the boot menu, BIOS is the hardwired chip containing the program that loads the firmware at bootup and provides some functions to games.
<br/>
<br/>
2) If it won't turn on with a known working firmware, it's probably a power issue. If the power LED (when turning it on) or charge LED (when plugging it in) turns on and then off right away, the fuse is fried. A bricked DS will usually display white screens, though obviously it depends on how much of the firmware is intact.
<br/>
<br/>
3) 10% is plenty enough for the failsafe to kick in.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Yup, I sorta knew that, but thanks again for the advice. The DS is still under surgery process and as soon as I have a result I?ll post it here. After I fix it It?ll never be messed again. Just would be used with regular games/flashcards.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">if you wanted to you could probably get a replacement fuse from digikey.com or some other website.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Let?s say that I don?t have many soldering skill points. Woudn?t be a fuse much harder to solder than a thin wire? And anyway, is there a know case of a dead DS because of the use of a wire instead of a fuse?
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the explanation. I tought BIOS/Firmware were different words for the same thing! =)

<br/>
<br/>
The firmware was stopped at 11%. When we ran the flashme on a working DS with the Wifi/Firmware chip from the broken DS, we could resume the operation and we did it to the end.

<br/>
Yup, it did! ^_^

For your pleasure, here?s a pic of my friend, the guy who did that to the poor DS, figuring out how to open the console.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For the record, I think I have blown a fuse in my dsl, I'm going to bridge 'em tomorrow. When I try to switch it on, the power led comes on for about a second, but the screens don't light up. When I try to charge it, the led also only comes on for a second, I assume its not charging.
