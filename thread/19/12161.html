    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Finally now that there are more Slot-1 Solutions out there, i'm less of a pussy of getting my DS flashed. So now i'm wondering. Is it worth it to buy the EZ Flash V? I'm being told that there isn't much homebrew support, which is mainly why I want to get it (test some of my programs)
<br/>
<br/>
So here I am. I want to know from people who already have it, or people who know about it, if I should get it. Thanks in advance for your replies,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Chishm's site says, "The EZ5 menu won't boot a ROM in homebrew mode unless the gamecode is "PASS". You'll need to hex edit the ROM to change the game code to "PASS" and then run ndstool to fix the header CRC".  Is this still the case?  That would get annoying.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">R4/M3 Simply doesn't seem to have that problem, so I'd say get one of them instead (they are all about the same price these days I think)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Seeing as there is constant support for homebrew going on at EZ's forums, i'm gonna have to go with buying this. Thanks Opium for your decision.

Alright, I can't wait to buy this little guy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For what it's worth, I blundered into the world of homebrew DS development by purchasing the EZ Flash V instead of the M3 Simply or R4 or other more well-known models.  I've been using it to develop and test a game I'm working on, and have only played a few others' homebrew games, and don't care much about GBA development, just DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a supposedly slow, cheap Micro SD card in it, but at the default speed of 4 (fast), I've had no problems.  Moonshell is nice and functional.
<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the review posted earlier.  The EZ Flash V is priced similarly to other Slot 1 products and offers similar features.  It could be improved immensely with some documentation in English (or any language), and getting nothing but the card in the package is a bit off-putting, but it took me all of 5 minutes to find a PDF manual, install the shell, upgrade the kernel, copy my .nds file over and watch it run.
<br/>
<br/>
I see these 3 Slot 1 cards as very similar, and I'm just waiting for one of them to dip below the current $45 price point so I can purchase another.  (For my wife to play my homebrew game, natch.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
