    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just got this from a store. theres a picture attched at the bottom of everything I have. all day I was playing GBA roms on it. though, to acsess them, I had to go through the GBA rom slot. meaning, the DS wasnt reading my Passcard for some reason. it says "No DS Game Card Inserted"
<br/>
<br/>
if it helps. I have a V1 Firmware because pictochat freezes when I take out the DSgame. and because I bought my DS withing the first week of release.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it not reading it because possibly my Passcard is broken? do I need a different passcard for my DS firmware?
<br/>
