    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, I recently received a Passcard 3 and an SC lite. I have a black DS lite with "purple" firmware purchased in December.
<br/>
<br/>
The SC works great... in GBA mode. I tried several homebrew and they work fine--even my own meager attempts, to my pleasant surprise. The trouble comes when I try the Passcard.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I've searched around and my understanding is that NoPass devices are automatic, e.g. the following should work:
<br/>
1) Insert NoPass
<br/>
2) Insert GBA adapter with menu loader/program files
<br/>
3) Switch on, wait for logo screens, then program to appear
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, no matter what I do this hangs a few frames into the logo/health fade. All I see (say, 90% of the time) is the "N" or "NI" in NINTENDO and a very faint warning below. Rarely I'll get a few more letters, but I've never gotten into the SC or the DS menu.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried it with the SC, a GBA game and nothing at all in the slot, I've tried manual vs. automatic boot settings, and holding Start. Tried holding the Passcard down, and nudging cardboard in behind it, though the fit is reasonably snug already. No effect.
<br/>
<br/>
As mentioned the DS is brand new, and authentic cards run fine (I'm hooked on ACWW even though I only got the thing for devel! :D). So my question is, what can I do? Do I have a dud? I'd be grateful to know I'm just being clueless... :b</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This happened to me with Mario Kart sometimes, it usually meant the card was dirty. Curiously, it has yet to happen since I installed FlashMe.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You're right I think, it does seem like a contact problem. Being the impatient sort, I looked at the edge and it is noticably different than the official cards. Suspecting it might not sit as high, I worked some paper behind the board, inside the case this time, and it usually gets a little farther.
<br/>
<br/>
Though it isn't visibly corroded (this stuff is all only 1-3 weeks old and the Passcard is marked 2006-07-04, which would make that pretty strange...), it is not nearly as shiny as my other games, and remains quite resistant to booting.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll try to find some alcohol or somesuch to clean it properly, but given the scarcity of similar threads, I have the feeling I'm just going to have to order another one.
<br/>
<br/>
So close, yet so far, and such a shiny machine... I feel like it's taunting!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Superkey and Supercard Lite would have made a better combo.  Passcard 3 should work with Supercard but there are multiple revisions of these things and Passcard 3 is the competitors product, so they could make it incompatible.
<br/>
<br/>
One of the devices may just be faulty.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
