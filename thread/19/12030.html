    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought my GBAMP for about four months ago, and it worked fine to begin with, but recently it has stopped working properly, it says my CF card is not formated.
<br/>
Problems started to occur before that as well. It only worked now and again, and when it did'nt find the card/said the card wasn't formatted, I only needed to reinsert the CF card.
<br/>
<br/>
But now it rejects my card completaly. The CF works fine on my computer, and I have tried to format my card plenty of times, without success.
<br/>
<br/>
So, what's wrong? Is it my CF card or GBAMP?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've had a GBAMP fail on me too. Its CF card works properly in another GBAMP, but a working CF card fails in the broken GBAMP, so we've determined that the GBAMP is at fault. And it happens even after cleaning the GBA connector with rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab. Sometimes it works after several tries, involving removing and reinserting the CF card, but it produces really screwed up file names when I chkdsk it. I look at the CF connector, and the pins don't look any more bent than on the working one. So should I have someone look inside and inspect the solder joints between the CF connector and the PCB?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could do that, but if you've checked all the connections and tried the card elsewhere/tried other good cards, it's likely the GBAMP at fault. Though I've had good cards fail at random before myself, and work again later.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It seems tepples has got the same problem as me.. I guess it's because of the GBAMP then. I've had a look at the pins, and they seem to be allright. The card brand is "VIKING InterWorks"..
<br/>
<br/>
I've got a M3 miniSD, but it doesn't run homebrew that well, so has anyone got any tips to what I could buy for the best homebrew performance? (+something cheap..)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alan, do you often have problems with homebrew booting to a whitescreen?
<br/>
<br/>
That's usually a loader issue. I find it useful to keep a copy of DSOrganize and Moonshell on hand for loading homebrew that boots to a whitescreen from the SuperCard loader on my SC:miniSD.
<br/>
<br/>
Often something which has problems booting from the card loader (For example, Tales of Dagur whitescreens. DS85 [The TI-85 emulator] loads with corrupted graphics) loads fine from Moonshell or DSO (Usually via the Alternate Load mode...)
<br/>
<br/>
An M3 shouldn't have too many problems unless all the homebrew you're trying to run was compiled ages ago and was built with old version of the FAT library...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Games like Wolf3d and Doom die after they've printed some stuff to the bottom screen. But most of the homebrew works fine, so I guess it doesn't matter. I'll stick to what I've got.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help everyone!
