Mine got changed a week ago, and I got one with the old firmware. But I guess here in Portugal they have plenty in store, so I don't know.

I don't know where you're from, but for what I see in that table, DSs from Europe stoped working at firmware "number": 
<br/>
<br/>
NEH112******

<br/>
But this is what I get from that table.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
