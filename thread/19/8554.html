I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.

Thank you, everyone, I look forward to taking advantage of your work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's not version "1" you're looking for, it's version <span style="font-weight: bold">C</span>1.  And even that isn't a 100% guarantee, it's not totally unknown for a manufacturer to produce a single revision with multiple chipsets.  There are also rev's A1 and B1, at least.  I think rev. B1 uses Atheros (based on information from its driver INF file) and A1 uses Realtek (a guess based on a process of elimination).
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">(EDIT)</span>: Ah, sorry, there.  Just had to be sure, you know?
<br/>
<br/>
The list of supported cards is most likely a list of cards which people have tried and reported to work, or else a list of cards that have been actually tested.  In other words, it's not likely to be exhaustive.
<br/>
<br/>
Most likely, IMO, if the driver just doesn't work, and you're not 100% certain that it's a card with an RT2500 on it, then my opinion is that you probably got the wrong card.  It's tough to get the right card - believe me, I went through this process, too.
<br/>
<br/>
On Linux there's a tool called lspci that gives you description information from the card itself, including the chipset.  I'm guessing pcitree on Windows does basically the same thing with the VID/PID check.  But you already did that, so I guess there's no possibility your card doesn't have an RT2500, right?<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC
