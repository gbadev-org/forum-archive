You need to update GBAMP firmware with <a class="postlink" href="http://www.geocities.com/chishm1/gbamp/" target="_blank">Chishm's</a>. Then you should be able to boot DS homebrew on the CF card via WifiMe. You can keep booting with WifiMe without ever using FlashMe. But it's a bit tedious :)

Right . . . I did that already, but now I just think I'm missing one of those easy steps on how exactly I'm supposed to make it work.  I think because I've spent about 6 hours trying to get all of this working my eyes are starting to go numb and I'm missing something.

Yeah, and I thought I had a small enough screwdriver, but apparently it doesn't want to turn this tiny freakin screw.  So I was just hoping there was a different way.  If I hit the back of the DS hard enough with a rock will it open?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I go to my command prompt and execute wifime.  It automatically boots to my GBAMP but it goes to the screen where I can choose between games or movies.  When I go to choose a game there are no files there that I can pick.  Any recommendations on a homebrew that is known to be working?  What files should be on my CF card?  I'm willing to start from scratch here.  I'm also pretty sure I'm going to be picking up a screwdriver tomorrow if the whole thing with banging the rock doesn't work out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Put flashme.nds onto the CF card and rename it to _BOOT_MP.NDS

If Chishm's FW doesn't find that file, it boots the regular GBAMP menu in GBA mode.

Thanks, considering how much time I've spent on this . . . I might take it into consideration.  Although "hitting it with itself" might be a lot like "one hand clapping."
<br/>
<br/>
To update: It's still not working.  I thought maybe I need to be using the ndsmp.nds file, but when I go to wmb that one, the Nintendo logo looks messed up and it freezes as it fades out.  
<br/>
<br/>
I think the first thing I need to do is get an actual homebrew program to go to the NDS (and then I'll work on my GBAMP issues).  The only programs I've been able to get to work are the signed demos like Meteos and the Zelda trailer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Right and I forgot to get that stupid screwdriver today . . . so FlashMe is going to have to wait.
<br/>
<br/>
But yes, in my data folder of wmb I have my "wifime" folder.  So I type "wmb -data wifime" and it shows the Nintendo logo with both screens on, and then goes straight  to the title screen of the GBAMP.  
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to go ahead and start from scratch right now and go step-by-step.  
<br/>
<br/>
1.  I already have my Wifi PCI card installed (Linksys WMP54G) and it's already verified to be working with the updated driver.
<br/>
2.  From <a href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php#app" target="_blank">http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php#app</a> I'm able to get the rt2560_app_wmb_1_4_beta_1.zip file and put the unzipped file in C:\wifime
<br/>
3.  From <a href="http://users.belgacom.net/bn967347/download.htm" target="_blank">http://users.belgacom.net/bn967347/download.htm</a> I download the wifime.zip file and upzip it to my data folder at C:\wifime\data
<br/>
So inside C:\wifime\data\wifime\ I have 5 files with the .bin extension
<br/>
4.  Now for the GBAMP I download Chism's driver update from <a href="http://www.geocities.com/chishm1/gbamp/ndsmp.zip" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/chishm1/gbamp/ndsmp.zip</a> and extract it to my CF card (I'm using a 1GB San Disk Ultra II).  I also make sure to unzip the source folder.  
<br/>
Note: I have updated my GBAMP with update.e19
<br/>
5.  Now I have 4 files and one "source" folder on my CF card.  (Two .txt files, a ndsmp.gba, and an ndsmp.nds) I run the ndsmp.gba file from the GBAMP
<br/>
6. Downloaded Homebrew Demos from <a href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/demos/playable_demos.zip" target="_blank">http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/demos/playable_demos.zip</a>
<br/>
and place the 3 files (tetris.bin, nibbles.bin, and pongDS.bin) in the root directory and also in the data directory to be safe.
<br/>
7.  I go to my command prompt from Start-&gt;All programs-&gt;Accessories
<br/>
8.  Change my directory "chdir c:\wifime"
<br/>
9.  Type "wmb -data wifime"
<br/>
10. I turn on my DS and go to the wireless download and "Wireless Multiboot 'Wifime'" by Firefly is listed and I hit 'A' to select.  I hit 'A' again to download the software and . . . 
<br/>
<br/>
. . . it boots to my GBA Movie Player menu. Crap!
<br/>
<br/>
Now.
<br/>
11.  Took the flashme.nds file (Not sure where it came from) and changed the name to _BOOT_MP.NDS and redid #9 and now I get two white screens . . . is this progress?
<br/>
<br/>
This would be a sweet tutorial if everything actually worked . . .</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, this does sound like progress...it sounds like the GBAMP is booting FlashMe...it's just not loading properly for some reason.  Try a different homebrew program and see if that works (rename it to _BOOT_MP.nds and put it there in place of FlashMe).<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, I tried tetris and nibbles and neither worked.  I'd just like to get one of the simple ones working before I try anything else.  There has to be a step where I have something screwed up . . . I just keep getting the Nintendo logo fading out to the two white screens.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not at home to try right now, but has anyone had a problem with having a cart in the DS slot?  I just realized that I've been trying it with a game in there, which I don't know if it would cause an issue.  I also found this on ndshb.com and I might try working with it.
<br/>
<br/>
1) Try formatting the card.
<br/>
2) Try defragmenting your card.
<br/>
Still not working, try this: (provided by Natrium42)
<br/>
<br/>
In HexWorkshop: 
<br/>
(1) Open *physical* disk from the menu. 
<br/>
(2) You should now see 0x200 bytes of the first physical sector. 
<br/>
(3) Sellect all of them (CTRL-A) 
<br/>
(4) Go to Edit -&gt; Insert and fill with 0's 
<br/>
(5) Close HexWorkshop, reinsert CF and format with Windows.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I see this:
<br/>
<br/>
Using [GBAMP] to install FlashMe
<br/>
<br/>
Borrowed/edited from Chishm:
<br/>
<br/>
To use this to flash your DS: 
<br/>
1) Put ndsmp.gba on your CF card root directory. 
<br/>
2) Start your GBAMP. Go into FC Game and run ndsmp.gba. Install the boot loader. 
<br/>
3) Download flashme.nds from <a href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/." target="_blank">http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/.</a> It must be the .NDS file, not the .DS.GBA file! 
<br/>
4) Put flashme.nds on the root of your CF card and rename it to _BOOT_MP.NDS 
<br/>
5) Use either a passme or wifime to start your DS in NDS mode. 
<br/>
76) Flash your DS according to the instructions on the web site. 
<br/>
8) Remove _BOOT_MP.NDS from your CF card, and replace it with a different game, such as OMalone.nds. Rename the NDS file of the game to _BOOT_MP.NDS. 
<br/>
9) Restart your DS.

Hmmm....here's an idea, as a test.  Did you flash the GBAMP's firmware with Chism's version 2 firmware?  If so, try version 1.

The GBAMP manual mentions something about incompatibility with anything below 128 MB. Perhaps some of your smaller cards are formatted with FAT12 which isn't supported very well by chishm's driver or even by the GBAMP firmware.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone. I'm in a very similar boat here. I just now got it to communicate with my DS (thanks to this topic), but I'm getting the Nintendo logo and then the double white screens. Here's what I got:
<br/>
<br/>
Silver Nintendo DS from November 2004
<br/>
GBAMP v2 with firmware e19 (V2.00) with Chism's NDSMP-GBAMP FW Hack v2.0 (NDSMP.GBA)
<br/>
pqi 1GB Ultra Hi-Speed CompactFlash (only one I have)
<br/>
Encore ENPWI-G-RLAM PCMCIA NIC
<br/>
Tim Schuerewegen's modified RT2560 Windows XP driver version 1.0.0.8 (installed properly)
<br/>
Application version 1.4 Beta 1
<br/>
wifime.zip placed in the "C:\WiFiMe\data" folder and unzipped into a "C:\WiFiMe\data\wifime" subfolder
<br/>
<br/>
Originally I didn't have the WiFiMe files in the data folder. Now it gets all the way to the download for Wireless Multiboot "WiFiMe" from Firefly. I download it, the Nintendo logo comes up, then it goes to the double white screens. I've tried Moonshell and Mighty Max's multiboot so far (both were named "_BOOT_MP.nds" when I tried each separately), but neither has taken. I'm afraid to try FlashMe if I'm having this sort of trouble. I'm going to try copying the data off and then reformatting the CF card. Should it be in FAT(16) or FAT32? I just downloaded a shareware Hex editor if I need to go that far. Anything else I should try first? Thanks in advance.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
Well it seems like the problem for me was the new GBAMP Firmware Hack v2.0. I tried v1.0 and it worked for most of the applications I tried (OMalone, DonSimon, and Moonshell). There were a few that did not work, the one in particular that disappointed me was Mighty Max's Multiboot Loader for the GBAMP. I was really looking forward to being able to use that. But I was able to run FlashMe without a hitch so now I can free myself of relying on my dad's laptop to run homebrew apps. I guess just putting Moonshell on there for now will be good until I can figure out how to multiboot apps. Any ideas what might be wrong? Well thanks again! I know I'd still be stuck if it weren't for this post.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looks like that was my problem too. Now that FlashMe is installed, Chism's firmware v2.0 is working just fine as well as Mighty Max's Multiboot Loader! Thanks for the tip! ^_^<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL
