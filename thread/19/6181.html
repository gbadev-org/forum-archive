I know this question has been asked before and I think it's also time for a poll.  Why would I like to see WiFiMe on Linux?  Because I don't want to buy XP :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Juste voted yes as I think it's important that all systems are represented. However, I agree the easiest way is to use a PassMe+FlashMe.

I'm not sure what you mean there. I personally find it easiest to develop using wmb with FlashMe. Flash carts are a hassle to disconnect, flash, reconnect, and test, and for me they are only good for their portability.
<br/>
<br/>
I develop on WinXP presently but if the Linux driver was finished (and I would help) then I'd resurrect my Linux environment.
<br/>
<br/>
Also for this poll it doesn't matter how many people say no, it's really about the amount that say yes. I think of it like a petition; if that many people really want it then it'll be worth working on.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, you are right on the petition point. I was speaking about people interested in running homebrew but not developing them. This is why I said that PassMe+FlashMe would be the easiest way (as it's definitive). Your point about removing+flashing+inserting is perfectly true though and I agree WMB is much easier in that respect.
<br/>
<br/>
I also think a Linux port would make things more understandable (source availability) hence triggering ports for other WiFi cards maybe.

I would really like to help porting it but I wasn't able to find the source for the windows driver. So where to start? Reverse engineering again?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Won't work. The HTTP client would require it's own firmware. And the you don't have an original environment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Why specifically? If Chishm's NDSMP can load one .nds file after another, why can't an HTTP client do the same? Does it have something to do with the load address possibly overlapping the RAM where the loader is located?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
