    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi i bought Datels games n music two weeks ago or so and this is what happens:
<br/>
<br/>
After it shows NDS start up and Datel Games n Music (Reg start up screens) the screen turns completely<span style="text-decoration: underline"> void and white</span>! 
<br/>
<br/>
It happened when i was trying to figure out that crappy snes emulator (snemulDS or DSnes i think..) I was trying so many different roms then i decided to downloaded a new lion kind Snes rom an redownloaded one of the emulators then it still didnt work ( it said please put snes roms in /snes directory) so i turned my DS (phat) off then on and the reg start up and then void screen...
<br/>
<br/>
Yes i know my first mistake was buying something from that crappy and cheap company <span style="font-style: italic">DATEL</span>.....
<br/>
<br/>
P.s. when i try to Add/delete stuff off my micro sd card it takes about a minute or so then says something like "This file is not formatted correctly. Would you like to format this now?" then i press no then it closes then when i press yes it takes another 30-60 seconds and then says something like:"this file cannot be formatted."

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you bought it at a physical store, just exchange it.  That's the nice thing about physical stores.. if you didn't.. buy a new MicroSD card and see if that helps.  You'll spend just as much in shipping as you can get a new MicroSD card for, so no sense returning it to an online store.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">...I have a Games n' Music, and it's nice.  Your microSD sounds like it could use reformatting.  Reformat it, if that doesn't work, just take the whole package (GnM, MicroSD, everything) and exchange it at Best Buy (my friend's GnM microSD spring broke, he got it exchanged no problem, and he didn't even return the microSD or reader, so he got two of them)
<br/>
<br/>
He also bought a 1GB SanDisk microSD at Best Buy and it works fine but only with DLDI version 1.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

<br/>
<br/>
Or, if yours is too old to return, you could always go to the store, buy a new one, take the new one out of the packaging, put the old one in the packaging, and return the old one under the new receipt.  Never tried that, but it might work.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
