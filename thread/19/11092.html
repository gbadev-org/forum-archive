    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello folks
<br/>
<br/>
I would just like a confirmation that the following hardware will infact allow me to run DS homebrew. This is my setup:
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo DS (Phat) : Firmware v2 (Blue Gray)
<br/>
GBA Movie Player v2 : Chishm's Updated Firmware
<br/>
SuperKey* : NoPass
<br/>
<br/>
*This is what I have my eyes on purchasing at the moment*
<br/>
<br/>
I am about to purchase one, but I need a confirmation. Will the SuperKey allow me to boot from my GBA Movie Player v2? -&gt; Alternatively, I have a choice of a Datel Max Media Launcher (which I've heard DOES work, but I haven't confirmed yet) for a few pennies more..
<br/>
<br/>
I am very sorry if this has been answered before, but I just need a yes or no :)
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: One more question: Is there a limit to the size that the NDS program can be that I boot up? I imagine its the 4mb limit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well you see, I already have a GBAMPv2 - except I don't have a device to use NDS homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
After looking around, I've decided that I will probably head to Circuit City in the morning and purchase myself a Datel Max Media Dock Compact Flash. It looks like it will sort-of render my GBAMPv2 useless (maybe not? I can use it to play GBA homebrew)
<br/>
<br/>
It's like, $40.. does anyone know retail stores offering up the Max Media Launchers? I really do not feel like waiting for them to send it to my doorstep (especially after the horrible retail reviews on these very forums ;))</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It would work, but it's wasted money. The Max Media Dock is pretty much a gbamp if I remember correctly. If anything, it has less homebrew support.
<br/>
<br/>
Since you have firmware v2, you can even buy a regular passme (if you don't intend to mess with your mates' newer DS's). I'm sure some people would send you theirs very cheap if they've bought something newer.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
SuperKey is a rebadged PassCard 3; both are NoPass cards. There are only a couple incompatibilities between NoPass cards and SLOT-2 cards, and I don't think any of them affect any version of the GBA Movie Player (except v2 SD, which hasn't been reversed at all by homebrewers).
<br/>
<br/>
GBAMP is an ATA interface (CF is electrically the same as parallel ATA) and a 512 KB NOR flash; the latter holds GBA mode menus and (with Chishm's hack) a DS boot loader. MAX Media Dock, on the other hand, is just an ATA interface, and its DS mode boot loader is stored on the bundled MAX Media Launcher card. Without firmware of its own, the MMD by itself does not work with FlashMe or with GBA mode.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Why is ANYONE saying this?  If there is a 4MB limit, how can I play a 8MB MP3 on my DS?
<br/>
<br/>
THERE IS NO LIMIT!  You just need to write your homebrew to swap RAM!  Ya'know, like the commercial DS games do?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because you cheat?! :O! Just kidding ;). Anyways, I just got back from Circuit City.. bought a Datel Max Media Dock - which does kind of.. defeat the purpose of the GBAMPv2 I purchased earlier this week, except it can use my 1GB CF card.. And it has some problems with MoonShell, so I'll stick to my GBAMPv2 ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So what's the most straightforward way to swap executable code modules in and out?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

You don't need to have the menu screens in RAM while game play is going on nor vice versa.

As for the Max Media Dock (MMD).. I think you will find that it was a bad choice.. unless you are looking to play warez, in which case you will probably be happy. From what I have read, MMD homebrew compatibility is extremely poor.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As I've mentioned, I'm sticking with the GBAMPv2 (I have no intentions on playing warez). I purchased the Media Dock because it was the only thing that I could find with some type of NoPass that I could get before the month is over - All eBay places which sold the No Pass alone, including Datel itself are located in U.K - which means I'd have to wait atleast 1 week for the product to arrive, which I did not want to do. So I purchased the Media Dock. I've already given my 1GB card (compact flash v2..) + the dock to my brother, so he can do whatever with it. I just needed the NoPass.
<br/>
<br/>
I've already started on a neat little Wifi DS application :D. I will probably post about it in misc when it is more completed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
