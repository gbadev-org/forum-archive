    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #990000">The procedure for getting homebrew to run on Nintendo DS systems with the</span> <span style="color: #ff0000">new</span> <span style="color: #990000">firmware (September 2005 and later) has become stable, but currently there are fewer ways of doing this than with the older firmware.</span></span>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">With a PC with a compatible Wi-Fi card, without modifying your DS (WMB)</span>
<br/>
You can use <a class="postlink" href="http://users.belgacom.net/bn967347/" target="_blank">FireFly's WMB application</a> to send .nds demos authorized by Nintendo for use with DS Download Play. Currently it works only with a PCI or PCMCIA card, <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> USB, with a Ralink 2500 series chipset.
<br/>
<br/>
Repeat: <span style="font-weight: bold">USB Wi-Fi cards do not work for WMB.</span> If you accidentally buy one, then use it for your home PC network and buy a PCI card for WMB. In addition, as of April 2006, the latest version of WMB contains bugs that interfere with reception by a "DS lite" system.
<br/>
<br/>
Be aware that like GCC, WMB is a command-line program, which means that double-clicking it isn't going to do much. To learn how to use the Windows Command Prompt, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=dos+tutorial" target="_blank">search Google for DOS tutorials</a>, as the Windows Command Prompt's syntax is descended from that of MS-DOS.
<br/>
<br/>
There is a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php" target="_blank">WMB tutorial on aaronrogers.com</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">With a GBA flash cart and a PassMe adapter, without modifying your DS (PassMe)</span>
<br/>
A GBA flash cart and the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dspassme.com/" target="_blank">PassMe</a> adapter will let you run most of the DS homebrew stuff. It changes a DS game's boot code to send execution to the GBA flash card. 
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>If you have a .nds program (not .ds.gba or .nds.gba), use Darkain's loader to turn it into a .nds.gba ROM. </li><li>Flash the .ds.gba or .nds.gba file to the GBA flash cart as you would, but make sure to use Single ROM mode. </li><li>Insert an official Nintendo DS game such as the Metroid demo into the PassMe adapter, and insert the PassMe adapter and the GBA flash cart into the DS. </li><li>Turn on the DS and tell it to play a DS game. </li></ol>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">With <span style="color: #ff0000">newer</span> Nintendo DS systems,</span> you must use a "PassMe2" customized to a given game, and you must use a matching SRAM code on the GBA flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">With a GBA flash cart and a PC with a compatible Wi-Fi card, without modifying your DS (WiFiMe) </span>
<br/>
If you have WMB working (see above) and you have an <span style="font-weight: bold">old DS</span> and a GBA flash cart, you can use WiFiMe. This file, available from the same place as the WMB app, is a cracked version of part of the Super Mario 64 DS multiplayer code, with modifications to a part of the file that make it send execution to the GBA flash card in much the same way as PassMe. However, you'll have to be next to your PC for this to work, meaning that you won't be able to take this modification e.g. on the bus with you the way you can with PassMe unless you have a laptop.
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>Prepare the GBA flash cart as for PassMe. </li><li>Turn on the DS and tell it to wait for DS Download Play. </li><li>Use WMB to send WiFiMe. </li></ol>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">How to modify your DS (FlashMe)</span>
<br/>
If you can already boot Nintendo DS homebrew through PassMe or WiFiMe, then you can soft-mod your DS using the <a class="postlink" href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/" target="_blank">FlashMe replacement firmware</a>. Soft-modding will let you run DS homebrew from a GBA flash card without a PassMe or WiFiMe, and it'll let you use FireFly's WMB application to send homebrew .nds (<span style="font-style: italic">NOT</span> .nds.gba or .ds.gba) files.
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>Read <span style="font-style: italic">all</span> the instructions on the <a class="postlink" href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/" target="_blank">FlashMe replacement firmware</a> page. </li><li>Download the installation file from the page. </li><li>Prepare the GBA flash cart as for PassMe or WiFiMe. </li><li>Connect your DS's power plug. </li><li>Follow the instructions on that page. If you do not follow the instructions. </li></ol> PROTIP: Once you've installed FlashMe, you can recover from any malicious "brick" program by reinstalling FlashMe.

GBA flash cart: depends on your region. See the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewforum.php?f=17" target="_blank">GBA Flash Equipment section</a>. If you live in North America (that is, Canada or the United States of America), try buying an EFA-Linker cart from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.kicktrading.ca/" target="_blank">Kick Trading</a>. If you live in the United Kingdom, try buying an EFA-Linker cart from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.totalgba.com/" target="_blank">TotalGBA</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Ralink PCI/PCMCIA card (for WMB and WiFiMe): print out <a class="postlink" href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">this list</a> and take it to your local computer hardware store. Look only at the "PCI" and "PCMCIA cardbus" columns; ignore "USB 2.0", "Access Point/AP/Router/Bridge", and "MiniPCI".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">With a DS with old firmware, a GBA Movie Player (CompactFlash to GBA Adapter), a CompactFlash card, a PC with a USB CompactFlash drive, and a PassMe adapter, without modifying your DS (GBA MP PassMe)</span>
<br/>
<br/>
A <a class="postlink" href="http://www.movieadvance.com/" target="_blank">GBAMP</a>, CF card and the PassMe adapter will let you run most of the DS homebrew stuff as well as GBAMP only homebrew. It changes a DS game's boot code to send execution to the GBAMP. 
<br/>
<br/>
As with FlashMe WMB, you must have a .nds program (not .ds.gba or .nds.gba). Most authors release their programs as .nds, except for those programs that need access to more than 4 MB of code and data at once.
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>Make sure that you have upgraded your GBA MP's firmware to DS-aware firmware, following <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=26" target="_blank">these instructions</a>. </li><li>Copy the .nds file to your CF card. </li><li>Delete any old _BOOT_MP.nds file, and then rename the new file to _BOOT_MP.nds </li><li>Insert an official Nintendo DS game such as the Metroid demo into the PassMe adapter, and insert the PassMe adapter and the GBAMP into the DS. </li><li>Turn on the DS and tell it to play a DS game. </li></ol> If you rename the file before you copy it, you will likely produce a fragmented file, which Windows can handle but the current version of the DS-aware firmware cannot. The most reliable method of changing the _BOOT_MP.nds file is to copy, delete, and replace as described above. If this does not work, try running Disk Defragmenter on the card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

iNES mapper 5 represents boards whose name looks like E*ROM; these contained an MMC5 chip. Based on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.parodius.com/~veilleux/boardtable.txt" target="_blank">this list of boards</a>, those games include at least Bandit Kings, Castlevania 3, Gemfire, Just Breed, L'Empereur, Laser Invasion, Nobunaga's Ambition 2, Romance of the 3 Kingdoms 2, and Uncharted Waters. If you don't already get the picture, Koei really had the hots for this mapper.

It's not well supported in PocketNES because its "ExGrafix" video model has severe impedance mismatches with that of the GBA.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
I have a blue NDS, from Australia - wondering if its the same as the "blue nintendogs" european DS? (and will have the same problems..)
<br/>
<br/>
The australian blue NDS doesnt seem to have any affiliation with nintendogs.. (just came in a plain box etc)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Part 2:</span>
<br/>
All this talk about using GBA cartridges,
<br/>
but I see no mention of these (A list taken off Aaron Roger's tutorial)
<br/>
<br/>
DS Flash Cartridge: There are currently four DS cartridges:
<br/>
G6Flash (currently 3rd generation with 1Gb, 2Gb, or 4Gb space)
<br/>
M3 Adapter (works with Compact Flash or SD card)
<br/>
NEO Flash (available in 512Mb or 1Gb)
<br/>
Super Card &amp; Super PassKey (works with Compact Flash or SD card)
<br/>
<br/>
They are DS flash cartridges as opposed to GBA flash cartridges, do they work? How do I get them to work?
<br/>
<br/>

What? Your hard drive is just 2 GB in size in 2005? Remember that GBA-specific flash cards are sold by the bit, not by the byte.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I made a little homebrew with the PA_lib, then I bought a wifi card (Linksys WMP54G). The connexion and the upload seems to work perfectly, but the game still not working.

I tried to upload each PA_lib example, and there is the same probleme ...

Did anyone tried already to load a PA_lib nds file on a DS ?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You will need a flash card or any other device compatible with wifime to put your code on. All wifime does is redirect execution to the GBA slot and executes the code that resides on the flashcard. This is the only way to execute code unless you don't have flashme installed on your DS.
<br/>
<br/>
If you do flash your DS (you will need a wifime compatible device as well) you have more options to start homebrew.
<br/>
You can now start Code from a flashcard without the need of wifime and you can load your code through wireless multiboot.

<br/>
<br/>
But you will need passme/wifime initialy to flash your device. If you don't have the neccesary equipment you might take a look at Sticky Flash Equipment Meetups thread. There might be someone near your location who is willing to flash your device.
<br/>
<br/>
Once flashed you can always update to new firmware version without the passme/wifime because you now can load any homebrew application.

Yes, you can lose your DS, but I've done it 5 times already without making a brick and i think here are some people who have done it even more often. I it pretty (not completely) safe if you do it right.

So once you've updated the firmware on your ds you can upload homebrew with

- pci or pcimia rt2500 chipset

without anything else?

I have the impression that it works this way: Insert the card in PassMe2, wipe out the contents, put in the DS game together with some important files, take out the card then put it in the DS to play. Am I right on this one?

Fixed. You have to buy memory cards no matter which handheld platform you buy, and if you go SLOT-1 (DS mode only), DS homebrew is once again cheaper than PSP homebrew. Even on a home PC, you can't run freeware without spending money, as you need a firewall router and a subscription to Internet access in order to download homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I used to have a flash card for my GBA and played all sorts of homebrew on it.  I've also modded my Xbox and did the same thing and was pretty into it.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I have a DS lite black and I'm researching how to get homebrew on it and I'm still left in the dark.
<br/>
<br/>
I am reading as much as I can but the amount of products is making me unsure as to which is standard and the best.
<br/>
<br/>
I essentially want to be able to play all the best homebrew, Quake 1, media and the like.  But I just can't figure out if I need the Slot 1 or 2, which kind, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I did some sort of test t see if I needed pass me 1 or 2 which involved removing a DS card while in PictoChat and I got Magenta screens which meant PassMe2.  Didn't help too much though...
<br/>
<br/>
With this said, should I get the SuperCard Lite BLACK (Micro SD)?
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a certain card that everyone uses?  
<br/>
<br/>
Price isn't a factor as I'm willing to lay down $45-$80 and that seems to be the typical price range, I don't believe I've seen anything for more or less.
<br/>
<br/>
So with all these guides pointing so many different directions, how does one determine what exactly to get??
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for any help!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
