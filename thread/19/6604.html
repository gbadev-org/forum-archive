    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, i have been reading these forums (and others about DS dev) for a long time, and once the wifi-me came out i was really exited. It seemed my brothers computer had a RX5500, so the next morning i sat down and decided to WIFI-ME my DS. To my surprise when i try and install the driver, it shows the driver as installed in Device Manager with the DS icon and everything except that it has an Exclamation Mark over it, and says some stupid error (im not going to log into his computer to figure it out right now).  So as a last ditch effort i have decided to finally make an account on a forum and actually make a post about this ( i almost never do this, i prefer chatting much better than forums).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways i know the Card is an RX5500 but nothing else, the drivers from the Ralink site install fine, but the WIFI-ME driver does not (well it does install, it just does not run). The Computer my brother has is a Dell, Windows 2000 pentium 3, 500 MHZ (yes i know its very low specs, but its an old computer). 
<br/>
<br/>
The router we have is a Netgear, MR814V2. The PCI card does not have anything written on it except what looks like a bar code. Upon asking my dad, he says the Card is of the same brand as the router (Netgear). 
<br/>
<br/>
I think i have given enough details by now, so ask you all is there any problem with What ever specs i have, will i have to buy a new card to use this feature or will this or can this be fixed? 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time,
<br/>

<br/>
No netgear cards are listed on that site.  Where did you get the name RX5500?
<br/>
<br/>
If you get one of those cards then read <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=23&amp;Itemid=31" target="_blank">this guide</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
If it doesn't work try updating again.
<br/>
<br/>
Try changing PCI slots.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
