    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just don't get it. I have a new DS Lite, load the v7 flashme (even though it says "firmware not recognized") and try to short the sl1 (the farthest left hole next to the GBA slot) with a paperclip and screwdriver...and nothing. The progress doesn't increase.

<br/>
Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The SL1 connections on the DS Phat were slightly raised, making it easy to bridge the connection. The Lite's SL1 is flat up against the board. Try using a tool that bows downward.

I watched this guy's movie, posted by someone else on this board: <a href="http://www.monroeworld.com/ds/hacking/updatelite.php" target="_blank">http://www.monroeworld.com/ds/hacking/updatelite.php</a>

He just uses aluminium foil as well. He also claims, that in order not to hit that piece of metal surrounding the screw, all you need you to do is not stick it in all angled. But I was under the impression that just brushing up to the sides of the hole leading to the SL1 was enough to short it, and brick it?! 
<br/>
<br/>
Is he just relying on a very steady hand ("taking a risk"), or is it actually quite hard to brick the DS Lite, if he can stick a role of aluminium foil up there with the same diameter of the hole itself, and st?ll has to <span style="font-style: italic">look</span> for the piece of metal to brick it...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
just roll it untill it fits in your DS.. but dont forget it..
<br/>
the ent of the aluminium has to be flat. (you can do this this way: roll the aluminium foil, hold the aluminuim foil (that is rolled) straight up and press it on a table, and go very fast left and right with it.. and you will get a flat point :D )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i had this problem the OP had, and that is what i finally had to do.  i had tried everything.  coat hanger, nail, needle, twistie tie shaved off, tweezers ...
<br/>
<br/>
finally used the foil and it worked pretty nicely.  i tried it all without insulating any of them.  all you really need is a steady hand, and a mirror to check progress.  the only hard part was finding something to short it with, and the second hard part was figuring out how to hold the NDSL backwards in a stable way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
