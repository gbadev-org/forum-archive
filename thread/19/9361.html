    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there!
<br/>
<br/>
I've the bad feeling, i kinda semi-bricked my gray DS. I don't exactly know why, but I wanted to upgrade from Flashme v6 (which worked perfectly fine) to Flashme v7. 
<br/>
This is what happens:
<br/>
The Update hangs at 66% with a flashing %.
<br/>
I also shortend the SL1 again.. no success. Failsafe seems to work, as I can boot my Supercard SD after a power off with start+sel+a+b+power.
<br/>
<br/>
Do I also have a paperweight now??
<br/>
<br/>
Help is veeery much appreciated :)
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by abstauber on Wed Apr 26, 2006 8:44 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it starts at 66% because that much of the code doesn't need to be changed. And as long as the failsafe works, you're fine unless you physically damage something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

dualscreenman was right, SL1 wasn't shortend at all, so aluminium foil and a paperclip did the trick for me!
<br/>
<br/>
I thought I turned my DS into a GBA SP with strange habbits :-D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
