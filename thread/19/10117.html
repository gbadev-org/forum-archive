    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been reading many forums for NDS Homebrew software, and I am really interested in getting into the scene.  But with so many different things it is a bit confusing.  All I have is NDS Lite with the new super mario brothers game.  
<br/>
<br/>
I want to run homebrew without having to destroy/alter any of my games, or the DS lite itself.  So I would need a Passme2 device and CF Reader/Card?  Or would a SD reader be better?  Also will anything be at harm to my DS Games?
<br/>
<br/>
I would also be greatful if anyone could suggest the best site/deals to pickup these items.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In my thread from a few days ago, I was told that CF card adapters don't usually have imbeded RAM.

What limitations are there on an SD based adapter? I just bought one so I'm kinda shocked to see somebody say "CF-based adapters *do* have more homebrew support, though."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Some homebrew won't be able to read or write to an SD card because those programs are using an older FAT library.  There are newer versions of the FAT lib that have better support for SD cards although there are still reports of corruption, so you better backup before using any homebrew that writes to an SD card.  Support will improve in the future and SD devices are physically smaller, so eventually SD or mini SD will be better for the DS lite.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Wed Jun 28, 2006 3:53 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

This business re PassMe, NoPass, Passcard3, etc confuses me - which one is the most compatible with the DS Lite and doesn't restrict the DS Lite in any way? I always thought it was the Passcard3, but am happy to be told otherwise. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When you say eventually, are you approximating less than 6 months or so?

I ask because I cannot decide whether to go for a Supercard SD, mini SD or CF.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to not only run homebrew and dumps of DS carts (NOT for piracy purposes, I buy my games but like to try them first before forking out the money for the cart). I'm not so interested in playing GBA games.
<br/>
<br/>
I also want to be able to playback MP3 files.

Currently, I have been under the impression that the M3 was the best flash device + NoPass. Even though it'll run you up to about $100~ I think its worth it because you'll be using it for DS games, GBA games, homebrew, movies, music.. etc.

and personaly i think the supercard is much better,

its cheaper($35 about :D),

32mb sram chip

and offers great support for all types of homebrew :)
