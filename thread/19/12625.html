no it's not the only file on your card. it can cooperate with many other .nds files. you onlx have to exctract a whole directory on your card and start dslinux.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you have the MMD you can use the slot-1 version of DSLinux (I think, I haven't got a MMD so I can't test).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And please take the time to type properly.  Maybe you should be using the DSLinux forums rather than here for support.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You need the right network card, special drivers and an install of Linux (I think it'll work via VMWare). You then send the nds to your DS via the "DS download play" option of your DS' firmware.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
