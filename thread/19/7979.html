    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Brand new DS not even a week old and after successfully putting flashme on and working well with my m3 sd card, all of the sudden I try to turn it on and cuts straight off.  If I plug it in to the charger the amber light comes on like its charging but as soon as I turn on the power the screen slightly lights up and the green light comes on but it cuts right off.  I tried with another battery from a DS and the same thing.  I have no idea how this happened.  Is there any way I can fix this or do I have to buy a new one since I certainly can't send it to Nintendo for repairs with a flashme bios installed.  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How nice of them. ^^<br/>_________________<br/>It's 'CubeGuy.' One word. No space.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you havent modified it any way, and you normally tried to charge it back up, then that damage is covered under the 1 Year Nintendo Warranty, so RMA that puppy, no need to buy a new one.

I really should learn how to read. You put flashme on. Heh.
<br/>
<br/>
Well try RMA'ing it anyways :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yep. You flash it and your out of luck with your warranty. But you could put it back the way it was and if they ask why the security sticker has been tampered with you can just act dumb and then say "Oh that I knocked it while taking my battery out".<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y240/Laintsurge/Sigs/Sig8.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think they would be able to easily tell whether or not someone modified the firmware - Assuming they actually would take the time to do what they would need to do.
<br/>
<br/>
It would take them way to much time (and money) to see if the unit broke because he tried modifing the firmware. Most likely they would just replace it for free.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's a hardware fault, not caused by software.
<br/>
Regardless of whether he flashed the unit or not this didn't cause the problem.
<br/>
TBH they probably reflash all the RMA DS's they get anyway, as they reset the firmware.
<br/>
Could also explains why the write-protect thing is so easy to get to.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
