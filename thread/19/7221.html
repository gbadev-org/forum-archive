Is that all it does, leave the health and warning screen?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It'd be nice if there was yet another version that took out the health screen, but left the DS boot up sound and logo intact, or if the health screen stayed, but instead of waiting for a key press, it'd just advance by itself. The former would be preferable.

<br/>
Anyway beggers can't be choosers. I'm still grateful for FlashMe, so unless anyone feels generous, just ignore me. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I haven't tried FlashMe, but PassMe v1 seems to do exactly this on my DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just got around to flashing my DS last night, and it worked quite well.  I chose the stealth version.  I approached it with a little trepidation because I didn't want some klutzy mistake of mine with the power button or battery creating a DS-shaped paperweight.
<br/>
<br/>
But everything went very smoothly.  I used a 4X flashcard, so once I launched the flashme and made the connection with my paper-clip pieces, it happened much quicker than the instructions had indicated.
<br/>
<br/>
My response was, "What, that's it?  I'm done?"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it's cool to NOT have that passkey + game sticking out of the back of my DS.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
