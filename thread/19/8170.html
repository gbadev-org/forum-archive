    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I were to use PassMe to let me use a GBAMP to play homebrew games, do I have to put the passme in everytime I want to play the homebrew games? Also, will GBA games still work normally after sing the PassMe? Thanks in advance for any help given.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yup, if you don't install FlashMe.  If you do, then it does the work of the PassMe. And yup.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just got a PassMe and I dont know if you have friends that wanna do the same, but anyway, I did so we shared the cost for one PassMe (which is pretty much cheap already :P). After that we we flashed our DS's and then you dont need it anymore. And yes, your DS will do anything it did before + more!
<br/>
<br/>
Ah yes and one tip from n00b to n00b :). You need to hack your GBAMP as well. It took me a while to figure that out :).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry to be a bother, but will FlashMe work with a GBAMP? Also, are there any more detailed instructions than the ones I found here: <a class="postlink" href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/" target="_blank">http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/</a> I'm quite worried I'll brick my DS unless I know exactly what I'm doing.

Thanks for the help, guys.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think the only difference is that it displays % now instead of the numbers shown.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, for updating the firmware on the GBA MP to work with NDS, check out <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=26" target="_blank">ndshb.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It should work just fine, it did last time I tried it with the GBAMP.  :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well my last time was like 1 week ago :P. And it worked just fine. Just remember you need to update the firmware of your GBAMP as well. And just to make you feal better. Its pretty hard to brick your DS without physicaly damaging it :P.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
