    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey!
<br/>
Im really troubled. I got a Supercardlite Rumble which hast atm the firmware v1.7 .
<br/>
Now, theres that update on the supercard site to 1.83, its a .bin file which means its a full update (no matter which version u got be4). 
<br/>
BUT my card doesnt find the .bin file in the menu.
<br/>
<br/>
Next things I tried were: Patching with the 1.81 and 1.82 file (because the 1.8 file doesnt exist, its not like its said on the page included in the 2.60 Patcher rar). I got 1.82, but newer ROMs (and even older like dd kong racing) still dnt work. The bin file is still not shown in the menu
<br/>
<br/>
Because i had trouble like this before knwoing about differences between eng &amp; chinese version i tried to downgrade to chinese version and upgrade it than with that chinese firmwares - but the chinese upgrade files (.scu) got message like: "Its not an accurate upgrade file. Turun off GBA".
<br/>
<br/>
Everything with renaming and son on I tried already. 
<br/>
3 things i wanna know:
<br/>
1. Why doesnt my card shows the bin file
<br/>
2. Any possibility to change form eng to chinese firmware? (beause the chinese got the 1.83 as .scu and not only as a .bin file)
<br/>
3. Might my feelings be true that the rumble card is the one with the most trouble and less supportings??? 
<br/>
<br/>
Thx to anyone who can give me a cloue (mainly about the first 2 questions^^)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hi!
<br/>
The update file is upgrade.scu, and the file setuprumbleV262en.zip has the file UPGRADE.SCU, so check again to ensure you downloaded the right file.
<br/>
It's recommended that you do ALL the upgrades, I mean, first upgrade to 1.80, then 1.81, 1.82 and finally 1.83. You'll find all the needed files here: <a class="postlink" href="http://eng.supercard.cn/soft_scrumble.htm" target="_blank">http://eng.supercard.cn/soft_scrumble.htm</a>
<br/>
The 1.80 firmware file can be found here: <a class="postlink" href="http://romnet.co.uk/ffm/sc_rumble/sc_rumble_fw_1.80.zip" target="_blank">http://romnet.co.uk/ffm/sc_rumble/sc_rumble_fw_1.80.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
As soon as you boot your console, the card will detect the upgrade file and ask if you want to upgrade (It doesn't matter if the firmware is already upgraded, it will keep asking everytime you boot, so delete the file once you are done with the upgrade).
<br/>
The best thing you can do to ensure that the upgrade files are properly detected is to backup all your games and files, format your memory card, and put the upgrade files one at a time.
<br/>
<br/>
The rumble card has no problems for me whatsoever. The only thing that pissed me off was the lack of DLDI support, and that's why I wrote a DLDI patch myself, which you can download here:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow! 
<br/>
I didnt think id get some solutions that fast!!
<br/>
@ bean_xp renaming doesnt work, i wrote it that i already tried that!
<br/>
<br/>
@ barni: THANX MAN YOURE GREAT! u know, with your link of the 1.80 firmware which IS NOT avaible at the sc page no more (the link includes just the software-patcher, no firmware!!!) i could upgrade step by step to 1.82
<br/>
For 1.83 i just got an chinese .scu which is, like i worte still "not an accurate upgrade file" and the .bin is still not shown
<br/>
@ Dan 2552: I think i already read something like that but WHY THE F*** did they put it than to the rumble firmware upgrade??? 
<br/>
<br/>
@barni again - THANX for the dldi patcher!!!! you should send a mail at drunken coders or whoever it was that they put that great file in your list!! Starting files works mostly with the lite dldi, but now is the first time i can save stats for example at DSmaster plus!
<br/>
<br/>
Now, theres still the problem that i want an upgrade to 1.83, maybe u got a link for an english .scu file???? 
<br/>
<br/>
And something else btw: rumble series cant use .gba files normally but can you use an emulator on the sc rumble for gba games or does that work neither?
<br/>
read something about an ram which is replaced with the rumblestuff, any clues?
<br/>

You answered your own question :P
<br/>
<br/>
In the rumble series, the 32Mb of NOR-type memory (which is quite expensive) is replaced by the (cheaper) rumble function.
<br/>
Those 32Mb are needed for GBA, because the GBA has very little internal memory, and runs its code directly from the cartridge (OTOH, the code in a NDS cartridge is first loaded to memory in the console, then executed).
<br/>
<br/>
The NOR-type of memory is needed because of it's speed, as it has to emulate the speed of a ROM (which is VERY fast) for random reads.
<br/>
<br/>
So, it's not because of a console problem nor the need for an emulator, but the need for VERY fast memory on the cartridge itself (NOR memories are among the faster kind of RAM technologies, if not the fastest).
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: more info on the NAND and NOR subject here: <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.disney.com/NAND_and_NOR" target="_blank">http://wiki.disney.com/NAND_and_NOR</a>

now, again the more important thing to me:
<br/>
Now, theres still the problem that i want an upgrade to 1.83 from 1.82, maybe u got a link for an english .scu file????
<br/>
(on the sc page theres just that zip with the new software and an upgrade.BIN which is useless to me).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What do you mean?  I clicked on <a href="http://eng.supercard.cn/soft_scrumble.htm" target="_blank">http://eng.supercard.cn/soft_scrumble.htm</a> and downloaded "SOFTWARE: SC Rumble series v2.62 &amp; firmware v1.83 2007.09.04" to find three files, one of which was an upgrade.scu file, and no *.bin file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#140644 - NastyNic - Tue Sep 18, 2007 8:17 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">okay 
<br/>
i found out last night that there is a scu file included in the download file on the usa page. before i loaded from the uk page and maybe they corrected it now (didnt check it), anyone who doesnt believe me - i can send u the zip file!!! 
<br/>
<br/>
Now 2 things else: 
<br/>
Is there a way to get youre homebrew and roms started through dsorganize or moonshell? i tried it with ds organize myself, neither of the methods there (chisms, dsorganize and magix) worked.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there  a way to setup moonshell or dsorganize as the bootup interface instead of the bad sc rumble interface? 
<br/>
<br/>
