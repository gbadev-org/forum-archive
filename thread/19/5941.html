    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">in the device manager, can I just have the same card serve as a network adaptor and be used for wifime?  I know they cannot be used at the same time, but if I just disable one at a time, would that work?  (I would try myself, but I don't want to screw everything up)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried that but Windows still seems to reserve the resources when the card is disabled, so you can't have two sets of drivers.  I have to choose update driver whenever I want to switch.  I automated the process with this <a class="postlink" href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q311272" target="_blank">command line device manager</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
I made two batch files.
<br/>
<br/>
To switch to normal driver:
<br/>
devcon update c:\ds\normal_driver\rt2500.inf PCI\CC_0280
<br/>
<br/>
To switch to firefly's driver:
<br/>
devcon update c:\ds\driver\winxp\i386\rt2560.inf PCI\CC_0280
<br/>
<br/>
The path to the .inf files will need to be changed.  The hardware ID (in my case "PCI\CC_0280") can be found by running:
<br/>
<br/>
devcon -m:\\your_computer_name hwids *</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
