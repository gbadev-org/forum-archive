    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a neo2 256mbit and an R4ds. I was wondering, is there a way to write to the neo cart from the R4, I have heard that the neo stuff is just a clone of other hardware (cant remember whos) are gba flash carts compatable with each other at all, has anyone even tried this?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
