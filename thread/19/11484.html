    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tried to flash my first DS with Superpass2 and SD supercard. Got to 0% turned over the DS shorted the SL1 contacts and unit powered off, carn't be sure how much the progress bar moved as was using a mirror. Saw it start then off it went. Very careful not to touch the screw next to contacts, used a paper clip, charger on and battery taped in.
<br/>
<br/>
Tried to restart flash with nothing in DS slot and START+SELECT+A+B then A numerous times but nothing (Boots to 2 black screens - no sound) Also tried START+SELECT+A+B+X+Y still nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
Reflashed the firmware of SD supercard and used a different SD card (had a few probs with SD card since attempt in another DS) with FlashmeV7.nds alone on card but nothing. Since I have flashed 2 more DS's all went fine, only difference was I used a Max Media card, newer SD card and Aluminium foil rolled up to short SL1.
<br/>
<br/>
Original DS (which is now mine as my 8 year old wasn't every understanding !!) switches on/off and gives green light, shows orange light when changing but no display/sound.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas ??
<br/>
<br/>

If I killed it would I still get the power lights ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A+B+Select+Start doesn't initialize all the hardware, and SuperCard firmware isn't entirely compatible with this state. Because the display isn't set up properly, you'll need to navigate the interface blind. Delete all files from your card other than FlashMe and then press A repeatedly to launch the first file on the card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tried the 'Blind' approach loads of times - Button selection &amp; then A ,  shorted the SL1 contacts for a few minutes hoping it would restart. Even tried button selection then START then X+B+X+B hoping Flashme might launch, then as above shorting the contacts. But each time nothing. Seems I have a firewareless DS, not recognising anything. Bit stuck as I was assuming if I'd bricked it the unit would be dead (no power/charge lights)

Anyone have a tutorial ?
<br/>
<br/>
Also heard you can hotswop a DS Lite bios chip with a working one (I'm crap at soldering !) anyone know if this is correct ? Is there a tutorial for this ?
<br/>
<br/>
Check about but can't find any guides (Just a .jpeg in ppflash zip)

If you really want to fix it yourself:
<br/>
<br/>
If it's a DS Lite then you can swap the firmware chip with one from a working DS Lite and fix your DS.  There's a tutorial for the chip swap here:

<br/>
You can't do that with a DS phat since it's not socketed.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Sat Oct 21, 2006 9:09 am; edited 5 times in total</span></div>

<br/>
The chip seems to contain (from what I can tell in the pics) the firmware (SPI bus Flash memory) and the wireless module. The BIOS is most likely located on the same die as the processors. That being said, it is only the firmware you are interested in.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

It certainly didn't work on my G6, when I was flashing my DSL and the power when off. And it went totally dead..my old gba flashcard saved me :)
<br/>
so, try to use a different Flashcard for recovery, like a flash2advance or ezflash or some others</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Only the G6 doesn't work. My theory on that is the G6 attempts to load some drivers that are not loaded in recovery mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
