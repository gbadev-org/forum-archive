    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there,
<br/>
<br/>
I got an Encore PCI ENLWI-G adapter just for trying to use WiFiMe to play the E3 demos, but I can't install the custom ralink drivers on it. I saw a topic regarding this same issue of mine when Searching the forum, but I'd like somebody to explain it to me more clearly.
<br/>
<br/>
1 - Is this adapter compatible with WiFiMe?
<br/>
<br/>
2 - Did I need to have a Flash cart even before I thought of getting the adapter? I'm afraid it's a must for those who want to play the demos - correct me if I'm wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No you shouldnt need a compatbile flash cart to play the e3 demos. You will need a compatible card apparently to use WifiMe(eqv of flashme for wifi) and flash the ds</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i think he's asking if his wireless card is compatable with the hacked Ralink drivers released in order to send WMB signals to your ds, there is a good general page that shows cards with Ralink chipsets here <a href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">http://ralink.rapla.net/</a> not all of those work tho cuz some are usb. thats the reason i say its general.
<br/>
<br/>
i know if youve got the original driver setup for your wireless card then try to change it with the DS drivers there always seems to be some kind of problem... i got around this once, but i cant remember how, and i'd love to help, but my wireless card at the moment is giving me a windows (code 12) error :( and dont know how to fix that</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's the exact same PCI wireless card I bought a while back - sorry, guy, it's not a Ralink. It's a Marvell. You can't use it for WMB, but you can use it as a SoftAP. Look for the Marvell SoftAP drivers.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
