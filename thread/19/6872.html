    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This has been irritating the crap out of me. I looked all over the forums for a solution to no avail, so I'd really appreciate any help.
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I'm using an EZ-Flash II Power Star 256Mb Flash cart. After a long and tedious process of having troubles with WiFiMe and finally getting it to work, I was able to boot demos from my cart using WiFiMe. I wanted to boot demos (or at least homebrew) without WiFiMe as I am borrowing the wireless adapter and need to return it. So I ran FlahMe successfully and flashed Darkain's multiboot with some demos onto my cart. Now here's the thing. If I boot the cart with WiFiMe, everything works fine, and all the demos, homebrew boot, etc. (so now I know the cart and data is fine). But when I boot my now modified DS and it loads darkain's loader, nothing works. The loader itself looks fine, but none of the homebrew or demos work, and the touchscreen won't respond. (everything has to be navigated through the buttons) I tried using the loader with only homebrew, and then with nothing, but the same problems continue to occur.
<br/>
<br/>
I apologize if this is a foolish problem or has already been covered, but I was under the impression that after I flashed the DS' firmware, I'd be able to boot right from my GBA flashcart without the help of WiFiMe/PassMe, just as if I *were* using one of those. Can someone clue me in?
<br/>

Thanks, and sorry for being wordy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think i might have the answer.I flashed mine with the GBAmp.I had a EZ-Flash III.and i also had that same problem.i had it where i only could play one homebrew at  a time untill i messed around with the multiloader.It works most of the time unless i put to much space on it.I hope that helps.Also i dont know if you need that ezf3me.zip loader.It makes the ez-flash turn into a single boot so it boots straight into the ds homebrew.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, I've managed to get everything working now without the wireless adapter, (I had to compile my own little loader from a random file I found somewhere) but I still can't get any multibooters (darkain's or otherwise) to load anything without a white screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Killjoy: I had a few issues with the multi-loader when I first got set up, but it works fine. The main problem is that if you attach an invalid file it will sometimes make the whole loader crash. Only use tested homebrew code and you should be fine (ie the examples that come w/ ndslib). Also, make sure you are using the most recent loader (the one with the grey/white screens, not the one packaged with darkstar). I am using a NeoFlash, so you may have a different issue, but I hope it helps.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just wanted to say that I've since been able to get all my homebrew, demos, and commercial roms to load off my GBA cart, but still no luck with the multiboot, despite trying multiple programs/versions/configurations. All the roms are valid, and work fine when I load them individually using the nds loader.
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I haven't tried at this point is trying different versions of the firmware, (and am not enthusiatic to take the case apart again) but will probably try it sometime in the next few days if I can't find any other suggestions/solutions.
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I appreciate the help guys!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
