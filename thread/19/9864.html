    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just got a DS Lite and saw this passcard.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it worth getting it as an alternative to flashing the device?
<br/>
Has anyone tried it on their DS lite?
<br/>
<br/>
I was just looking to purchase the passme 2 because the passme 1 I used on my old DS doesnt work with the new DSLite so I can flash the firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
but maybe i dont have to flash firmware anymore since passcard 3?
<br/>
<br/>
Advice is much appreciated :)
<br/>
<br/>
should i get this or should I stick to passme 2 and flash the firmware that way?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
