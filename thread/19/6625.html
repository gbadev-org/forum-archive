    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've pretty much decided on getting the M3Perfect when it actually does release itself... the ability to test my NDS Homebrew (workin on a little pirate-ship boarding game) on the machine as well as use it for a basic media center is an attractive endeavor.... however, after reading some various forums and threads here, i've seen the debate about SD and CF cards come up a few times with no clear answer.
<br/>
<br/>
So which one should I go with? I care more about the performance of applications on the handheld itself, rather than the speed of copying to the handheld... and one being more expensive than the other isn't really an issue. 
<br/>
I've read some people say SD card's run faster, with a slower transfer rate, while others say CF cards are faster in both areas, so I really don't know which way to go with this.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want smaller for like 20 dollars more go with SD, if you don't care about the size then go with CF, you probably won't notice a drastic difference in speeds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
This has nothing to do with your question, but thought it might help sway your decision...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you're in the US, check out Costco Online.
<br/>
<br/>
2GB CF - $99
<br/>
4GB CF - $199
<br/>
<br/>
GB, not Gb!!!

I think rmco2003 is refering to a device that amadeus is making for the GBA slot, to provide 32 MBytes extra storage. Check it out over on the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dslinux.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=580" target="_blank">DSLinux.org</a>  boards.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not too sure I'm interested in that yet or not, DSLinux looks cool, but I dont know if I'd have much use for it.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm more into games and the homebrew games people have been making. Some of its pretty sweet stuff.

FInally got my passme, and found a new use for my old battery-dead XG1 cart, and I have to say, I'm so impressed with what people have been doing</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd pernonally choose the SD version as it could lead to an smaller design. SD card often consume less power.
<br/>
<br/>
But CF are cheaper...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
