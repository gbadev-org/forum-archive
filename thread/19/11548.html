    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi my friend bricked his DS Lite as Noflashme stopped. It has still Green light so I think it's no "Fuse" brick. But to fix the BIOS Chip we would have to have to DS Lite and nobodys willing to open his one (i've got a phatty DS) So is it possible to use ppflash with the DS Lite?

ppflash might be easier on the Lite because the chip is socketed.

Does A+B+Select+Start+Power on still work? What flash equipment are you using?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
