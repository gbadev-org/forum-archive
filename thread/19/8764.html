    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't flash my DS.I'm surely doing something wrong... This is my equipment:
<br/>
<br/>
H/W
<br/>
<br/>
DS Version 2,
<br/>
Supercard SD,
<br/>
SD Card 1GB,
<br/>
WMB-ready enviroment.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a passme or a superpass as I don't need one if I'm not mistaken.
<br/>
<br/>
S/W
<br/>
<br/>
flashme.nds (V6)
<br/>
ndsloader.bin
<br/>
Supercard software (that renames an .nds file as .nds.dsq)
<br/>
<br/>
Sooo... What do I do?
<br/>
<br/>
What do I put on the SD Card? the flashme.nds? The flashme.nds.dsq?
<br/>
<br/>
What do I run from the WMB? Can I run it with Headspin's WMBFront or should I open a command line?
<br/>
<br/>
Should I create a flashme.nds.gba or a flashme.ds.gba and where should I put that? 
<br/>
<br/>
Too many questions...Sorry!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't run Flashme through the patcher, just put it on the card.
<br/>
<br/>
Step-by-step:
<br/>
<ol type="1">
<br/>
<li>Upgrade your Supercard to the latest firmware. (Get the .bin file from supercard.cn, put it on your SD card, load the Supercard as a GBA game, and run the .bin file.)
<br/>
</li><li>Put flashme.nds on the SD card, the SD card in the Supercard, and the Supercard in the DS.
<br/>
</li><li>Remove the battery cover from your DS.
<br/>
</li><li>Run WMB and broadcast wifime.nds.
<br/>
</li><li>On your DS, "Download Play" the Wifime.nds.
<br/>
</li><li>The Supercard should boot in DS mode. (You'll see "Supercard DS" on the bottom screen.)
<br/>
</li><li>Run flashme.nds, and bridge SL1.
<br/>
</li><li>Never need to use Wifime again!</li></ol><br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I never really gave much attention to the patched file,what I was doing wrong was that I was broadcasting flashme.nds and not wifime (which is not an .nds file, but a zip file ;) ) and then I just ran flashme.nds which was on the SD card and here I am on the XBXB screen now! Good luck to me.
<br/>
<br/>
lol m2pt5,as you were writing the steps, I was actually doing them!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, no problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I flashed five friends' DSs last week with a PassMe and my Supercard SD, so I think I'm reasonably good at it by now. :D<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
