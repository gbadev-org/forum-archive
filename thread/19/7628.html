    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
I think about selling my GBAMP on eBay and buying a M3 or a Supercard. Can someone tell me, what advantages / disadvantages these Modules have or which one would be the best? And which one has the best compatibility and the best movie and music playback.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.

Huh?  Moonshell works perfect on the M3, the same as on the GBAMP.  Ever since support was added to the CF driver most DS homebrew using a GBAMP has also supported the M3.  The supercard I'm not really sure of.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I think it depends on the Firmware version of your DS and what you really want out of it.  Do you want the ability to run Homebrew, or use the supplied applications to convert your music/movies and do that?
<br/>
<br/>
For early models, or DSs with FlashMe installed, I would agree that the GBA MP is the best bang for the buck.  At $25, it will pretty much do all the stuff you would like it to do, aside from running 2 or 3 specific homebrews, it runs pretty much everything else, and some GBA MP Only homebrews.
<br/>
<br/>
For newer model DSs without FlashMe installed, GBA MP isn't really an option, unless you can get FlashMe installed.  New DSs require PassMe2 to run homebrew and PassMe2 requires SRAM, which the GBA MP doesn't support.  Hopefully this will change with the help of anything with SRAM support (like a commercial GBA Cart).
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, your only option is a SC or M3..  Which is better?  Dunno.. I don't really like either of them.  The SC fits SUPER tight in the GBA slot.. so it's a good thing you can remove the CF without removing it.. but, that leaves the CF card sticking out all by itself.  Which, makes me fear that the pins inside may get bent if the CF card is not treated carefully.  Just look to your local digital photo center for details.. None of the ones around me have working CF slots anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the SC doesn't support FAT32..  Why, I have no idea..  And the price isn't that great either, at around $40.  Almost twice that of the GBA MP.
<br/>
<br/>
M3 on the other hand, uses the same housing as the GBA MP..  Supports FAT32 and fits nicely into the DS.  It also supports a bunch of file formats.  Problem with it is, it cost around $90 (With PassKey, which is useless on DSs with new firmware, so you'll still have to buy a PassMe2).  I haven't seen anyone selling it without the PassKey.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess, if I had to choose, I'd choose the M3 for a DS with new firmware.  
<br/>
<br/>
Using them:

<br/>
I first bought the GBAMP some while ago, before the DS had even come out. And I still use it for Moonshell and running homebrew. Not all homebrew is compatible with the M3.
<br/>
<br/>
Then I bought Supercard, and I was quite disapointed. It drains my DS battery in a jiffy and it runs no homebrew at all. Moonshell does work, but it can't run nds homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
My last buy was the M3, it is double the price of a Supercard, but I think every ? was worth it. I use it to see movies also with the cristal engine converter.
<br/>
<br/>
So in my pouch I carry, a GBAMP with a 512 MB CF and an M3 with a 512 CF.
<br/>
<br/>
I won't sell my Supercard, and I've been updating it, but I never carry it around with me. It is at home, inside its box.
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm definitely keeping my GBAMP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unlike the GBAMP, the M3 and the SuperCard have 32 MB of RAM in GBA ROM space (for .ds.gba programs and for GBA homebrew) and 64 KB or more of RAM in GBA SRAM space (for PassMe2 and for GBA homebrew). You cannot use PassMe2 or homebrew GBA ROMs with the GBAMP.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Also, I think we need to mentiont the fact that the 32MB of onboard RAM on either of those devices are currenty not being used by NDS homebrew.

I've tested GBA MP, SuperCard, and M3 and all support homebrew in one form or another.  Some are more confusing to understand what format you may need the homebrew to be in for it to work, or need the firmware updated, but they all work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In my GBA posts, a "ROM" is a program that runs in GBA ROM (0x08000000), while a "multiboot" is a program that runs in GBA EWRAM (0x02000000).
<br/>
Roughly, multiboot is to ROM as .nds is to ds.gba.
<br/>
<br/>
"Old fashioned" NOR flash carts work with all GBA homebrew, as do the SuperCard and M3. The GBAMP works only with GBA "multiboot" programs (*.mb.gba) and those GBA programs that are specially designed to access the GBAMP's CF card (such as Dwedit's hack of PocketNES). Some programs come in both multiboot and ROM forms; examples include <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/lu/" target="_blank">Luminesweeper</a>, which has music in the ROM version but no music and a limit of 7 skins in the multiboot version.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It is NOT stiff in the cartridge slot. Moonshell and SnesDS both have versions that specifically support the file system.

It did drain my battery life but once I used flashme i took out the ds cartridge and it wasnt as bad. I havent tried the movie player yet.

And most important of all it was cheap. I paid ?30 for a passme and SDSC off ebay (new).

<br/>
<br/>
As for SC vs GBAMP, I have used all three (SC, GBAMP, and M3) and if they were all free, I'd choose the M3, as it seems to work the best.  Of course, I only work with homebrew, so I don't know how good any of them are for "other" purposes.  But, when I'm doing anything, I still use my GBA MP as I really like MightyMax's boot loader.  I might've liked the SC if it supported FAT32, as it being hard to remove doesn't matter much if you don't have to remove it.  Though, I guess it would suck for Rumble Pak homebrew, as you have to take it out to insert the Rumble Pak.  Oh well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
