    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't delete files in DSOrganize. I've found that its file system implementation, at least on my GBAMP, often deletes the wrong file and causes lost clusters. I've seen it delete _boot_mp.nds, which is a bad thing when you're away from a PC for 72 hours.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The latest version renames and moves correctly. The above problem is no longer valid.<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI
