Buy an EFA-Linker flash card. I can't tell you where unless you put at least your country in <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/profile.php?mode=editprofile" target="_blank">your profile</a>.

You'll also need either a PassMe device or a PCI or PCMCIA Wi-Fi card with a Ralink RT2500 series chipset. (Routers and USB Wi-Fi cards do <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> count.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

We even have a different part of the forum for those who want to get homebrew running on their Nintendo DS. Stickies aren't going to change that.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
