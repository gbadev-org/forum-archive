    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok. I've flashed the appended flashme.ds.gba onto my 512mb EFA cart, without the multiloader. The passme boots it up, and then it says,
<br/>
<br/>
'GBA file is corrupt'
<br/>
<br/>
Argh. I can get every other homebrew app running, but not flashme.  I've also tried using already appended flashme files that other people have been successful with. Still no dice. I really want to get this working. :\</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Just change the name of the .nds file to .nds.gba and flash it.
<br/>
<br/>
I think that was the fix anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had to append the loader.bin to the flashme.nds and named it nds.gba and it worked, Just be shure that the flasher proggie doesnt change anything @ all (like remove intro, trim size...)

BTW why do you use flashme when you are so lucky to have a passme?? Or do you use WiFiMe?<br/>_________________<br/>...It?s a good day to die...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Are you serious?  Why would anyone want to have an extra piece of hardware to carry around and have sticking out the back of their DS when they can use FlashMe?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I flashed mine, and then a pixel went dead, so to get it repaired I unflashed it, and had no problems whatsoever. You just need to read all very well and be calm and all will be ok. There's always danger, but I hate to have the passme hanging from the back:|
<br/>
<br/>
I used a EFA-Linker 512Mbits and flashed mine with no problems.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't remember if I just put the flashme.nds on the EFA program, but I think that was it. Well, will have to do it again once it returns.

It's one of the new NDS homebrew files that have a loader built into some 'unused' space in the NDS header.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
