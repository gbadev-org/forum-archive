    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been downloading and playing homebrew on my GnM perfectly fine, but all of a sudden no new games or any of my old games work. When i try to run any game by tapping on the icon, the top screen turns black and the bottom screen stays the same (white with all of the cartridge icons) and nothing happens no matter how long i wait. Does anybody know how to fix this or is my GnM dead? If it matters at all, the only app i really want to run is Colors! Please help me!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a Games n Music card, so here's been some of my problems, maybe they can help you. Make sure you have the right DLDI patcher. Chism made 2 versions, and the newest one doesn't work. I haven't heard of a single card it worked for, no offense. But the first one works great. If it worked before and you haven't changed anything, this shouldn't be the problem. Second, make sure you're not replacing programs with newer versions, just backup your card, clear it and put the new stuff on. Third, Reformat your card. Most of the time this is the problem, just reformat it, and redo it. Sometimes the Games n Music card goes screwy, so just reformat it and start over. This is why you should constantly be backing up your card, in case you want to keep your save states.<br/>_________________<br/>Games n Music Homebrew:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am releasing a Homebrew OS especially with the GnM in mind, llok for that in a few days and use it as bootme.nds and you should be able to use it for all homebrew on the GnM. Look for it in a few days as Flashcart OS: Slot 1 Edition. It will also have DLDI patching so you won't have to worry about that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to keep using the GnM menu &amp; loader, I would suggest reformating it and DLDI patching all FAT homebrew with v1 of the GnM DLDI patch. Also make sure you aren't using Files larger than 2.5 MB.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Development Blog:</span> <a class="postlink" href="http://teendev.org" target="_blank">http://teendev.org</a>
