<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering:
<br/>
<br/>
Are there any really big dangers of using PassMe with my DS? Is there any issues I should know about? Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

PassMe is a piece of cake and I haven't heard of any warnings about it. I don't think it can hurt your DS at all, there is only a slight danger if you use it to install FlashMe, and that danger is typically a matter of not following instructions.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Is getting FlashMe set-up dangerous? If I don't do something at a certain time will my DS explode?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's easy too. The key is that you don't restart your DS (or let a low-battery shut it off) while you're doing it.
<br/>
<br/>
The special step you must do is to remove the battery cover, remove the polk-dotted sticker that covers a hole, and then use a piece of metal (paperclip or eyeglass screwdriver) to connect 2 contacts inside that hole. You can even pause and go do something in the middle of it, the key is that you must bridge those contacts until a certain point and then it will continue on its own. Then you can restart ONLY when it reaches 100%. So it's not tricky, you just need to be patient and do it on a full-battery charge, and maybe leave the power adaptor plugged in.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One last question:
<br/>
<br/>
If Nintendo ever updated the DS firmware online, would I still be able to use FlashMe and the DS firmware update?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If Nintendo's tool rewrites part of the firmware, it still won't be able to touch the failsafe block, and you can probably FlashMe again by using the failsafe key commands (see FlashMe docs for details). However, FlashMe might have to be updated if the new firmware is a different size, so don't try it until you hear a success report.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo could follow in Sony's footsteps and take measures against WiFiMe and PassMe in future versions of the Nintendo DS firmware. Such measures would include disallowing an ARM7 or ARM9 execution address in GBA ROM. But the company has chosen not to do so. Case in point: the new blue DS has an updated firmware, but the big change was that the backlight fades in and out.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
