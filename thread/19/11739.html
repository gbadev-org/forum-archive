If you are looking for Internet access (and you know how to run homebrew) you will need a wireless router or you will need to know where you can get wireless Internet access.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

routers weren't designed for nintendo DS. Some routers come with access thingys and a setup CD which basically does everything for you. For some people, a WEP key is simply a serial number (such as copy protection) while setting up their wireless! My friend had a setup like this and his wep key was the default one, which was written on the CD case!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Er k... this thread seems to have become a bit lost.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, your router's manual should tell you how to get into your router's configuration. Often times you can go to a web browser and type your Gateway IP into the address bar (often 192.168.1.1.) and that will bring up your router's configuration program.
<br/>
The password should be in your manual, unless it's been changed.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, make sure wireless networking is activated and you know your WEP key (the router configuration should tell it to you).
<br/>
<br/>
You can connect via your DS using information provided by the router configuration thing.
<br/>
<br/>
If you need more help, I have to say I don't really know what you're having trouble with. Can you give us a bit more information to work with?
<br/>
<br/>
I'd recommend just trying some software that uses wireless Internet stuff and seeing what happens.
<br/>
Have you configured anything with the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection setup in official games?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!
