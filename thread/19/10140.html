<br/>
Still in stock last time I checked.

Can't post directly to the dealer so I'll post the link to the digg article/comment section: <a href="http://digg.com/tech_deals/2GB_SD_Flash_Memory_$43" target="_blank">http://digg.com/tech_deals/2GB_SD_Flash_Memory_$43</a>

<br/>
No rebates required, and a 5-year warranty.

I still feel bad for the guy who left a comment saying he had just purchased a 2GB module from Circuit City for 149 bucks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
