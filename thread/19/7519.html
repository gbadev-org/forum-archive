    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all, i am planning on purchasing MKDS however i want to change my ds firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
but the problem is that i do not know how to?
<br/>
<br/>
I know that official site provide all the necessary stuff but i do not understand the part where it states </span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">make contact between the two SL1 pads by putting a solid metal object in the hole. You could use a screw or screwdriver for example</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
What does that mean in easier english.
<br/>
<br/>
Also btw i have Superpass+Supercard so would these be able to do the job for booting flashme.nds?
<br/>
<br/>
Thankx

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yep or any metal object small enough to fit in there. But remeber if the percent meter stops going up don't freak and turn your ds off just reposition it a bit and it should start going up again.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y240/Laintsurge/Sigs/Sig8.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes. If you can already run homebrew using FlashMe, then use that method to install the new version of FlashMe on top of the old version. But you will need to grab the screwdriver that you had used the first time to bridge SL1.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
