Looking at the flash movie, it seems like a new DS flashcard is coming out.
<br/>
And it has a built-in mini USB port for plug and play.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So it has a built-in NoPass, works with flashcarts and CF/SD adapters, and has built-in storage and USB port? That's hot. Seems like the perfect thing for DS dev, should it use a file system that's easily recognized and supported. Plus, for anything that doesn't work, if it functions as a NoPass, there shouldn't be a problem if you have an alternative already (I'm assuming most of us already do).
<br/>
<br/>
The storage would definately be handy for loading up music. That way, you can play that directly from the card without anything sticking out of your DS Lite while it sits in your pocket. A lot of MP3 players only have 512MB still. Granted, 1GB or 2GB would be better. Even better still would be something that combined the design of this (USB port included), but nixed (or better yet reduced) the onboard flash memory in favor of a MicroSD slot for expansion. That way, you could buy whatever size you want, much like how it is the CF/SD/MiniSD/MicroSD adapters now.
<br/>
<br/>
The built-in USB port has me really curious if homebrew could make use of it. That could really open up a lot of possibilities. WiFi communication is great and all, but some things are just easier (and less expensive) wired. Although I doubt it could be hacked to work as a GBA link cable port without some serious modifications to the DS (seems like it'd be more likely that the DS Lite's power connecter be hacked first, if it's even possible at all).

I have original DS + GBAMP, and it works in my pocket while walking, but when I start jogging, the GBAMP gets tilted within the DS, some of the GBA slot pins lose contact, and MoonShell freezes.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've NEVER had problems using a GBAMP and DS Phat running moonshell in my pocket. It barely fits, and in the pants I wear with a suit, it slides out sometimes (cuz its silky smooth :)) but it's fine usually. Sometimes the song pauses or skips because of the shoulder buttons, but when they changed it so u have to press both buttons while it's sleeping, that didn't happen almost ever.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a bit uncomfortable though. I REALLY wish I had a DS Lite. Maybe I can trade my fat DS in the fall for a DS Lite if I trade some games along with it (like when EB Games as a trade in deal for PS2 games where they give a bonus). I'll have to get rid of FlashMe though, or I could leave it as a treat for the next user.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How is 510 MB useful space so much worse than 512 MB? GBA and Nintendo DS homebrew programs don't come in even 2^x megabyte chunks. Are you talking about "that other use"?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's the kind of review I wanted to see. I passed along the first as it was the first I had come across and sounded promising, despite lacking in a lot of details. That second review pretty much answered most of my questions I still had.
<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like the DS-Xtreme is pretty good. Only 512MB is a little low, but should be decent for just homebrew. I'd like to see them release one with 1GB or more, though.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing that review mentions that really has me curious now is the level of customization of the OS and how it can be "rewritten". That sounds like an interesting project in itself. I wonder if we'll start seeing full replacement firmwares and OS's for it?<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL
