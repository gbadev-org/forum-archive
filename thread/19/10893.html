    <h4>#99445 - Mr. Picklesworth - Mon Aug 21, 2006 7:40 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">With my GBAMP, I have become very used to using Moonshell as a bootup screen since it looks nice and does a lot of stuff very easily.
<br/>
From the looks of it, the Supercards are more designed wtih the DS in mind so they undoubtedly have a DS firmware built in which they use.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there still a way to get a Supercard to automatically boot a program when it starts, or would I have to put up with its built in firmware?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

<br/>
So I hold select to bypass FlashMe.

Where are you running your games from?<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not interested in running commercial games via SC, so nothing to worry about there.
<br/>
In fact, one of the reasons I'd want to skip the SC's built-in menu is so I don't look like I'm interested in such things.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I guess such a firmware fix could have the same thing as holding Select with Flashme.
<br/>
If Start is being held down, it could boot with the normal menu.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!
