<br/>
<br/>
I took a dremel to the corners that extended out a bit and sanded them as close as I could to the PCB inside.  I did this because a friend brought over her GBA SP, and my flash cart wouldn't fit (I have a Flash Advance Extreme 128).
<br/>
<br/>
Once I trimmed it a bit, it fit fine, as well as fitting in the DS!
<br/>
<br/>
Email me if you'd like some pictures of what I did.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks for reporting this, i took a razor to the corner of my visoly flash advance 64 and it works perfectly! i wouldnt suggest using a razor unless you dont have anything else. i managed to walk away with only a slight cut on my thumb but if you are careless it can obviously be much worse (not to mention possibly ruining the flash card)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it seems like some visoly cards fit right away and some dont. mine definitally did not fit at all, and a quick comparison to a normal gba cart showed that one of the corners wasnt indented on the flash cart while both were on the gba cart</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you have a GBA cheat device that fits in the DS, turn the switch off, and just use it like a bridge for the carts that don't fit in the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
When I still had a flash advance cart I used it on my DS and GBA SP through a codebreaker, and it worked fine. No need to damage the cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
