    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there any way to flash my DS's firmware (it's a stock version 2 right now) using only a SuperCard (SD preferably), WiFiMe, and FlashMe? I've tried searching for this information, and looking in some faqs, but I couldn't easily find the answer to this. Also, is there any mirrors for supercard firmware? Since SC's website doesn't seem to work (only temporary I hope?). BTW, the only SD card reader I have is in my camera. I don't have a compact flash card reader. Which is why I'd perfer the SD version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
