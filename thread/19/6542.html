Jandaman says they will take money orders. Just email him and ask about it. That will get you the GBA cart. If you need a passme, ask around and maybe someone will work something out with you. Or you could buy a WiFi card supported by the WiFiMe hack and use that method. If you don't know what cart to buy, read a little and I'm sure you will find the info you need. Many of them work, some have tradeoffs. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure other sellers will take money orders, it will just take longer to get your parts. I mentioned Jandaman as I've ordered from them and had good results, and I see posts on various boards recomending them for the same reason. 
<br/>
<br/>
I recently purchased a devkit (cart/linker + passme) from dspassme.com. Maybe they would work something out with you? The total was $78 shipped. I allready own an EZ3, but I wanted another cart to dev DS stuff on so I don't have to delete all my ROMS or loader from the EZ3. It hasn't arrived yet, but I hear they are reputable and they claim my order shipped yesterday.

You have options, you just need to look more. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, you do need a GBA flash cart or a GBA Movie Player UNTIL you flash the firmware of your DS...then it's possible for you to upload most homebrew directly via the wireless download play function bypassing the need for a GBA flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
*edit*
<br/>
Forgot to mention...you CAN download the official demos without flashing your NDS...that's needed for homebrew though.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Don't be too sure your WiFi will work. It requires a very specific card chipset, not just any WiFi card. On the WiFiMe website, it has a list of known good cards, and even without a GBA cart, it should be able to load the driver and your DS should show the WMB server. If this works, you will NOT be able to use your WiFi card for anything else. The drivers are DS or WiFi, not both. 
<br/>
<br/>
The need for a GBA cart shouldn't be a problem though, as you have the money and I gave you one reseller that will sell you a GBA cart without a CC. You don't need a big one, a 256Mb is more than big enough to start with. You need bankswitching to use more than that anyway, and that's more than you want to start with, I would think. Or you could get a GBA-MP (Movie Player) and a Compact Flash card. I've seen CF cards in the grocery store!
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I see you've been answered about the cart requirement. If you really don't want a cart, see if you have a friend with one to do the FlashMe with. If not, well, you're stuck. Stop complaining and go buy a cart allready!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
