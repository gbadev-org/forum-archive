    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have sucessfully flashed my DS with Flashme v6 and it is nice not having to use my Passkey everytime to boot int NDS mode.
<br/>
<br/>
I decided that I should try the flashme recovery code just in case a future comercial game writes to the firmware and bricks my DS.  
<br/>
<br/>
I still had flashme on my CF card, so I inserted it into my M3 and put the M3 into the GBA slot.  I then held down START+SELECT+A+B while I turned on my DS.  The power light came on, but the displays remained blank (with no backlight).
<br/>
<br/>
I expected to see the M3 menu where I could choose to run the flashme.nds off of the CF card.  Is the M3 compatible with the flashme recovery code?
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose that it is possible that the M3 menu is coming up even though the displays are blank.  Unfortunatly, the M3 menu system is too complex to attempt to navigate it blindly.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The latest version of Supercard SD firmware will boot into the Supercard menu from the recovery code. I'm sure they could fix the M3 firmware so it can as well.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have tried several times to navigate the M3 menu blindly when using the Flashme recovery code.  I think that the M3 interface code must be crashing when it is run using the Flashme recovery code.
<br/>
<br/>
I am using firmware version E16 on my M3.  Has anyone else gotton the M3 to work under the Flashme recovery code?  If so, what firmware version are you using on your M3?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: The Flashme recovery code does work just fine on the M3 as long as you do not have a DS game in slot 1.  When I was testing I had Animal Crossing inserted in slot 1 and all I got was blank screens.  When I took Animal Crossing out, the Flashme recovery code booted into the M3 menu just fine.
<br/>
<br/>
So if anyone else has this problem, just remove any games from slot 1 and it should work fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
