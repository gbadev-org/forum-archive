    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How would I do that? I just flashed it and now it doesn't work.
<br/>
All it shows up as is a blank screen
<br/>
<br/>
Also, it doesn't work at all when I have my NoPass card in there</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try putting the update.e19 file on your CF card and see if it asks to update.  If it does, that should fix it.  If not, you have to take some further steps.  Easiest way to fix it is with another working GBA MP or GBA Flash Cart.  If you don't have access to either of these.. Your basically out of luck.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Use the following instructions:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Format your CompactFlash.
<br/>
2. Download <a href="http://www.gbamovie.com/images/update.e19" target="_blank">http://www.gbamovie.com/images/update.e19</a> and put it on your CompactFlash.
<br/>
3. Download <a href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/NDSMP/ndsmp_v2_11.zip" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/NDSMP/ndsmp_v2_11.zip</a> and put ndsmp.gba on your CompactFlash.
<br/>
4. Put REIN, DSOrganize, MoonShell or GBAmp MultiBoot on your CompactFlash and rename it to _BOOT_MP.NDS .
<br/>
5. Insert the card in GBAmp and GBAmp into your DS. Boot it in the GBA mode. When it asks you to update, accept.
<br/>
6. Go to the 'Game' menu and run ndsmp.gba.
<br/>
7. Press L + R + SELECT and wait until it says you can turn the DS safely off.
<br/>
8. Now, insert your NoPass and turn your DS on. If everything is right, you should boot straight to your homebrew loader (MoonShell, DSOrganize ...).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know if I would say that.. I personally have bricked a few of them back when I sold them pre-flashed on dspassme.com.  But, I would say they are extremely hard to perminently brick.  If you have access to another device that you can boot with in GBA mode, you should be able to recover.  Even if you have to boot Chishm's updater from another device and swap in the GBA MP to flash it again.  Being that I had my own available to recover wtih, I had never had one perminently brick.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You should also be able to recover in DS mode, eg by WMB, if there were an app to do that.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
