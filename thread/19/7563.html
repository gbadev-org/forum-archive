    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try another CF card. Also, you should not prefix a loader to the file, as that is meant for standard GBA flash carts, not the GBAMP.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, see what happens without the file on the card. It should reboot into GBA mode.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nope, I've figured out that v2 isn't compatible with WiFiME, only PassME and FlashME. Put v1 on GBAmp, rename FlashME file to _BOOT_MP.nds and that should work. I had the same problem and tried everything you did. Then I tried v1 and it worked flawlessly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
