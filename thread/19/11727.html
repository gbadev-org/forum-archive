    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys...
<br/>
So I ordered with my SuperCard a replacement DS Shell (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.psxbox.net/?gOo=Z29vZHNfZGV0YWlscy5kd3Q&amp;goodsid=1324" target="_blank">http://www.psxbox.net/?gOo=Z29vZHNfZGV0YWlscy5kd3Q&amp;goodsid=1324</a>) and after I removed all the DS Parts from the old shell, I began applying it to the new one. For some unknown reason, the ribbon cable that goes from the mainboard of the DS to the Top screen got a very very little cut. But, that cut was enough to stop my DS from working. When I now turn on my DS, both screens turn on for a few moments, the top black(not wokring apparently), and the bottom fades from black to white(the FlashME I guess) then turns blue, and then the DS turn off. So now I no more have a working DS. I was wondering if there was some way to fix this cut, in any way possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
What part of the DS if I buy would give me the ribbon I'm talking about?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry, being totally honest, I can't help.

Save up to get a DS lite I guess, not the best answer you were expecting..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
