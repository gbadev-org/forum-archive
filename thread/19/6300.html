Nintendo are at this years Comic-Con, which I think is Friday to Sunday or something like that, and on the list of games...
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br/>
DS Download Station (similar to E3)</span>
<br/>
<br/>
They might be the same ones as E3, but it could be used to get another capture of the Zelda trailer.
<br/>
If anyone's going, and you have the stuff for wmb, I think you need to get in contact with Firefly to get the stuff to capture the demos...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Just do it the way everyone did it before his program was released. Use the Airopeek demo if you're running Windows, or a similar porgram that allows raw wireless packet dumps to be made. Transfer and capture several times (I believe 5 is sufficent) so you know theres a good chance you don't have any missing data, and save the dumps. Worry about being able to reconstruct them later.
<br/>
<br/>
The nice part about dumping them this way is you don't need a card with a RALINK chipset. (Just something with drivers that let you do a raw dump)
<br/>
I thought I'd point this out in case anyone has the capability to do so and didn't know it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Compare taking raw captures and "worry(ing) about being able to reconstruct them later" to, "1) Walk past DS download station with laptop in your backpack set to capture using an easy turnkey DS capture program. 2) Get home and post binaries up for everybody else in 5 minutes". I'm not saying there's that program available (even from Firefly) but if it were, anybody could get demos from any event, not just a select few who are knowledgable enough to reconstruct binaries from packet level stream captures.<br/>_________________<br/>-Unrequited</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That was just my misunderstanding then. In the E3 demos topic, I remember Firefly saying for people to contact him about it.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Actually, maybe maybe not. From the e3 Demos topic:

Sorry, didn't see that.
<br/>
Still, the other method would work for people who don't have an RT chipset. The only disadvantage is, as said before, reconstructing them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
