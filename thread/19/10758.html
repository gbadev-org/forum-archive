    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered a G6 Lite (which just arrived) and a Max Media Launcher (which I won't receive until week, because of Datel...).
<br/>
<br/>
So, I've plugged my G6 Lite into my DS Lite and to my suprised it booted!  I get the G6 Lite main menu and everything!
<br/>
<br/>
Does this mean I don't need the NoPass (eg. Max Media Launcher) after all?  Can I just throw flashme onto my G6 Lite and then flash it that way?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If it has a big black border around it, then it's the GBA menu. You can run Luminesweeper and other GBA homebrew from the GBA menu, but to run FlashMe or any other DS homebrew, you need the NoPass.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
