    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The topic pretty much explains it, I hope that this is the right spot to post. Basically, I am using a flashed NDS lite with a supercard lite in it, and was just curious as to how wmb works. Anyone wanna help me out?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can use it as a method of sending from a PC to the DS.  If you are running Windows then you need a PCI/Cardbus wi-fi card with a RT2560 chipset.  <a class="postlink" href="http://users.belgacom.net/bn967347/download.htm" target="_blank">Install the driver and WMB Application and then run WMB.exe -data file.nds</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Boot the DS, select "Download Play" and wait for the game to show up.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">does the router thing still function as a normal one too? Or would I just be better off using my card normally?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ralink cards can only be used for WMB when Firefly's driver is enabled.  You have to switch back to normal driver if you want to use it as a normal wi-fi card.  Firefly's driver doesn't support USB ralink cards, so you can't use the Nintendo Wi-fi connector.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">aww well, I got an sd reader thing for my computer anyways. I just thought download playing my apps would be kinda fun. I don't feel like doing all of that confusing stuff and buyin a new router when I already have a superkey and supercard lite, lol. Thanks for the info Sektor =).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
