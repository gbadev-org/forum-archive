    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi, I have a few questions that i keep getting mixed answers to and was hoping some one could help me out with.
<br/>
<br/>
1: I have a red ds(Mario Kart Bundle)NU122****5[8] and every place I seemed to look on sites they said the red ones wont work, is this true?
<br/>
<br/>
2: the main thing I want to use this for is old NES games like contra and other old games. I seen some where you can do this with the DS, is this true also?
<br/>
<br/>
3: Which would I use Passme2 or passkey2? ive seen a few post and i have mixed feelings twords both as i have never used either, but passme2 seems to be the choice of most.
<br/>
<br/>
4: would a M3 Adapter SD be my best bet?
<br/>
<br/>
i have seen some post and know i need to flash my FW but can you do this  with passme2/passkey2 on a red ds?
<br/>
<br/>
also even if i get a passkey2 do i need a JTAG?
<br/>
<br/>
my questions are more geared twords the passkey2, cause i figured  getting the bundle would be cheaper, is there anything that gimps the passkey2? that the passme2 overcomes?
<br/>
<br/>
thx ahead of time.  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well if you just want to play NES games you could just get a gbamp from lik-sang because it can play NES games and you wouldnt need a passme 
<br/>
<br/>
but if you really want a passme and to play homebrew then you need to check your firmware version.  
<br/>
<br/>
just make sure theres a DS game in and go to picto chat lobby 1 and then take the DS game out
<br/>
<br/>
if the screen turns yellow or magenta you will need passme2 and m3
<br/>
<br/>
if it turns any other color (dark green or whatever) then you should use passme1 and gbamp (cheapest but doesnt work with newer firmware DS's aka yellow or magenta)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

True - in GBA mode using PocketNES, and only for ROMs that'll fit inside the GBA's RAM space.
<br/>
<br/>
If you use a Passme, though, you can run NesDS, which can use the full 4MB of DS RAM, gives you very good control over the scaling that's done to make the NES display fit on the DS screen, and also lets you use the shoulder buttons to "rewind"/"fast-forward" the emulation...  which is great fun, really.  PocketNES is great stuff but it's really much better when run from a real flash cart IMO (or at least a good fake, like an M3 or whatever).  NesDS gives you more pixels and generally a better experience IMO.  The only thing you get with PocketNES that NesDS can't provide is multi-player via link - but you can't do that on the DS in GBA mode anyway.<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC
<br/>
I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.

The most recent version of PocketNES (NES emulator) and Goomba Color (Game Boy emulator) can use virtual memory to load bigger ROM files piece by piece, treating the .nes or .gb file on the CF card as a read-only swap file. A few NES games have slowdown on the GBAMP, but then a few GBA games have slowdown on the SuperCard.
<br/>
<br/>
Yellow means you <span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span> use a GBAMP to install homebrew-friendly firmware; you have to use an M3, SuperCard, or traditional GBA flash card. If you're considering an M3, please also consider a SuperCard, as the SuperCard CF is less expensive than any M3, and it lets you remove the CF card (to reload it on a computer) without always having to remove the SuperCard.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

From a GBA flash cart, for sure.  From a GBAMP, only by swapping.  I was basing my assertion on this statement:

Stuff that bankswitches a lot will run super-slow, kinda like when your computer starts going to the swap file. Don't even bother with Mario 3 or Kirby.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have another questions for you guys which would be better to use, the CF or SD for M3? I already have a few SD cards so i think that would be more my choice, but is there a down side to the SD card vs the CF?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i have looked into the supercard, and my main thing is, on the M3 website it says it plays emulation games with out modding/patching anything. just load the emulator, games and play. does supercard also do this? if so i would like to cheack it out in more detail, i also heard that you have to turn the ds off then back on to save with the M3, and you dont have to do that to save with supercard. is this also true? and do you have a link to a site with detail info on the supercard? i  keep getting  <a href="http://www.gameboy-advance.net/nintendo_ds/nds-supercard.htm" target="_blank">http://www.gameboy-advance.net/nintendo_ds/nds-supercard.htm</a> every time i search with google, either that or ebay listings

Just a card reader.  You can get those at your local Circuit City or CompUSA for around $20.  Plug it into a USB port and any modern system will recognize it as another storage device and you can move files to it.<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC

also i have seen some post that say supercard runs some gba games slow is this just with supercard?

A CompactFlash card can operate in PCMCIA mode or ATA disk mode. ATA disk controllers are very well understood, and the hardware-level interfaces are nice to deal with. The available MMC and SD adapters, on the other hand, are in effect general purpose I/O ports connected to the pins of the card, meaning that you have to do a lot of bit banging to operate the serial protocol that the cards use. In addition, even once you've got the SPI physical layer working, SD protocol is significantly more complicated and less familiar than ATA.
<br/>
<br/>
CF scales better to larger capacity.
<br/>
<br/>
A decent card reader should work with CF, MMC/SD, SmartMedia SSFDC (old digital cameras including my own), xD (newer Olympus cameras), and Memory Stick (PSP and Sony cameras).

The slowdown comes from the way the SuperCard handles saving. It patches the GBA ROM to copy SRAM to the CF card periodically, and that causes slowdown. Nintendo DS programs are not affected.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
