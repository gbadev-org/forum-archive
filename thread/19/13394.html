    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there!  I'm new to the DS homebrew scene, and though I've done some research, I'm still a little confused about a few things.
<br/>
<br/>
I decided to buy an R4 a few days ago, before I realized that I can't get saves from my DS carts to the R4 (without wifi).  Originally I wanted to do this because I wanted to put all my games onto the R4, but I've found out from reading this forum that there's probably not a legal way for me to do this, so now I just want to back up the saves.  I'll just use the R4 for pass-me-ing, mp3-playing, for homebrew, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
It's too late for me to cancel or change the order, it's already shipped, so I'm looking for a cheap slot-2 card to use to backup the saves, and maybe run some GBA homebrew.  My main question is: Can the "EZflash 3-in-1" back-up saves from DS carts?  I'm guessing theirs probably homebrew to do this, but I don't want to make another mistake...
<br/>
<br/>
Having just realized I've created a wall of text, I'll sum up my questions:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  Can I use a R4 and a 3-in-1 to back up saves from my DS games?
<br/>
2.  It is illegal for me to put my DS games on the R4, right?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time, and sorry if I'm asking super-common questions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. I'm not sure, however recently I had the same problem (I wanted to backup my retail DS cart saves, while still wanting to run homebrew) so I got an R4DS and a Supercard SD so I could play DS homebrew with a nice slot 1 card, and so I could back up my saves. The Supercard SD also contains some nice RAM for Dslinux to use.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Only legal if you dump them yourself, but here is not the place to talk about that stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you can't use Wifi and SavSender, the only methods of backing up save files would be to use EEPINATOR or REIN or REINMOON, and I don't think any of them support saving to anything the 3in1 can use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, thanks for the responses.  Any suggestions for a slot-2 device that will allow me to back-up my saves easily?  I've got my eyes on either a EZ Flash 4 or a Supercard MicroSD lite.  I'm just price shopping right now.

<br/>
On that note, I'm guessing that the difference between the EZ Flash 4 compact and deluxe are quite significant:

I'm really not sure what all of this is:

 256Mb PSRAM (32 Mbytes)

 384Mb NorFLASH (48Mbytes)

 32Mb Loader (4 Mbytes)

 8Mb saver SRAM (1Mbyte)

Is that just added RAM or something?  I'm a complete noob here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The problem with that is I live way out in the boondocks, all I have is Dial-up.  I don't think the wifi/save sender approach will work for me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Then get an AP and use your PC to bridge your dial-up adapter to the AP.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Most people would recommend the deluxe over the compact.
<br/>
<br/>
The loader ram is self-explanatory (holds the OS)
<br/>
PSRAM is the ram where homebrew (and that which shall not be named) is loaded to each time execution.
<br/>
<br/>
The compact has only 8mb of psram and thus the size of homebrew launched is limited to 8mb.
<br/>
<br/>
The deluxes extra psram will also allow (recently) for the running of DSLinux with ram support (And potentially other ram using programs if developers add support).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
