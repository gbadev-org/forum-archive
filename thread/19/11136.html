Well, at least those are "NEW" products.. I don't mind them as much because I don't have time to research all the new products as much as I used to (back when I had a job ;) )  But this post is about OLD hardware..  And doesn't even mention the SuperCard SD Lite, which would have been more acceptable..  This post is like.. what.. a 1998 ad campain or something..  Sure, it was probably "revolutionary" back then.. but now?
<br/>
<br/>
What's even worse, is the fact that xboxpuffin (as with the huge post count of 2) could be an ANTI-SuperCard person posting this information to try to make SuperCard look bad.  Kinda like if I posted a message about how the GBA Move Player is the ultimate Movie viewing device to take your GBA or NDS into the future!  It would also get this kind of response.. which, I see as a negative response.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
