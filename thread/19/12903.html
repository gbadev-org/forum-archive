    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am completely new to homebrew, and this is all a bit confusing to me. There are a few questions I would like answered.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. How big is the average ROM?
<br/>
<br/>
2. Is there anything I need to do to the ROM to make it usable?
<br/>
<br/>
3. Can I have multiple ROMs on one microSD card?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The answer to all of these questions is please do not talk about talk about pirated commercial roms on these forums. Not even "backups" of games you own. Please read the forum rules.
<br/>
<br/>
You might seek information from the manufacturer of your hardware (supercard, m3, G6 etc.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
1. Commercial ones are (I think) 256 Mbits
<br/>
2. For slot 1 cards, no. Slot 2: some may require a fake GBA header.
<br/>
3. I'm sure you could, if anything you'll just need to add a menu either first or last to make sure you can still use them.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Homebrew programs can be anywhere from 10 KiB to 10 MiB or more. And yes, you can have multiple homebrew programs on one microSD card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
