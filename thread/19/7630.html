    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a 256mbit EZF Advance card which I'd like to use to flash my DS firmware.  The only way I know how to put anything on the card is with the EZFA Client software/cable via my GBA SP.  I think this program only allows me to put a .gba file on the flash card.  Can I simply append ".gba" to the flashme.nds file to get it on the card?
<br/>
<br/>
I have access to a passme and also have a compatible wifime NIC.
<br/>
<br/>
The procedure for flashing the DS firmware via wifime isn't all that clear for me (and I've read the tutorials).  Maybe I could use wifime to simply put the flashme.nds file on the cart and then run it using passme??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First make sure it's FlashMe v5 you have.
<br/>
<br/>
You need to append it to a GBA loader. (I used to have an EZF myself, so I know how they work.)
<br/>
<br/>
Go download Moonshell. When you unzip it, you'll find a "wintools" folder. One of the programs in there is "dsbuild.exe". Drag &amp; drop the .nds file on the dsbuild.exe, and it will automagically append the required loader and make a copy named &lt;whatever&gt;.ds.gba. (Much, much easier than mucking about on the command line with manually appending ndsloader.bin.) <span style="font-style: italic">That</span> is the file you need to flash.
<br/>
<br/>
Then you stick the flashcart in your DS, put a DS game in your PassMe, put the PassMe in your DS, remove the battery cover and the sticker covering SL1, and turn it on. When FlashMe loads, you need to press X B X B (I think) and then short SL1, making sure you hold the battery securely. When it reaches 100% and says "complete", it's safe to turn off your DS and you don't need the PassMe or WiFiMe ever again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Whew....that was a little scary.  I couldn't get good contact across SL1 for some reason.  It halted a bunch of times early on, then I got a good connection and I didn't breathe until I saw 100%.
<br/>
<br/>
Seems to be working fine, but I did run across a rom that worked perfectly fine with my superpass but freezes somewhat regularly with flashme.  Is this something that normally happens?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your clear instructions!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not normally, but it happens occasionally.
<br/>
<br/>
And by "ROM", you mean a homebrew ROM, right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yes. The connector has two "lips", which need to be bridged with something conductive. One way to do it is to use a tiny screwdriver; you may be able to use the same one that you used to open the battery compartment. Or try a suitably bent paperclip.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi...ran into another game that freezes in the middle of playing.  Never encountered this when I was using the passme.  Could it be my flashcard (EZFA 256mbit) has some issues with flashme?  Also, if I flash back the "original" firmware image, will the DS be exactly as it was before?  And would that mean I lose malware recovery code that's in the protected area?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you used PassMe2 to install FlashMe on a DS with <span style="color: red">new</span> firmware, and then you install NoFlashMe, then you'll be on the old firmware, not the <span style="color: red">new</span> firmware.

<br/>
Yes, you do lose FlashMe's recovery code when you install NoFlashMe. (That's also why it counts <span style="font-style: italic">down,</span> so that the recovery code is overwritten last.) If you want to use NoFlashMe in order to get warranty service on your DS, then consider installing Stealth FlashMe instead.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks, for the answer tepples.  (It is a silver DS that had the older firmware on it...used a Superpass to flash it. Did the "stealth" version too.)
<br/>
<br/>
I don't really want to go back to the NoFlashMe version, I think I'll try a different flash cart and see if that makes a diff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
