    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I need help with running nds roms on my supercard lite. I have the supercardlite and a 1gb micro sd card, I got it flashed and I have the super card v2.55c software(I used that to transfer several nds roms but didn't work), is there anything else that I need? 
<br/>
The problem is I see the supercard menu when I turn on the ds lite and also the fules I have transferred onto it (eg. 0468 - Point Blank DS (U).nds.dsq) and when I click onto it both the screens turn all white and nothing happens on my ds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
