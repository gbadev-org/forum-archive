    <h4>#87295 - Vic-Viper - Tue Jun 13, 2006 3:56 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After flashing my DS Lite with V7, I noticed a reduction in audio volume.  To test my theory, I took a Flashed and unflashed DS lite and booted Mario Kart at the same time.  I confirmed that both had the same audio settings and set to max output.  I then proceeded to blind test it between 3 people and confirmed each time that the flashed DS was noticably quieter.  I turned down the unflashed DS until they matched and the results came to about 60%.  Once the unflashed one was down to 60% output, nobody could tell the difference between either DS.
<br/>
<br/>
To confirm that V7 was in fact the problem, I then proceeded to flash the unflashed DS lite.  After the flash, the audio was reduced and both flashed DSs had the same output level.
<br/>
<br/>
So if you use Flashme, expect your DS to be quiet until this is fixed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I do have trouble hearing the music in Mario Kart, but I think that's the game's fault. His sounds louder at the menu but they're the same once the game starts.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I don't think the DS Lite is quieter than the original, I just think it's more sensitive. I can still hear things on my DS Lite even when the volume is near the low end, whereas on my old DS, I couldn't hear anything lower than halfway on the volume control, and anything above that was a lot louder.
<br/>
<br/>
But like some of the other guys said, it gets to be too loud anyways at full volume, and I use earphones already.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think that's just a bug...happens on Super Mario 64 occasionally for me (that's flashed or unflashed DS).<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My volume is definately softer than his. I think this may be a real bug.<br/>_________________<br/>It's 'CubeGuy.' One word. No space.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#88312 - JaJa - Sun Jun 18, 2006 7:05 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the problem is with differing sound hardware revisions.
<br/>
This is why you can't compare between DSs (unless they are the same age and so hardware revision.
<br/>
<br/>
Also what version firmware are people upgrading to/from.
<br/>
Can some perform a proper test, using the same DS, with the regular firmware and then FlashMe.
<br/>
<br/>
None of this buy ear nonsense either. Use a decibelmeter or hook the DS upto a PC record the file to WAV and compare the wave forms. If there is a difference in volume I would expect one sound to have higher peaks (amplitude).
<br/>
<br/>
Try and get someone who doesn't know of the problem, as this may affect your call.
<br/>
<br/>
I myself don't think there is a difference, but I haven't tested it at all.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

    <h4>#88319 - HyperHacker - Sun Jun 18, 2006 7:27 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, but the game could just assume that the firmware will leave the sound system set up a certain way, and so not bother to set it up itself. Since normally it'd only be loaded from Nintendo's firmware, that should be a fairly safe assumption.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think some of you are missing the point, its NOT about comparing DS Brick to DS Lite.  This is comparing DS Lite to DS Lite flashed.  Once flashed, the retail games are noticably quieter.  My unflashed Lite was 40% louder than the flashed one.  Then I flashed it and it got quiet like my other flash DS Lite.  I think the firmware flash maybe setting the levels to a different revision (maybe DS Brick?).  The only way you can test this is between 2 DS Lites, flashed and unflashed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been thinking about it, and it may be just a silly thought, but isn't teh problem maybe teh fact that a volume slider is at max at flashing time and flashme assumes a halfway position, thus setting volume too low. And u loose higher volume settings?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think software can detect the volume slider position.
<br/>
BTW, I do recall hearing that if you put old firmware on the Lite (or the other way around?) trying to adjust the brightness would make the speakers pop a bit. Could be a bug in the brightness code?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This only started happening since I upgraded from v6 to v7 though so it had me worried that this was due to the flashme v7 code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
