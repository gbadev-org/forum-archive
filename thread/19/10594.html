    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have recently opened up my Max Media Dock (MMD) for NDS . Following is my finding.
<br/>
<br/>
When you open up the MMD you will find only 2 major chip in this .
<br/>
<br/>
1) cypress CY7C68300B USD to ATA bridge
<br/>
2) ST EEPROM
<br/>
<br/>
It has no SRAM no Latches No Bios like other SC and Easy Flash . What does it means? It measn that it cannot be used with Flashme currently as it does not emulate a GBA cart at all and it cannot be use to run the GBA code as it would be to slow to run from the CF but is it fine for DS code
<br/>
<br/>
This is how i suspect the MML + MMD works ( correct me if i am wrong please)
<br/>
<br/>
the Datel media player or media launch works buy emulating the NDS catridge . Unlike traditional Passthru device that jump the address to the GBA flash address it actually hold a NDS program inside it whhich access the MMD CF and load a default NDS code ( in this case Bootme.nds) 
<br/>
<br/>
The Bootme.nds is a browser software which inturn load MP3 Files or NDS files from the CF. 
<br/>
<br/>
That how i figure how MMD works please correct me if i am wrong

Why does Flashme need a GBA cart?
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing Flashme would do to help it is to protect against firmware bricks, as it can boot itself all in the DS slot anyway...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hmm I have just purchased the MMD, and from what I can tell, the DS card that comes with the pack is like a nopass MML with the Max media player data on it also.  When I have a flashcard inserted inside of it, It will boot into any of them.  It seems that the card looks for something to boot off the GBA first, then loads the media player.  This is probably to load the updated versions of the media player.  So in order for it to work with flashme, flashme would need something like the max media player attached to the flashme, then have some kind of branch to do a test to see if the card in the gba slot is a max media dock or another device, then load the max media software<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds" target="_blank">http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have an objection to that.
<br/>
If there WAS just a program to start up an MMD, then I could run the update file to use it right?
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Wrong.</span>
<br/>
You cannot use a slot-1 flash card + a boot file to start it.  Two white screens.
<br/>
Thus, I blew a big hole in your idea.  Sorry to be so blunt, but it's the truth.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
