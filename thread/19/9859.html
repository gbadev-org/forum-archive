<br/>
Does anyone know a good website for the passme 2-z?
<br/>
Or has anyone else successfully used their passme 2-z with an american ds lite?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nevermind, I'm stupid. I figured it out.
<br/>
I'm about to attempt the flashage of a brand new (bought today) ds lite in the US.
<br/>
Unfortunately everytime I short the SL-1 terminal it turns off.
<br/>
I'm searching the forum for this solution (post it here if you can).
<br/>
Once I've succeeded (or failed) in flashing I'll post the results clearly for all to see.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If there was any doubt,
<br/>
THE AMERICAN DS LITE RELEASED ON JUN 11, 2006 CAN BE FLASHED WITH A SUPERCARD SD AND A PASSME 2-Z.

COMPLETE with backlight brightness settings.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
