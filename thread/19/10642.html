Howdy, I was the recent owner of the M3 CF but it was stolen.
<br/>
<br/>
So I need buy a DS/DSLITE... and another cart and this leaves me with a few questions..
<br/>
<br/>
Should I get another M3 CF because It's been perfect with everything I've tried or should I buy the SC CF instead. whats the compatbility issues with the SC CF compared to the M3 CF.
<br/>
<br/>
There have recently been sd and sd mini editions of both SC and M3, If I'm planning to buy the Lite.. The fullsized CF would look a little huge and is it worth looking into the SD/mini SD releases.
<br/>
<br/>
SD doesn't seem to work with some homebrew or is that just a matter of time? Would Getting a SD edition stop me from using the homebrew I love soo much.
<br/>
<br/>
Looks matter very little.. but the idea of placing the DSLite in my pocket without getting caught on my CF card would appeal.
<br/>
<br/>
Please post your reviews/opinions/issues your've experienced with your current card(s) and Remember I'm interested in homebrew compatability, not "game" compatability.
<br/>
<br/>
SC CF vs M3 CF vs SC SD vs M3 SD (+ mini SD editions)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, if you don't want to spend so much, I'd get a GBAMP.
<br/>
<br/>
BUT, a Supercard CF isn't a bad idea. It will just stick out as much as a gba cart (which isn't at all in a phat ds, and just a bit in the ds lite) and then the cf will stick out just a bit. It has better compatibility than all those mini devices (I think) and it won't stick out like the M3 or GBAMP (it's worth noting that the m3 and gbamp would stick out A LOT on the ds lite, so that might be a risk as it may break if you dropped it or something.

Sorry about ur stuff getting stolen. I hope whoever did gets whats coming to them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Depends on what homebrew your talking about, most larger homebrew, scummvm, linux, moonshell work fine on SC SD, i cant really think of much that doesnt work on SD</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
