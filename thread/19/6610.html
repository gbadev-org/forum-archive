    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would also recomend jandaman.com. I got my EZ3 from them and thought they delivered great service. 
<br/>
<br/>
For DS Homebrew, I decided to get a devkit from dspassme.com as I needed the passme device anyway. I don't have a compatible wifi card, so I used the hardware method. The flashcart I got with it was a 256Mbit XG2Flash Turbo. Not a bad card, and worked fine for flashme and homebrew. My EZ3 would have worked as well (with Darkain's loader replacement) but I decided it was eaiser to have a seperate card for now. The GBAMP should be able to run flashme and homebrew as well. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anything bigger than 256Mbit and you will need to have technical details for the bankswitching and such to be able to use the extra space for DS stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

a:) You could probably get away with a smaller sized cart, I think 256 megabits (32 MEGABYTES is the most you could use without bankswitching (if I remember right, GBA carts are supposed to be only 256 Mbits or less, banksitching switches to the other 256 Mbits...it's not known how to do this for all flashcarts anyhow).  Anyway, regardless of whether my explanation is right or not, bankswitching will limit the size of DS homebrew for the most part to 32 MB or under.
<br/>
<br/>
b) not totally sure, but the cheapest I've seen in my travels is probably the X-ROM (works fine for DS homebrew although you need a GBA/GBA SP/GBA Player to flash it...you could likely get a used cart from somewhere for less though especially if it's one of the older carts).
<br/>
<br/>
C) Not sure here, I have no problems with my X-ROM although that's not to say someone else hasn't, heh.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I've got <span style="font-weight: bold">this</span> card and I like it a lot.  I'm pretty sure you can run homebrews on it, and hopefully I can test it out with a passme that I still need to buy soon.  The place to buy the card is at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.raidentech.com/gameboy.html" target="_blank">Raiden Tech</a> I bought the 512mb for $145 which I think is cheap.  I haven't looked around in a while for cards so I don't know if it's the cheapest now but it was then.  Have fun looking.

And if you only plan to load homebrew games, get an 256Mb version. Which is the maximal size you can use using flashme/wifime.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
