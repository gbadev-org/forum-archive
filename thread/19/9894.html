    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just picked up a NDSlite and would like to be able to run DS and GBA homebrew and roms.
<br/>
<br/>
Theres quite a few generations of equipment for modding the DS and I was wondering if anyone had any info on this one and how it works (does it work?):

<br/>
Also I see theres the M3 adapter or SuperCard/SuperKey. Does that work better?
<br/>
<br/>
Kinda new to this so forgive any ignorance. Just trying to figure out exactly what I need to run backups of my ds games so I wont have to carry around lots of carts everywhere and such.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and they stole the "NeoMAX" name from DM Ashura in the StepMania scene.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The SuperCard is great for DS stuff though it's not that good at GBA stuff. For the PassMe side of things you should probably get the Max Media Launcher or a dspassme.com (PassMe version 2) and install FlashMe immediately. (Though the Superpass 2 is probably fine.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hm, when you say it's not good at GBA, how good is it? I've been considering buying one, partially because I'd like to be able to run GBA homebrew &gt;256K and GBA ROM hacks. :-/ I'd prefer SC over M3 because it's cheaper, better supported, and AFAIK doesn't have any regional lockout (even if it doesn't really affect me, it still annoys me), but GBA support is important to me too.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It fits a bit snug into the slot. That kind of annoys me but it doesnt seem too terrible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">According to Supercard and other forums, you can't use the ordinary in-game saves on GBA games to save your game. Apparently, you need to use the Supercards built in In-Game Save feature.
<br/>
<br/>
(Can't verify, just what I heard)
<br/>
<br/>
Edit - Apparently, that's half right.
<br/>
<br/>
You can use the normal saving features of a GBA game, but there's a hot key which 'fixes' it to the SD/CF cart. If you don't 'fix' the save, it wont have actually taken place and will disappear when you power off. To use this hot key, you need to let the SC software patch your GBA game before writing it to the flash media. If you can't patch the game, you can follow <a class="postlink" href="http://eng.supercard.cn/manual/tip.htm" target="_blank">this FAQ</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum.

<br/>
<br/>
Are you one of these guys who quicksaves at every room when playing an FPS? :P
<br/>
<br/>
As for other problems, I have no idea. I don't believe it can play DS homebrew without special patching by the SC software, and I think its favourite flavour is .nds.
<br/>
