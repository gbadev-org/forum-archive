you do realize,
<br/>
CF cards that are 1gb cost $50,
<br/>
that x4 equals $200... and 4gb...{whoops this is what i get when your... nm}
<br/>
so infact your getting that bypass card and 1gb for free if you buy this :P...
<br/>
<br/>
and why would you need to exploit it?...
<br/>
i already said in another topic,
<br/>
you don't have to exploit it because they sell the bypass card for $20,
<br/>
and it works with most flash carts according to their site(i guess that means one's with sram :P...)
<br/>
<br/>
so yeah...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

just because they let you bypass it doesn't mean you can run homebrew because it would have to be written for the max media player</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

fixed it, sorry...
<br/>
brain age is going to my head :P...
<br/>
<br/>
anyway, i live in New York and their they have the famous New York times lol...
<br/>
in it you can find atleast every week,
<br/>
sales...
<br/>
and if they have sales on CF its always $45-$55 for 1gb,
<br/>
$20-$30 for 512mb...
<br/>
and so on :p...
<br/>
i guess nobody else gets sales like that :D
<br/>
<br/>
but ebay often has the same price as the sale :P<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">
