    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Odd, it says "Homebrew FAT libraries will recognise CycloDS, resulting in excellent homebrew software compatibility," but I've never heard of it. From what I see on their website, it is either the same as a supercard, or a knockoff/clone (the chinese like to do that sort of thing a lot). It's hard to compare, since the only shop I could find it is in UK, but it costs a few dollars more than what I could find a supercard microsd for.
<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend just getting the supercard instead, it's more known, and better supported, and seems to cost about the same.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You say clone; I say compatible. Clone, compatible, let's call the whole thing off :)
<br/>
<br/>
Given a hardware interface described in terms of a set of memory-mapped registers, it is relatively straightforward to design original hardware that implements the same interface. When MAX Media Dock first came out, Datel was wrongly accused of copying the GBA Movie Player. It turned out that Datel just implemented the most obvious design for a (parallel) ATA interface to the CompactFlash card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
Like I have said, my CycloDS seems to not be working, event he supplied moonshell doesn't run.  I decided, for the fun of it, to apply the CycloDS dldi file to it.  The tool said it was already patched with CycloDS?
<br/>
<br/>
So then I decided to try the latest moonshell patched witht he CycloDS dldi file.  Same thing, moonshell starts and says adaptor not found :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
