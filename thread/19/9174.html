    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My friend and I bought Nintendo DSs yesterday and Metroid Prime Hunters... He got a silver DS and I got a blue one. Turns out he got a V3 firmware but I got stuck with a V4. So, I have to get a passme2... but, I can't find a site that sells it programmed for use with Metroid Prime Hunters, and I can't find the game listed in Darkfader's game list with a VHDL file. I'm not sure if I can make the passme2 work with the game myself by changing the VHDL file, but if it's simple i'd like to know. Anyways, i'm just wondering if anyone is using this game for their passme2, and i'm asking for anyones help in getting homebrew code running on my ds. Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There have to be specific 16-bit values in the first .nds file on the card in order for PassMe2 to work. Many games don't contain those values.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, It seems that the game isn't listed at PIRACY-DOT-COM or in Darkfaders table. So, I guess it's too new. I hope that this game isn't one that doesn't have the values needed by the Passme2.
<br/>
<br/>
Another question. Does finding the values involve just running a program on the DS that show the values after a search?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes. This program is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com/blog/?p=34" target="_blank">PassMe Call Finder</a> by Natrium42, one of the engineers behind PassMe.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Actually, they have been a bit slow in updating, so it may have been released.

It can be done using the newest NDStool, IIRC.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

NDStool produces a .sav file and a .vhd file. Is there a way to make a .gba to use that .sav, and a way to use that .vhd?<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You could inject the .sav into Pepsiman's tool, replacing a different .sav with it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
