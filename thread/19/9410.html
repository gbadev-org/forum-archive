Datel has made a Max Media Launcher, I think it would be useful to make a similar device: It is same as a normal DS game card, but has a switch on top that says EXECUTE and WRITE. When the switch is set to EXECUTE it runs software stored in the card normally. When set to WRITE, the display might say something like "To continue, turn off DS and set switch on DS game card to EXECUTE, then turn on DS". If you press the right combination of button it will display a menu for uploading software to the card which will run in EXECUTE mode. The menu might have options such as this:

Then you could run homebrew software on Nintendo DS without any extra equipment! You could give card to whoever you want to, they can use the card just fine.
<br/>
<br/>
You still need some equipment to make DS game, such as Supercard CF, wireless router, etc. Or you could type it manually in (but that takes too long).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you give card to someone else and they change it, you can put it back how it was before.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't know, maybe you could take a commercial card or Datel card and then modify it<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
