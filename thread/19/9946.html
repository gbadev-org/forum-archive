    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Anyone have the US DS Lite working with the Max Media Launcher?  I have a Flash2advance Ultra which works fine in GBA mode but with the Max Media launcher and a ds.gba file it just shows the logo and goes to two white screens.  If others have it working with other carts then I'll just find something that works, but if it doesn't work at all with the US DSL then we've got an issue...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It means the PassMe device (the MAX Media Launcher in your case) is working.
<br/>
You need to ensure that your cart software doesn't write any loaders or alter the header, as this will stop the homebrew from working.

What homebrew are you trying to run?<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the reply.  At least it's getting somewhere then.  I'm flashing with PowerWriter, and I only put one app on the cart so there isn't any header mangling or bootloader programs being added (or so it claims).  So far I've just tried the ds.gba file from A Touch of War .7 and .8d, Ill try a few others and see if I have any more success.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I tried it with flashme on a gba flashcart but it stays at the white screens, what does this mean?<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It means you can flash it to a PassMe2 provided you own a compatible DS game and an appropriate JTAG cable.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
