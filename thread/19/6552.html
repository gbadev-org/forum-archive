<br/>
<br/>
Just a quick survey.  I am thinking of starting a little side business of coloring DS and GBA.  Never painted before but I'm going to do so on my own systems first.  The question is simple.  Would you be interested in getting your DS custom painted or buying a custom painted DS?
<br/>
<br/>
I may have a spare DS soon and I am wondering if anyone would like to buy my experiment.  I'll provide pictures of course :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, I was thinking about painting my DS seeing as how the original silver color is a bit dull (not to mention that its starting to chip too..). Sadly, I couldnt find a thing about it posted anywhere, and anyway I'm not particularly good at that sorta thing, but if I could send my DS somewhere to get painted I'd do it in a heartbeat.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would be interesting especially if you can find someone who is good at airbrushing to do some custom jobbies... IMHO much better than the cheap, cheezy skins that are out there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, that skins are pretty crappy. Its not like I'd want anything too complicated either, just a sorta dark olive green metallic finish really</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm... can't say I agree with you.
<br/>
<br/>
If I was dissatisfied with my silver DS, I think I'd just prefer a plain colour myself.
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm not :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Better than most of the commercially available ones, but around the bumps at the top and the speakers etc., like the others, it has its weaknesses.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
