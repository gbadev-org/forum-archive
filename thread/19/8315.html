    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, sorry if this has been asked yet, couldn't find information about it.
<br/>
<br/>
Question see subject.
<br/>
So, do I need a PassMe or will WiFiMe work?
<br/>
<br/>
DS is an early one, I think FW1, 2 or 3 (not my DS, so not certain).
<br/>
GBAMP has modified firmware. Boots fine on FlashMe'd DS. Don't have Non-FlashMe'd DS for testing, so I'm asking.
<br/>
<br/>
If it doesn't work, what do I need to make it work?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Should work fine if it's V1-3, just do the Pictochat test.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I'm almost 100% sure it's V1-3.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tested and it's dark green (v3 right?).
<br/>
<br/>
However the GBAMPv2 won't boot with WiFiMe (neither on my flashed one nor on my friend's unflashed one). White screens.
<br/>
It does boot with FlashMe on my DS, though.
<br/>
<br/>
What could be wrong? For example, FlashMe installer boots on both (if GBA flash cart is inserted). Friend doesn't want FlashMe on his DS, so we're asking for help with WiFiMe now.

Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does he know about the version that doesn't remove the startup screen, making it identical to standard firmware except for the homebrew capability? Or the recovery code that allows you to fix a bricked DS? Really I can't imagine why he wouldn't want it. (And it's easy to revert back to the original.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
