Am i wrong?Is it magic? Can we use a XG2 flash + passme/wifime instead of a neoflash kit for booting dS backups? Soon dS backup support on other gba flash cards?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">exactly my thoughts ;).  I have a neoflash on the way to me this Monday.  I thought I was the only one thinking this.  Thing is though - you only save 1/2 the price of the neoflash when buying XG cart and that's assuming you have a passme already - so after a point (once you've included import tax of part etc, cost of passme and cart)... is it worth it?  Anyway - would be nice to recycle the passmes I have :) and help out my mates!  
<br/>
<br/>
Having read that article all my suspicions seem to have been verified.  Anyone know of a seller of XG2 turbo 512 carts?  Damn that's cheeky of them, but then again most passme makers have stopped making them.  So I suppose it's the logical progression.  What I don't understand is why all this patching of roms to use save area of actual NDS cart a) can't be done for homebrew b) (not endorsing piracy) can't be used with other carts - why does it have to be an XG cart?? Or am I being stupid</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Proteanruler on Sun May 08, 2005 3:07 am; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From all the info I've seen, you're right. The NeoFlash kits are just XG2's and PassMe's that have been repackaged and rebranded (and potentially overpriced). The review says that this is the only way to get a PassMe-type device now, and this is partially true as natrium42 is not ordering any more materials, Kraln's site is down (or link changed), and Lynx is out of stock. Lynx ordered another 100 sets of parts though, so that's why I say this detail is not entirely true.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the NeoFlash team has been smart about their marketting efforts, i.e., giving away several dozen kits to developers, and now starting a contest to give away more. I don't care if they have rebranded existing hardware, this is what you see in any given industry. It's also standard marketting practice to cleverly make it seem like you have something new and unique by using a catchy new term for the same old tech: "Magic Key Technology Support".
<br/>
<br/>
I personally prefer that the new product makes it clear what it really is, without any obscurities to cause misconceptions. Like when Mazda says the Mazda3 uses the same suspension as the Ford Focus and the same frame as the Volvo S40.  No one is required to present the facts like this though. Sometimes it's better to leave room for mystery (from the retailer's POV). A good consumer would rather have all the info up-front though and know what the tech really is.

<br/>
Presently, is there any way to make a DS backup? Is a DS backup to be considered a backup of a) a commercial ROM, b) a homebrew ROM, or c) something else like the DS firmware? From the way I interpret things, there are no true DS backups (of commercial ROMs), so no kit out there can boot this kind of backup.
<br/>
<br/>
One last thought... if there really was something special and unique about the NeoFlash kit, I think they would have said more about what this new feature is. There's very little reason to keep a marketable feature secret, when boasting about it would dispel doubts and boost sales. You can say you have feature X without divulging any trade secrets. Thus I personally think that there's no new features in the NeoFlash, except that you have your PassMe and GBA flash cart all in one package, with commercial support available for both. This was inevitable and all-in-all a good thing.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by FourScience on Sun May 08, 2005 3:08 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
 I think the problem lies in most carts not being able to load straight .nds files.  So rather than stuff being written specificallyh for Neoflash/XG - am I correct in thinking this is the only cart/software that can do this??  Prob just a case of other updating their stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
I am quite interested in seeing Neoflash exposed and encouraging other carts (i.e. F2a ultra - my favourite) to not get sidelined cos of XG's/neoflashe's (even though I have one on the way!).  F2A ultra is a beautiful cart - I am sad to have to switch but would sell this XS/"neoflash" cart in a flash if I could use my F2A ultra instead of this xg for straight .nds files.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They'd also have to patch the ROM's file system driver to load assets from the GBA ROM rather than from the DS card, but given the ease of automatic SRAM-patching on GBA and BBA-patching on GameCube, that might be straightforward.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

In a neoflash review a guy wrote he just added the allready sram-patched GS rom in the menu as an (normal) nds file. Maybe this indicates the patching is done offline and is not done on flashing or online. And if this is true, it could work on other flash cards as well.
<br/>
<br/>
What i don't get is why the XG2 flash 256Mb doesn't work with the GS nds file (problem in the linkersoftware or the flashcard?), and what is the difference in extra flash features between XG2-512Mb, XG2-256Mb, and other flashcards.
<br/>
<br/>
Some questions could be answered with some simple reverse-engineering, but a XG2 flashcard or Neo flashcard is needed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
You mean the GS patched nds file is encrypted? I am (not yet) familiar with nds loaders and nds format(s). 
<br/>
<br/>
But wouldn't it be possible to write a GS nds file to a XG2 or neoflash card using the neoflash writer (with the  ndsloader.dll), and read it back somehow from the card and find out what ndsloader.dll did to the image on the card in order the let it run on the DS? After that you can try the same with a homebrew nds file, read it back, and compare it with the results of the GS nds readback.

the GS versions have a gba header, so it looks like they have some kind of loader.

So were you able to use the Neo software with the XG2 and do you have to do anything to GS mario (like attatch a loader) or did you just drop it in the Neo software and flash it?
<br/>
<br/>
I just ordered a 1GB XG2 today myself so I hope it really is a Neo. I already have a F2A 256mb but figured I could use a 1GB card. I have a working wifime/flashme setup so I didn't bother getting a passme, just the XG2 and USB linker.

<br/>
Grrrr....what a crock. I mean the early GST releases worked with flashme why the need to change. This relationship between GST and Neo is almost disturbing. I mean it totally breaks the code of the scene. Which has always been to do this stuff for non-profit reasons. 
<br/>
<br/>
The flashme solution is so slick.....no extra hardware is the way to go.  I hate dongles.....which is basicly what the passme/neokey becomes when you don't need it do to flashme
<br/>
<br/>
Alas all of this is still in its early fazes. Other flash card companies will figure out what neo has done and other release groups will emerge hopefully bringing us no-dongle releases.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok thats the end of my rant. Until I get some hardware to play with I will suspend all judgement. Just having the whole DS dev scene come along so quickly is exciting. Thanx to all the cool coders who have helped make this possible.

if you remove the gba header then ndstool is able to look at the ds header somewhat correctly, and you can see there that the addresses are odd to say the least. Trying to extract files causes a loop and the FS is not read.
<br/>
<br/>
So remove the DS header as well and get ndstool to remake it, and then try to extract files. It works a little better in that its going to more than one address in the loop, but it would appear that the FAT of the ROM is also patched with odd/incorrect values.
<br/>
<br/>
It would seem to me at least that these values are corresponding to specific addresses and commands to do with the xg carts, and for a rom dump group to only released patched roms for a commercial product, well, they are not much of a rom group but a commercial hype group then. 
<br/>
<br/>
I think it would have been better to have let the dumps out without the patches and left it up to NEO to come up with patches if they wanted it to work with their commercial carts. Unfortunately that is not what happened. Can anyone say free flash kit bribes? Hushkits? (just kidding of course)... 
<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me of another product, and their "underground release group" - DMS and Toxic bios/os on PS2 - in that case at least the point is wrather moot that the commercial company obviously is unwilling to release the info for anyone to code a bios/os on their product, and to come up with a commercially viable app like toxic it would take a little more than hacking, it would take intimate knowledge of the work that went into the product as well as source code for an app that was never publicly sourced.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, if another ACTUAL group decides to step up and release the REAL dumps that are not patched then maybe I will get a real chance to see how a complete FS from nintendo looks, extracts and works, but as I said before, for my purposes GBFS is more than adequate unless a DS slot type writeable cart comes along... thanks costis! (and darkfader for the REAL deal filesystems in your dumps)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
My point exactly.....GST is not your typical scene release group and are more of a lets make this comercial product (Neo) more attractive group.
<br/>
<br/>
That just cuts against the typical scene vibe. I mean most sceners do this stuff because it is fun and educational, not to uphold a comercial product and not so people can play free software.
<br/>
<br/>
I give GST credit for being able to produce the first flash card runnable DS comercial roms. I mean it takes effort to rip the games and patch the hell out of them so they work, but they aren't really adding much to the overall scene because they are keeping their roms and info on the process they are using to themselves.
<br/>
<br/>
Now once my new cart shows up I will just shut up,be thankful and go play GSTs release of the Jap Meteos, that is until it gets a USA release later this month. The demo of that game has me hooked. It is easily the best stylus puzzle game ever. I baught Puyo on DS and it is a nice adaptation, but really the need for the stylus is zero.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I can say that at least for me the passme doesn't work at all.
<br/>
<br/>
First I had my nintendo ds with flash me and a xg2 turbo 512M and the dumps didn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
Then I read that with  the passme should work and I bought one to lynx that I just received and I have tried and It's the same , always white screens.
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried with all the diferent dumps the oldest and the newest and it's the same.
<br/>
And it's weird because in nds mode the neo power kit recognizes the name of the rom and the size properly and doesn't put any loader but nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried with the metroid demo and rayman originals but nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
It's seems it works for some people I don't know if I have to do something with the patches in the setup of the neo power kit but I have tried everything and didn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there is a difference that I cannot find.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wasn't there an xg2 turbo 512mb card that was pre the 2005 models?
<br/>
<br/>
That may be the problem as it appears you have to have the xg2 turbo 2005 512 or 1GB cards. That card writen with neo software and using a proper passme appear to work with all current releases. 
<br/>
<br/>
I am guessing the people that have earlier passmes with problems have either a different CPL chip or slightly different code programed in them.
<br/>
<br/>
Who knows maybe it is just easier for GST to do their rips working with passme and thats why they aren't supporting flashme with recent releases.....like they figured some easier way out after the first two releases.....or maybe they just like extra hardware sticking out of their DSs
<br/>
<br/>
At any rate hopefully some kind genius will create a patcher for GST games that let them boot from flashme.....if that is even possible.
<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if a fashme upgrade would work as a solution....If GST is doing a hardware check for the passme/noekey CPL or code in it to allow the rom to boot then I don't see how a firmware fix would do anything. If that is what is happening then all someone would have to do is remove the GST check code or force it to always return a yes to CPL check.  That wouldn't seem that hard for someone who know their way around a DS rom image........which currently isn't many people.
<br/>
<br/>
What happened to the good old days when groups tried to one up each other for glory.......If GST is just doing a dongle check then some other group should try to crack it and be the Hero of the Flashme Day....Breaks into metalica solo.....Mama they try to break me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And the Neoflash carts are just XG Flash 2 Turbo carts that have been repackaged.

I've got passme+xg flash 2 turbo 512M 2005.

And I cannot get working any of the roms.

Maybe there are different passmes, I've got one of the last ones of lynx.

And I'm not a newbie, I have tried everything and I've got a flashme (at the beginning everybody said that it was enough), wifime and everything working properly but the roms (I've got practically all of them even different versions the first two and the latest) don't.
<br/>
<br/>
And the software of the neo power kit works properly (but its really slow and it doesn't work very well with the saves of gba) and recognizes properly the roms and the flash cartridge.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
