    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know I am somewhat breaking the rules that show when you sign up for this site, but I am in need of help even after reading countless pages and threads of information.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I want to play homebrew games on my DS.  It is a version 1 model, so I should be able to use the original PassMe.
<br/>
<br/>
What I want to ask is exactly how this all works, and what I need to buy for it to work.  My basic understanding on materials is that I need a PassMe and a GBA Flash Cart.  To work it, it looks like you somehow flash downloaded games onto the cart, then just play it in the DS with PassMe inside.  
<br/>
<br/>
Of course I am really wanting to know exactly what I am getting into.  Price is a big factor, so I want something cheap yet effective.  What are some good flash carts that have a pretty good amount of memory?  How much does the average homebrew game take up in space?
<br/>
<br/>
If you could please help me on this, it would be much appreciated.  If it is too far off the rules, then I am sorry about that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would consider:
<br/>
passme1($15+shipping)
<br/>
GBAMP-CF($20-25+shipping)
<br/>
CF-Card($15 for 512MB+shipping)(if you don't already have one) 
<br/>
CF-Reader($5+shipping)(if you don't already have one)
<br/>
<br/>
assuming shipping is $5 for each, and you don't have a CF, or reader, thats $75 total, and 512MB is nice a big, and should be plenty of space for just about anything.
<br/>
<br/>
Only downside, there are a few (very few) homebrew not supported on GBAMP, and most GBA homebrew is not supported. If you want the most compatible, the next step up would be Supercard CF($40-45+shipping)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't forget to mention you have to patch the firmware on the GBA MP with Chishm's firmware hack.  Not a big deal, but should be noted.
<br/>
<br/>
As for as I know, that is still the CHEAPEST way to get homebrew on your DS with a very high compatibility rate as far as most current homebrew go.  And the GBA MP is still my choice for all of my DSs, including my DS-Lite with FlashMe.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just go with a GBAMP and a PassMe or NoPass. You have a version 1 DS (or so you said) so you could just go with a PassMe1 and flashme ur DS so you wont need it anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
If you need more info on other devices, I wrote a guide about all the different devices available. I tried to right what I know was true from what I've seen around the forums. It should help when making your choice, as Supercard might be device to pick.
