    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
as already announced, I've prepared a package for launching
<br/>
homebrew on the GBAMP SD, so the frustrating need for
<br/>
renaming all homebrew to _BOOT_MP_1122.nds can be ommitted.
<br/>
<br/>
Since i only packaged stuff together, 
<br/>
thanks go to tepples (his DLDI Wiki Entry to DSOrganize with
<br/>
its DLDI'able exec stub) and a user I don't remember (issued 
<br/>
an older entry in another forum that Moonshell should be able
<br/>
to launch on the GBAMP SD): Therefore I tried again, and yes:
<br/>
Moonshell 1.6 CAN launch some few .nds on the GBAMP SD, and
<br/>
says 'Unsupported adapter' on others.
<br/>
Thanks go to also to GrizzlyAdams: DSChannels was the key: it
<br/>
seems that it initializes the NDS in a way, so launched homebrew
<br/>
does work in most cases.
<br/>
<br/>
So here is the setup:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.filefront.com/13946984/gbampsd_launchsetup.zip" target="_blank">gbampsd_launchsetup.zip</a>
<br/>
I suggest to backup the SD card, clear it and extract this zip to
<br/>
your SD card as a starting point.
<br/>
<br/>
Now the usage instructions for it:
<br/>
I use Moonshell 1.6finalfinalbeta0 to boot up the GBAMP SD (so 
<br/>
renamed to _BOOT_MP_1122.nds). It is important to use exactly
<br/>
this version, otherwise launching DSOrganize will not work later.
<br/>
<br/>
From within Moonshell, I launch <span style="font-weight: bold">dschannels.nds</span>, which is 
<br/>
located in the root directory.
<br/>
<br/>
I've setup NitroHax 0.82, DSOrganize 2.61, Nitrotracker and 
<br/>
Moonshell 1.71 in its /Apps directory,
<br/>
and of course copied the mpsd.dldi into the /qlshell/drivers directory.
<br/>
In DSOrganize, I dldi'd the execstub as explained in this <a class="postlink" href="http://dldi.drunkencoders.com/index.php?title=DSOrganize" target="_blank">DLDI Wiki Entry</a> by Tepples.
<br/>
<br/>
From within DSChannels, you now can launch NitroHax, Nitrotracker,
<br/>
DSOrganize and Moonshell 1.71. (E.g. Moonshell 1.6 can launch NitroHax
<br/>
directly, but then the touchscreen does not work and the graphics
<br/>
are scambled).
<br/>
Since Moonshell 1.6 and 1.71 are very similar, the same moonshl folder
<br/>
can be used (as far as launching is concerned, I didn't test all
<br/>
features of moonshell).
<br/>
<br/>
DSOrganize can now be used to browse the filesystem and launch
<br/>
other homebrew programs. Or you add other homebrew to the
<br/>
Apps folder of DSChannels and add an image to the /qlshell/icons folder. 
<br/>
<br/>
When using NitroHax, there is one issue: after loading the cheats.xml and
<br/>
inserting the game module, the dpad and a/b buttons do not work first,
<br/>
but after touching the touchscreen. 
<br/>
Funnily, when using Moonshell 1.6finalfinalbeta2 as initial launcher, the
<br/>
dpad and buttons are working immediately after launching by DSChannels,
<br/>
but DSOrganize does not startup. So i decided for Moonshell 1.6finalfinalbeta0 as initial launcher.
<br/>
<br/>
So, the one 'always working' solution does not exist, but the situation
<br/>
is much better now for GBAMP SD users, I think :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how the situation is on other flash cards is, but I hope
<br/>
the launchers will evolve and learn from each other. (Thanks to Mighty Max and chishm and their exec stubs, 
<br/>
I think these source releases helped much). 
<br/>
Please nobody shake heads about launching launchers with launchers,
<br/>
but no other combination worked for me when directly booted by the GBAMP SD :-( 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: Since I updated the mpsd.dldi in the DLDI Wiki this morning,
<br/>
all homebrew providing a copy of the dldi drivers still have the previous,
<br/>
non working version of the mpsd.dldi. So consider this when
<br/>
experimenting with own setups and other constellations.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by ps2aich on Tue Jun 30, 2009 11:17 am; edited 5 times in total</span></div>

Since all is DLDI-based, it should be able to give it a try on all flashcards for which DLDI drivers exist. Simply patch all .nds in it, the DSOrganize exec stub, and add the missing dldi drivers to the /qlshell/drivers directory (I removed all except mpsd.dldi).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Edit: I just looked into the SCLite DLDI driver, it seems to be derived from the manufacturers io_scmicrosd_asm.s, but the SuperCard (SD Card) DLDI driver seems 
<br/>
not to be derived from the manufacturer drivers, perhaps someone could wrap the io_scsd_asm.s into a DLDI driver.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by ps2aich on Sun Apr 22, 2007 5:00 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Hy Lynx, could you give <a class="postlink" href="http://www.divshare.com/download/457969-3dc" target="_blank">this driver</a> a try?
<br/>
<br/>
I simply took the io_scsd_asm.s, added the missing export of the reset function and wrapped the dldi template around it.

Ok, this sound kind of similar to the GBAMP SD situation, so if Moonshell works with one of the DLDIs to boot up with the SC Rumble, it could work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Files that get white screens on supercard rumble aren't caused by DLDI problems. The problems were introduced with r20 of devkitpro or something like that. The majority of homebrew without DLDI boot because r20 was released before DLDI came mainstream.
