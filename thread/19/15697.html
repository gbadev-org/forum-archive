    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i have the max media player and i was wondering if there is a directory you can create to hold all of the stuff you are supposed to put in your root folder. I have a lot of things in my root folder right now and i hate that. I do not want to just mark things as hidden because i usually use dso to look at things and they still show up in there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What sort of things are you talking about?  Some homebrew programs have adopted the convention of also accepting data files in a "DATA" folder on the root of your card.  For instance, DSOrganize will look for the "DSOrganize" folder both on the root of the card and inside the "DATA" folder.  I believe a version of DS Doom does as well.  Look up your homebrew apps and see which ones of them have adopted this convention.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
