    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everybody, I just flashed my DS lite enamel navy with version 7 of flashme, but now I don't have the 4 levels of brightness anymore. :(   It just turns on and off now like a regular DS.  Anyone know why that is and how to fix it?
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a regular DS v7 flashme and a DS lite v7 flashme?
<br/>
<br/>
I flashed my DS lite because I thought all the bugs were worked out.  :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I guess there is indeed more than 1 version of FlashmeV7.
