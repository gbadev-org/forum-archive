    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would it be possible in the future to create WMB software that supports booting multiple demos on multiple DSes, or is there an inherent limitation in the protocol (which I am not intimately familiar with yet, I'm afraid) that prevents this?
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously a single DS can boot multiple other DSes - I just don't know the inherent limitations of a boot server that's delivering multiple programs via WMB.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, it is my understanding that the Windows WMB software can beacon for up to 16 demos at once, and that that limit is an inherent limit.  Is that a limit in the number of beacons a single host can send, or is that the total number of beacons a single DS can receive?  (Meaning, if a single host is sending 16 beacons, does that mean nobody else in range can WMB anything?)<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC
<br/>
I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.
<br/>
Thank you, everyone, I look forward to taking advantage of your work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As for multiple downloads, you could just run it in a loop. ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
