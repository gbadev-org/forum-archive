Thanks in advance.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, the DLDI driver would need to specifically support SDHC, I think.  I know that in the case of the CycloDS Evolution, theie DLDI driver has separate support for both types of microSD and the original version relied on a flag being set by their menu when you launched the homebrew in order to know which type of card you were using.  However, that wouldn't work with homebrews laucnhed through DSOrganize or some other loader, so Team Cyclops released an updated driver capable of doing the detection on its own.
<br/>
<br/>
THis is all second-hand knowledge since I don't have any SDHC cards to test with, but now that they prices on them are coming down, I've been thinking of getting one just for music.  Probably ought to wait for the prices to come down a bit further, though.

SDHC needs support both on HW and SW side.
<br/>
<br/>
so updated DLDI only can make it work on HW that has SDHC option.
<br/>
any SPI mode HW (like datel gnm) should be compatible, but other
<br/>
specially older are not at all SDHC compatible, like R4/M3 defenetly
<br/>
can not support SDHC (tested also)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
