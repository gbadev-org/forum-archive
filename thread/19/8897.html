    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I saw natrium's serial port, and it struck me: why not multiboot from it? If connected to a pc, this could provide a solution for linux users since WMB doesn't work yet on linux. If connected to a SD card that supports SPI mode, this could make a convienient storage system. FlashMe and NITROFW authors, consider adding this functionality.<br/>_________________<br/>If you would not be forgotten

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">still, pretty much everyone has a serial port, while not everyone has a wmb-compatible non-usb wifi card. serial port multiboot would be very nice when developing &amp; testing: you wouldn't need to swap cf cards or flashcarts back &amp; forth every time you made a new compile.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Case in point: One of my computers has a serial port, but both of its PCI slots are filled. In order to add a PCI Wi-Fi card, it would need a new motherboard, a new case, and (because they probably don't make motherboards for the computer's processor anymore) a new CPU and RAM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I would add that function to FWNITRO, if I had that device and I knew how to make it work, and the support library isn't too large to fit in the firmware. Later I might just do that! (But I'm not sure)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, you don't need the PassMe + serial port modification. Since the serial port = EEPROM interface, you could just etch a pcb that can be inserted into the DS that has traces for EEPROM /CE, D6, D7, (serial input/output), and CLK. This could be connected into a 3 volt parallel port. Or voltage converter + serial port. this could cost a few bucks max.

Edit: On second thought, I'm not sure is this would work. Not everyone here is a hardware guy.<br/>_________________<br/>If you would not be forgotten
