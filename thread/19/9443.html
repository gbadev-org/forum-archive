<br/>
<br/>
I have an old grey DS (v2 firmware) that's had FlashMe installed successfully for a while (I'm now on V7), SuperCard SD, but I don't have Passme or the like.
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to dump a few ROMs so installed FWNitro v1.6C and now I have a big problem.
<br/>
<br/>
If I try to run a homebrew NDS file from the SC the DS freezes with 2 white screens.  FWNitro installation won't run.  I can't even revert back to Flashme/original BIOS using flashme.nds or noflashme.nds.  I get the same 2 white screens.  Though commercial images run OK!!
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, every time I try to dump a DS card from the menu it halts at the message 'Progress 000.0% &amp; Initialising FAT'.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone got any ideas? (Or am I now locked into FWNitro v1.6C)?
<br/>
<br/>
TIA...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Also you might need SCCONV program to run some software from SuperCard<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
