    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there any reason/advantage to buy a CF M3 or Supercard over an SD M3 or Supercard (or vice versa)? I do not have any existing CF or SD cards/hardware/etc. I understand that the SD M3 is not yet available. Danny of m3adapter.com says that it will be released around November 20th.

Thanks for your help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">CF is potentially faster, and chishm's CF drivers are more mature. SD might in the future be compatible with GBA-slot Option Paks through passthrough devices that take both a DS card and an SD card (such as Magic Key 2).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The SD supercard is completely contained within the game pack slot... it doesn't jut out at all. Although, the CF supercard is also the best of the CF adapters for being compact... The only thing poking out is the compact flash card itself.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Even if the M3 sticks out as much as the GBAMP does, I think I'd rather have it that way since the card is contained entirely within the device.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's all well and good for playing games on the road. But when you're sitting at your computer in an edit-build-run cycle, it's convenient to be able to pak-swap the CF card without having to pak-swap the GBA card too. It's all a matter of what you'll use it for; some people have reasons to prefer the SuperCard, others the M3.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not really concerned about whatever the card is contained in the DS or not. But I want to use the SD version because I already have an SD card and don't want to spend extra cost on a CF card that I only use for DS.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm also wondering the real pros and cons of either SD or CF. The less the device sticks out the better, but performance trumps compactness in my mind.

Is there a nice gui or menu for either card? I like the idea of it being user friendly, so I can pass it off to friends.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
