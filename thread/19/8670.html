How cool is that.  Hopefully when i check fw its passkey 1.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you make little sense, to be honest
<br/>
<br/>
but if your <span style="font-weight: bold">asking</span> how to check the firmware then go to picto chat and eject your metriod from the back of the ds
<br/>
<br/>
if its not yellow or megenta then you can use a passkey 1
<br/>
superpass
<br/>
passme 
<br/>
etc... (basicly everything with out a 2, but 2 will work too)
<br/>
<br/>
other wise you need a passme2 or superpass2 
<br/>
and a flashcart with sram
<br/>
<br/>
anyway i think it will be fw 1
<br/>
(ds will freeze)
<br/>
but sounds like you got a good deal :P<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

I was just merely saying wow how lucky can a person be, to want a ds for homebrew, go into a random store, see an old silver complete with metroid demo and get a free game with it.  Plus it was new retail so It doesn't have any wear or tear on it. :D  btw it was v. 2.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
but looks like all you need to do(if you didn't already)
<br/>
is get a flashcart and eiter get a good wifi card that can multi-boot your ds over download play
<br/>
or buy that passthrough device :)
<br/>
<br/>
(i have both of those BUT still don't have the damn sram!)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

either way, good luck in semiconductors :D  I did CS/CE, so I didn't need to take it, tho I ended up taking a VLSI design course here that included most of what it would have covered.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

Hence why living in a small town sucks. Wal-mart is the cheapest of the two places that sell SD cards, and the only one with CFs. (And I had no credit card at that point.) &gt;_&lt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
