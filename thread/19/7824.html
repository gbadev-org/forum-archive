If you have a GBA flash cart what's the point?
<br/>
If you send it to darkfader, i bet he could make another one and a writer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just want to use it because it would just be really cool to run my code off of a real develepment cart! 
<br/>
<br/>
It's got a proto of zoo tycoon on it, so I'd like to copy that off before I write anything on (it seems like it's even buggier than the final.  I've never played the real one so I can't be sure.  At least if it isn't, I feel very sorry for those of you who bought this game!!  I am positive that it's different than the final.).  
<br/>
<br/>
I bought it from someone who's pretty well known for protos.
<br/>
<br/>
I did write darkfader asking him about it.  I don't want to try to push a project on someone when I can't really pay any money for it right now.  I also don't want to send it anywhere!
<br/>
<br/>
It's a cool little device.  The back cover comes off to reveal a plug for the save memory.  This way a developer can plug in different sizes of memory depending on their needs.  I don't have it in front of me, but I'm pretty sure mine has a 64k eeprom plugged in.  It's got a little switch to turn the save memory off if you don't want to use any.
<br/>
<br/>
I know I can just use a gba flash cart, but isn't having a real ds flash cart one  of the holy grails of ds homebrew?  It's just cooler that way...  ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I've been doing some nes development, but I'm still pretty new to ds development.  If I flashme my ds, can it boot directly to a gba flash cart and then still use the ds cartridge port? It seems to me that if you can write to a gba flash cart while it's in the ds, then a ds flash cart should work the same way except for the encryption...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well homebrew can use the NDS port as shown by the Neoflash MK2 menu, but to actually run stuff off of that development cartridge through flashme you'd probably need a special loader to execute the files, I reckon if DF thinks it's a good idea you should go ahead with it, it'd certainly be cool to have Flash cartridges going through the NDS port that acted as PassMe devices too, that would eliminate the need for FlashMe altogether.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It may be more trouble than it's worth.  Since I saw the picture of the ds development cart on this forum, I thought that perhaps someone had some idea of how to use it.  Maybe I'll sell it or keep it just as a proto.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

He probably doesn't want to say, because I am pretty sure there is no legal way for him to get it without being a officially licensed ds developer...either he stole it, or someone else stole it and gave/sold it to him, or an official developer violated his contract by giving/selling it to him.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There seems to be room (but I don't see the circuitry) for four flash chips.  To me that seems to mean that either it can be used with smaller types of memory chips or that it could potentially have 2gb on it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyway, if you don't want to hand it out, the only option is that someone (me for example) remotely can control it. sgstair's wifi library could be helpful :)
<br/>
The reset signal might not be register-controllable so that would be a little problem since it would require to power off/on the DS or card manually or with some additional wire. Check if you can find a good place to solder ;P (or in DS)

Here's the title screen.  There is a couple of letters and a date in the upper right corner.  I blurred it.  I know where I got the cartridge from.  I don't know the history before that.  I decided to blur it just to make it harder to trace.  Besides the text in the corner, does there seem to be any difference than the final?

The date is earlier this year (2005).  It does seem to be pretty far along.  Saving doesn't work.  There are lots of bugs that hold up gameplay, but I hear that's true in the final too.  I really want to go buy it so that I can compare!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Therefore, it's getting ebayed.  Just search for DS development cartridge and I'm sure you'll find it (unless it gets pulled!).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess one last question before I pass on the tourch.  I have opened up the cartridge completely.  I didn't mention this last week because I didn't want to raise the ebay price over simple speculation.  Look at the extra chip...  
<br/>
<br/>
Do you think it is possible that the extra chip handles all the encryption while the flash memory stays totally unencrypted?  Is there simple way to test this?  
<br/>
<br/>
I have given some of the picture unwatermarked to a couple of specific people that I don't think will pass them out.  I can pass out high rez unwatermarked pictures, but I feel I should talk to the new owner first.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A Nintendo NTR-FCC-01, and an ordinary flash ROM. It does seem like that chip might do all the encryption.
<br/>
<br/>
As for translation... it's blurry, can't really make it out, but the first text in the box says "SWITCH ROM"... the second one looks like "pakuun" or "pataan"; that p could be a b and the n could be 'so'. Third one looks the same, but again, I can't quite make it out at that size. It's Katakana, though, which is a phonetic alphabet used for foreign words, so whatever it says would sound like the English word it means (as with "furasshinikaado" == "flashing card").</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Odd, I never bought (or attempted to bid at an auction) when I didnt have the cash to pay for item immediately. 
<br/>
<br/>
So, to sum it all up, is it currently for sale, or not? (For the record, I'm really not interested in buying it)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">tepples, I still don't know much about the ds dev.  I was working with darkfader a little bit because he had this tool that worked over the net, but it never really worked for us.  I wanted to dump the cartridge to see exactly what is on the flash but:  I'm a ds beginner still, I only have a supercard cf which there is no dumping tool yet, and nobody in dev seems to really know anything about these cards.  
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if it would be helpful to the community or not, but I do hope that I can find someone interested in buying it that is a nesdev hardware person who can at least add to the dev knowledge.  I'm not looking to get rich off this if I find the right person.

Ok, or if anyone has any nes dev stuff they want to trade for it, I'd be all about that too!  Got a collection of blank nintendo official dev game circuit boards that you don't know what to do with?  Come talk to me...  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not certain, but it can encrypt stuff.  I mean, I'm not sure what you'd have to do to make a 'proper' secure area as I have no idea what is in that area exactly, so it could still be kinda hard to figure out.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
