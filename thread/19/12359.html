    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I was flashing my NDSL, when I got to around 76% and it turned off, I had my power plug in as well, so Im guessing that it's not fully bricked, but when I tried to use the recovery mode, it would work. All that appears on my screens now are two black screens. So I'm wondering if it is bricked and can't be recovered except without fuzing the blown fuzes, or if its bricked, and I can recover it w/o having to hard mod it and use a soft mod.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Except he says he no longer has a warranty anyway, so that's kind of a moot point. :-p<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nintendo honored the warranty for my silver DS with FlashMe stealth. In the United States, we have the Magnuson-Moss act, a statute that prohibits companies from conditioning a warranty on the use of other products specified by trademark or service mark. Nintendo would have to prove that the unlicensed hardware actually broke the DS first.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Can Nintendo prove that he broke his DS by running unlicensed software?  Or, if Nintendo cannot prove that this was the case, how will Nintendo react to finding out that the DS produces white screens?  Especially with the DS having been around for over 2 years and not a single case of the DS simply producing white screens without any firmware tampering?  Can Nintendo say that he used unlicensed software simply by eliminating any other possible problems?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
