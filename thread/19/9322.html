    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got my passme today, and it works fine, I can boot moonshell, and from there i can load scummvm, but i cant get any other programs to run, they seem to be all .ds.gba files, i realy want to load frodo and other peoples homebrews.
<br/>
<br/>
they all run (a bit) in emulators, so im sure the programs actually work.
<br/>
Do i need to do anything to the files to get them to load?
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can't run .ds.gba files from the GBAMP, because they have an additional header that make them compatible with Flash Carts and Supercard. For the GBAMP, you need .nds files that should be provided with basically every homebrew program.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
