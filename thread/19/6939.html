    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it possible to hack RSA and build it in the FlashMe utility so you can stream it on the DS and patch the firmware? It'd be a good solution for homebrew, since you wouldn't need the FlashCart which is hard to get in smaller countries (like Slovenia, for example)? 
<br/>
<br/>
After FlashMe, you could stream homebrew directly into your DS and no FlashCart would be needed (it isn't portable, but a good start anyway).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hell, if you cracked the RSA to allow you to upgrade the firmware without a flash cart, we wouldn't need FlashMe to allow downloadable hombrew (which removes the RSA check).

In other words.. Unless someone is working on breaking the 1024(or 1048, whichever it is)bit key..  It's not going to happen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Once the Wi-Fi is cracked, the 4 MB limit is no limit, as you could put a CIFS client in your program, and it could stream files from the PC the way current games do from a GBA Movie Player.

But then the problem of booting without a flash cart remains.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
