    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you like piracy, or you want the current Heretic or Doom ports, then the GBAMP isn't the way to go. Otherwise, homebrew is able to support the GBAMP and (if needed) its CF reading/writing now, so I'd say it's the best solution. 
<br/>
<br/>
I personally bought one from dspassme.com just recently, it be in the mail.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">Reverting to old nickname...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the m3 is by far the best homebrew device for the ds due to its cf reading, highest compatability and its potential 32 meg expansion capability.  It can also play offical demos too which are awesome ( had a lot of fun with electroplankton!).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And now it gets confusing :)
<br/>
I purchased the GBAMP with hacked firmware from dspassme.com for now. Eventually, once GBAMP is outdated by incompatible and substantially better capabilities elsewhere, I plan to get an M3 or something similar and less expensive that pops up.
<br/>
<br/>
I did this because the GBAMP is a very low-priced device, so I can get away with using it temporarily, whereas the M3, which costs around 2.5 times the cost of the GBAMP, would be a bit more painful to replace if some wonderful new thing appeared.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I havn't seen any recent homebrew that needs to use that extra memory that the M3 affords though, since Chism's CF FAT drivers now exists. I suppose the CF is slower, but it's likely not a huge issue unless you're making something that really needs to quickly stream files off of the medium. At least that's how I understand it.
<br/>
<br/>
Mostly, I just like the price of the GBAMP :)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">Reverting to old nickname...

Now Supercard reads CF&amp;SD, but no driver is made yet.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm getting to the point where I need to test on real HW, so yesterday, I too finally broke down and ordered the GBAMP + SuperPass from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dspassme.com" target="_blank">www.dspassme.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I spent a lot of time checking out the various options, and although price wasn't really that much of an issue for me, I decided to go for the cheap option because with the fine work of some of the people here, GBAMP now supports NDS multiboot and flash read/write.  FlashMe is going to save me a lot of headache as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, since I'll be able to dynamically load levels, save gamestates, and have multiple homebrew apps on a single CF, I think I'll be set for a while.
<br/>
<br/>
How cool is THAT, when you consider that for $40 + shipping, and some free downloads, one can develop for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of free downloads, the resources available here online are simply amazing.  Jeez, DevKitPRO alone is astonishing... what a cool thing have in existence.  Add to that mix everyone who develops all these drivers, ultilites, docs, and samples... 
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to gush like a noob.  I've been in these forums for a while, and I've been in the gamedev biz for *cough* over two decades, but it still amazes me when I look at what this particular community has done, simply for the love of doing it.

You also need a CF writer, a CF card, a DS, and an official game. And if your store doesn't have any DS systems left with old manufacture dates, you'll also need a NOR card in order to get the thing started with the new PassMe, as the GBA Movie Player doesn't have any SRAM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want something small (thus, more useable), I would recomment the Supercard CF. The CF card slides into the end of the Supercard that sticks out of the system (which means that to write to the card you don't need to remove the entire cart), and the only thing sticking out is the CF card... it looks a bit precarious like that, but it is very unlikely that you'll manage to bash the bottom of your DS against something in such a way that would break a Compact Flash card... without breaking your wrists as well, anyway...
<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the legal stuff on the back of the CF card, it only pokes out to around where the top of the FC CE text is.
<br/>
<br/>
Supercard SD is even smaller, but it lacks that advantage of removing the card without removing the cart, and (in my opinion) SD cards are more limited than CF cards.
<br/>
<br/>
Supercard is also nearly half the price of M3...
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I can't give you any official words  :)
<br/>
<br/>
Does the Supercard really have 32 MB of RAM? I have never seen the thing's RAM directly mentioned anywhere...<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Update:  Last night, I received my GBAMP-V2 + Super PassKey in the mail.  Ordered from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dspassme.com" target="_blank">www.dspassme.com</a>, btw.
<br/>
<br/>
It worked exactly as advertised, right out of the box.  I had my homebrew app running on the DS within minutes.  It's cool when something just works.  Especially for only $40 plus shipping.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On my to-do list:
<br/>
<br/>
flash my DS with FlashMe so I don't have to use the passkey
<br/>
copy the multi-boot rom to my flashcards
<br/>
Get CF FAT read-write going from my application (currently using GBFS)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I picked up some 128MB Compact Flash cards at Office Max for less than $10 each.  There are some good deals around if you're willing to look.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
