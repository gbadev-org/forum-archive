    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This has probably been covered before, so I apologize in advance, but I did a search of the forums and found nothing that worked for me.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm trying to load FlashME onto my DS. I tried the newest FlashME files, to no avail. I renamed the .nds file to .nds.gba; no luck. I used ndsloader.bin to modify the original .nds. I'm currently set up with a PassME, Flash2Advance Ultra 1G card and silver North American DS from within a month of its release last year.
<br/>
Here's the problem: When I go to load the FlashME file from my flash cart, using my PassME, I get white screens. Just plain white, nothing else. I've written, erased and re-written the FlashMe file to my flash cart, so I don't think it's an improper write. How can I FlashME my DS? I know that other homebrew for the DS works, as I've been messing around with homebrew for months, and it usually works with the .ds.gba.
<br/>
<br/>
Please, pretty please, help me out. I'd really appreciate it.
<br/>
To summarize the above for those who don't feel like reading two paragraphs:
<br/>
Flash2Advance Ultra 1G card + PassME
<br/>
Homebrew usually works with .ds.gba
<br/>
FlashME doesn't work, get white screens
<br/>
Tried writing and re-writing files, using ndsloader.bin to convert FlashME files to .ds.gba etc., still no luck
<br/>
Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Got an older version of FlashME to work, but I obviously need to update because of the Wifi stuff coming out soon, right? Also, I want the warning screen back, so can I just flash the new stealth mode over top? Or would I get the white screens again? I suppose it doesn't hurt to try...
<br/>
<br/>
Edit2: Put the older version on, and it worked fine, yay! But I still want to put the new stealth mode on, rather than the old, non-stealth mode. I tried putting it on, but got the white screens again. *sob* Any advice? Thanks in advance...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've tried it with and without the .gba extension, and I have no means to try WiFiMe. Thanks for the ideas anyway, though, I really do appreciate it! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, renaming it to ds.gba won't do anything...and you said you tried prepending the loader (which would make it a ds.gba)...have you tried anything like Darkain's Multi-NDS Loader?  FlashMe might work from that, haven't tried it...it's another way to load homebrew that you could try though. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I appreciate the idea, but I got it working on my own :D I had to use my GBAMP with hacked firmware to load the flashme_stealth.nds file. That implies a problem with my flash cart, which is odd, because it works fine with everything else :/ Oh well, it works, so I'm happy!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
