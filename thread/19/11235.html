    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got a g6 lite, a passkey2, and a black nds lite that I'm trying to flash with flashme, but I can't get the passkey2 to work. I previously used it with a m3 mini-sd on a different ds lite fine, so the hardware should be cool. Here's what I've done, and what I'm trying.
<br/>
<br/>
What I did (that seemed to work)
<br/>
<br/>
- Put the K2_HW04.gba on the g6
<br/>
- Ran it with the program adapter and passkey2 to update it
<br/>
<br/>
What I'm trying now
<br/>
<br/>
- Put the K2_RAM04.gba on the g6
<br/>
- When try to run this file, I get "CRC Error !" every time
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried it several times from both the root of the device, and using the software... I've even re-downloaded the the passkey2 zip file m3adapter.com. 
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?
<br/>
<br/>
I just need it to work once so I can run flashme! :) Where does the leading card info get stored? because, I had previously set it up for the game I'm using, but it doesn't work either... I get a white screen after the health warning.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I found the problem. The g6 lite needs either a different firmware/software for the passkey2 in order for it to work with it. The correct version can be found here: <a href="http://www.handheldsources.com/Download.html." target="_blank">http://www.handheldsources.com/Download.html.</a> I upgraded the software with that one, and it worked fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
