    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a Gigabyte GN-WPKG wireless PCI card (it's on the <a class="postlink" href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">ralink list</a>)
<br/>
<br/>
I installed the 1.0.0.8 driver successfully, and I am able to run wmb.exe using one of the oficial demos.  I load up download play on my DS, and it sees the demo.  However, I can't download the demo.  I immediately get a "Communication error" on the DS.  WMB.exe is stuck at "Sending multiboot beacons &amp; waiting for authentication".
<br/>
<br/>
Am I missing something?  I understand that I don't have to flash my firmware in order to run official demos.  I run a wireless network in my house on channel 11.  As long as I'm not on the same channel, that shouldn't be a problem, right?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It usually works after restarting the app. Or have you more than one WMB app running at the same time? When I did that I got that problem too.<br/>_________________<br/>The future of gaming is mobile Handheld Gaming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One thing to try is rebooting...I've had problems coming out of hibernation on my laptop then trying to WMB something.  It seems the drivers (or at least my card) weren't waking up correctly.  Dunno if this has anything to do with your situation, but couldn't hurt. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hm, I've tried rebooting.. I'm not running two instances of WMB at the same time either.

I guess it just doesn't work on my machine :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">try different channels?
<br/>
<br/>
put your DS real close to the wireless card? (which you rememberd to attach the antenna tightly, right?)
<br/>
<br/>
good luck</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
