    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm torn between which should be my next Flashcart..... i was thinking of a SuperCard CF but the only place I could find one was by a certain store and they were like $56 and I only want to spend about $40. I would have liked to buy it off of another well known store but he doesn't carry them anymore. SO I'm now torn between SC SD/miniSD, Rumble or not, and an R4 because I heard they were really great. But I want something that supports GBFS and PAFS which niether of my current flashcarts support (GBAMPv2 and MMD). And some extra RAM. But if the Rumble versions are cheaper than the non-rumble at he expense of no RAM I guess that's ok as I probably won't use the RAM that often...Which is the best choice?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by tondopie on Sun Apr 29, 2007 5:27 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Stay away from the Rumble series, seriously.  The SC Rumble has low homebrew compatibility for one thing, and the lack of RAM means no GBFS or PAFS compatibility.  As long as you're getting a slot-2 device, do yourself a favor and get one that has the functionality a slot-1 device can't provide.  The way I see it, the SC Rumble and M3 Pro have about the same functionality as a slot-1 device (except for a few special cases like the ability to use REIN), so by that point you might as well get the slot-1 device instead.
<br/>
<br/>
My personal preference is the slot-2 Supercard miniSD with RAM, which I got for $50.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's damn near non-existant!  Sure, people are saying that if you do this, or do that, you can get it to run homebrew..  Which is OK if you already were suckered into buying one.  But if you are making a choice up front, stay away from this device.  Sure, the rumble sounds "handy" for the future, but NOTHING uses it.  Even the SuperCard site only has ONE patch to make it work with a NON-HOMEBREW rom.  It doesn't even work to replace original equipment (meaning, the official Nintendo Rumble pak).  The device is useless and shouldn't have even been made.
<br/>
<br/>
Like dantheman said, if your going Slot-2, it might as well be able to play GBA Homebrew as well or have built in RAM that can be used by DSLinux or other homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Theres no need to hint at backups, just don't discuss them at all. Just say you would like a CF card version. But if I miss interpreted your allusions then I apologize. 
<br/>
If you want to know which to get between Supercard: miniSD and Supercard: CF then it all depends on what you feel is more important. A CF will stick out, but generally the card reads a lot faster. A miniSD fits flush, and I really can't think of any programs that suffer too much from the card speed, but then again I've never actually had anything to compare it to.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

ok edit that stuff out if you feel it nessisary... I know CF has better compatability but its a ton to expensive for me.... does miniSD have better support? and the sticking out think is kind of... blah.... it could snap off.... so its down to SC miniSD and R4... ehcih is the best interms of Developing and hb compatibility... I really don't like SLot-1s.... I like my SLot-2s but I heard the R4 is reall really good... but I also want GBFS/PAFS support.... argh.... this is so hard....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I'd suggest the Supercard miniSD, which has fairly good homebrew compatibility.  Really, only very old FAT-enabled homebrew programs won't work correctly on it.  If you want to develop on it, you can use DSFTP to transfer files over, and you can also use this modified Wifiloader that loads the entire program into RAM before executing it.  The fact that it sits flush is really nice for me.  The only issue is that you will most likely have to put the miniSD card in an adapter before putting it in your card reader, which is one more step you have to take when loading programs onto it.  This gets somewhat annoying if you're doing a lot of back-and-forth cart swapping, but you'd have to do that with microSD anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
