    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to write a cleaned-up rewrite of parts of libnifi in D, and am running into problems getting my flashed DS Lite to acknowledge the connection (fwiw, libnifi doesn't work either).
<br/>
<br/>
For this reason, I'd appreciate it if somebody could post a packet dump of a successful file transfer of a homebrew, between WMB and a flashed DS Lite, so that I could compare packets to find the problem. (I can't run WMB here on Linux, obviously)
<br/>
<br/>
Any help is appreciated.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I'm using the rt73usb driver, with the hack changes applied. (to do that, get a cvs of rt2570 from the same date the hacked driver is from and do a diff to see the changes, then apply them to whatever driver you want).
<br/>
<br/>
so basically, the only thing it doesn't do is default to short preamble, and that's handled over iwpriv anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Huh. Short update: I switched to the modified aircrack driver and so far, it appears to work better. If you're having issues, try that one.
