    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Guys,
<br/>
<br/>
I really need your help here. Around 3 weeks ago I had my DS Lite flashed by my friend. Unfortunately, we bricked it. We searched the net how to fix it. Luckily we got it back alive after we openned the case, swap the BIOS with the unbricked DS and flashed it.
<br/>
<br/>
at home, after I had my DS Lite flashed using FlashMe, I tried inserting GBAMP CF into the GBA slot. After I turned it on, it is displaying "this product is not licensed by Nintendo bla bla bla". After pressing start and waiting for so long, the screen was stuck so I turned if off.
<br/>
<br/>
After that I couldn't turn it on again. No green light or whatsoever. When I charged it, the yellow led light up for half second. I sent it back to Nintento in Melbourne for repair. After 5-6 days, they sent it back fully repaired without charging me a cent.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I already got my DS Lite back repaired saying that they have to replace 2 fuses. I bought M3 Lite card from the internet. I was so excited when I tried inserting my M3 Lite into the GBA slot again, the same message appeared and stuck in there for so long.
<br/>
<br/>
Guess what? After I turned it off and on again, it wouldn't. Same thing happenned. Does any of you guys know what happened? I sent it back to Melbourne for repair and hopefully they still repair it without charging me since I already void the warranty.
<br/>
<br/>
did something wrong when I flashed it? If I un-flashed my DS would it back to normal? I don't want after I got my DS Lite back then I would blew it again.
<br/>
<br/>
Really need your help guys.....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I doubt flashing has anything to do with the fuses blowing.  Maybe you made a short in the GBA slot when you put it back together.  Ask Nintendo if they tested it with GBA games and if you send it back again, make sure they test the GBA slot.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I did mentioned in my letter to nintendo that I inserted GBA cartridge. Hopefully they will check it. 
<br/>
<br/>
in other forum, they mentioned that bent CF pins in GBAMP can cause DS fuse to blow. I am not sure whether I put the CF Card upside down or not, I need to check it later when I got home. 
<br/>
<br/>
I did inserted my M3 lite first with no micro SD and then the GBAMP CF where it screwed up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A CF card won't quite fit into the GBAMP upside-down; it'll go most of the way in but then stop. If you tried to force it that way you'd probably break many pins though. It should be inserted such that when looking at the touch screen you can just see part of the back of the CF card (not the side with the logo and such; usually they have specs or a writeable label) sticking out.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have this same problem. I put a GBAMP with 1GB CF card into two DSs (one Phat with FlashMe, one Lite without) and it worked perfectly. I swapped CF cards to a 512MB one from USModular, and it caused BOTH DSs to do the same thing (won't turn on, no matter what).
<br/>
Is there any way to fix this myself without much electronics know-how, or will I just have to send them in? Also, will they be able to tell that the Phat is FlashMed? (I'm almost certain I used the Stealth one)
<br/>
<br/>
In case the above was confusing;
<br/>
<br/>
DS Phat + Flashme + 1GB card = works
<br/>
DS Lite WITHOUT Flashme + 1GB card = works
<br/>
DS Phat + Flashme + 512MB card = total blow-out (no turning on at all)
<br/>
DS Lite WITHOUT Flashme + 512MB card = ditto
<br/>
<br/>
Bascially, I've ruined two DSs, one of which is my sister's. Any info that I can use to fix this would be greatly appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They can tell easily if they can power it on, but I've never heard any reports of them caring. Since it won't even do that they'll probably just toss it in the scrap heap and send you a new one.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
