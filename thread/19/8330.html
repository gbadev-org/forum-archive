I don't think so. The firmware is not some kind of OS in a way, that games "ask" the firmware "hey, which button is pressed?". it is just a program, that can load other programs (wmb, gba slot, ds slot) but after that, the game has to do everything. i don't know, if there's i bios function to read the buttons (which games could use and we could modify), but i think, the games read the buttons directly from hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

presumably, if anyone figured out a way to use the arm9 in GBA mode.. things would get a lot more complicated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A PIC sitting on X,Y,L,R,A,B and say select+start would be able to map the buttons *similar* to what you want, but it's not a quick hack (and I swear, if I see another person asking for a firmware option to remap buttons, I'll trout them to within an inch of their life).
<br/>
<br/>
PIC reads X,Y,Select,Start.  Select+Start switches modes (XY act normally, XY-&gt;LR, XY-&gt;AB), with the PIC wired up (preferably through a resistor to avoid contention) to the pads you want to control (LR and AB in this case).
<br/>
<br/>
You can't 'swap' buttons (AB &lt;-&gt; XY) without actually cutting traces (vastly increases the risk of installation failure) and extra soldering, but you can make multiple buttons act as one (i.e. X and A trigger A).
<br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking about making something like this just for the hell of it, but I personally don't really need it, so it's on the backburner.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat
