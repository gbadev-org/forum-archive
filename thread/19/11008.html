    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i just got my supercard lite and superkey and i've tried some of the homebrew apps/games and the only ones i've got to work are the newer ones with .sc.nds file extentions, like Zelda and Acromage. (Zelda is awesome by the way) is there a way i can get the older ones to work though? alot of the programs just give me the dual white screens of death. lol do i need a loader or what? help please.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DS programs for SuperCard need a loader. Anything <span style="font-weight: bold">ds.gba</span> can just be renamed to <span style="font-weight: bold">sc.nds</span>, and a lot of newer .nds files work as in because the newer startup code includes a basic loader. For the older ones built with older versions of devkitARM, try running them through dsbuild:

<br/>
<br/>
just drop the homebrew file on the .exe and it will automagically produce a supercard compatable .sc.nds</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i dont mean to anger/upset anybody but shouldnt this be in the flash equipment forum? since this is a developers forum and the question has to do with flash equipment. i guess im just a bit curious as to whythere's so many dev-unrelated posts in this forum :)
