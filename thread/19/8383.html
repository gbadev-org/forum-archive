<br/>
<br/>
Second question, I had thought i was starting to understadn things round here that CF&gt;SD in terms of compatabiltiy, but then I just read that supercard SD is just as good as supercard CF for compatability...
<br/>
<br/>
Help me.. please... before i go crazy!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

if you mean warez compatability - please go away.
<br/>
else if you mean homebrew compatibility, so CF should have more compatability for newer filesystem applications.

By warez what do you mean? i know this means pirated sotware, but i thought it wasnt even possible to pirate DS games?

Anyway,

Supercard CF and Supercard SD have about the same FAT filesystem support in homebrew. The GBAMP CF seems to have the best support for this, followed by the M3 CF. However, you can do all of the things you mentioned with <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> of these devices, with some limitations on GBAMP. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'd suggest getting the Supercard CF.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Also when mntorankusu said supercard CF and SD have about the same file system support in homebrew, im assuming that the CF has slightly greater because you recomended it overall. But are you 100% sure that they can both do all of the things i wanted? I thought that the guy making linux said he couldnt use SD cards or something liek that.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'm just being stubourn because i really dont like the idea of a CF card sticking out of my DS...

<br/>
This just further proves my point. EEPROM save games are not well supported by homebrew on GBA (mainly because flash carts use SRAM), nor on NDS. RAIN is the only NDS application to support the EEPROM on DS Cards, AFAIK. The DS firmware and touch screen use SPI, but these are hidden behind libnds functions or installer programs. Multiplayer comms support in GBA homebrew is very rare, possibly due to the difficulty in getting syncronous gameplay on more than one GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
This is in contrast to the GBA display modes, which are all controlled by memory mapped registers. Keypad input is a simple read of a register. There are countless other examples, but my point is, it is easier to simply peek and poke memory locations than it is to bit bang data over a serial line. 
<br/>
<br/>
Then there is the problem of CRCs for the normal MMC mode of SD &amp; MMC cards. These have to be calculated on every command and sent along with the data to the card.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, if you want to see for yourself, have a look at the io_*.c files in gba_nds_fat. The CF drivers are all similar and quite easy to follow, with pokes to memory then waits on a memory value to change. Compare this with the (not working) SC SD code, which has many function calls to do a simple task. Then compare this to the NMMC code (Neoflash MK2 / MK3), which takes advantage of the DS's SPI hardware. There are still confusing parts, such as the clock sends. The M3 SD (not included) is different again, with hardware level serial control mapped to registers in GBA ROM address space.  These are 3 different SD devices with 3 completely different interfaces, compared to the 3 CF devices where the only difference is the addresses of the mapped registers and the startup unlock sequence.
<br/>
<br/>
Wow, long post. Summary: CF devices use simple memory mapped registers and share a common interface method. The 3 SD devices I've looked at use completely different interface methods, with one requiring bit banging, one using hardware level control and one taking advantage of the DS's own SPI interface.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

Well since you're not lazy, and you have the hardware, you can write a driver for the supercard SD. It has to be C, and make sure it works for all SD cards. ;p<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

Well actually, there are two versions of that driver in the various versions of Moonshell 0.999. The pure C one is what I converted from Romman's ASM driver.
