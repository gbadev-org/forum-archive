Homebrew doesn't really need an auto save manager, but Game Cards do. That's why I wrote RAC. But unfortunately, the popularity of SLOT-1 cards makes it harder to write auto save managers for Game Cards. But still, DSOrganize could use a feature that synchronizes its saves with data on the PC, and if a flash card manufacturer wants to provide such a feature, cool.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Come on Tepples..  You know that is exactly what they are talking about.. Slowdowns playing VIDEO on your GnM.. BUY THIS DEVICE!!  It doesn't have slowndowns for VIDEO like the GnM!  Why are you trying to not make it warez related?
<br/>
<br/>
Let's see if we can take every warez specific term and make it homebrew friendly.. Why don't you release a homebrew game with a bunch of 00's at the beginning or end.. Then, there would be a need for a trimmer..
<br/>
<br/>
Next, you could release a homebrew game that requires 512 EEPROM and then another that needs 2048 EEPROM and then you would need the auto save manager.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So then, it will be a 100% homebrew friendly device.. without even offering warez support.. Oh wait.. they'd still have to change the CLEAN ROMS note.. 
<br/>
<br/>
Oh well.. we can only try.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Datel Games N Music seems to be doing well enough to make it into major retail chains and they haven't went out of business yet..
<br/>
<br/>
And so far.. they are only promises..  Who knows, once some homebrewers get ahold of it, it could be the next awesome homebrew device.. or.. it could end up just another warez only card.
<br/>
<br/>
What I can't grasp is a gbadev.org forum moderator (yes tepples, I'm talking about you) trying to justify "features" that are warez specific.  Trying to somehow minipulate them into something homebrewers would care about.  I know a lot of devers are warezers..  And that's up to them.. I'm just really getting the feeling that gbadev.org needs remove the sheeps clothing and say what the site is really about.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Uhh.. I don't think so, as I don't know what site you are refereing to, nor would I guess I have an account there.
<br/>
<br/>
As for why pick a GnM over this?  How about total cost of investment? You can find the GnM shipped to your door for around $22 and your done.  Everything you need is included in the package.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, you are saying this device is going to be $50, plus you still need to buy a MicroSD card, and potentially a MicroSD reader/writer if you don't already have one, or if it comes with one.
<br/>
<br/>
So, GnM vs this, in my opinion, GnM wins hands down just based on price and for the most part is homebrew friendly.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, you have to ask why to purchase this over the R4 or M3 Simply.  Both are sold cheaper and have very good homebrew compatiblity.  Keep in mind.. we are only talking about homebrew.  I don't know if these devices have slowdowns for illegally downloaded warez romz or how they handle save states for those illegally downloaded warez romz either..   Nor do I care. 
<br/>
<br/>
So, for homebrew, what is the benefit of having 1GB of onboard FLASH memory?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the idea of open sourcing the firmware sounds great..  for programmers.. but, what effect does that have on the overally general population that is going to purchase this device?  Does the provider release the source to v0.1 and expect the homebrew community to fix the bugs and add the features?  Leaving them out of the support loop because you are running "this guys" firmware instead of the provided firmware we released, type of thing?  Now that I think of it, that sounds like an awesome idea for the seller.  Even if they turn around and release v0.2 unders some anonymous homebrew dever name, they would no longer have to support their own product.  We've seen NeoFlash do this with their devices.  Sell it with crappy firmware and never release updates.
<br/>
<br/>
So your only hope would be that a homebrew dever has enough interest in the device to want to keep it alive for their own purpose.. and hopefully releases updates as they go along.  Just as we saw in other OSS threads, just releasing the source of a project doesn't keep it alive.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
If the set up a SVN/CVS for the firmware as some people in that thread already suggested, it could solve all the "wild anarchy" that so many people seem to be scared of with open source stuff.  Hopefully, if they do set it up that way, their own developers (if there are any) will be participating in the same SVN.  Acekard could just take regular snapshots of the stable build to have for distribution on their site as the official firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
If this is well done (and so far there's absolutely no reason to assume that it won't be), it could turn out to be really amazing.

The card is working very fine and it is very easy. All NDS files I have tested working without problems including sensible things like Wolf3d, so I'm sure the DLDI are working correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
The menu is very fast and simple to use. You can copy, cut, delete and paste files. Also between Flash memory (internal mem) and micro SD (external mem). You can start slot 2 (testet with supercard lite).
<br/>
<br/>
Upper Screen contains a calendar and a watch.

I'm very happy with this card. I'm sure it is the best availlable one in this moment!

all homebrew tested worked perfectly EXCEPT for dslinux, which kind of annoyed me...

it's strange because when i have my ezflash in slot two, and i boot dslinux from AK menu, the top screen just contunes to scroll with text very fast ( i think it's showing hex values)

when i take my ezflash out and boot it, the text scrolls down for a moment then stops on some error. my brother has my DS right now so i'll have to check again to see exactly what the error is.

It definitely sounds like it's crashing on boot.  It's a shame because it would of been nice to have an open source card to go with an open source OS.

DSLinux kernel panics on boot.  I agree the hardware looks nice (feels of quality), but we still have to wait and see if you get your money's worth based on what the homebrew community can make of the product.  Out of the box, I don't see ANY benefit over other cheaper hardware on the market.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is exactly what I wanted with my DS-X, except that whenever you want to turn the NDS on you have to take out the USB cable which gets long. Do you have to do it with the Acekard?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm.. do you have a MicroSD card inserted?  I'm running a DS Phat with just the acekard RPG (no MicroSD) in slot-1.  I attached the USB cable and inserted the card into my DS.  I then plugged the USB cable into the back of my laptop.  It found the device and a few minutes later said it was available.  I then browsed to it to make sure I could read it fine.
<br/>
<br/>
I then turned on my DS and it boot to the previous folder (svsip) with a single .nds file in it. At the same time, I tried browsing the folder and was able to.  I created a .txt file and was able to save it.  But, at some time, the DS locked up.  I then turned the DS off and back on, and it was no longer able to load back to a menu. 
<br/>
<br/>
I removed the acekard from the DS and connected it back to the laptop.  I tried doing a scandisk on it, and it hung half way through.  It appears the file system is corrupt, but it doesn't seem to want to repair it.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I reformatted it, and copied the system files back onto it.  And it began to work as usual.
<br/>
<br/>
So, it looks like the hardware can handle it.. in theory.  Every time I browsed the device while the DS was on, it corrupted the file system.. But, that doesn't mean the USB port can't be used for communication. I just don't think a computer and the DS can access the file system at the same time.. At least, not with the current firmware.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I use this card with microSD. ACEkard makes auto DLDI patching. If you start a NDS homebrew on SD it is patched automatically with SD DLDI and Homebrew see's directory from SD. If NDS homebrew is startet from Flashmem it is automatically patched with Flash DLDI and homebrew see directory of flashmem.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">USB Host ports provide power to the device plugged in.  The standard requires 5V.  The DS is only 3.3 volts.  So, to meet the USB standards for a host, you need an additional battery that is capable of providing 5V to the device.  If his calculator runs on 5+ V then he can use the internal battery.  The additional current drain on the battery depends on the devices demands.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Of course I have, and I also understand how they work.  But, energy is not gained nor destroyed, only transformed.  P=IE no matter how you fiddle with the numbers.  USB hosts can provide 500mA at 5V which = 2.5 Watts.  So, the DS would have to be able to provide 760mA at 3.3V to provide 500mA at 5V.  And that doesn't take into account any additional draw the circuit may create.
<br/>
<br/>
So, next issue is the built in fuse and it's rating.  Remember, it needs to be enough to supply 760mA to the USB host port as well as run the DS itself.  You'll find this very handy page:
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://tim.cexx.org/?p=345" target="_blank">DS Power Consumption</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Which states that worste case, the DS consumes around 300mA.  Not including memory expansion paks or the like.  So the internal fuse will have to be rated above 1A continuous draw.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone willing to risk their F2 to see if the DS can in fact provide 1A continous draw?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
