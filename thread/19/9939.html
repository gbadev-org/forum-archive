    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have no idea how to install the flashme on my DSLite because when I insert the passkey2 with the game and switched to passkey 2 as well as the G6 GBA cart inserted in the gba slot, I get white screens after the warning.
<br/>
<br/>
am I doing something wrong? How do i get to flash my DSLite with a G6 cart or an M3 perfect SD?
<br/>
<br/>
I just got my DSLite in June 11 when it the DSLite's were release in North America at EBGames.
<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your time, help and advice. :)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by KidBomba on Fri Jun 16, 2006 9:57 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, i"m confused. Can someone please explain me how to do this? :(
<br/>
<br/>
all I have right now is an M3 Perfect SD, a G6 clash cart, mario kart ds game pak, my ds lite, a passkey 2 dongle thing plus some other wierd dongle that goes in the gba slot.
<br/>
<br/>
I"ve been following the sticky above, but I'm stuck here: 
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>sticky wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">This is the tricky part. What you are going to do, inside of the same 2-3 seconds is: Note: If you are using a Supercard miniSD, there is no time requirements as the SRAM in the miniSD is battery backed up. Take your time.
<br/>
<br/>
    * Power off the DS
<br/>
    * Stick the Passme2 with game into the DS slot
<br/>
    * Power back on with ABXY held down, release when you see the SC screen on the bottom
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I run the IQSRAM.GBA file, it says loaded, then i turn it off, put the passkey2 in with the nds game press abxy at the same time and once I see the health screen I release...but nothing, white screens still :( (what is the SC screen anyway?)
<br/>
<br/>
flashing the DSLite is very frustrating. i didnt know it would be this complicated. Any ideas what to do? I appreciate your time and help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yea, I think that's the problem here. I'm no expert, but when flashing my DS Lite, I ran into the same problem because I had never programmed my Passme2 before (my old DS was on the v2 firmware). I used MarioKart DS European Version, the SRAM needed for it is different than the US version.
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure that the SRAM you reprogram your passkey for is the same version of MarioKart DS needed, based on whichever DS game you're using. In your case, it's MarioKart DS so find the correct SRAM, reprogram your passkey2. To find the correct code, check the back of your DS game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How do you reprogram the passkey 2 with mario kart ds?
