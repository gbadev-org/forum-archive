    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i just noticed that when a ds game is in my slot, a little line flickers across the top screen when i boot up to the menu. im using flashmev6. im not sure if this has anything to do with the intro sound getting messed up. i wouldn't be able to tell cuz im using flashme, but is this small line flickering across the top screen a sign my ds is going to fry? (i turned on my quite a few times just to check if it would start burning)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Your DS may be suffering from the following problem! Do not turn it off and on again or you will risk serious damage!

<br/>
Other than that, I doubt that your DS is going to brick. It's probably just something to do with the game, or just the screen doing its thing. Maybe a problem with the DS's hardware, but I doubt.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, if your DS <span style="font-style: italic">does</span> brick itself, it is possible to recover with Flashme.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not necessarily. Being bricked just means being broken. If it's messed up firmware, yes you can fix it, but if the hardware is busted you may be SOL.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have also seen it on unflashmed DS's.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
