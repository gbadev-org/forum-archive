    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The more I hear about the PlayYan (Nintendo's official GB/DS Movie Player), I more I like it. It uses SD memory and fits snug into the GBA slot. Nintendo also advertised that there will be downloadable games for their website, so it seems they have homebrew in mind. Hopefully we will be able to run code off of it like a regular flash cart. SD memory goes pretty high and it also plays MP3s and video so its the ultimate add-on. I really hope its easy to put homebrew on it, cause then that would just be so nice. Anyone else as hyped as me?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

"Sadly, Play-Yan Micro is incompatible with the flash-based mini games that Nintendo has made available for Play-Yan."

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Because the GBAMP sticks out of the DS pretty far and the Play-Yan is the size of a GBA cart (slightly bigger, but not by much). And as El Hobito said, it has a hardware decoder and the video is a lot better quality. The new SuperCard looks like it could be good as well, but it doesn't have the hardware decoder.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Who would really need "full screen" on a Nintendo DS, given that TV shows aren't shot for the dual-screen format (two 256x192 screens with a big gap in the middle)? If you refer only to filling one 256x192 screen, then is there really much of a practical difference between 240x160 and 256x192 when watching a sitcom?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Well, the 240x160 on the DS is smaller than on the GBA. The DS screen has the same width as the GBA one. For me its kind of small:|</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
