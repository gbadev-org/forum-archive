    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">&gt;_&gt; I had written this earlier, but I violated rules *cries*, well first let me say hi.."Hi!", ok now that that over, I'm new here and  wanna know if I researched well enough to come up with this package for my homebrewing playing. Im gonna buy these.
<br/>
<br/>
PassCard for Nintendo DS
<br/>
M3 Lite TF (MicroSD) Adapter
<br/>
SanDisk 1GB TF(MicroSD) Card
<br/>
<br/>
Are these right for playing homebrew, as I dont wanna buy the wrong thing. I also noticed on 2 diffrent sites that the passcard was orange on one, while purple on another, why is this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Different versions of the PassCard may have different colors. Make sure that you get the PassCard version 3, as it makes things a lot easier.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
