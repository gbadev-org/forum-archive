    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello!  In my quest to learn about serial/midi/ds i've decided that i need a small breakout cartridge for prototyping my (our) hardware for the interface.  I was thinking of making a run of pcbs so their done well and was wondering if anyone else would be interested?
<br/>
<br/>
It will basically be a cart with a 16 pin (one of the pins on the ds cart isn't connected to anything) connector on the back to make prototyping hardware interfaces for the ds easier.  I'd sell these as cheaply as possible plus a tiny bit extra (i'll have to solder them myself) for assembly.
<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone use these if i had a run of em made?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How about the reason that there is currently no way of obtaining a DSerial? the last post in the blog was 3 months ago. I'm sure he'll finish it when he gets some free time, but nerd may want something sooner.
<br/>
<br/>
Important to note that the DSerial will supposedly do a lot more than just a simple breakout.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes. If you're interested in PCB prototyping firms, go ask on nesdev.com boards.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's who I use for PassMe's.  If your just looking for proto's though, check out sparkfun.com.  They aren't bad for small quantitiy protos, but you don't have the option to choose trace or pcb specs.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
