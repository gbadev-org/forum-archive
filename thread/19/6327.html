<br/>
<br/>
I would like to have a pcmcia card or a pci card needed for wmb. Does someone want to give me one (in any condition, as long as it is working) in exchange for a Siemens 11M I-Gate pcmcia card, which uses the prism2 chipset and is extremely well supported under linux and perfect for wardriving, if you like that sort of thing. It's been flashed to the most recent firmware possbile and is in good condition. 
<br/>
<br/>
Another question: Is there any documentation on the data that is needed to initiate a wireless boot? Like what is needed to advertise a download, what is needed for the handshake etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
