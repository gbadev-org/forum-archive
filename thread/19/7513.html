<a href="http://darkfader.net/ds/files/fwdumper.nds" target="_blank">http://darkfader.net/ds/files/fwdumper.nds</a>
<br/>
It saves to FWxxxxxx.BIN on a CF card. M3 might not show up, but still seems to works.
<br/>
Thanks to chishm and co. for the CF routines. Still too bad there are no standard file I/O calls yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've tested it, it is a dumper not a bricker.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Damn, flashmeed mine yesterday. One more day and I would have my original firmware dumped. hehe
<br/>
<br/>
What about that "every firmware is sacred" talk? Is the firmware unique for each DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">FlashMe currently contains a modified copy of Nintendo's firmware, which is thought by some gbadev.org members to be a copyright infringement. Other sites distributing Xbox firmware hacked in the same way have got in legal trouble. Future versions of FlashMe may require an original copy of the firmware to avoid warez allegations.
<br/>
<br/>
NoFlashMe is potentially in even more hot water, as it contains an exact copy of multiple official firmware revisions.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition, someone wanted a dump of the iQue DS firmware to see what the extra data represents. I'm guessing it might be an ideographic font.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>

-- You know, the human.
