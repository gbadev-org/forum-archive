    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to install flashme via Wifime and my GBAMP/EFA linker1 (256Mbit).
<br/>
Neither give any operation I  just get 2 WSOD's :(.
<br/>
I put the flashme file (both stealth and non stealth tested) on there (with the GBAMP renamed as _boot_mp.nds, with the linker via the linker software).
<br/>
Wifime, and it tries to boot and I get the nice screens.
<br/>
If I use mooshell, same problem, if I use the EFA nds loader, same problem :(.
<br/>
Anyone got any clues?
<br/>
<br/>
I've got FW V2 btw</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I might be able to help... at least with the flashcart. Is the flashcart's software trying to load it? Or is it some sort of pathcer on the PC? If it is the latter, don't use it. In any case, see if you can find ndsloader.bin, and prepend it. In the console wiindow of your PC, in the file flashme.nds is in, type </span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">copy /b ndsloader.bin + flashme.nds flashme.ds.gba</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> Put flashme.ds.gba on the flashcart and boot.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>dualscreenman wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">What about Gaim DS?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks! got it working :).
<br/>
I couldn't get it working myself, but after looking through the files in the DSlazy patcher (that doesn't seem to work on my system) I found how they appended the loader, and did the same thing.
<br/>
Did the trick :).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
