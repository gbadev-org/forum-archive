    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I have a question I am thinking of buying a Passcard3 instead of flashing my ds, I want to know if there are any bugs or anything bad that I should know before purchasing a Passcard3 with my M3 minisd. I heard its a perfect combination. What about the MK4 is that better then passcard? If so then in what way? I looked up the pricing for MK$ which is 50 dollars. However the passcard 3 is only 24 dollars. I see a big price difference, if you guys can help me it would be great. I don't want to buy a passkey 2 because it is awfully big and its mainly for people who want to flash their ds lite's. I want to run homebrow with the passcard only i dont want to update firmware because first of all the firmware might be buggy and 2nd im not a 100 percent i can fully flash it. Thanks, hope you guys can help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There hasn't been a major bug reported in FlashMe since V4, and flashing is easy on the old DS. Lite is apparently a bit more difficult, but all you really need to do from what I hear is use a piece of metal wrapped in electrical tape so that only the end is exposed.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I"m thinking of returning my passkey 2 and getting a passcard3 because I keep getting white screens from my passkey 2.

Am I doing the right thing?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
no freaking updates on the freakin thing. all my homebrew runs like crap..... well not all. 
<br/>
<br/>
mostly things that write to the SDcart.  CF 100X better.
<br/>
<br/>
I was always just hoping there was a software upgrade to make it a MKworkonafreakinDSlite2  
<br/>
<br/>
DRNeo is holding out on everyone who gave him money....
<br/>
<br/>
