For cheapness, the GBAMP/MML (Max Media Launcher) combo is probably cheapest.  You aren't going to have compatibility with ds.gba homebrew though, at least the kind that expects to run from a GBA flashcart.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Really, the games that need to be ds.gba's are like, 2 piss old programs or something. Most of the games worth playing have been modifyed to use the FAT library anyways, which means it can be played on just about anything.

<br/>
Buying an M3 over the GBAMP to get support for ds.gba roms is throwing your money away.
<br/>
<br/>
The GBAMP is probably the most FAT lib compatible device, as the maker of the FAT lib also wrote the GBAMP's modifyed firmware that allows it to play DS homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER, it's butt ugly and sticks out about 200km's from your DS. If I were you, I'd wait for some device that fits nicely in the DS Lite's gba slot, or even better, the DS slot.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">M3 doesn't have the best homebrew compatbility at all.
<br/>
There are many reports that most homebrew is broken on M3.
<br/>
<br/>
There are work arounds, but some programs aren't supported anymore and will remain broken (the screen power thing for example).
<br/>
<br/>
GBA homebrew support is reportedly just as bad. However that could be fixed in future firmwares
<br/>
<br/>
Unless you want to do some yarrring, don't bother.
<br/>
Personally I feel the GBAMP + MML is the best combo.
<br/>
<br/>
But if you have money to burn go for it.
<br/>
Otherwise if your really do want to run GBA homebrew then go Supercard and MML. It's cheaper and offers all the functions of the M3 with better compatibility. It's cheaper to boot. It's one flaw is due to cost, they've used cheap and high power consuming chips.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

There are more than two. Off hand, I can think of Heretic, Hexen, SnezziDS, and TickleGirl. In addition, most GBA-mode homebrew is .gba, not .mb.gba.

SLOT-1 cards worry me, as they are unable to run GBA homebrew. If all the flash card makers stop making SLOT-2 cards in favor of SLOT-1 cards, this may contribute to the decline of the GBA homebrew scene just as the unavailability of GBC cards has contributed to the decline of the GBC homebrew scene.

I have a Supercard SD combo, w/FlashMe v7 on a normal DS.

Long story short: Supercard CF seems to be compatible with everything currently available. Supercard SD-friendly homebrew isn't very widespread. DS applications that save to SRAM and aren't filesystem aware (such as Beup's account saving) will work with the Supercard SD if you use the QPC sequence.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum.

I keep seeing people say this, but I have still had no problems with it.  Only time I did was once when I accidentally ran a bit of homebrew through the M3's patcher software.
<br/>
<br/>
It's kind of driving me crazy, since I'd love to know why these people are having problems...I highly doubt I have 'the One M3 to rule them all' or something of that nature. ;)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I swear to god this topic feels like its a couple of months old with some of the replies im hearing. SC SD works fine with most homebrew now.
<br/>
<br/>
From what i've heard M3 is supposed to have the best gba compatability because of the faster ram being used in it hence the price of it. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'd suggest getting a mini-sd sc or a m3 sd as sc cf sticks out a fair amount</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is because the latest public version of <a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/gba_nds_fat/index.html" target="_blank">Chishm's FAT library</a> is also "a couple of months old" which in turn is because Chishm is busy rewriting the whole thing.

well yeah, the saving doesn't work but they're otherwise very useable! :P

<br/>
as for the tepple's wiki - how does it encourage piracy? all the mention of roms can be legally attributed to using backups... something that I do. Who wants to carry around loads of NDS carts when they can all sit happily on one SD card? (I realise that not everyone pays for their games but other peoples dishonesty shouldn't be enough of a reason to not link to a very informative wiki imo)
