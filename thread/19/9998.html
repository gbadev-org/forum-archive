        <h2>DS Flash Equipment > M3 or Supercard?</h2>

    <h4>#88710 - superflat - Wed Jun 21, 2006 6:13 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm getting a DS Lite within the next 10 days and I want to get a GBA flash card to go with it. I will be using the card to run homebrew applications, SNES and GBA emulators, and possibly ScummVM. I am looking at the M3 and the Supercard as my top two choices, and the M3 seems to be winning at the moment. The only problem with it is that it is rather expensive. Any suggestions as to which card would be better for the purposes I listed above (and probably a few others that I forgot when I was typing)? Just for the record I will be using Datel's Max Media Launcher unless suggested otherwise (I don't really want to screw around with the firmware for the DS).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, for each type of card, which type of memory is better (CF, SD, or miniSD)? And would it be worth it to wait for the Lite versions of Flash Carts to come out? While I'm getting the DS soon, I won't be getting the Flash Cart or the MML until after August.

Thanks a bunch!<br/>_________________<br/>Spaghetti man ate my dreams.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
