    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not entirely dev-related, but I managed to get my Belkin USB stick (FSD7050 if anyone cares) to work with the driver hack posted the other day and working as a Nintendo Wi-fi USB Connector. The problem however is, no matter what I do I just cannot get connected to the WFC service with Zonealarm (or any firewall I've tried) running. The second I close it, no problems. Obviously this is fairly frustrating and all that idiots elsewhere say is "turn off your firewall"... which as we all know would be deeply stupid. Has anyone had any luck getting connected with the USB Connector through Zonealarm..?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i think its impossible...
<br/>
since you need to enable access for all of your opponents, meaning everytime you play you need to enable 3 or less IPs, if they dont disconnect....
<br/>
its better to just use windows firewall or a router</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Can't remember how exactly I got it to work, though - but it was a fair bit of trouble.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Please do. There seems to be some very specific trick to getting it to work correctly. Zonealarm appears to be *trying* to let you connect to the WFC service (there is definitely up/dowload activity) but failing in the end for some reason a lot of people can't figure out. My personal theory is UDP ports need to be allowed, but which ones is beyond me (given that the Nintendo site helpfully advises "all"...)
<br/>
Yet I have no problem if I just set it to connect via my wireless router. I'd much rather use the USB method however if this can be figured out...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, well like I said, I can't remember exactly how I got it to work, but I'll give some of the settings I have set up here.
<br/>
<br/>
First of all, it's a fairly old version of Zone Alarm Pro - 3.0.118
<br/>
<br/>
The DS wireless adaptor is set up on 192.168.7.0/255.255.255.0,  Entry Type : Network, Trusted Zone
<br/>
<br/>
The Trusted Zone settings are:
<br/>
Medium
<br/>
Nothing is blocked in the Medium settings for Trusted Zone.
<br/>
<br/>
In the 'Advanced' box, under 'Internet connection Sharing', I have 'This computer is an ICS/NAT gateway' ticked, and my local address entered (192.168.7.3, though that probably won't be relevent to you).
<br/>
<br/>
Far as I can tell, that's everything relevent that I've ticked. Of course, the Nintendo Wifi Connector program has full Access and Server privileges.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
