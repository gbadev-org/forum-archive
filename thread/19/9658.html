Everyone who has the GBAMP compact flash version can use Chishm's firmware hack in order to allow their movie player to be used with a passme device to run nds homebrew.

I have a GBAMP secure digital version and ther doesn't seem to be a firmware hack out there. Is anyone going to write one?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
