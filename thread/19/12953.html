    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can get cards that fit into either slot to use homebrew with. Slot-1 cards are smaller and generally you just plug them in and go. Slot-2 cards require either a firmware hack or a slot-1 card to boot them (though these are much cheaper than standalone slot-1 cards and generally come with the device), and may stick out of the slot (especially with DS Lite), but may offer things such as standard SD card or Compact Flash support, GBA compatibility (for playing GBA games on the DS or using the card on a GBA), extra memory for homebrew to use, and/or rumble support.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Like what? I know about the issue with backing up saves from DS Game Cards, but is your problem just that older programs haven't been recompiled with DLDI? If so, then the GBAMP had the same problem during the transition from ds.gba to .nds+gba_nds_fat.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
