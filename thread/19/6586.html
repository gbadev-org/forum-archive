    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've had a Blitzz Super G Wireless PCI card for a while now and I don't want to go out and buy a new card just for this.  I looked at the list of Ralink RT2500 and my card isn't listed.  I was thinking that maybe my card wasn't tested or something.  Is there a way to find out if my card has RT2500?  Or would I be better off buying a PassMe but I don't know how to install that or anything, but I'm sure it can't be too hard if soldering isn't heavily involved.
<br/>
I might have more questions in the future, so please help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">PassMe needs no soldering. It needs only the PassMe adapter itself, the Metroid demo (or any other official DS game) plugged into the back side of the adapter (which is a cut-down connector for Game Boy carts), and either a GBA flash cart or a GBA Movie Player that has been made DS-aware.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, so the PassMe seems to be better than buying a $50 PCI card.  But do I still have to open up the DS?  Or does it plug into one of the slots using somekind of cord?  Thanks for the quick response.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Your Nintendo DS has a front slot and a back slot. PassMe plugs into the back slot, and a GBA flash cart plugs into the front slot.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
