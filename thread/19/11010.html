    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My G6Lite was just shipped from hong kong yesterday and i was wondering if there is anything i should know about it when it comes to homebrew what things i should do to get it set up if any
<br/>
<br/>
I know some people are having problems with this device and i would like to know about any if people know about them it'd be nice so i know its not just me if i have any problems with mine.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I've been hanging around this site for a while but this is my first device for homebrew so any info i would need to get into homebrew scene would be apreciated</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, you should know there is no libfat support for the G6, so you wont be able to run some homebrew unfortunately (unless you can make a FCSR image, but you still probably wont be able to save).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
