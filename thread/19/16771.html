    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Previously, it has been told that iPlayer team was developping external subtitle function. Now, their progress is revealed, that subtitles setting has been added into video playing setting, besides, font colour and subtitles time offset operation of external subtitle has completed. But there are still some multinational language code problem what needs to be solved, further more, subtitles background colour function is considered to be added, so that it could avoid colour superimposition problems, if the subtitles colour is similar with the video colour around. The expected external subtitle function is believed to be coming soon.
<br/>
<br/>
Recently, external subtitle function is whether limited by video formats or not, what was asked on some forum. Of course not, the external subtitle function is separated from video playing, and complete independence, so whatever the video format is, you could use external subtitle function freely.
