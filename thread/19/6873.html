    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A problem that im sure is easily sorted, but i cannot find an answer to.
<br/>
<br/>
Setup: 
<br/>
Super Card CF, latest firmware, using latest conversion software
<br/>
Passme GBC Complete
<br/>
DS carts tryed: MK64DS, Feel the magic, MP: Hunters Demo
<br/>
<br/>
Problem:
<br/>
The homebrew apps have been placed on the supercard using the software. When booting it loads the supercard screen fine, when a app is selected the Supercard doesnt appear to load much but then the apps are quite small. The Gameboy screen comes up (on the homebrew apps) then sometimes the screen goes white and freezes, other times it goes white then black and freezes. With the zelda trailer it doesnt show the gameboy screen but rather loads into a white screen and freezes.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for any help. If this problem is covered in another thread please link and lock.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the application with the supercard only seems to output zero byte files on every homebrew app I try. What this app SHOULD do is add a bootloader to your images, so they can be loaded (yes, this is needed on a supercard).
<br/>
<br/>
- If you have files that end on .nds.gba: Just rename the extension to .nds and it will work (otherwise the supercard will treat it as a gba game anyway)
<br/>
-  If your file ends on .nds: you will have to add the loader yourself. I don't know if there are any apps that do this for you, but I do this manually by dowloading this <a class="postlink" href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/ndsloader.bin" target="_blank">ndsloader.bin</a> and appending the file to it.
<br/>
<br/>
Most homebrew people are nice enough to provide a .nds.gba file as well though, all you need to do is rename the file :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. I hear the next version of devKitArm will make .nds files that have a loader built in (so you can use it as a .nds.gba also)
<br/>
<br/>
2. the dsbuild.exe tool converts a .nds to a .nds.gba file (this tool is part of devkitarm)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So you <span style="font-style: italic">don't</span> need the SuperCard app at all as long as you can append the ndsloader data to your roms?  Can someone confirm this?
<br/>
<br/>
This would be a big relief to me, since I plan on doing all of my development in Linux, and while I could wrestle with Wine, I'd rather not.<br/>_________________<br/>dz

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The only thing the supercard software is for is commercial roms. Homebrew is simple to just rename the .ds.gba to .gba.nds or .nds(but that's confusing). <a href="http://www.scdev.org" target="_blank">http://www.scdev.org</a> is a great place for supercard help. I have never had problems with any homebrew on the supercard; all seem to work. For commercial rom commpatability(you dirty bastard) check out <a href="http://www.consolecovers.com/ds/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.consolecovers.com/ds/index.html</a>  ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
