    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The two folders are <span style="font-style: italic">amd</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">i386</span> if I'm not mistaken. If your pc is running on a Intel-processor, which is most likely, you need to head to the i386-folder. If your pc is not, you probably might wanna go for amd.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
