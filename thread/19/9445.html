What is this? What can it do? It's a CF adapter for playing movies and NES games. I wonder what else is possible... Does anyone have it, yet?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's what I'm voting on this, though it does look more like an M3 than a GBAMP, I think that's mostly due to the silver coloring as the GBAMP/M3 look fairly similar side-by-side.  Especially since it lists a generic AVI as a format it can play (like the GBAMP literature does, even though it can't as it needs to convert it first :P).<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For all the information I could get, it seems to be a GBAMP v2 like device. Whether chishms Patch works with it I can't tell, but, if you are a German (or another European), you can get the original GBAMP from flashlinker-shop.com without having to import (or just an inner-EU import) (and it is even cheaper than the HAMA MP)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.uglyhorst.de/blog/nerdpunk/" target="_blank">visit my blog. please.</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's the translation of the infos for the not german speakers:
<br/>
<br/>
Multimedia Player
<br/>
    * to play movies and music (and freeware-NES-Games) and fotos
<br/>
    * it can read eBooks
<br/>
    * compatible with the Nintendo DS / Gameboy Micro / Gameboy Advance / Gameboy Advance SP
<br/>
    * supported formats: AVI, WAV, ASF, MPG, MPEG, WAV, MP3, WMA, MOV, RM, RMVB, VOB, BMP, DIB, RLE, PCX, DCX, JPEG, PNG, DXF, IMG, GIF, TIF, WPG, TGA, WMF, EPS, and more!
<br/>
    * will need a Compact-Flash-Card (not included)
<br/>
    * includes software for converting (to use on a PC)
<br/>
    * the software is for Windows? ME/2000/XP
<br/>
<br/>
sounds like the GBAMP -&gt; you have to convert the music/movies on a PC.
<br/>
It costs 29? which is 36$, a GBAMP is cheaper and i think it's too cheap to be a M3 clone...
<br/>
<br/>
But let's wait until someone gets one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes and I read in the review by c'net that videos are stored in two files, one gbs file and one gbm file, and they also said that it was "a licensed version of the movieadvance Movie Player", whatever they want to say with this.
<br/>
<br/>
The only reason I could think why to buy this is the hope that their converters are modified and not as trashy as the original ones. I say trashy, because they don't work for me (they want to access C:\ but I have none).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.uglyhorst.de/blog/nerdpunk/" target="_blank">visit my blog. please.</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I suppose if you could find a download of their software you could try it and see if it works.  Sounds like the format is probably totally the same as the GBAMP's.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
