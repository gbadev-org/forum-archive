    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody,
<br/>
<br/>
I bricked my DS yesterday when flashmeeing, I accidentally dropped the ds and the battery flew out when it showed about 1%. So I disassembled it, soldered the wires, but my computer's LPT port is 5 volts. Which method to reduce voltage do you guys reccommend: resistors or a CMOS buffer ie (74HC07)?
<br/>
My second question is that I don't have a flash cart so is there any way to directly load the FlashMe firmware into the firmware chip?

This can be done with Wifime and WMB, however, as Lynx states, if he doesnt have a flashcart, how did he flashme in the first place ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Now can you guys answer my question?

I was only curious. If it is possible to start flashme.nds on a stock fw1-3 DS with only a Ralink wireless card and no GBA card, then I want to know how to do it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Sorry guys, I was inaccurate to you. It didn't actually show 1%, i just thought that was it since the screen went dark and immediately shut down so fast i couldn't see if anything was there. I thought I saw something.
<br/>
<br/>
If the FlashMe loader didn't run how come my DS just shows the logo and shuts down?

Don't think so; the fall was pretty short. Anyway I checked Fuse F2 (I read somewhere DSs fail often due to a damaged fuse.

It didn't show anything (that I could make out anyway) before shutting down. But the weird part, again, is that <span style="font-weight: bold">why</span> does the ds now just boot and shut down immediately if the firmware wasn't damaged??? Anyway, I already soldered the wires and have the setup complete (I tried buffering the parallel port and my multimeter now shows 3 v instead of 4.5 v) so I guess just reflash it.

I then removed fuse F2 next to the battery connector, soldered some wire instead of a fuse, inserted battery, and booted. It however, still immediately turns off.

Update: I also checked the lcd connectors. They seem to be ok. However, I've noticed that after bridging fuse F2, the DS boots with a red light instead of a green light.
