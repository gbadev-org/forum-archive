    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's a thought...
<br/>
<br/>
Many people (myself included) are more than a little ticked off that the DS has no GBA serial comms port.  Is it possible to make a GBA cart that will fit into the DS that is equipped with a comms port that you can then use to play multiboot games?
<br/>
<br/>
And if so, would it need to have its own 256K memory to store the games?  I ask this because when the DS boots to a GBA game, there's still a DS white splash screen (screens.. whatever), so this makes me think that the DS flushes its RAM on boot.  If you think about it, it doesn't need to retain RAM on boot like MB GBA stuff 'cause you're not supposed to be able to do that.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's another half-baked idea:  Is there a way you could modify your e-Reader to do this very task?  I'm not talking about average-joe me, I'm talking about smart people?  Obviously, *I* couldn't do that...

Wild guess: Audio, just like on the SP. 
<br/>
Apparantly the EXT port is identical to its SP counterpart, and i think i read a post somewhere that the external headphones with EXT plug still worked fine on the DS...<br/>_________________<br/>"Duct tape is just like the Force.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, but in their ultimate wisdom Nintendo decided to include the standard GBA SP power connector/headphones jack so as to remain backwards compatible with the GBA SP.  Sadly, this backwards comapatibility does NOT extent to having an EXT port - presumably they just ran out of space.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

Make sure to pick up some GBA games as the DS lineup is quite thin at the moment.
<br/>
<br/>
Golden Sun
<br/>
Golden Sun: The Lost Age
<br/>
The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap (Jan. 10 is the US, out already in the UK)
<br/>
Advance Wars 2 (Advance Wars is pretty much the same thing, no need to buy both)
<br/>
Final Fantasy I &amp; II
<br/>
Final Fantasy Tactics Advance
<br/>
Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories
<br/>
and try out Megaman Battle Network. I liked that game but it might get a bit repetitive as you go through the sequels.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In practice, most people pirate their PocketNES ROMs. Most people also pirate their GBA multiboots rather than using that tool-that-must-not-be-named to intercept downloads from a GameCube. Besides, the only interesting one is probably Panel de Pon, and you can get that for Goomba.
