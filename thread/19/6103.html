I'm curious about this - if I understand this, there is a way to acces Compact Flash from app - maybe there will be in future option to download game updates (courses, models, etc.) and place them on Play-Yan or sth? It would be fun - same thing as PSP owners can do ;)<br/>_________________<br/>[ sorry for all mistakes, but my english isn't as good as I wish it to be ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As for accessing the CF card with a movie player, there's already a huge topic about that.  Chism wrote a FAT16 driver for it and everything.

Yeah, and somehow I think this dumper is based in someway on Darkfader and my flash read / write sector routines. Notice how it came out just after Darkfader posted code for writing? I think the least they could do to thank us is update it to use FAT so it doesn't corrupt the CF card. That and release their source code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
