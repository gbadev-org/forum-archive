    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well my friend is looking to get into ds homebrew after I was telling him some of the stuff that I could do with my ds. But after messing around with my Games N Music card I can't seem to get it to play things like Colors, Trivia, etc, anything that needs use of a filesystem. And since that would be the cheapest method I had suggested it to him. So I have a few questions.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Is there a way to get all games to work on the Games N Music card?
<br/>
<br/>
2. If not, what card would be the cheapest that can do everything?
<br/>
<br/>
3. What is the approximate price range for 1-2 gb memory card for the answer to number 2.
<br/>
<br/>
4. Regardless of price what is the absolute best slot-1 card to get?
<br/>
<br/>
5. What would you recommend he does?
<br/>
<br/>
Btw he lives in Scotland if that comes into effect, for shipping prices and such.<br/>_________________<br/>Red GBA SP, Gold Triforce DS Lite, GBAMP V2, GnM, 512 MB CF card, 2 GB CF card, 128 MB microSD card, 1 GB microSD card</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Did you make sure to use a <a class="postlink" href="http://dldi.drunkencoders.com/index.php?title=End-user_instructions" target="_blank">DLDI patcher</a> to put <a class="postlink" href="http://dldi.drunkencoders.com/index.php?title=GNM" target="_blank">gmtf.dldi</a> into each .nds program that reads files from the memory card? Tip: Version 2 of the DLDI doesn't work with all microSD cards; use version 1 if you have problems.

<br/>
R4, SuperCard DS One, and CycloDS Evolution appear to work. The big advantages of these over the GnM are 1. they automatically patch .nds programs with DLDI when loading them, and 2. they read and write files faster than the GnM.

All three of these take microSD cards.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has he patched his homebrew with DLDI yet?  Until he does, homebrew won't be able to access the filesystem of his card, as the GnM does not automatically patch homebrew for you like many devices do now.  See the DLDI wiki at <a href="http://dldi.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://dldi.drunkencoders.com</a> for more info.
