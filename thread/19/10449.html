    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys,
<br/>
<br/>
I just like to ask what are the pros and cons on flashing your ds vs buying a passme card. So far here is what I have listed (correct me if I am mistaken, thanks ^_^)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Flashing</span>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Pros</span>
<br/>
No need to buy a new hardware
<br/>
No need to carry an additional cartridge
<br/>
Prevents DS from bricking once installed
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Cons</span>
<br/>
Loosing your original FW (unless its reflashed with the original FW)
<br/>
Risk of tampering your warranty (same as above)
<br/>
Risk of bricking your DS
<br/>
Decrease in sound (not sure if true)
<br/>
Wifi incompatibility with some games (not sure, please confirm)
<br/>
Need passme to initiate the flashing (borrow from a friend!)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Passme</span>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Pros</span>
<br/>
Original FW is retained
<br/>
No flashing required
<br/>
Plug and play
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Cons</span>
<br/>
Need to buy a new hardware
<br/>
Lesser battery life compared to flashing (not sure if true)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to decide if I should get a passme or just flash my ds. Thanks again
<br/>
<br/>

<span style="color: red">False- Your firmware can be restored, but FlashMe is a clone of the original anyway.</span>

<br/>

<span style="color: green">True - but you can always restore the original FW.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Risk of bricking your DS
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">True and false - If you follow the directions, it is very hard to brick your DS. But once FlashMe is installed, it protects itself from becoming bricked.</span>

Decrease in sound (not sure if true)

If you have a newer DS, using a passme2 is far from plug and play. It's actually very inconvenient. With a NoPass device however, it's really easy.
<br/>
<br/>
But really, it's a bad pro for using passme, flashing is even more plug and play (after you're done), wouldn't you say? You only have to plug in one device.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You have to plug in four devices to install FlashMe: a NoPass, a GBA card, a screwdriver sized for the battery compartment, and a screwdriver sized for the SL1 pads.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

When I flashed my DS and my other cousin's DS, I put the sticker across one of the LCD pot adjustment holes. I can move it back and install stealth or noflashme if I need to.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Sweet. I have seen the video as well. He did it in less than 2 minutes!

@tepples

Hhmm.. I have read somewhere in the forum that they did the exact same thing. They just placed the sticker back after flashing. Cool!

I'll try to see if I can flash my DS this weekend. Hopefully I can find the necessary flashme files. Btw is the official flashme site already up?</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You need a way to run homebrew to flash.

You still need a GBA cart of some sort.

If you do it right the risk is very, very small.

I've heard this happens to some Lites, but it didn't happen to my Phat.
<br/>
<span style="color: green">Wifi incompatibility with some games (not sure, please confirm)</span>

Using any wifi game would corrupt the firmware (but you could restore it) on old versions of FlashMe. This isn't a problem with the latest version.

Because FlashMe is based on DS firmware v3, you lose the bugfixes in newer firmware v4 and later that are unrelated to anti-piracy and anti-homebrew changes. It's like a PSP user on 2.60 downgrading to 1.50 and losing the web browser.

I am not entirely sure that such improvements in newer versions of the DS official firmware exist, but they could include improvements to the battery efficiency of the DS dashboard program, better touch code in the calibrator and PictoChat, more stable connections in PictoChat and DS Download Play, etc. There has to be some difference between firmware v1 and v3 and between v4 and v5.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

When I checked first time I tested Mario Kart DS playing from real Card. Only started it up quickly and didnt experience it..

But now I think that some games sound different.. because Sound and SFX are not "mixed" correctly in Loudness... SFX are a littlebit louder...  Its just a minor glitch.. And can live with it....

I think so. I recall people saying they put Lite firmware on an old DS (or vice-versa) and trying to change the brightness just made the speakers click.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Would be nice to include if its the US/Euro/Jap Version of the DS.

If NDSMP can't find _boot_mp.nds, it boots to the internal firmware in GBA mode. Have you chkdsk'd the CF card?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
