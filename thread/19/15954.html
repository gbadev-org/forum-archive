    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a good guide to the current set of flash carts anywhere? I guess most people only own one, so don't really get to compare them. Is it just changing too fast to keep up now?
<br/>
<br/>
I already have an old slot-2 supercard, and a Datel G'n'M, but I'm thinking of getting myself a second DS (tbh, I'm a bit embarrassed using my phat in public ;) ) and want a decent, easy-to-use slot 1 card with fast DLDI r/w. A while ago that would probably have been an R4, but these days I just don't know. 
<br/>
<br/>
Is SDHC faster than normal SD? Given that I genuinely don't care about warez, do I even need high capacity card support? The 128Mb card that came with the GnM has done fine for me so far, but the GnM has other problems.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

m3 sakura has a problem with homebrew but [...] has a better dpg player then moonshell. But m3 ds real firmware is perfect for homebrew:)

right off the back of the box

i currently own 5 flash kits. one is over 9yrs old, so they date back but all work. i just passed on my r4 for an acekard rpg. anyways... what do you expect to get out of the kit? do you want real time saves? do you want sdhc support? do you want good cheat support? do you want 100% compatibility? do you want auto dldi patching? do you want guaranteed download play support? do you want gimmick features?
<br/>
<br/>
sdhc shouldn't be thought of as being faster but larger. if you want to carry more than 2gb with you at one time, then get an sdhc kit. all sdhc kits currently on the market are backwards compatible with normal msd. so your old cards will work. the ds seeks data at 12ms (i think) and from what i recall no msd is that fast yet. but with that said namebrand goes a long way for certain things, when 99.8% of other things don't care.
<br/>
<br/>
each kit has positives and negatives. right now i am back to recommending the acekard2. i have been assured (and asked not to mention names) that team acekard has indeed fixed the FAT error hardware issue with the ak2. as long as your ak2 says '2.1' on the sticker, you will have no issues. the open source AKAIO firmware is just amazing. it has native 3-in-1 support, cut/copy/paste features which will move save files with the rom, and automatic rom trimming. it features advanced skinning and great cheat support. also the new build has a wifi cheat download option. ak2 is only like 23 bucks from most retailers.
<br/>
<br/>
if you want official firmware updates, high compatibility and money isn't an option ($65+) get a cycloDS. the kit is pretty well made and the tream is behind it all the way. problems are usually fixed very quickly, or they are the 1st to fix problems out of all the other flash kit teams.
<br/>
<br/>
The EDGE is a cycloDS clone which i have read good things about, but again its a clone. so expect the unexpected. 
<br/>
<br/>
i would personally stay away from the m3 real and the m3 simply due to many recently issues. the team hasn't been updating firmware. In fact they are working on a new kit and have focused all attention to it. the m3 team is very old and they have good experience. so its sad to see the slot1 kits feature hacked firmwares and poor support. they have, however, recently put out the itouchds. this kit is under $20 on most vender sites. i've spoken with a few people that own it and they have good things to say about it. however, the iface is clunky and the loader is a bit slow.
<br/>
<br/>
stay away from all r4 clones, the n5 (blows a fuse on msd power cycle, and may brick your ds), the dstt, the g6 kits, the neo flash kits. they all have issues which can cause you headaches, frustration, and hardware issues to your ds.
<br/>
<br/>
again... research the acekard2 and AKAIO firmware a bit. see what you think. if you have questions post back. i will check for the next few weeks for responses or other comments.
<br/>
<br/>
cheers,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry, I haven't been here for a while - this PC is on its last legs, so I've been using my laptop, which doesn't have all my bookmarks on it - but thanks for the comments. I'll look into the Acekard.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm most interested in things like Colors and NitroTracker, which read and write to the card a lot. Some of the apps I want to write, if I ever get round to it, would also be reading and writing external files. Auto DLDI-patching would be nice.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'm not in a rush. :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
