    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not the answer you want to hear, but I have a EZFA 256M Realtime cart (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.dannychoo.com/blogimg/ezfa_1.jpg" target="_blank">this red one</a>), and the only reliable method I found for booting multiple homebrew roms was to get a Supercard SD. :)
<br/>
<br/>
I did have limited success with MultiNDS after I upgraded my FlashMe from 5 (I think) to 7, but I found that it would be much more convenient to get a SC.
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't know if MultiNDS works with a PassMe; I've never had one.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">multinds doesn't work flashme v4 or v5, iirc.
<br/>
<br/>
it's a given that it doesn't work with anything &gt; 3 mb (what with needing the ram and everything), nor does it work on commercial roms, or anything with a loader pre-attached, but for old flashcarts whose manufacturers don't support any other kind of nds loader, it is the best option available.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
