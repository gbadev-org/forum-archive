    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For the past year or so, I've stopped doing GBA homebrew because I got myself into NDS homebrew with equipment for testing, so my EZF Advance 256M cartridge just sits in the Slot 2 dock of my NDS doing nothing. 
<br/>
<br/>
To make a short story shorter, I was looking around for BSP documentation, with things involving Quake and BSPs, and I happened to come around again to Simon's page of Quake and Q2 for the NDS, and I remembered that those 2 can use (one requires) slot 2 RAM. I got to thinking that perhaps if it is possible, I could do the same things with my cartridge, kinda like having extra memory like the debug NDS units have internally.
<br/>
<br/>
So, is it possible to use my card in this way, and if so, how could I do it with an EZF Advance 256M cartridge?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No you can't use EZF Advance 256M as a RAM expansion because it doesn't have RAM.  You can use it to run Ticklegirl and a few other old homebrew games that can only read their files from slot-2 devices.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
