    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First you need to get the newest firmware for your GBAMP, packed as a .gba file.
<br/>
Second you need to install your wifi-card, explained over here: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php" target="_blank">http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php</a>
<br/>
And at last, you need to put the flashme nds file on your GBAMP.
<br/>
Maybe you needa find a tutorial cause I'm not capable to go into details ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

for 2., the screen turns green but i had a question that i posted in the thread about the discovery of this test
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">my ds was preowned when i bought it in early september, but its an NU900, meaning (from what i heard) that it was refurbished at some point, but not when i bought it, so these are the stages of my ds's ownership that i'm thinking its been in
<br/>
<br/>
1. purchased new
<br/>
2. sold to some store, which sent it to nintendo to be refurbished
<br/>
3. someone bought the refurbished nintendo ds
<br/>
4. the person sold the refurbished ds
<br/>
5. the store (ebgames in this case) didn't have it sent into nintendo
<br/>
6. i bought it
<br/>
<br/>
When i did this test, i got both dark green screens, meaning its FW3....but is it possible that it's not FW3 since its refurbished?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
