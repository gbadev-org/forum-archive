Well, my L button is completely dead, and I gotta send the DS in for repairs.  I know third party software like the R4 and EZ Flash 3-in-1 (both of which I'm using) voids the warranty, but is there a way for them to detect that I used them? (Yes, I'm cheap. I don't want to spend $75 that I don't have on a repair. xP)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if you didn't flash your ds, i would say there's no way to know you used a linker... i'm not 100% sure on this, but as long as everything you do while using a linker is done in memory, and mem is erased on each reboot, even actions like accessing the carts fat/eeprom is limited to the cart's hardware. So i'd say once you've removed your linker, and powered-cycled once using an official cart, i can't see how there could be any trace remaining on the DS.
