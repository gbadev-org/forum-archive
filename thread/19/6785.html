I heard that Neoflash permit to run commercial games. I don't want to do that myself, but I want to know if said commercial games were hacked or if they are pristine dumps (trying to access to the DS slot to get their data).

The point is to allow remote testers to flash a card and test using cheap equipment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are the official DS type carts truly <span style="font-style: italic">that</span> expensive if you are already a developer with access to the official equipment and libraries?
<br/>
<br/>
AFAIK there is no current unliscenced product capable of using "pristine" / official NDS data to emulate NDS functionality through the GBA slot, NeoFlash or otherwise. 
<br/>
<br/>
It is my understanding that in a few weeks the G6flash and M3adapter products <span style="font-style: italic">may</span> be able to use the same data that a NDS cart would, but as far as I can tell that is only marketing hype/speculation and such speculation has been ongoing for quite some time. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking to distribute some test files/units for actual beta testing then these products <span style="font-style: italic">may</span> be what you are seeking, depending on their coders ability to circumvent standard NDS filesystem security.
<br/>
<br/>
The so called 'permitted' commercial games for NeoFlash are in fact patched/hacked/illegal roms, and my personal advice is to avoid NeoFlash products as they are based on poor technology (XG flash carts) to begin with.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by cory1492 on Thu Sep 08, 2005 10:29 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

From what I hear, they are dumps of NDS cards hacked to run from the GBA slot directly...apparently there's a lot of specific stuff their private pirate gang hack in there that only works on their flash cart, or whichever XG Turbo (?) cart it's a rebranding of.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Cory: the cart themselves aren't that expensive, but the equipment to flash them is. We can't afford to buy more than a few of them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">9th Sage: I cant find the post, but it was in another homebrew forum like GP32x or it even might be here lost somewhere. Anyway, the original poster was talking about the lawsuit between Nintendo v Lik-Sang. Allegedly when the prosecusion was demonstrating how the flash carts could be used as piracy devices, the game they used to demo had been developed using lik-sangs hardware. The president of lik-sang made a comment that those particular developers had purchased hundreds of the flash cards/linkers in questions from them. It was a quote from either an email or press release from the president of lik-sang. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have also seen video from "behind-the-scenes" making of a GBA game (pro developers) and they were using mostly off the shelf flash cards from China. They were even talking about how they how go through dozens of cards in a month since they would frequently break from heavy testing. This is really not too surprising if you think about it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
