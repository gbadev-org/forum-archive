    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just recently got myself an M3 DS Simply. I'm loving it since I got things working on it, but there is one thing I'm concerned about. The clicking mechanism in the card doesn't seem to be working right anymore, although I think I can deal with it. I push the microSD card into it, and before, it would stay in until I push it again to get it out. Now, it won't stay in if I push it in like you would with a DS card int othe system. What I do now is push it in slowly until I can feel/hear a click, and which I release, and the card stays.

Moonshell works fine, but when I go to close it down or change some interface options requiring it to reset, I get the following message

Is there anything I'm doing wrong? Maybe I don't have some particular file(s) on the system?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
