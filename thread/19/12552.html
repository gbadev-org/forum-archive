    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi i have an old DS with the right firmware to run wifime. I have noticed it is possible to flash the firmware with flashme via wifime.
<br/>
<br/>
The only Flashcart i have is a mini supercard sd.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to somehow get the flashme to boot from the GBA slot via the wifime pass me ?
<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading all forums and tried to get it to go but i am still having trouble...
<br/>
The supercard has the latest firware on it. Does the flashme have to be in a specific format ?
<br/>
<br/>
When i run the passme via the wifime, (which is some sort of hacked save file from the mario game?) it shows the loading mario screen and then says failed after 15 seconds.
<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be gratefully appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What you need to boot your SuperCard in DS mode is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/pass/" target="_blank">NoPass</a>. Depending on where you live, some stores may carry a NoPass plus a CF adapter by the name of "MAX Media Dock".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

"Old wifime"? I wasn't aware that wifime had changed.
<br/>
<br/>
"Old WMB"? Failure to adapt to new MAC prefixes would give a communication error on the PC, not a successful execution of SM64DS's loader.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

My MMP is tight in the DS slot (doesn't eject as easily as Superkey) and it displays an annoying splash screen.
