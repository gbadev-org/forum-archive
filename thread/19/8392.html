    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a FW2 NDS. I am using an EZPass2 to (try and) boot my supercard. (I can only get two white screens with the EZPass2 and an original game)  
<br/>
<br/>
Is EZPass2 not backwards compatible with EZPass1? If it is, will the ezpass.jed file be used? Is there a trick to make an EZPass2 work with an older firmware NDS?
<br/>
<br/>
If it won't work with older firmware NDS units, I think this is explaining all my troubles!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have no idea about that.. Are you trying to boot homebrew?
<br/>
Cause I just got my ezpass trough the door today.. It'll load any backup, but I get 2 white screens when attempting to load any homebrew.. Including flashme!

EZ team refuses to comment on it :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
