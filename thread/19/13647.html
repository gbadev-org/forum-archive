Facts: I have a DS Lite, GBAMPv2 and a Max Media Launcher.

The GBAMP starts up whether I have the MML in or not, when I select "Start GBA Game".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

MML displays "MAX Media Launcher" for a second or two, and then the DS starts running _boot_mp.nds. If you get "MAX Media Launcher" followed by a white screen, then the GBA Movie Player hasn't been properly flashed with NDSMP. If you get "MAX Media Launcher" followed by , then NDSMP can't read "/_boot_mp.nds".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, that's interesting... I remember last night that I had put the MML in the DS with the unflashed GBAMP a few times, and it did what you said would happen, but one time it started to go to that screen, then stopped, kind of. It was only halfway revealing the words "Max Media Launcher" and so I turned it off. I don't remember it working after that...
<br/>
So has anyone heard of a MML (or any DS cart) stop working?
<br/>
<br/>
If it matters, I think my battery was low, but not so low that it was about to shut off.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes you do, for at least some DS save tools. They need to have the FAT in SLOT-2 so that they can read and write the serial flash or EEPROM in SLOT-1.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have a problem with a MAX Media Launcher or any other SLOT-1 device, first try cleaning it. The procedure is a bit more difficult than with a GBA Game Pak due to the plastic teeth between the contacts, but it's still doable.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have both a Games n' Music and a GBAMP V2 CF.  Before the DLDI, I ran homebrew on my GBAMP.  First, using GBA mode (no pass/mml device), you run the flashing program that flashes the GBAMP's internal firmware to allow reading of NDS files.  Then, insert the MML (or in my case, GnM without SD card, which acts as an MML/NoPass) and put a _BOOT_MP.nds file on the CF's root directory, and insert the GBAMP.  It will show the GnM (or MML) screen, but then go straight to running whatever's on the GBAMP (the _BOOT_MP.nds).<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, thanks guys. I tried cleaning the MML, and it worked for a little, then died. I guess I should've used that time to put on flashme, but meh. I ended up just going out and buying an Action Replay DS and using it to install flashme. Oh well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
