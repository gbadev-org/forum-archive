    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I understand you correctly from your post, you are referring to pirated ROMs, which is a tabu in this (homebrew development) forum. Go elsewhere to get help on that topic. If I don't, nevermind.
<br/>
Thank you.

Which games are you using? If you try <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/tod/" target="_blank">TOD</a>, does that work?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, it sounds to me that his old DS Lite had FlashMe installed and the new one doesn't, so on the new one he's only booting in GBA mode, which does not show *.nds files in the Games menu at all.
<br/>
<br/>
You need a passthrough device like a Superkey to boot it in DS mode so you can launch DS homebrew files.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
