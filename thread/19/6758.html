<br/>
I don't see a single change in the features list.  unless i find out for sure that there is an improvement, i don't see the point of flashing again. could this be misinformation?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Loopy released an updated FlashMe firmware patch to fix a very minor bug that no one even noticed.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">If your DS is flashed already:
<br/>
- there's probably no real need to update now</span>
<br/>
- you don't need to short SL1 to update your firmware
<br/>
<br/>
If your DS is not flashed already:
<br/>
- go ahead and flash it if you want
<br/>
- you do have to short SL1 to update your firmware
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to unflash your firmware:
<br/>
- grab noflashme.nds and flash your firmware
<br/>
<br/>
Check out the FlashMe website for downloads &amp; instructions:
<br/>

<br/>
The code to do the update seems to be compiled differently (perhaps a later version of ARM GCC or devkitPRO was used?), whatever the bug was it must have been minor or I'm sure someone like Loopy would have said something here by now... but I am curious too, as to what got changed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I dont think that the people doing the firmware updates have anything to do with microsoft... I did the update on my DS and it appears nothing has changed, all is well, although the time it took to flash the unprotected portion did seem to take longer than the last one (from splash screen to no splash screen update).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
