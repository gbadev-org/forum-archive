    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, check out this, about a week ago I got around to running FlashMe on my DS to upgrade from version 7, to 8. Now when I boot it up, half the time, it goes to GBA mode. Also, a lot of stuff has got corrupted, and most app's don't work.  And yes, I formatted my card twice. It's starting to really annoy me, so, anyone got any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you tried cleaning the GBA Movie Player's SLOT-2 contact with rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That worked once, but the ROM of my Boot loader wouldn't boot right. And after words it never worked again. I'm not sure if its a card error, or my GBAMP is breaking down.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
