    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello. I have a most likely simple question. I'm looking to get into the DS homebrew scene and was trying the find the cheapest price for the Superkey and Supercard-lite. <a href="http://www.psxbox.net" target="_blank">http://www.psxbox.net</a> seems to have the best prices for each. However, they have the English version of the Supercard-lite for $45 and the Chinese version for $40 (http://www.psxbox.net/?gOo=Z29vZHNfZGV0YWlscy5kd3Q&amp;goodsid=1419). Anyone know if selecting the Chinese one will just throw a ton of chinese language in the menus with no option to switch, or should I just play it safe and pay the five extra dollars. I have no clue what the interfaces for these look like.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Chinese version is in Chinese. It's a <span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span> region lockout, just as the lack of English text in Japanese RPGs is a region lockout.. But the GBA Movie Player v2 CF is cheaper at auction if you don't care about GBA homebrew or those few DS homebrew programs that require support for GBA ROM (e.g. TickleGirl and SnezziDS).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The chinese M3 won't let you install an english firmware unless you change the header but you have to do that for every firmware update and it can have bugs.  Does the Supercard have some protection against using a firmware from another region?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
