    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's also the EZ4 lite. I'll be getting that. It does stick out 1mm, but it's better than the 36mm sticking out that the M3 has. Plus the EZ4 will take removable/upgradeable flash media. I saw a pic of the G6 lite and it's soldered on flash chips (not user upgradeable)<br/>_________________<br/>2 x Enamel Blue DS lites V5, V7 FW whatever
<br/>
2 x EZ4 lite microSD adapters
<br/>
Both are FlashMe'd</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
