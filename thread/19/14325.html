    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since my Games n' Music's microSD slot died and if I can't get it replaced or repaired, I'm thinking of buying a different card.  The Games n' Music is a great card, but there's better cards out there to replace it with.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently thinking of either an R4DS, M3 DS Simply, or AceKard R.P.G.  I'm leaning toward the AceKard because it has extra features like USB (so I don't have to remove the microSD and therefore wear out the slot like on my GnM) and the internal flash memory.  I want to know how good these are at running homebrew.  How well do their DLDI files work, can they read files, write files, run popular apps, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I mainly want to run:
<br/>
MoonShell
<br/>
DSOrganize
<br/>
nesDS
<br/>
SNEmulDS
<br/>
Colors!
<br/>
Lameboy
<br/>
DSFile
<br/>
DSAIM
<br/>
<br/>
Mainly MoonShell and DSOrganize.  Does the Chishm loader work on these cards?  What about other loaders, such as MoonShell's loader.
<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, if it's permitted on this forum, where can I find these cards for the lowest price from a reputable retailer that won't take forever to ship it and not reply to e-mails like Datel did.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah fair enough. realistically with rpg, the nand memory is nice, but not exceedingly useful. it's inclusion seems partially linked to the better performance in NDS piracy, which obviously isn't relevant here.

<br/>
and open source? it's a matter of whether A: you want to develop the loader or B: you believe others will make valuable improvements.
<br/>
<br/>
personally i wouldn't have minded a games'n music, however it's slow access speed is significant enough as i do use my DS for multimedia too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I thought DSLinux was one of the only ones that didn't work? Or did they fix it already? anyway, i agree with you all the way. It's not only the easiest to use, but it's far more dependable than most other cards.
<br/>
<br/>
So far, I've tested all of the following work on CycloDS:
<br/>
<br/>
NitroTracker
<br/>
Moonshell
<br/>
DSOrganize (except bootloader, which shouldn't be used anyway)
<br/>
Colors
<br/>
SnemulDS
<br/>
NesterDS
<br/>
LMP (ipod clone)
<br/>
ComicBookDS
<br/>
BlipTracker
<br/>
DS MidiKeyboard
<br/>
NDSMail
<br/>
NitroHax
<br/>
dStar
<br/>
DiagNose
<br/>
<br/>
Homebrew games:
<br/>
fish tank DS
<br/>
DSchess
<br/>
skinzsudoku
<br/>
Lemmings DS
<br/>
<br/>
Commercial Games:
<br/>
All i've tested work!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Haven't tested DSLinux yet, but i think that works now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe DSLinux was fixed as of Firmware v1.2. I'm using v1.21 right now and it worked the last time I tried it. There's also a newer v1.22 that came out a couple weeks ago. I must say, I've really liked my CycloDS Evo as well. It runs pretty much everything I throw at it. Although, if I were to consider another card, the AceKard RPG sounds very interesting feature-wise.

I had to take out the spring and now the microSD always has the same stuff on it no matter how many times I format it, so I have been thinking of buying another Slot-1. From what I have discovered I would say the Cyclo DS Evolution or the SuperCard DS ONE, are both great choices. The teams seem to be on top of homebrew and are making sure that it works by providing fuctioning DLDI drivers and such.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't have my R4 yet, but I hear that they have a new edition without the spring. That was the main problem. G6 is good, but not expandable, so I can't pop in another micro, and have 2GB spare. slot 2s aren't as good because they use GBA loaders, but that's minor. I already have 1.9GB of music, videos, photos, ebooks, audiobooks, games, etc.. So my 2GB will be gone before I know it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
