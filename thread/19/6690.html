    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a RT2500 USB Wireless LAN Card (it's an integrated component of my computer) and i want to know if my card is compatible with wifi me.
<br/>
the problem is my card is'nt an usb card, and however, only the usb normal driver version works and windows thinks it's an usb card.
<br/>
on the tutorial it's specified than the usb version is RT2570, and PCI/PCMIA are RT2500/RT2600, so i don't know what think.
<br/>
thanks for your helps.

Many motherboards have internal USB ports called "headers", intended to be connected to wires that run to the front panel of a case. If your wireless adapter is connected to an internal USB header, then it'll look like a USB card instead of a PCI card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I don't think so. But are you sure it's an USB version ? All the integrated wifi card I've ever seen are either pci or mini-pci ones. A photo could help.
<br/>
<br/>
But if you have a desktop computer you could find suitable wifi PCI cards for less than 25$.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
