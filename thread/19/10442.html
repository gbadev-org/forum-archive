    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I am new on playing the nds programming and I am interested on the wifi function.
<br/>
<br/>
I bought a network card which is BELKIN F5D7010 (one of the model from the list) and followed the instruction to install the driver 1.0.0.8. and rt2560_app_wmb_1_4_beta_1.
<br/>
<br/>
I put a demo.nds into the data directory and tried to download it to my nds with the command "wmb -data demo.nds".
<br/>
<br/>
In my nds, I click on "DS Download Play", it can receive and show the title "demo". When I choose and try to download it, the antenna icon goes red and pop-up a message "communication error".
<br/>
<br/>
May I ask, is there anything I set wrong or missing...?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the patience to read these text...!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have a GN-WIKG, non-flashed DS and still can't load Demos.

I always get "Comunication Error. Download not Completed." message
<br/>
when trying to load a demo.

Driver 1.0.0.8 and the last version of WMB are used, but the program just

sits there at "Sending multiboot beacons &amp; waiting for authentication"

part...

<br/>
Then the DS just doesn't seem to download anything...
<br/>

Help? Please? It seems that i'm the only one that can't load demos.

Seeing the rate of success this has, it's strange that i can't do such a thing.

If you don't have a GBA flash card, well then your out of luck. The only downloads you can download to the ds are NDS RSA secured files from E3. If you get a flashcard. Then you can write the code to the flashcard and use wifime as a wireless passthrough for the ds. And you don't want DS lites version (firmware) because it's not compatible right now with wifime.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Eyeliner, what's the firmware version of your "phat" DS? Newer firmwares or at least the ones with updated chipsets suffer from the same problem. If you have firmware v5 or newer this may be the case. The good news is that by upgrading the firmware with FlashMe you might get the DS Lite brightness control (4 levels and clearly brighter than old DS screen) for your device. :)

Is there any dat file for the demos around? I had one a while back,

Sounds like your problem maybe due to interference. Change the channel that you use for WMB (do not know if this is possible under the Windows version).
