    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My GBAMP only boots in GBA mode :(

<br/>
I used to be able to reinsert it and it would boot fine, but now there is nothing I can do :(

<br/>
What could the problem be?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you aren't even receiving the NDS boot screen, then it's your PassMe/NoPass device.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why would it work sometimes just by reinserting it? Sometimes I just wiggled it a bit and it would boot correctly instead of GBA mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I just get GBA mode! Also, what does the following mean:
<br/>
<br/>
DS + Mario Kart DS + GBA cart = MKDS boots
<br/>
DS + Mario Kart DS + GBAMP = GBA mode boots
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using flashme v7, tested on both DS lite and Phat, used to work on both, tried a different CF card, _boot_mp.nds is on the root.
<br/>
<br/>
How do I reinstall the GBAMP firmware? When I go ahead with the GBA boot, it says my CF card is not formatted in FAT or FAT32 (It is) and I press start to continue, but it gives me black screens.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That sounds like a bad connection somewhere on the GBAMP.  It's time to take it apart and fix it or buy a new dev device.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As Sektor said, there is something wrong with the connection to the CF card. If the NDSMP firmware can't find _BOOT_MP.NDS on the card then it boots to GBA mode. It still has the PASS game code though, which is why it is automatically booted by flashme.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had the same problem :)
<br/>
I've just reformatted my card, and it worked then.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tried various CF cards with no good results. Sometimes when I insert it, I get two white screens, which I think is better than GBA mode :)
<br/>
<br/>
A quick look inside the cart didn't reveal any obvious malfunctions to my untrained eye.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Holy crap wtf, I just took it out and reinserted it and it WORKED. I was using DS AIM as the _BOOT_MP.nds
<br/>
<br/>
However, when I turned it off and back on, it booted in GBA again. ARGH.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT2: And now its working again (this time with DSOrganize) It really does seem to hinge on how its inserted. Is there anything I can do to make it more reliable?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT3: Now its working reliably on NDS Phat and Lite...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
