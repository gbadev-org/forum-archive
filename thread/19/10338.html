<br/>
<br/>
I bought mk4 mini bundle with neoflash 512mb but guess what those 2 things arent working together..
<br/>
<br/>
the multiboot menu isnt compatible with mk4 mini. so what i wanted to ask is there somewhere a different way to boot more files? has someone somewhere made a homebrew menu. or a universal menu
<br/>
<br/>
you would help me alot becouse i get sick of burning everything again after finished using it...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i reported tis but nobody has a solution
<br/>
<br/>
also i looked everywhere on google but still nothing so i was thinking meaby somebody has made a universal menu you know one that works as a program not menu from the flashcards.
<br/>
<br/>
i see so many great things are done so i was just thinking by myself (meaby) somebody did made one (kind a a menu) just something for multi boot files that is compatible with mk4 mini</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
