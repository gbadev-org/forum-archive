    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello. I recently installed flashme v6 (I was able to use the passkey1 setting on the passkey cartidge). I have been able to use it fine for a couple of days. However I tried a gba game and was getting garbled graphics and reset the ds. When I reset the ds it saved the game, but it wouldn't boot up. Now I only get dual white screens as long as I have the M3 perfect plugged in. I have tried wiping the sd card and that did not help. Any suggestions?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.
<br/>

Edit: I forgot to metion that I still have the problem even when using the passkey cartidge.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm posting this to help other that have this problem, since I found this problem in other forums and most of them did not have the answer. Incidentally, I found the basis for the solutuion at <a href="http://m3-forum.com/," target="_blank">http://m3-forum.com/,</a> although I had to do quite a bit of digging to find it.
<br/>
<br/>
The solution was to copy an m3 update to the sd card and (this part might be optional) the the BACKING directory. Specifically, I wiped the card(this might not be necessary), then I copied the updagcsd.e14 and BACKING directory to the card. After inserting everthing back into the ds, I then booted into gba mode (hold select down while turn the ds on and the select gba). I just followed the on screen instructions then.
