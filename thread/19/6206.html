Is the ppflash software and the associated schematic are capable of flashing the whole firmware? I want to replace the original firmware with the hacked one (FlashMe). FlashMe require either PassMe or WifiMe but I have neither a compatible wifi card nor a PassMe. 
<br/>
<br/>
My point is: If ppflash is capable of flashing the whole firmware, then I can flash the hacked firmware without PassMe or WifiMe. The next question is, where can I download the hacked firmware? Or, at least, a patch of it?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I do not know where to get the full firmware bins, but what the utility will do, is flash the first 3 sectors with the failsafe recovery code.  Once that is done, you would just then flash your DS by booting the failsafe recovery code.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are planning on using this utility,  you have to follow the directions included in the diagram,  including making sure that if your parallel port outputs 5V, that you use a signal translator, as the firmware chips are 3V parts, with ABSOLUTE MAX ratings of about 4V.  also, unlike use of passme/wifime to boot the DS for flashing, this WILL void your DS warrenty, as there will be evidence that you opened your DS.  At least with the Passme/wifime solution, As long as your careful,  you could restore the official firmware back to the DS, and nintendo would be none the wiser.  As such,  if you are not able to access a passme/wifime,  then I recommend to have it professionally done at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.aheadgames.com/xcart/customer/product.php?productid=17479&amp;cat=558&amp;page=1" target="_blank">Ahead Games</a>.  Once that is done,  future upgrades can be done without the need for passme/wifime.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You are right about the warranty... But I'm not in the US,  order anything from the US will cost me $$$ (just for shipping and mony transfer fee). I think I will go for a compatible wifi card. Thank you for your reply.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
