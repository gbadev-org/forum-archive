    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I finally made some progress with my very own Windows <b style="color:#FFA34F">driver</b> for my new wireless card. The DS (slave) now actually sends its player info to my PC (master). The authentication and association process seems to be stable. It also looks like the CF-POLL &amp; CF-ACK "flood" can be slowed down dramatically, which makes it easier to debug.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Made some progress but also have some bad news...
<br/>
<br/>
I was able to send the header, arm9 and arm7 binaries to my DS in "DS Download Play" mode. However, when I give the DS the "run game" command it displays the classic Nintendo logo on top, tries to fade out, then hangs. If I corrupt the logo in the header that I send to the DS, then the corrupted logo appears on the top screen. This means the header data is reaching the DS uncorrupted, and seeing as the arm9 and arm7 binaries are right behind the header, I am assuming they are also received by the DS without errors.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The problem with the DS hanging at the Nintendo logo screen has been fixed, I was sending the wrong ARM9 binary, which obviously failed the RSA signature check.

good = binary loaded, mario ds displayed "LOADING GAME DATA..."

For most of humanity, yes. However, I built myself a molecular computer using omegatron particles to compute at twice the speed of gravity back in the 60's that can crack it instantly. I wasn't born yet back then, but the device shifted into the past somehow when I put a coathanger next to it.  :p

Actually, the 512-bit key version of RSA encryption was cracked a while ago. They used something like 260 computers to do it..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1024 bit encryption is nothing to be scared of - follow the link to see information on creating a machine that can crack 1024 bit RSA in minutes.  It's pretty cheap too - just $1 Billion :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmm.. interesting. Also, I am wondering, what exactly is the DS downloading before your demo starts? There seems to be 2 loading screens with the first taking a REALLY long time.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i think you can speed up the time of that first loading screen.  are you just playing back a <b style="color:#FFA34F">download</b> capture?  
<br/>
<br/>
the thing about the way WMB works, is it wont actually start to send any *useful* data until the host DS says "start game", and then the <b style="color:#FFA34F">download</b> occures... so it looks like you have a decent amount of dead time os sending empty/unused packets.  
<br/>
<br/>
AFAIK, the initial WMB boot loader should only take about 1-3 seconds.

Just out of curiosity, does this bring wireless tunneling back in the realm of possibility?

I don't know how much faster it would be. The amount of memory you have to work with for PassMe'd code is (correct me if I'm wrong) about 4mb. So, even with overhead and packet loss, thats still pretty quick to transfer the code to the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, in my situation, I have to insert my GBA cart into my SP, plug it into the computer, burn the code onto the GBA cart, move the cart back into the DS, and then run the code. So, if I'm making a lot of changes to my code, it would be far more tedious to do it via cart than wireless.

Download play doesn't work because there is a big RSA encrypted signature of the downloaded code and we can't sign our code. Tim's new stuff does the same thing as the PassMe card - redirects execution to code loading from a GBA card. This is possible because the headers with the start addresses are pre encryption.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to know which GBA cards work check the separate thread about that. If it isn't mentioned in that thread then NOBODY KNOWS. You'll need to order a PassMe and check yourself.
<br/>
<br/>

Given what happened with multiboot on the GBA (led to F2A and EZFA cables and mass copyright infringement of GBA games), I'd guess that Niиtendo may have designed the hardware and the Firmware to put some restrictions on what a DS Download Play slave can do.

Of course the demos can use NiFi, and probably don't need to remain in contact with the host device (Unless the software checks for it, or has to remain in contact with the host at all times).

<br/>
Once the wifi hardware (and/or any bios api or nintendo library) has been figured out, it would of course be possible to put a wireless "loader" on the GBA cart.
<br/>
This loader can then download the real software from the PC.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing I don't understand is why people think passme hacks are limited to 4MBytes. The only limitation is the size of the GBA cart you use.
<br/>
The ARM9 can only execute code stored in the 4MByte RAM, yes, but the ARM7 can execute directly from the GBA cart if you want, and you can load any amount of additional resources (graphics, sounds, new ARM9 code, ... ) from the GBA cart to the 4MByte memory as you see fit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No. This driver has its own class, it is not an NDIS driver. Windows does not see the RT2560 card as a network adapter. It would also require a lot more code for handling communication with other 802.11 devices.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nice FAQ!
<br/>
<br/>
Brought me to buy the MSI PCMCIA Card for about 30 Euros and this evening my DS will play the first Homebrew-Software ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
But on question: I have only a 64Mbit F2A Card, can it soon be expected that Homebrew Software will exceed the Space of the Card?
<br/>
<br/>
I have also a 128Mbit Torbo Card, but, as for GBA Games, it ist incompatible with the DS, for it hangs up as the game starts, or short afterwards.
<br/>
<br/>
will homebrew-software work instead?

Good job on the tutorial.
<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that you installed the driver using the "Don't search. I will choose the driver the install." option. It is easier/faster to use "Search for the best driver in these locations." and "Include this location in the search".
<br/>
<br/>
Problem is that this will only work if your card's PCI vendor/device and subvendor/subdevice combination is listed in the INF file. This was not the case for your card, and Windows probably told you that it couldn't find any compatible driver in the given location. That is why you had to go through those extra steps and force Windows to use my driver. Hence, the "Update Driver Warning".
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the needed line for your card, the "LinkSys WMP54G v4", just put it somewhere in the [MSFT] section.
<br/>
<br/>
%RT2560.DRVDESC%=RT2560_Inst, PCI\VEN_1814&amp;DEV_0201&amp;SUBSYS_00321737
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else has this problem with a different card, please let me know so that I can update the INF file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you are not sure if your card has the RT2560 chipset, then download following program and check if the VID/PID is 1814/0201. If it's not then it uses another chipset.

<br/>
I did not have to start from scratch when I wrote my RT2560 driver. I used the PCIDRV example, a fully functional driver for an Intel 10/100 Ethernet card, from the Longhorn 4074 DDK as a starting point. It would take me another month, maybe less now that I have some experience, to write a driver for another chipset. Problem is that you need technical information on how that chipset works, information that is generally well guarded by the chipset manufacturer, thus making it impossible to write any custom driver whatsoever.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
the compatibility issue with regards to the chipset supported is purely down to the WifiMe application and nothing to do with the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Point being that if this app supported other chipsets then more wifi adaptors would instantly become compatible.
<br/>
<br/>
So people who've already got kit thats not instantly compatible shouldnt rush out and buy new stuff yet as there maybe a chance further compatibility. As is the way with newly released software. Especialy on PC's

If it's USB it's not going to work.  If it's 802.11b, then it isn't the RT25x0 chipset.  Either way, it won't work and most likely never will with WiFiMe.

Atheros in fact is not possible without some serious work reverse engineering the binary only HAL for the driver.  It does not expose the required amount of control.

You obviously don't understand how the PassMe works, maybe you should read up on it.  Until then, do not misdirect those who are just learning.
<br/>
<br/>
It is in-fact possible to run commercial games using a passme, and some other knowledge, but it is frowned upon because of legal issues.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Say, will the sources for the driver and the application be made public? I know it's kinda rude to ask for more when you've just released the binaries.
<br/>
But it could speed up the progress of getting a good method of running homebrew code and I bet that some compability issues could be solved too. 
<br/>
But you're probably already aware of that so I'm a bit curious about your opinion on the whole subject.

You need to be able to control the sequence numbers of the packets being sent.

It's not a driver mod, it's something in the binary HAL.  I checked the open HAL on BSD and it doesn't have control over that either.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Make sure you order it and make sure they have received it before you go to the store.
<br/>
Also; Often Mycom report that they have something in store on the webshop and it turns out to be false.
<br/>
Always order an item and wait for a confirmation that th item arrived to the store.

 Have you considered releasing the source of wmb.exe? Or even just a rough API of your <b style="color:#FFA34F">driver</b>? (Presumably, since it doesn't advertise itself to the system as a wireless network card, the API is very different.) Finding other uses for the technology (like the old Pictochat-to-irc gateway idea) would be a lot easier with an example program that uses it....

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now, I'm only slightly familiar with the theory behind windows drivers, however...
<br/>
<br/>
I was aware there is a windows feature to create "filter" drivers. Like, you could make a driver that gets put in the driver stack so that you could say, send/recieve certain types of raw data to/from all cdroms (used for some cd burning apps?). 
<br/>
<br/>
On that same note, would it be possible maybe, to write a filter driver that goes somewhere in the network stack, so that you could intercept and process all "NiFi" traffic from any wireless networking device (i think you could filter by MAC address, right?)
<br/>
<br/>
If i'm not completely off-base, that would solve a number of problems. Namely, you wouldn't need manufacturer specs for currently unsupported wifi cards (assuming the card is already supported by windows). Also, the wifi card could be used for regular networking (although I suppose performance would be degraded).
<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to take a crack at a simple test myself, but the DDK isn't free anymore :(
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll admit I don't know much about the way your driver arranges the packets for broadcasting to the DS, or the DS's wireless protocal at all for that matter.  But I would imagine that a Lucent/Orinoco or Intersil Prism driver shouldn't be too difficult to devise.  They have been open source for awhile now, and even the main Linux kernel has supported them for years.  Not to mention that an Orinoco Silver card can be found on ebay for about $10 - 20 these days.  These cards and chipsets have been out for years - Orinoco was one of the first 802.11b providers in the market and their commercial APs are still some of the best out there.  They've been proven as stable and flexible for most wireless applications, so I don't see how it would be too difficult to get <b style="color:#FFA34F">WiFime</b> to work.  But like I said I'm not at all familiar with the inner workings of the DS's wireless specs.
<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I'm just throwing that out there in case Tim or anyone else would be interested in expanding the compatibility of the driver to these very common cards.  I figure the more wireless cards that are compatible with this the more people can start developing and testing DS homebrew software.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's an F5D7000 which unfortunately has a BCM4306 chipset (Broadcom). It's a revision 3 card, so watch out for this specific type.
<br/>
<br/>
I found out that the chipset it uses has horrible vendor support, so that to this day no one was offered enough information to build a Linux driver for it. So my plan to check out the source to the Linux driver in an attempt to write my own DS-fiddling apps died.
<br/>
<br/>
On a more positive note, it appears that the card is acting up. Whenever I touch my screen, or my PC's case, I'm getting some strong electric zaps.

You were right! It was the grounding! The reason I didn't notice this was because I recently moved to a new house. While I suspected the recently aquired card to be the culprit, it thus was actually the old crappy wiring in this recently aquired 200,000$ dump. At my old place, I didn't have electricity on the second floor where the computer was located because of a burn-out, so I built my own extension wire which wasn't grounded eighter. However, I never noticed this "shocking" problem because I wasn't touching the actual ground with my feet, just the upstairs floor.
<br/>
<br/>
I temporarily fixed the problem by grounding the wall socket using an old coax cable.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm wondering if all the years of being nuked by this weird energy the monitor emmitted could be responisble for some of the unexplained neurological complaints I've being having for some years (buzzing in ears, nightblindess, unequal pupil sizes, bouts of confusion, auditory hallucinations, balancing problems, etc.).

Sounds kinda bad. did you reboot after the installation? are you sure windows really is trying to use the correct driver? 
<br/>
<br/>
As for that broadcom chipset it's not only a driver that is needed. For a card to be compitable with the wifime  you need to be able to send and recieve raw wifi packets, and there's several obstacles for this. For example your operative system. With a custom driver you can bypass the problem of getting the raw data to the device.
<br/>
But many devices modify the data before sending it out for special reasons. And this interference CANNOT be fixed with simply a driver I don't think it can be bypassed at all. 
<br/>
<br/>
The question "Can you make my card compitable with the device?" seems to come back once every page, if things are still unclear please read the enitre thread and I guarantee your enlightment. And if you refuse I can simply give you the answer you'd potentially belive:
<br/>
<br/>
"No you card &lt;insert model here&gt; cannot and will never be compitable with the wifi boot method."

Did you verify the VID/PID with PCITree? It should be 1814/0201. If that is the case (I hope for you it is) then try following steps:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Unpack custom driver zip file.
<br/>
2. Delete winxp\rt2560.sys
<br/>
3. Rename winxp\rt2560.sys.checked to winxp\rt2560.sys
<br/>
4. Download DebugView (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/debugview.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/debugview.shtml</a>)
<br/>
5. Run DebugView
<br/>
6. Install custom driver ("checked" version, see step 2/3)
<br/>
7. Copy all driver debug output from DebugView and paste it to <a href="http://www.rafb.net/paste" target="_blank">http://www.rafb.net/paste</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My notebook has locked up completely a few times since installing a Belkin F5D7010au v3 PCMCIA card into my Toshiba A70. The flashing worked fine and everthing and the crashes are completely random ie. Not even while flashing or any 'apparent' wireless activity is occuring. Although the lights appear to stay on all the time even with the DS is switched off, is that normal?
<br/>
<br/>
I got it today for this FlashMe 'operation' so I havn't installed any other driver (not that that should matter), so I've removed the card and will only put it in when I need it.
<br/>
<br/>
But looks like a bug in the driver, unfortunately it completely locks up so I can't provide any debug info or anything. It totally freezes the mouse and everything.
<br/>
<br/>
I have never experienced this behaviour before installing the driver.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The RT2560 and RT2460 are very similar chipsets. The work involved in creating a RT2460 driver based on the RT2560 one will be minimal. However, the development of a driver usually requires hardware, and no hardware means no (or a crappy, maybe non-working) driver.

What do you think? Having it Linux based would make it easier for people to make drivers, and a very basic version could easily be fit on a floppy.

Anyhow, back in MY days, a good old 5.25 inches floppy could only hold up to 360k. Some time later they supersized them to fit 720.

Yes, there is a working *NORMAL* linux driver for the RT2560 chipset. What I need is a *MODIFIED* linux driver that allows you to send (2mbps) and receive raw 802.11 frames from user mode, and do other things, see device.c in my "echo" app.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh, and doing research on the subject, I found an interview with you, where you said that writing the driver was easy because of examples in the DDK and the official Linux driver.

Just a warning:  you might find that the Linux kernel doesn't expose an interface that's sufficient to do what he's doing.  I.e., there may not be the necessary syscalls available... this is just a hunch, of course, but it's something to look out for.  After all, the driver just plugs into the network device layer in the kernel, so if this thing is going to run in user-mode, it's going to have to use the published interfaces (i.e., syscalls).  If this is the case, you'll have to create a new set of syscalls to expose the necessary interfaces, and I have no idea what's involved in that, or if it's even possible to do from the driver layer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm going to bet....No. I take it you want to plug the GBA cart into the NDS, and use WiFiMe to write to it using the NDS? With the current firmware release this should be impossible. I don't think it even is possible for the NDS to do a full write of data to the GBA cart, just game saves, and I'm not sure if we even have code for that yet (do we?).
<br/>
<br/>
If it is possible it might matter which GBA cart you have too. I've seen comments here and there that seem to hint that some carts have a writable portion which the NDS can use.
<br/>

Only because 1. the 802.11b chip hasn't yet been figured out, and 2. we haven't yet found a buffer overflow in a commercial game's DS Download Play binary. We'll need such a buffer overflow in order to boot unsigned code on a Nintendo DS with stock firmware without a flash cart.

In GBA mode, the Nintendo DS has to write to GBA ROM space to get EEPROM saving to work. In DS mode, the Nintendo DS has to write to GBA ROM space in order to get the rumored "option paks" to work.

And I have some other kind of wireless on my laptop, it'd be nice to have a driver for that too, but Firefly there has done a lot of good work here already, and I would not want to bother him with the asking him to make drivers for every single wireless chipset in existence.  :P  Instead, I thank him for the awesome work he's already done.

That being said, my new ralink wireless card is in the mail.  I can't wait, that coupled with the next firmware update is a very nice thing indeed.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, netgear don't make any cards with ralink chipset.  With a compatible wifi card, you don't need a flash cart to run signed commercial demos but you do if you want to run homebrew or flash your firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It looks quite similar, and both have the proper form factor. I think the one you linked just has a larger plate over the card, and the one off the Gigabyte site has minimal plating over it. It could be the same card, same chipset, different plating, but that's the best I can say, and without guarantee. I think it's likely to work, but unless someone else can confirm that the one at newvisions tests out, there's a risk it won't.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've been getting similar behaviour with a Belkin PCMCIA card (and latest driver), I didn't realise it was after hibernation mode, I thought it was just randomly happening.

Or get the verifier to check only part of the message. Once we reverse-engineer the way SM64DS's WMB stub or one of the other official WMB multiplayer slave programs receives its assets, we can get the verifier to check only the stub and not check the corrupted assets that we send it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
i really hope you can help me, as i bought a wlan card especially for WifiMe.
<br/>
<br/>
I Have a problem with WifiMe: When i try to upload demos with WifiMe it keeps saying:
<br/>
"error: could not load "header.bin"" and "ds_multiboot_master_init__failed" and "ds_multiboot_master__failed".
<br/>
<br/>
What to do about this? I think i need a full example of the folder structure that someone uses who made this working.
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, but there's a second problem: I even made it sometimes anyhow to get DSPaint onto the DS bt when Download-Play ends and the program shall start it only shows white screens with the black logo and it seems to want to fade away as it gets gray, but when it got gray the program freezes.
<br/>
<br/>
Can you hepl me about this? Do you need any additional info from me?
<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards,
<br/>
<br/>

I saw people writing "Flash this file to your gba cart and boot it using PassMe/WifiMe" but the only way to run something seems to be putting it into the data folder from the wifime the folder. But is there really a way to load something onto the GBA Flash Card (i use "Supercard" as the flash cart, that's the name of the cart i mean) and then boot the file using WifiMe?

I have one file like that...the old OLD polarium demo.  Assuming all of these files are essential, one would need these files:
<br/>
<br/>
arm7.bin (arm7 code)
<br/>
arm9.bin (arm9 code)
<br/>
beacons.bin
<br/>
header.bin (game header...icon and whatnot that shows on the Download screen)
<br/>
rsa.bin (the rsa signature...this will be found **ONLY** in 'official' demos provided by Nintendo and other game companies)
<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to, most if not all of these can be obtained by using NDStool on one of the NDS files floating about.  Can't remember the exact command, but start up NDStool and it should tell you.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That is what happens when you upload unsigned code to a non-flashme ds. You need to install flashme first by using a *real* gba flash cart and either passme/<b style="color:#FFA34F">wifime</b>.

If each step of the 2^33 operations could be done in one clock cycle on a FPGA running at 100MHz, you would need about 24 hours for all 2^33 steps. This is without parallelization. If parallelization is possible, this can be reduced by puting multiple units onto the FPGA.

<br/>
Are you sure it can be done in 2^33 steps? Article says this:

We also implemented the

attack on SHA-1 reduced to 58 steps and found real collisions with less than 2^33
<br/>
hash operations. In a way, the 58-step SHA-1 serve as a simpler variant of the full
<br/>
80-step SHA-1 which help us to verify the effectiveness of our new techniques.

So it seems that the 2^33 are not for the "full" SHA-1. Is the DS SHA-1 the full 80-step SHA-1?

<br/>
<br/>
Do you need a flash cart or modified firmware to run the Nintendo E3 demos and the like located <a class="postlink" href="http://www.akkit.org/DS/E3/" target="_blank">here</a>, or can you do this with only a DS and compatible WiFi card.
<br/>
<br/>
Either way I plan on buying one sooner or later, but right now the cost of the card is out of my reach, haveing just dished out $250 on PC parts.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I orderd a MSI MP54G4, which isn't on the compatibility list(The MP54G2 was) but acccording to the pictures I have seen of it has the correct chipset, I should be able to varify wether or not it works when I get it in a few days, only $20 at newegg and looks like a good solution for laptop users if it works.

For the official demos, you only need a compatible WiFi card, the DS does not have to be FWFlashed or use a PassMe/GBACart.

To run homebrew code through WiFi you need to flash your firmware.

Yet its already half of the work to get the private key :p
<br/>
<br/>
n and e makes the public key,
<br/>
n and d is all info needed for the private key.
<br/>
<br/>
Now "just" build d  :P
<br/>
<br/>
For anyone interested in this:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>n = p * q
<br/>
where p &amp; q are the large primes to build the key. (if known it'd be easy to recover the private key)
<br/>
<br/>
</li><li>t = lcm(p-1,q-1)
<br/>
<br/>
</li><li>(e*d) % t = 1
<br/>
<br/>
</li><li> cyphertext c of m is defined as c = (m)^d &lt;=&gt; m = (c)^e
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
n and e are known. The remaining values are needed. (espacially d = 1/e under modulo t)
<br/>
<br/>
It helps that a bit that we know :
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>precission of p has to be ~ precission of q.
<br/>
</li><li>precission of (p*q)=n is == precission of p + precission of q
<br/>
</li><li>be m1 and m2 data and their encryption already known, then we know the encryption of a 3rd message: (m1)^d * (m2)^d = (m1*m2)^d
<br/>
</li><li>e does not divide n with a remainder of 0. =&gt; d*n is not ordinal
<br/>
</li><li>e is odd (unless the RSA-algorithm would be sure that t is odd, but as t is created through random p,q and lcm its unlikely - d would not exist for e=even and t = even)
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>

RSA is an asymmetric encryption system. Public key is known and should be in the firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
The hard part is the private key. Perhaps quantum computers will make cracking 1024-bit RSA possible, but don't even try it with current computers...

a public key is always the one known to more then just the owner of the private key. As both keys are basically aquivalent if both known:
<br/>
<br/>
Say rsap is the private encryption and rsaP the public. Then
<br/>
<br/>
rsap(rsaP(message))  = (message)^d)^e  % t = (message)^(e*d)= ((message) ^e)^d  % t = rsaP(rsap(message))
<br/>
<br/>
where e = public key, and d = private key
<br/>
<br/>
so basically all that is different in both keys is which one is given out to determinate if its public or private. As we know it, i'd say its the public one :p. The difficulty to do the real transforming from e to 1/e=d is that its really hard to calc in a modulo you dont know. ;)

either you missed something or I did :)

let me explain.

this key is 1024bit in size, but it consist of two part, (with your notation) e and t. so both (e and t) have 512bit each.

e is prime*prime, this means that each prime is about 256bit in size and this numbers like that had been allready factorised in the RSA challange.

<br/>
Wrong. In the beginning there were two 512-bit prime numbers (p &amp; q) that, when multiplied, became the 1024-bit public key (n). There also is a 1024-bit private key (d) which is actually used as exponent when signing. The public key is used in both signing and verifying process as the modulus. The exponent used to verify the signature (e) is 0x10001. If we know p &amp; q, for example by factoring n, then we can calculate d, which is closely related to p, q and e, and sign our own binaries. However, this is not going to happen any time soon.
<br/>
<br/>
sign = (1024-bit message ^ 1024-bit private key) % 1024-bit public key
<br/>
verify = (1024-bit signature ^ 0x10001) % 1024-bit public key

so the link I got was not really correct, 'cause it does not inlcude the whole key?

could then someone post both parts of the public key plz.

Wrong. Here's the original source code, written/released by me so that others could steal it. As you can see, and already mentioned before several times, the public key is 1024-bit. If "both parts of the public key" was known, then we'd be able to calculate d and sign binaries ourselves.

you cannot sign and verife just with the two public parts, you need the privat part too. as Mighty Max mentioned before, there is 
<br/>
bar=foo^d%t
<br/>
and
<br/>
foo=bar^e%t
<br/>
if you have the two public parts, "d" and "t", you still miss the "e".

If you know the "two public parts", the two primes that make up the public key, namely p and q, then you can calculate d, the private key, which is used as an exponent, and sign. Both p and q are not known and usually discarded because they are not being used directly in the sign/verify process, hence why one has to factor n in order to obtain them.

the "two public parts" are not the primes that made the public keys ;) either it would be very useless to sign something if you release the two primes. I mean the d and t. but ok, now I understood that d==t. it was never like that in the "theory" where I learned RSA :)

Shouldn't WLAN go further than some meters? Is it because of the driver? Or could the Bluetooth dongle (but I already tried without it) and wireless keyboard and mouse be the problem?

I can't really recommend any particular antenna, but generally higher gain = better. Also make sure it is non-directional (works the same in all directions), otherwise you will get black spots in your signal. 
<br/>
Really, anything is better than the small antenna attached to the card hidden (from the DS's view) by the case of your computer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a few questions, sorry if they've already been answered.  I really don't have time to read through 32 pages, my apologies.
<br/>
<br/>
1)  I have a compatible PCI card and a compatible PCMCIA card that I use in my laptop.  I was recently at a convention, where I was hosting DS demos for the convention goers.  At the place, there was a WHOLE LOT of wireless communication.  I was using dovoto's DS Server program for windows and WMB 1.4 as the backend.  Overall, it worked fairly well, with some issues.
<br/>
<br/>
The main problem was that the program repeatedly got confused.  It needed me to constantly monitor it, and kill it when it froze.  It would sometimes get hung up when uploading, and freeze around 40 or 50%.  It would also sometimes get an authentication, but not actually upload anything (this was VERY frequent (about 20% of the time)).  There would also be the odd case where it would be uploading, and would recieve a de-authentication request.  Any chance that these bugs can be fixed, or changed to allow for automatic hosting?
<br/>
<br/>
Another problem that seemed to be by design was that I could only serve one DS at a time, and everyone else would get communication errors while that DS was being served.  I also could not run the program on multiple threads...  Any chance it could be modified to allow serving multiple units at once?
<br/>
<br/>
2)  My second question is much more complex...  is there any possibility that this program could be ported to Linux?  Barring that... anyone know how to flash an X-ROM flash cart from Linux?  :)  GBA/DS Development is pretty much the only reason I keep Windows around, and it would be nice to completely remove Windows from my laptop.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I'm new to all this DS tweaking, and since i had a linksys/ralink chipset adapter, i wanted to use wifime.
<br/>
so the <b style="color:#FFA34F">driver</b> thing works, but it's the wmb that crashes on me, saying it's unable to load the header.bin file in the wifime.zip archive.
<br/>
<br/>
so i'm kinda stuck here, i have absolutely no idea of wether it's a bad archive problem (although i downloaded it 10 times from the only site that gives it...) or a <b style="color:#FFA34F">driver</b> problem, which shouldn't be since it's a WMP54G...

Linksys Wireless G PCI Card WMP54G
<br/>
<br/>
The Linksys Wireless-G PCI Adapter installs in most desktops and lets you put your computer almost anywhere in the building, without the cost and hassle of running network cables. Now you don't have to drill holes in your walls and climb through the attic or cellar to get connected to the network. Once you're connected, you can keep in touch with your e-mail, access the Internet, use instant messaging to chat with friends, and share files and other resources such as printers and network storage with other computers on the network.
<br/>
<br/>
The Wireless-G PCI Adapter connects you with Wireless-G networks at an incredible 54Mbps! And for added versatility, it can also inter-operate with all the 11Mbps Wireless-B (802.11b) products found in homes, businesses, and public wireless hotspots around the country. And in either mode, your wireless communications are protected by industrial-strength Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), so your data stays secure.
<br/>
<br/>
So don't hassle with running cables through your house ? get your desktop connected the easy way with the Linksys Wireless-G PCI Adapter.
<br/>
<br/>
Features: 	
<br/>
<br/>
    * Operates in the 2.4GHz frequency spectrum with data rates of up to 54Mbps
<br/>
    * Complies with IEEE 802.11g standard, and backwards compatible with IEEE 802.11b
<br/>
    * products
<br/>
    * Up to 128-bit WEP encryption
<br/>
    * 32-bit PCI interface
<br/>
    * Compatible with Windows 98SE, Millennium, 2000, and XP
<br/>
    * Wireless-G (802.11g) connectivity for your desktop PC
<br/>
    * Incredible data rates up to 54Mbps in the 2.4GHz radio band
<br/>
    * Also interoperates with Wireless-B (802.11b) networks at 11Mbps
<br/>
    * Put your PC wherever you want, with no cabling hassle

DSE 802.11b Wireless LAN PCI Card
<br/>
<br/>
Easy way to add 11Mbps WiFi networking to desktop PC's
<br/>
<br/>
Throw away cables!
<br/>
This 802.11b Wireless Network Card for PCI capable PC's is an easy way to connect to or set up a wireless network. It's a cost effective, easy to install solution for sharing Internet access, files, music, printers and a whole lot more.
<br/>
<br/>
Industry compatible WiFi
<br/>
Its simple ? if you are considering expanding your wireless network with products like access points, routers, print servers, etc, then look for the WiFi logo. Its your assurance that what you are buying will work with what you have got!
<br/>
<br/>
Proven Technology
<br/>
Using 2.4GHz Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) technology, this adaptor transfers data at speeds up to 11Mbps. It supports 64⁄128-bits Wired Equivalent Protection (WEP) algorithm for added network security. Both Ad-Hoc and Infrastructure modes are supported.
<br/>
<br/>
Will 11Mbps be fast enough?
<br/>
Many people are now using wireless networking to share an Internet connection, data files and perhaps a common printer. For the bulk of this work, 11Mbps is going to be more than enough. Some users who want to network the very latest graphic intensive games and move large volumes of data may find the speed unsuitable and should consider faster standards like 802.11g.
<br/>
<br/>
Removable &amp; replaceable antenna (DSE ExtRa range compatible!)
<br/>
Featuring an industry standard RP-SMA connector, the supplied antenna simply unscrews allowing you to add a Wireless Booster or higher gain antenna. This leads to greater range and⁄or a more pinpointed coverage to ensure the signal reaches only those who need it.
<br/>
<br/>
A highly integrated cost effective solution direct to you
<br/>
By utilising the very latest silicone integration techniques, production costs are reduced while feature sets increase. Added to this is the knowledge that all DSE products are purchased in volume, directly from the manufacturer and are supported by a nationwide network of retail outlets.
<br/>
<br/>
Why a swap-out warranty?
<br/>
We know how important your network is. The last thing you want is to be left high and dry waiting for a resolution. All DSE networking products carry our 1 year swap out hardware warranty. In the unlikely event of product failure, simply return the product to your nearest outlet with your receipt where we will swap it out with a direct replacement, it's nearest equivalent or we will refund your purchase.
<br/>
<br/>
Features: 	
<br/>
<br/>

This isn't on the compatibility list, but since I have the RT2500 drivers, I thought that at a pinch it may work. There's also a bit of a price difference, but please let me know. Also, the top one as listed isn't a "v4" like the compatibility list says, so it appears as if it's an original. Would this matter, also?

Alright, this is all I can dig up. The gigabyte one is in the compatibility list, with no "depending on revision" star. The WMP54G Linksys isn't a v4, but could it be updated so that it works? And also, the MicroNet seems to be another which is under the compatibility list without suspicious revision business.

Lastly(these aren't in order of what I'm describing, either), the CNet depends on card revision/version.(I'm not too sure of what this means.)

gba rom as in a game made for running on the gameboy advance? no, not psosible.

<br/>
or gba rom, as in a .ds.gba file, which is a .nds file with a loader prepended to work from flashcarts? in this case, there is a chance it will work, but sometimes it's not possible due to the way the app was written. you can use this tool i wrote: <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=5768&amp;highlight=pme2nds" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=5768&amp;highlight=pme2nds</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It refers to the 'data' directory in the WMB folder....basically, -data "file.nds" is the right way to use it, with file.nds being an NDS in the data folder.  Basically, you're not telling the WMB program what you want to send, so it's confused.
<br/>
<br/>
You can also use a folder name in the data folder (instead of the name of an NDS) with all the files that make up an NDS contained in it, as in the case of the <b style="color:#FFA34F">WiFiMe</b> NDS program.  Generally you don't need to use it in this way though.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To use <b style="color:#FFA34F">WiFiMe</b>, you need a GBA cart...it's basically like a virtual PassMe.

As far as I can tell, that FAQ answer is wrong. You are not supposed to double-click wmb.exe; instead you're supposed to use the command prompt: <span style="font-weight: bold">wmb -data official_demo.nds</span> or (if you have old firmware) <span style="font-weight: bold">wmb -data <b style="color:#FFA34F">wifime</b></span><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

If you mean the list at <a href="http://ralink.rapla.net," target="_blank">http://ralink.rapla.net,</a> that list isn't specifically cards that are compatible with Nintendo DS developer software like WMB, it's just a list of adaptors that use the RT2500 chipset.  They have other lists there for other chipsets.  But on the pages for the WMB utilities it specifically says that the card you use has to be PCI or PCMCIA, not USB.  So it has to be on that list <span style="font-weight: bold">and</span> it has to not be USB.  The reason for that is because accessing a device over USB is much different from accessing a PCI or PCMCIA device.  I imagine it'd be possible to create a WMB-capable driver that works with the USB version of the device, but it's not work that's been done yet.<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC
<br/>
I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.

flashme through wifime: if you only have a wificard: no

wifime loads a homebrew from a flashcard!

instead of a ralik, you could also write drivers for other cards, but not all wificards, because you have to do some low level stuff, wich isn't available on all cards. till now, now other cards than ralink are supported.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

and you call yourself a hacker lol, but yeah it would. the signature is basicly suming up all the parts of the code.

its like a math problem, when you devide...

because the anwser could be more then one thing...

it could be 20/4 for all you know...

and say you were to add to the math problem(or in this example the .nds)
<br/>
10 / 2 + 1, the anwser changes...

wifime has a signature,
<br/>
and the way it works is it uses a header that is not put into the signature(in fw4 and up it is &gt;.&lt;;)
<br/>
thats why wifime works on a non-flashed ds...

<br/>
A WMB transfer is done in four parts. These are the RSA header, the NDS header, the ARM9 code and the ARM7 code. The NDS header and ARM code are covered by the RSA check so you cannot alter them without the DS rejecting the download.
<br/>
The RSA header has the RSA signature and the address of where to store the NDS header and ARM code and the addresses of where to start executing for both the ARMs. There is a small amount of data in the header that is not used and so can be set to whatever you like.
<br/>
Some clever people (I do not know who did this) worked out that you could stick some ARM code in here to hold the ARM9 in a loop and change the ARM9 execution address to this code and the ARM7 to execute from the GBA slot, allowing homebrew to run.
<br/>
Therefore you can turn any properly signed WMB transfer into wifime by knobbling the RSA header.
<br/>
What firmware 4 plus did was to ignore the execution addresses in the RSA header and use the ones from the NDS header.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well excuse me for not knowing everything. I just figured maybe some part of the header would define the executable size, and it would only bother to verify that much of the data, since as far as Nintendo would have known at the time, there'd be no way to exploit anything by adding more to the end. Most programs don't care if you add useless data to the end of a file, as long as the file's header has some information to tell how big the file should be (for example, bitmap images).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That list of compatible cards is not maintained by any of us. What has happened is that there are newer chipsets being added to that list, and Firefly doesn't update his site (don't blame him though). So only the cards in the first table (the long one) will work. The additional tables for RT2501 Turbo, USB, and RT2600 MIMO XR cards use different chipsets altogether.
<br/>
<br/>
We can't do anything about this table. It is still the most accurate resource we have in tracking down the right cards. You just need to pick cards from the PCI and PCMCIA columns in the first table, and be aware that the * incidicates that only certain releases will work for those particular cards.
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, try finding what card you need based on knowing only that you want this chipset: <a href="http://www.ralinktech.com/prod-2.htm" target="_blank">http://www.ralinktech.com/prod-2.htm</a><br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't have the Nintendo USB pen, so i'm using D-Link DWL-G122 v.c1
<br/>
I have Knoppix 4.02 and windows XP, tried with Windows and i was told that USB don0t work in Windows, so I got Knoppix, and I used a file that i got from the explanation site how to use Wifime with Knoppix and wnet to the file creator site (http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/rt2570.php) but that file is only ready to Nintendo USB pen, for other usb wifi pen you have to change the content, now, this is the problem, i can't change the cotent and I don't know what to do next, I mean, I don't know what steps to take.
<br/>
Can you be more specific about the protocol, I dont know what you're talking about.

Thanks for the patience and thank you very much for helping me.

That list of compatible cards is not maintained by any of us. What has happened is that there are newer chipsets being added to that list, and Firefly doesn't update his site (don't blame him though). So only the cards in the first table (the long one) will work. The additional tables for RT2501 Turbo, USB, and RT2600 MIMO XR cards use different chipsets altogether.
<br/>
<br/>
We can't do anything about this table. It is still the most accurate resource we have in tracking down the right cards. You just need to pick cards from the PCI and PCMCIA columns in the first table, and be aware that the * incidicates that only certain releases will work for those particular cards.
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, try finding what card you need based on knowing only that you want this chipset: <a href="http://www.ralinktech.com/prod-2.htm" target="_blank">http://www.ralinktech.com/prod-2.htm</a></span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

The first quote above did not mention the list of compatible cards. He was talking about a specific card which had a product page from newegg.com which was linked to in this <a class="postlink" href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php#faq" target="_blank">tutorial</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
And he's quite right that the link needs to fixed/updated. The tutorial says to get the WPKG, but links to the WP01GS. I just bought the wrong card as well. The WP01GS is not in the list of compatible wireless adapters, but the WPKG is listed. To add insult to injury, while checking if this link was indeed incorrect, I found that the card eXpired and I bought in vain has gone down in price since I paid for it 4 days ago.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

People, please email me this info directly when the links go bad.  I am more than willing to keep the links up-to-date if you just tell me so.  You can find my email address on the main page.  I'll see what I can do about updating them now.

EDIT:
<br/>
1) I just added links to Froogle searches.  This is better when it comes to links changing, but maybe not as good if the results aren't 100% accurate.

2) Sorry, BTW, for those of you who got the wrong cards.  I blame it on NewEgg.com.  If you search the site for that model, you get the wrong one.

You need to specify the logo when assembling the .nds with ndstool, using the -o command line switch:
<br/>
<br/>
-o /path/to/something.bmp
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to have it in a demo, you'd have to extract it and then put it back together again with the logo I think.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I had to encrypt the secure area of the .nds file I created with ndstool version 1.29 otherwise wmb wouldn't load it.  Could that have something to do with it?  I have firmware 3, does the ndstool encrypt the secure area with a later firmware version?  I heard this partial fade/hang phenomenon can be caused by incompatible firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I'm wondering is if the rsa.bin file in the wifime data directory has something to with this.  I doubt it because wmb transfers the .nds file to 100%.  But if it is the problem, is there a way to incorporate the rsa.bin when I build the .nds file?  When I encrypt the secure area can I specifically choose to use the rsa.bin file?

The Windows version of WMB doesn't work with DS Lites, basically.

I thought since Encore only has one wireless PCI adapter on their website, this would be the correct one. But it uses the Realtek RTL8185 chipset.
<br/>
<br/>
And it also locks up my PC...

At least it should only be $1 after rebate.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I've been out of it for a while - now I come back and find that NoPass exists and there's all these great Slot-1 products using it.  So, I have a question about how NoPass relates to WMB.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, my understanding is that NoPass works because it is signed code.  (I don't know if that means people can sign any piece of code they want, now, or if it just means that they found <span style="font-style: italic">one</span> working combination of code + signature and called it "NoPass")  I want to know if it's now possible to sign homebrew code and send it over WMB to a stock DS - or if it's possible to send NoPass code over WMB to boot slot-2, at least.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your patience as I get back up to speed.<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC

No. NoPass works because it is properly encrypted with a symmetric cipher, the details (including secret keys) of which were derived from a dump of the BIOS. It does not carry a DS Download Play signature, which uses asymmetric (public key) encryption.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It's sure not that simple. It would take at most this many attacks:(From my calculations)
<br/>
~360,000,000,000,000 attacks.
<br/>
<br/>
The only way to use WiFiMe now is to flash your DS with FlashMe, but that voids the warranty.(You can flash it without a card, as long as you can use WiFiMe on your PC)

I think you're confusing Wifime with WMB.  WMB is the wireless multiboot system that lets you send .nds binaries to the DS via Download Play.  Normally it only works with official RSA-signed demos.  Wifime is a way of using WMB to boot a slot-2 device in DS mode, and it only works on DS systems with firmware 3 or below.  You could use Wifime to install FlashMe, which would let you send homebrew files to your DS through WMB if you wanted.  Good for developers, not quite so convenient for end-users.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's correct. In lots of places on the net, WifiMe refers to WMB, not the real thing. That's why I said what I said. I do know what WMB and WifiMe are, however.
<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't it be possible, to make the WifiMe binary to jump to the un-RSA signed portion of the binary, and cause a jump to SRAM from there?
<br/>
The execute addresses from WMB would be set to this unsigned portion,
<br/>
which is located immediately after the header. Then, the DS would execute some code, which would jump to SRAM.(This region is ~8KB, at least in the Meteos demo. I don't know about the Mario 64 bootloader though)
<br/>
<br/>
I found that estimate I did was way off...

I have Windows, not Linux... I guess I'll try VMWare... But, I guess that means that means the whole system would be running as Linux...(Obviously hardly anything I have supports Linux... )

But, I'll probably have to download Linux in it's entirety, and with Dial-Up...

About the booting problem: Are they not passing the RSA-check? Or, is there a data transfer problem? I have some experience with WMB, so I might be able to do something about it...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not completely out of topic, but i just wanted to say it works flawlessly for the official demo (i haven't flashed my ds yet). wmb v1.5.2 + <b style="color:#FFA34F">driver</b> 1.0.0.8 + frontend 1.3 and hockey techdemo. It just works. When it did, i just felt like the first time i made my phone ring using svsip... Amazing what technology can do ! Happy happy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Great!  I'm glad I was wrong about that.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's more of a matter of switching OSes... It would be wonderful to have my old computer running an OS that doesn't crash so much.(It's usually this Win98 third-party <b style="color:#FFA34F">USB</b> Mass Storage <b style="color:#FFA34F">driver</b> that crashes however. But with Linux such a <b style="color:#FFA34F">driver</b> would probably come with it!)
<br/>
Also, it would be nice to have an OS that would work on both of my computers, at least in the OS aspect.
<br/>
<br/>
I could download Linux with my aunt's DSL however...(But I'd have to wait till Easter...)
<br/>
<br/>
I have some questions about Linux. Click <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=150494#150494" target="_blank">here</a> to help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I am trying to do something similar but for linux.  If you would be nice enough to help me out it would be greatly appreciated!!!
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to send me it but don't want the others to see you can send it to my email ( pm me for it... ) or if you don't want to at all I'll go on my own adventures.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks...
<br/>
I'll check back eventually!
<br/>
just depends on how long &gt;_&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
