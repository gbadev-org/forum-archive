<br/>
<br/>
i've run into some problems lately when running games off the M3 CF card in a DS Lite:
<br/>
<br/>
DS originals work flawlessly, GBA originals work too, but running DS backups seem to randomly crash the game. I've updated to latest firmware (22f), but still happening, in every game tested.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried on an unlit DS (non lite), and after some initial testing the games seem to work (not too exhaustive testing, may need a bit more).
<br/>
Also, since the problem started, im getting random "write PSRAM failed" messages when booting backups.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried reformatting the CF (both fat and fat32) and reverting to older firmware, but still doesn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
Seems it could be an error with the M3 device; any way to check out?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Checkout the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9484" target="_blank">forum rules</a>. No backup talk. Since original games (I'm assuming this means homebrew) work, your device is fully capable as far as this board is concerned.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
