    <h4>#101143 - LunaticStrain - Sun Sep 03, 2006 4:12 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello. I've recently tried to install WiFiMe. Here's my problem. I went and bout a Wireless Adapter, one of the ones on the list. Linksys' WMP54G v4. I tried just putting the Adapter in my computer, then running the Add/Remove hardware and selecting the driver, and it installed, but it said this device cannot start. Well, after a while I tried installing the official software, then add New Hardware and choosing the downloaded Driver. However, everytime I bring up wmb.exe (through Run/cmd, as when I just double click it the window closes too fast) it says error: parameter -data is required. I've tried just adding -data (wmb.exe -data) but I get error: unknown or incomplete parameter "-data". I checked PCITree and VID is 1814. When I go to Decive Manager and click on properties for DS Ralink properties, it gives me this: This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device. (Code 31).
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This won't help with your driver issues, but if you want to use WMB for demos, you need to use <span style="font-weight: bold">wmb.exe -data somefile.nds</span> where somefile.nds is the name of a DS program that has been signed by Nintendo.
<br/>
<br/>
What version is your DS's firmware? Have you done <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/pass/" target="_blank">TakeMeOut</a>?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the official FAQ says that when you launch the app, it should say waiting for authentication, and mine doesn't, and there is the error with the driver, so I guess my card isn't supported, even though that list says it is. Oh well, I've tried three different network adapters and none of them have worked, so I guess I'm just going to say screw it. None of the stores around me seem to carry what I need, except for the three I tried that for whatever reason didn't work. Thanks for the help, oh well, guess I'll check out PassMe or something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That means the driver's not working, which means either:
<br/>
-You haven't installed it
<br/>
-The card isn't compatible
<br/>
-You used Hibernate in Windows and need to disable and re-enable the card in the Device Manager after doing so.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
