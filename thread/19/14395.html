The uncontrollable homebrew and piracy communities that use the DS rely on similar devices for their more nefarious ends, but this should, in the long term, allow Nintendo to exercise some control over at least the former through the simple step of offering a path to publisher-supported content. Compared to the slightly vague WiiWare proposition, <span style="font-weight: bold">this has the possibility to revolutionise homebrew development ? at least in terms of distribution and the possibility of mainstream success</span> ? but how far the notoriously controlling Japanese giant will allow that community the creative freedom it requires to flourish will only be seen in practice. And before getting too excited, the device will launch exclusively for old Game Boy content, initially.

Hopefully Nintendo won't force a signing process similar to the one on new Nokia phones upon the homebrew community. Still, that'd be a stellar improvement over the state of today. :D

I doubt it would allow pc to card transfer. It would be like wii, where all transfers wireless from the internet.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think you'd be lucky if they're $2 each.  Probably $4 or $5, which is in line with the Virtual Console prices.  I don't think that's too much at all, though, personally.  There's some great Gameboy games out there.  And I'm sure it'll be wifi distribution just like with Wii VC games.  The price of the cart itself, though...well, we'll see.
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I don't see much hope of this turning into any kind of avenue for homebrew distribution, either, but I still think its cool.  Hopefully they won't keep it limited to just the Gameboy.  I'd love to see NES, PC Engine and SNES get the same treatment, and it'd be especially cool if the games were exchangable between the Wii VC and these card.  Not sure Genesis and Neo Geo are reasonable just in terms of resolution, but if Nintendo could figure out a way to make them look good, I'd buy them.

Yeah, they've done the NES Classics release with one or two missing scanlines on the GBA, but thats also why I don't really see it happening.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

But they are doing it for the remake of Kirby Super Star for DS.  Basically, they are more likely to remake the game than just port it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know, an emulator would obviously be the more cost-effective solution for Nintendo. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure why the existence of the NES Classics series makes it less likely that Nintendo would try emulating the NES or SNES on the DS.  Seems like the fact that they've already done it (on a system with an even lower resolution screen) would make it more likely that they'd do the same thing again rather than less.
<br/>
<br/>
I've never played any of the NES Classics games, so I don't know how they looked, but I think nesDS looks pretty great.  Horizontal resolution matches and you can crop the top and bottom of the screen a bit since the games were programmed with some overscan in mind anyway and then just drop 1 horizontal line for every tile so that it's uniform.  I bet they could even come up with a system that scrolled the dropped lines up or down along with the screen for vertically scrolling games so that they never got that wonky effect.
<br/>
<br/>
I really don't see any problem with NES or Turbo games on the DS.  Nor SNES purely in terms of the resolution, but SNES obviously has the additional issue of background layers that has been a problem for the homebrew emulators, but I'd still like to see Nintendo take a stab at it.  With some game-specific code in the emulator you could probably get around the layering issues.  Or maybe they could get a software renderer working at full speed.
