    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys I am planning on buying a ds light really soon but i need a gba cartrige and some other stuff. I recently found out that passcard3 was released. I wanted to get a supercard but then since the m3 adapter clearly has some advantages over the supercard i really want to buy it. I need a m3 minisd because i have a 2gb sandisk minisd. I also am thinking about buying a passcard3. If I get both of those will I be able to play homebrow and listen to music and videos and stuff? Anyway my real question is where can i buy a m3 minisd for cheap. I dont mean a cheap price like supercard, because i know m3 is expensive. But if you guys can tell me a place where i can get it really cheap compared to other places, it would be appreciated. Also i want to know where i can buy a passcard3, Thank You All. P.S. I like in California, United States.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Prices at [1] are pretty cheap. And if you're only running homebrew, you might as well get a Supercard. And if you mean "commercial" by "homebrew", Supercard is still very good. And it does all the other things you mentioned(music,movies...). And of course you can get the M3 MiniSD and the passcard here: [1] (Click backup and development)
