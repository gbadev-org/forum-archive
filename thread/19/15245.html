    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i wanna install this firmware on to my ds lite but i am worried would i be able to install one of the precompiled versions straight aWAY with no problems i cant be bothered compiling it myself lol
<br/>
<br/>
also to install it do you install it the same way you would with flash me (short sl1) 
<br/>
<br/>
i have tried to use fw nitro b4 but after i installed it that ds will now no longer boot from slot one at all i think its because i missed the libnds because i didnt read the readme 
<br/>
<br/>
will the compiled versions that come with 1.6c have lib nds already in there
<br/>
 any help would be great thanx</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
