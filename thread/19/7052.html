    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am trying to install wifime on my ds.  I am using the Linksys WMP54GS for my wireless connection.  When i try to update the driver under xp, and try to install the one I downloaded off the WIFIME site, it says that the software needed for this hardware cannnot be found.  Basically i wont let me install the drivers from wifime site, and I am wondering what I am doing wrong.  I do not have service pack 2 installed but i wouldnt think that it would matter. Can someone please help me out on this one. Thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It doesn't have the right chipset.  I don't think any cards with speed booster/108Mb work.  You need another PCI card.

<br/>
This is the closest card on the list to yours and some versions of the card do not have rt2560:
<br/>
<br/>
Linksys WMP54G v4 * 
<br/>
<br/>
* - chipset depends on card revision/version (could be Accton, ADMtek, Agere, Atheros, Atmel, Broadcom, Conexant/GlobespanVirata/Intersil/Harris/PRISM, Envara, Inprocomm, Intel, Marvell, Realtek, SiS, Texas Instruments, VIA, ZyDAS or some other).
<br/>
<br/>
I suggest you find a card that doesn't have an * next to it, less chance of it being the wrong chipset.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What i am trying to do is put wifime on here, in order to apply the flash me program. Would i be better off just getting passme (so i could install flash me) instead of paying the cash for a wireless card (that i will only use once)?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i bought a surecom 9321-g card for 14$ @ a local dealer, was pretty cheap to me, cheaper than a passme...and i had the possibility to give the card back with a loss of 10% of the price so the shop can sell it as cheap used hardware with full warranty, maybe you could ask a dealer to "test" such a card and give it back then when flashing is done.<br/>_________________<br/>...It?s a good day to die...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're only going to use the card once to run WiFiMe in order to install FlashMe, and you're not going to be using the card for FlashMe+WMB or for your home network, then I would suggest getting PassMe from dspassme.com instead. However, you will need to buy an official Nintendo DS game if you bought your DS after Nintendo cut the price to $130 while eliminating the Metroid demo. (If you like Tetris Attack, I strongly recommend Meteos.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
