    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">for me the cartridge detection is the biggest problem. and I want access both, slot 1 and slot 2 cartridge at same time.
<br/>
<br/>
I know, DLDI should solve this. but I think patching of NDS files isn't my way. I would prefer homebrew running on all supported cartridges unchanged.
<br/>
<br/>
on some cards there isn't a timout management. other card driver gives random values if the specific card isn't inserted into NDS slot. it is no big problem to fix this.
<br/>
<br/>
the problem is I own only 3 kind of cards myself: M3 mikro SD, DSlink, M3 DS simply / R4. this week I get a supercard lite (mikro SD). 
<br/>
<br/>
for this 3 cards I have solved this recognition problems. the supercard will be solved this week. as a example I have dsdoom running on all of this cards now.
<br/>
<br/>
for other cards I cannot solve this really without feedback. if I solve the problem, maybe this driver generally won't work.
<br/>
<br/>
is anyone owner of another supported card and willing to test with different media until it works fine?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
