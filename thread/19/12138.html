    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all - I used to make GBA homebrew games back in the day, so I got my g/f to pick up a DS pass card from China when she was out there over Xmas.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not up to speed at all on DS homebrew sadly, but its an ezPass3, which allegedy is compatible with both DS and DS Lite - I've got one of each, but when you turn the console on with the card inserted, it comes up with the Health &amp; Safety warning as usual, then fades straight out to a white screen. 
<br/>
<br/>
Allegedy its supposed to just boot as normal and you can select it from the DS menu as you would a regular DS game. Anyone know whats up - have I got a duff one?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Is there a loader app or something? Some way of getting multiple homebrew apps on a single cart?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For old GBA carts, I think the only choice is darkain's MultiNDS. There's a download here:
