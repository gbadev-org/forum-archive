    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hmm, i had a problem with a zonet xew1601. Its either a ralink 2561 or 2561S, which is normally called Ralink 2501 or Ralink 2501 TURBO.
<br/>
<br/>
I suggest u check with pcitree and see if it has the right numbers. By the looks of things, it doesn't
<br/>
<br/>
I was really trying to get wifime to work, but i dont think it would be worth it. It's cheaper to order a passme from dspassme.com (i highly recommend that site, Lynx is great). It was shipped the next day and i got it 2 days later, and it worked fine and i was able to flashme my ds.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW: You do know whether u need passme1 or 2 right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
