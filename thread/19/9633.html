<br/>
<br/>
(not in these exact words of course..)
<br/>
<br/>
using max media launcher
<br/>
1. insert MML into DS slot
<br/>
2. insert storage device in GBA port
<br/>
3. switch on console. <span style="font-weight: bold">you see the MAX Media Launcher screen for a couple of seconds before the menu of your GBA flash storage device loads.</span>
<br/>
4. use the menu to load stuff
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ok. I made that bit bold because i want to ask about it. Was my GBAMP meant to have a menu come up? I've always assumed I've needed a _BOOT_MP.nds file, but this tutorial says nothing about it; if I didn't visit these forums and tried moonshell, i wouldn't have known about it at all. So how are people meant to do this....
<br/>
<br/>
When I have no _boot..... file, the max media launcher loads the GBAMP in GBA mode... BUT with things on the side of the screens??? So is this actually NDS mode or not?  ---this doesnt happen when I use a commercial GBA game</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you've installed NDSMP on your GBAMP v2 CF and have put Mighty Max's loader or MoonShell or DSOrganize as /_boot_mp.nds on your CF card, then yes. If you're using a SuperCard or M3 or G6 or MAX Media Player, then yes.

Same happened when I used PassMe1 and no /_boot_mp.nds was present. NDSMP falls back to GBA mode if it can't find the file.

This is GBA mode with a custom border loaded into the frame buffer.

The Nintendo DS firmware is more careful about making a polished runtime environment for GBA mode. NDSMP, with its smaller code size, can't be as careful as the firmware when it falls back to GBA mode.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
do you reckon if I emailed datel support asking for a GBAMP firmware, would they link to Chishm's? or do you maybe think they have their own?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
