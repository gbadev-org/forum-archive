    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've tried EVERYTHING, and nothing will work. A couple of weeks ago I re-flashed my DS to version 8, soon afterwords, it stoped working. It would just boot in GBA mode. Around the same time, certain applications like DSO started messing up, but it was about the only one. 
<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I go it to finaly work but for example in DSO it would freeze randomly (it was the new 2.8 version) usually during the broswer when I tried to open it. I took apart my GBAMP and cleaned every part of it, which seemed to help as far as just booting it up goes. I formated the card to remove any curruption problems. After that, I re-downloaded Mighty Max's bootloader, and DSAIM, just as a test. When I booted it up, it went to it, but when I went to load DS AIM, it would re-load the boot loader. So, that didn't work. I re-started it, and this time got nothing but 2 white screens, I tried changing every file I had to _BOOT_MP.nds and it did the same thing. 
<br/>
<br/>
So...does any one know what to do...cause I really don't wanna buy a new slot-2 device (or slot-1 device for that matter. . . )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actualy, no. I was going to though but I read somewhere it was bad to do so. I could un-install it (but my PassMe1 is defently broke now) or can I just go straght from V8 back to V7? Also, I don't have a link to V7 anywhere that looks trustworthy. Can anyone supply one to me?

EDIT: Found the file, can't get it to boot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
