As for the card, you may not even need one if you can get wifime to work and can flash your DS. (then you can go homebrew with just the GBA cart.) However, I recommend the PassCard3. It\'s what I use, (or used until I flashed) and I had no problems with it at all.

What we need is to designate a specific wiki as the knowledge base for users and developers of DS homebrew. Before SimonB tightened the rules on what constitutes "supporting" piracy, we had one (PHWiki). Should we just designate <a class="postlink" href="http://tobw.net/dswiki/index.php?title=Main_Page" target="_blank">DSWiki at tobw.net</a> for both GBA-mode and DS-mode of the Nintendo DS system?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

WifiMe and PassMe1 work with versions 1 through 3. I think the earliest version of Lite is 5.

Wikipedia has a fair bit of info on this, heck, I wrote a lot of it. :p<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
