I wasn't too hot on the idea of getting a GBA Flash cart, mainly because if I wanted to get another cart, I wouldn't have to be paying for the same product twice. Also I have a bunch of SD cards lying around (two 128mb, one 512 mb, and one 1gb) so I'd rather use what I already have availible.
<br/>
<br/>
But thats just me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the M3 is better than G6 because the G6 carts will have a limit to how many games/files it can hold. 
<br/>
With the M3, just buy more CF/SD cards to hold more games/movies.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
