    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm very happy with my SCminiSD for DS homebrew. Compatibility is nearly 100%, the only incompatibilities I've had are with a now out dated version of DSOrganize, and older applications that ran on old FAT libraries that didn't support the miniSD cards at the time, such as HereticDS.
<br/>
And though the RAM is reportedly faster in the M3, the Supercard has a price advantage, and I can't report on the M3's compatibility.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

Been considdering getting one myself for some time, why didn't it make the poll?
<br/>
That asside, I'm also under the impression that the Supercard seems snappy and realiable.

[There's no Slot2 solutions out there that Autopatch + dldi .nds on their own are there ?...]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Only downside with supercard for GBA is that you can't 'overclock' the ROM, you have to leave it at the default (slow) speed. But I haven't heard of any problems when running at the slow speed (besides the fact that it's slower, obviously), and I don't know of any homebrew that needs the faster speed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

SuperCard RAM runs at 4,2 wait state, like the oldest GBA flash cards. Official GBA Game Paks run at 3,1. Some Shitfaced Clowns demos run at 2,1. In order to make these work on a SuperCard, you'll need to run them through a patcher.
<br/>
<br/>
Once you have a NAND/RAM card (such as a SuperCard or M3) that you can use with DS homebrew, you can use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/#memtestARM" target="_blank">memtestARM</a> to see how fast its RAM runs.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, the RAM is noticably slower than on every other card I've tried. Tbh I'm not at all impressed with my Supercard (miniSD) but I've never played GBA games so can't comment on that side of things. The SC is the least favourite of all my flash cards... (it can hear me talking about it btw)
<br/>
<br/>
The M3 is overpriced for what you get (just seems like a souped-up gbamp).
<br/>
<br/>
Never used a G6...
<br/>
<br/>
Never used a EZ4, however I do have an EZ 3-in-1 which is actually pretty good, so that's what I'd recommend. You get the benefits of slot-2 (GBA support, fast RAM etc) and the goodness of slot-1, eg no need for flashme or a nopass etc. So I'd vote for a 3-in-1.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
