I just wondered if a new homebrew firmware could add the option to use WPA or better?
<br/>
I add a Poll so the devs can imagine how many would appreciate such a feature.<br/>_________________<br/>Marine, we need you to head to the depths of the compound to rescue a scientist that is being held hostage by Satan and his manyfold minions.

<br/>
Yes.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS does not support WPA encryption. If you feel insecure about using WEP (there have been problems with it in the past) or cannot use WEP for other reasons, I personally would use the Nintendo USB Adapter (assuming you have Windows XP)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
I would like to add that while the DS cannot connect to a router using WPA encryption, <span style="font-weight: bold">the Wii will be able to do so</span>. It will support four encryptions: WEP, WEP-PSK, WPA and WPA2. You can read more about them on the Internet if you want more information. It is not impossible that the DS can get online through the Wii, so what you have described might be possible if you plan on purchasing a Wii console. However, do not take my word for it and look into the matter if interested.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

It's not homebrew only, it's the DS hardware in general that doesn't support WPA.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmmm, this is odd...
<br/>
<br/>
I do seem to recall reading that WPA in it's original form works under DSLinux...
<br/>
<br/>
*checks the DSL forums*
<br/>
<br/>
Greaaat, their search feature doesn't like three-letter words. 
<br/>
<br/>
I may just be hallucinating then...

There are couple of functions that need to be implemented (for changing wep keys on the fly etc.). No one has done this yet, but it should be relatively simple glue code since the interface that needs to be implemented is already defined.
<br/>
<br/>
wpa_supplicant is in the tree already on the uClinux branch - we just need to pull it to head when we need it.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know for sure whether WPA will ever work though. There might be issues you only notice when you start trying to make it work.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Thats the Information I've been looking for!

So it is actually possible to rewrite the Driver.<br/>_________________<br/>Marine, we need you to head to the depths of the compound to rescue a scientist that is being held hostage by Satan and his manyfold minions.
