    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I just picked up a Nintendo DS the other day and I wanted to get involved in some homebrew stuff. I currently do not own a GBA flashcart or PassMe, so my question is, what hardware do you gusy recommend? Should I try to build my own PassMe in order to learn about the electronics? Should I order one online? Should I get a PassMe and Flash Cart seperate or order one of these bundled movie palyer packages?
<br/>
<br/>
What experiences have you guys had? Which carts are good? Which are bad? Any feedback is appreciated thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Personally, I'd just purchase a GBAMP and a PassMe. CF cards are cheap nowadays, and almost without a doubt cheaper than buying a flash cart. Edit: PassMe + Supercard is a possibility too
<br/>
<br/>
(Don't flash carts typically advertise in Megabits at that? 1 Mbit is 1/8th an Mbyte, the latter of which CF cards are advertised in.)
<br/>
<br/>
Or wait to see details on the GBAMP people's "M3" (passme + new DS enabled movie player), which will cost more but may be beneficial if you really care about the video.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My concern about the wifi stuff is that if I understand it right you need to then use FlashMe to reflash your bios in order to play homebrew. I would rather not reflash my bios because I am hoping to use Nintendo's Wi-Fi Connection when it comes out and I don't want my MAC address banned for having a wrong Bios checksum or something. Not that we know they will do something like that, but I am just trying to be safe.
<br/>
<br/>
I was interested in that M3, anyone know when that will be available yet?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you get wifi and a gbamp, you dont need to flash your DS. I would also reccomend the gbamp. Right now there is already moonshell, and a nds loader that works with a lot of programs already.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is there a GBAMP that uses SD cards instead of CF cards? I have a camera with an SD card already so if would be nice if I could use the same kind.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, has anyone experienced problems with fragmentation of the CF card causing homebrew apps to not run? I read something about that on one site but I wasn't sure how big of an issue it was.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBAMP V.2 doesn't support sd I believe their making M3s that support SD, but Im not sure and the M3 are supposed to be around $70 I hear.
<br/>
<br/>
The fragmentation really hasn't been an issue for me. The only file that can't be fragmented is the NDS file booted from the firmware. So if you use the loader, its the only one that needs to be whole.
<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem for running other programs (that you didnt make) is GBAMP firmware only supports .NDS, but for $20 plus a compact flash (around $10 for a 32meg card), Its probably worth it.
<br/>
<br/>
Its also really usefull for programming applications, with the ability to load files with chisms drivers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Pretty soon fragmentation won't be an issue at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
