    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I went out and bought a Zonet ZEW1601. When I put it in, Windows automatically installed the driver Ralink Turbo Wireless LAN Card driver. If i try and select "update driver" through the device manager and browse to the custom driver, it says that the driver already installed is better and won't install the custom one. If i uninstall the device, and then go to the add new hardware wizard, it automatically installs the Ralink Turbo Wireless LAN Card driver anyway, and wont let me choose a driver.
<br/>
<br/>
How am i supposed to get this custom driver installed!?!?!?!??!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try this
<br/>
Uninstall driver
<br/>
goto folder with custom driver
<br/>
right click on .inf
<br/>
use the install choice
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If that does not work I am sorry for wasting your time but it has been along time without windows so I am a little hazy and that is what I remember from win98 and XP may be different</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i tried method 2 on a different computer. it installed, but then i got error code 10 (the device cannot start)
<br/>
<br/>
im going to make a new partition on a different pc and reformat and try installing the driver. someone else had the same sort of problem, except they got error code 31, but they reformatted and tried it and it worked.
<br/>
<br/>
but...i checked with pcitree and the VID/PID was 1814/0301, not 1814/0201
<br/>
i think its an RT2561. Will it still work with this custom driver?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
