    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i still only have games 'n' music and we all know its a bit slow with loading most homebrew (but for some  strange reason, wifi captured demos loads kinda fast...) and so i was wondering, is it possible to overclock, just any slot_1 device inserted; like the method used to speed up slot_2 memory expansion devices.. was it mentestARM-0.03 the program. could it be done?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">wow... thank for the info. but how can i speed up loading times with homebrews &gt;4 GB? data swamping in and out of the ds ram is horribly slow.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

I don't know of any homebrew that's bigger than 4 GB. Assuming that that was a typo for 4 MB, you can speed up loading times by buying something other than a Games n' Music card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For an unreasonable answer, you can always work on replacing the chipset of the GnM.. That would be the only way to increase it's speed, as the reason it is slow is the hardware they decided to use.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
