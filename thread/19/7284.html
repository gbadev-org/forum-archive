    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We need some consistent DS firmware versioning scheme. I have seen the most recent firmware refered to as "Red Firmware," but I don't think using colors is a good idea for a versioning scheme.
<br/>
<br/>
I talked to Loopy (Olimar) and here is the DS firmware versioning he suggested.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">v1</span> (checksum 0x2C7A)
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">v2</span> (checksum 0xE0CE)
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">v3</span> (checksum 0xBFBA)
<br/>
<span style="color: red">v4</span> (checksum 0xDFC7)
<br/>
<span style="color: red">iQue </span>(checksum 0xF96D)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">v1-v3</span> are the original firmware supported by old PassMe/WifiMe
<br/>
<span style="color: red">v4</span> is the firmware of recent DSes that blocks old PassMe and current WifiMe
<br/>
<br/>
Checksum is located at offset 0x6 in firmware. Currently there are no methods to find out what firmware you have without first getting DS to boot in DS mode and running a checker.
<br/>
<br/>
FlashMe now works with v1-v4. So far, only an iQue-PassMe or PassMe2 can boot a v4 DS.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, we have different DSes, the silver DS, the iQue and perhaps some newer DS will be different in some aspects too. So i suggest a sheme, where you can see for what DS it is.
<br/>
<br/>
Sv1
<br/>
Sv2
<br/>
etc. for the silver/first/normal DSes
<br/>
<br/>
Iv1
<br/>
Iv2
<br/>
etc. for the iQue and compatible DSes
<br/>
<br/>
btw. I heared, that some new colored DS could be different (colored DS in Europe). Is this verified? I saw some blue and pink DSes in Germany, but i wont spend 130? to test this ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They did set the code protect bit in the header tho, to try and hide the fact it's a complete clone of the passme.

At this point, you remove your game card/game pak.  (both cause their related interrupt events).  
<br/>
<br/>
Olimar/Loopy was able to test this for all firmware versions, as he has dumps for all of them.

v1: hang

v4: yellow
