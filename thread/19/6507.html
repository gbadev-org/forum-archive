    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, there will be "III Polish Nintendo Fan Convention" in Poland, and we want to make DS Download Service. I tested WiFi me at my home, and it works fine, but there is a problem. Even when apps like WMBFront have 'kiosk mode', It can send one file at moment (I don't have 2 DS to test). On convent, there will be a lot of people.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way to get DS Download Service based on WiFi me, which will work familiar to oryginal one? 
<br/>
<br/>
When I start more then one instance of wmb, I get comunication errors, and only one file on list. Any ideas?<br/>_________________<br/>[ sorry for all mistakes, but my english isn't as good as I wish it to be ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No. You are limited to one download at a time. Before you ask, I can not add the requested functionality to my application because I do not have a DS Download Station for stick poking purposes. Heck, I don't even have a 2nd DS :(

Yes, that is normal. You should not run multiple instances. Why? The same way why you can not feed two starving Ethiopian children with one grain of rice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
