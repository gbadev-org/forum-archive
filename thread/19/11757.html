    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow,this seems to be a serious problem...
<br/>
<br/>
I bought a Sandisk 1GB MicroSD card for my SCL Rumble. It came with the SD adaptor and all.
<br/>
<br/>
When it arrived,I plugged it in my card reader and saw that it was already FAT formatted,nice.
<br/>
<br/>
I copy/paste some homebrew apps right away,then try them on my Lite.Some ran,some not.
<br/>
<br/>
5 mins later I insert the microSD in the card reader again only to find out that it cannot even be recognized by Windows XP.
<br/>
<br/>
Everytime I insert it,it tries to read from the card but fails- no error messages,it just hangs for a moment,then the 4 icons ( CF,SM,SD,MS) dissappear and then one by one reappear (maybe it restarts the card reader itself?). A few times it showed an error,I can't recall exactly the words but it had to do with "flags".
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what to do,my previous SD card works like a charm,but this microSD has this frickin' problem. I even tried it in 2 different card readers; same reaction.
<br/>
<br/>
I made a final attempt to format the card from dos,the moment it tries to read,and it gave me an IOCTL error. (?)
<br/>
<br/>
Returning the product to the shop is not an option since it has a sealed-product only policy...
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone help me?<br/>_________________<br/>He who laughs last, obviously didn't get the joke.

If at first you don't succeed, redefine success.

Can you provide the details of this return policy, specifically the extent to which it disclaims the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implied_warranty#Merchantability" target="_blank">implied warranty of merchantability</a> or foreign counterpart? If the retailer does not accept defective products for exchange, please consider asking SimonB to create a topic in Retailer Feedback named after the retailer so that you can warn the rest of us not to patronize such a retailer.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I believe none of you will be having any transactions with this shop,as it is a Greece-only online shop. But I contacted them again,spoke with a higher level person there,and apparently he understood the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
It appears that this policy is valid only if I want to get my money back,which is natural that the product should be sealed.Their defective product policy was not even stated in the site,oh well.
<br/>
<br/>
As I'm stuck with a fucked-up card that can't even be formatted,I guess I'll start the Quest here,sending the card back to the shop,which then will go all the way to Sandisk to be checked if it is indeed faulty.
<br/>
<br/>
