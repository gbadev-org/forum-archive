    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think I may have found another flashme 7 bug.
<br/>
<br/>
Just got a UK DS-Lite (Black :)) and flashed it using v7 located at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/h2cgf" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/h2cgf</a> .  I checked MD5 hash and everything indicates that its the correct, v7 firmware.  I get all the different brightness levels etc.
<br/>
<br/>
However since flashing the Lite I have noticed that when I switch it off, it leaves some black lines (like long dashes) on the left hand side of the top screen and the middle of the bottom touch screen.  They are quite hard to see and fade away after about 5 minutes.  If you switch the lite back on before they have faded, you briefly see them on screen before whatever you're loading (supercard menu etc) appears, kind of like an overlay.
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, until a wee while ago I was convinced they were just appearing when switching the machine on, but If I wait 5 mins for the screen to clear up before switching on I get no screen weirdness.
<br/>
<br/>
A buddy bought a white uk DS-Lite and flashed using the same file at the link above.  Gets the same problem.
<br/>
<br/>
So anyone else seeing this?  (I have an old Phat DS running Flashme v6 and that works fine)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You are 100% certain it is caused by flashme? you say it is very hard to see the lines normally, perhaps they were there before you installed flashme, but you didn't notice them?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it's a fun side effect of LCDs when you power them off.
<br/>
It's noticable on the DS becase it's a light color screen when off, rather than the darker color like an LCD monitor.
<br/>
<br/>
I've seen this on a lot of 'light' color LCD screens, especially monochrome.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

<br/>
Every time I turn off my GBA, GBA SP, DS Classic, mobile phone, i see the same effect. And I've seen this on some laptops and PDAs...
<br/>
I think it's totally normal... but i've noticed if I play outside, it fades away almost immediately.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Seen that as well.
<br/>
Both BEFORE and AFTER flashing.
<br/>
Again I think it's a fun effect of LCDs.
<br/>
<br/>
Possibly some transistors getting their charge first and turning completely on (on boot-up) and some retaining it longer than others when you turn it off?<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback guys.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem definately wasn't there before flashing.  I was using an MML cart  and switching the lite on and off in succession never caused the problem.  I wasn't too impressed with the MML - Thats when I decided to flash the firmware after which the problem started happening.
<br/>
<br/>
It still works fine so its no big deal, I just thought maybe the Euro DS-Lite was running some newer uber firmware or something...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Perhaps the intro screen turns on the LCD a few frames before it turns on the light, making the effect less noticeable. Does the same thing happen with the stealth version?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
