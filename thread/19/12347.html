You can't play Super NES Game Paks on a Nintendo DS, unless perhaps you use a Super NES and a GBA video-in module. Or did you mean ports of Super NES games to GBA? Or did you mean backups?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

By miniSD, I assume you mean Supercard miniSD. That would imply you need a miniSD card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SNES emulation is barely possible, and current emulators rely heavily on similarities between SNES and DS video hardware. N64 emulation is <span style="font-style: italic">never</span> going to happen in the DS, barring some miraculous discovery or crazy add-on. The DS and N64 are almost identical in specifications (N64 93mhz 4MB, DS 66+33mhz 4MB), but you need about 10 times the processing power to emulate another architecture (N64 and DS CPUs are quite different).

I think it has more to do with the fact that EA has all James Bond related development rights now. When they first acquired the license, Nintendo even had to censor the GoldenEye box and name from their TV ads.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nope, it isn't.

(Though in their defense, SMW's code is terrible.)

Write to Nintendo. An official port is probably your best chance of getting this accomplished.

That tends to be common in launch titles. <span style="font-style: italic">Tetris</span> for Game Boy is also horribly coded. Might it have something to do with cargo-cult programming habits built up on development boards containing earlier versions of the console's chipset?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Probably that and/or immature development tools, and perhaps messy code as a result of the game being used to debug the hardware. Super Mario 64's code is pretty nasty too. You're certainly right there, it seems with every Nintendo console I look at, the first few games released are coded such that you wonder what they were on. Tetris looks like it was written by hand in a hex editor, SMW is slow and uses the same bytes as code and data in some places when it really isn't necessary (not to mention wasting space like crazy), and Mario 64 has a lot of redundant instructions. I haven't hacked NES really so I don't know about that.

Even with HLE, it'll need a lot of timing hacks, because the SA-1 is apparently insane to get proper timing with.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
