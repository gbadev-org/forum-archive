    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone, I'm looking for some assistance in getting some equipment for my DS lite (that i dont actually have yet)
<br/>
<br/>
A fellow student showed me his DS lite (import) on the last day we were in, and he had a device that allowed him to use the same memory cards as the PSP (SD cards i think) it was black in colour, and i wanted to aquire one, but forgot to ask for the name of it.
<br/>
<br/>
ive also looked into flashing the firmware for the UK DS Lite, but came back empty handed. I don't really fancy having a PassMe device hanging out of the back of my black DS Lite.
<br/>
<br/>
So 2 questions really:
<br/>
<br/>
1) what is the best device for using PSP memory cards in the GBA slot, and how do I then move files from my PC to the card?
<br/>
<br/>
2) where is a site with a guide for flashing the firmware on the UK DS Lite (unless its been confirmed its the same method as the US/Japan version) I know you have to short a connection and such, its just better to be safe than sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to start coding for the DS, and i want to get the stuff ready ASAP. Any help would be appreciated
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

PSP uses Memory Stick PRO Duo.

I think the only Nintendo DS device that accepts Memory Stick media is Datel's MAX Media Dock for DS (Memory Stick version). The more common adapters take only SD or CF media.

Use a USB Memory Stick writer.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most homebrew supports CF better than SD. As for devices it depends what you want to do. GBAMP is cheap, but lacks SRAM, so you can't use it with a Pass*2. Supercard and M3 have SRAM, and also 32MB of RAM that can be mapped into GBA ROM space, which lets you use them as a really big GBA flash cart, and can provide extra memory to DS apps (but I don't think any of them use it yet). They're more expensive, though, and I don't think they support any auto-startup method (you have to go through their menu every time you want to load an app).
<br/>
If you get a NoPass such as Max Media Launcher, GBAMP wil work fine, but if you're stuck with a Pass*2 or you want non-multiboot (&gt;256K) GBA app support, you'll need something else. You can also use traditional GBA flash carts, but few apps support writing to them (except to SRAM), so it's not a very convenient solution.
<br/>
<br/>
As for flashing, it should work the same way with all systems.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
