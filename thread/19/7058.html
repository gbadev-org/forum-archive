    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I read about a limitation with the gbamp?s, is this "card" able to start .nds files of bigger sizes like 256mbit oder 512mbit?
<br/>
<br/>
I?d like to buy a new flash card because i just have an old 128mbit EZ2 Powerstar and size is very limited. It was a hell of an procedure to get such a cart where i live, and the only thing i could order pretty cheap is the gba mp2. can it do everything a "normal" flashcart can?

<br/>
<br/>
For NON-GBAMP written homebrew, it has a 4MB limit.  This is because the ROM is loaded into the NDSs internal memory, which is 4MB.  But, if the homebrew is written for the GBA MP, the limit is the size of your CF card.  Example being Moonshell playing 8MB mp3 files.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you cant run most ds.gba files or various other homebrew software due to various as yet unknown bugs (pocketspc and snesds for example).  I wouldnt get the gbamp just for homebrew its more of a nice touch for those people who bought it for what its designed for.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

By the time you've paid for a GBAMP, a CF card, and a CF writer, you could probably have already bought a NOR based GBA flash card with an included writer, no?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
I paid $60 + $10 shipping (and waited a month to receive it) for a 256Mb GBA Flash Cart..
<br/>
<br/>
So, I'd still say the GBA MP is cheaper, and that's not even doing a good comparison, as you'd have to break it down to $/Mb.
<br/>
<br/>
GBA MP = $0.03/Mb
<br/>
Flash Cart = $0.23/Mb</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One question here is, will people continue to support the GBAMP, or is everyone going to switch over to someone else in a matter of weeks?
<br/>
As long as every bit of DS homebrew is built for a different kind of card, with no attempts at keeping it all moderately uniform, things are going to get very confusing and quite irritating. I'm not saying we should start acting like a government and be enforcing how people write their code, but we should perhaps figure out one kind of card and stick with it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, uhm... so, is it remotely possible (putting aside how ridiculously complicated it could be) for the GBAMP's firmware to be done in such a way that it can pretend to be a regular flash cart?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

As long as the GBAMP is still sold, it'll still be developed for. I'll probably try to make my own DS programs compatible both with GBA flash cards and with the GBAMP, either at compile time or at run time.

Not possible. The GBAMP is designed to be an interface between the GBA cart bus and ATA block devices, and ds.gba programs expect to be run from a word-addressed device, not a block device. I've summarized the issues in <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.pocketheaven.com/Block_device" target="_blank">my PHWiki article on block devices</a>.

Unfortunately I don't know enough about the ARM9 CP15 to make it work. Besides, I think the DevKitPro CRT0s completely change the CP15 settings at boot up, making this even harder. It technically doesn't have to be in firmware. However, if MightyMax gets it working I will definitely include it in the firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
