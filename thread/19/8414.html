<br/>
You can get the WMB host from here:

The original WMB for linux (libnifi) has not been updated yet (TBBle is not around at the moment) but you can find out how to patch it from here:

I believe these only work with ralink rt2500 and rt2570 (usb) based wireless cards. The rt2570 needs a hacked driver that you can get from here:

<br/>
Tells you how to set the rt2570 interface up too. To set up a rt2500 based card follow the instructions from libnifi:

<br/>
The Nintendo DS firmware must be version 1 to 3 as for the Windows version.
<br/>
The host requires a nds file with a correct RSA attached. The meteos demo from the following link works for me.

My setup is:
<br/>
Firmware V3 DS
<br/>
rt2570usb
<br/>
debian kernel image 2.6.14
<br/>
GBAMP V2 with chishm's patch 2.11
<br/>
256MB CF card</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The linux versions will work with the same wireless adaptors as the Windows version. These cards are based on the ralink rt2500 chipset (pci and pcmcia ? rt2560 refers to an individual chip within this chipset I believe).
<br/>
Where as the Windows version relies on a custom written driver interface the linux versions  interact with the wireless adaptor through an abstraction provided by the operating system. Therefore any wireless adaptor driver that provides the required functionality will run happily. At the moment this is only provided by drivers for the ralink rt2500 and rt2570 (usb) chipset (I believe) but other wireless adaptor could be made to work if their driver is written or changed and the applications with not have to be altered.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Currently none will run out of the box as the USB rt2570 driver is a hacked version of the open source driver and therefore will not be included in any live CDs. I do not know if any live CDs would allow you to download the driver code and WMB application, compile it, install and run it. As I run linux all the time I do not know much about Live CDs.

Anybody fancy building a Nintendo DS WMB/WifiMe Disk?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
