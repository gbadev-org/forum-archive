Unless any other cards are recommended, which of these two would be best? Also, I have an old EZF Advance 256Mb GB card that I have used for my GBA development for a while, but the problem I have with it is that I can only upload my stuff via a link port through my worn-out GBA. Is it possible to use one of these Slot 1 cards for transferring my homebrew stuff to it, insomuch as to have it work as if I used it the other way? And would it even be possible to use my GBA card as external RAM?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In my experience, Dualis and other emulators are still so buggy that you need a flash card for Hello World. Are you still at the point where you are developing your game logic on the PC or GBA, your 2D graphics on the GBA, and your 3D graphics using PC OpenGL?

These two cards are almost exactly the same.

It depends. First somebody needs to figure out the flash writing protocol for EZFA, possibly by debugging the multiboot stub that the official client sends. If and when that's done, it would become possible to write a tool to copy a .gba file from the microSD card in SLOT-1 to the GBA card in SLOT-2.
