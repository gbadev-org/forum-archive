    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello my name is Omri. My brother bought the Electric Blue DS for me and from research I've concluded that I'll probably need a PassMe2. Within about a week I plan on ordered a M3(CF) Adapter and the Yu-Gi-Oh NT game. I'm from Israel and not entirely sure of the region of this game, but I believe it is [E] or mybe [U], if  someone of you lynux or natrium 42 could please verify this for me I plan on buying it in a shop in Tel Aviv, and if... one of you can program for me the PassMe2 for using Yu-Gi-Oh NT I plan on purchasing one. Please  answer me back as soon as possible, Thanks. - Omri</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
