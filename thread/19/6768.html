    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello. I've been following this site for a few weeks. I'm looking to get the G6 Flash3 
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.g6flash.com/news.htm" target="_blank">http://www.g6flash.com/news.htm</a>
<br/>
<br/>
and a passkey so i can play music and run the commercial games i have purchased. I just wanted to know if Moonshell works with all flash carts as well as GBAMP.
<br/>
<br/>
I do own GBAMP V2 but it kept on getting lodged in my bag and i don't want to damage my DS. Having an M3 AND a passkey would just add too many inches as i am currently travelling alot.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not to sure wether i should of put this post in the Moonshell section, but any help would be welcome</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do you have your DS and GBAMP firmware flashed yet? because moonshell works with GBAMP v2, very well if I might add.
<br/>
<br/>
The GBAMP will probably be more valuble in the longrun, especially with all thats being developed for it, NESds, and ScummVm, along with moonshell, what more could you ask for (SNESds?).
<br/>
<br/>
But G6 sounds like just another flashcart packaged with a passme right now, so if your thinking of going the flashcard route I would suggest getting a cheap flashcart now. I think moonshell works with most flashcarts although its not quite as easy, you have to use a filesystem thats created using a batch file and appended to the rom.
<br/>
<br/>
You can also use flashme to dispose of passme, although to use lashme you need GBAMP or a Flashcard AND a passme or wifime.
<br/>
<br/>
The only reason I would get a flashcard is that you can use the larger .nds.gba files, for a GBAMP .nds file cant be more than 4 mb (although it can load from CF card).
<br/>
<br/>
The firmware has also been hacked for supercard now, if your interested.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if your looking for the best route definitly go with a GBAMP v2 i have one and i love it!! there also real cheap too!, as far as i remember i only spent like thirty or so USD$ Plus like joebob180 said there is alot being developed for it, and im pretty sure that with the way moonshell is going it will blow the m3 out of the water (that is if the m3 is ever released for sale (as far as i know its not yet)). However i have a flash cart too (EZF3 advance (the crappy linker4u version)) and it works just fine with moonshell as well, mp3 playback and all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the m3 runs moonshell the same way the gbamp2 did.
<br/>
<br/>
The m3 is for sale, and I have ordered one
<br/>
and the m3 is probably the best thing to get, if you want a flash cart, the G6 does have advantages over the other ones, as I believe it has a menu simalar to the M3's

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thankyou very much for these replies.
<br/>
<br/>
The M3 is and option and i was looking at the SD and CF versions. The main thing that is putting me off buying one of these and going for the G6 is the size issue. As i said, i do own a GBAMP V2 that i purchased from lik-sang, but it kept on getting trapped in my bag. I'll be doing some more travelling for awhile longer(currently in Australia at the moment) so space is and issue as well as not damaging my DS. I only really want to put my games on them and music. I have no interest in using it to watch movies but i'll wait and see what happens when these devices are released.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the advice</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
