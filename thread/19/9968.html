    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wanna start on GBA/DS developing but I'm having a hard time deciding what I should buy to run homebrew on my DS. Basically I just want the best that's out there. M3 Adapter looked like it was the best to me but I saw a lot of people use Supercard too.
