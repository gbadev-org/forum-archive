Because they use a different chipset than the one for which we have a hacked driver.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At a guess, to make a driver you will need the Windows DDK (Device driver development kit) and documentation on the chipset of the wireless device you wish to write the driver for.
<br/>
<br/>
The DDK is available from Microsoft's website somewhere or if you are an MSDN subscriber you probably already have it.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck getting the documentation for the chipset of your wireless device. Visiting the manufacturer's website might be a good start. Or looking for an equivalent Linux driver.
