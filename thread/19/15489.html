    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so i got a DS linker recently (actually more a DS linker copy called "DS fire link") and within a few days i managed to kill it.
<br/>
after turning on, the DS freezes right in the heath-screen at startup.
<br/>
i guess i might have turned off the DS while in USB mode without unmounting the device on PC.
<br/>
<br/>
now, before i throw away this brand new piece of 50? junk, i'd like to assure there is no way to fix it. i found some information that resetting the device is possible by various button-combinations at startup, but so far i had no luck...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
don't you have any kind of warranty? you could always give it a try! check the manufacturer's support, maybe they can help.
<br/>
ps: pretend you don't have a clue... most of the support people i had experience with didn't have a clue either and talking to "tech" point would only confuse them, which does not help. ;^D
<br/>
<br/>
good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I found this on the net for re-formatting and installing the latest boot files:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">
<br/>
1. Slot in the Fire Card and connect your NDS to the computer via the Fire Link.
<br/>
2. Switch on NDS and wait for the Health Warning page to load.
<br/>
3. Press and hold Left Trigger and Down button and hold them down, it should now load to the main menu.
<br/>
4. Press and hold Right Trigger and A and B buttons, in a few seconds, it would load the formating screen.
<br/>
5. Wait for it to format completely, and for the removable drive to appear on your computer.
<br/>
6. When done, copy the software files from the manufacturer's site and restart your NDS. These files are:
<br/>
xmenu.dat
<br/>
Fire_eng_1_45.nds
<br/>
7. All done!
