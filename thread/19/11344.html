    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, I have a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&amp;childpagename=US%2FLayout&amp;cid=1150490054358&amp;pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold">Please use the [</span><span style="font-weight: bold">url=] syntax for long URLs. -- MOD</span></a>, and for some reason it doesn't work with WifiMe. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now, if someone could give me a real in depth tutorial, (Not from here though: <a href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php," target="_blank">http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php,</a> that's where I keep messing up) 
<br/>
I'd really like that.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but I'm sure I'm doing SOMETHING wrong.. So can someone please give me a step by step tutorial? thanks in advance..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm, it shouldn't be that hard. Everything is explained nicely and with screenshots. The most things which can go wrong is the correct install of the driver and/or using the correct PID &amp; VID IDS.
<br/>
<br/>
But in order for people to help you, you might want to tell what you've done already and what went wrong or didn't work for you.
<br/>
<br/>
Other tutorials can be found pretty easily with <a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=wifime+tutorial&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" target="_blank">google</a> I guess.<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Well my PID/VID thing is 1814/0301, will it still work?
<br/>
<br/>
I keep getting that "Error(10) the program cannot run" thing at the end of the installation, and I get a exclamation mark over the icon in device manager.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, do I install my Linksys's stuff on the CD it came with first? or do I do this before?
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I believe I've done everything it said, (I even have the Linksys wireless adaptor used in the tutorial) but I think I might be missing something. The files and stuff you need to download are kind of confusing, like I heard you need to take the files from the WIFIME file, and put them in the Data file of another file, but that may only apply to flashing and stuff.. That tutorial just doesn't work for me, which is why I hope someone can just 1. 2. 3. the steps out for me. All I want is to run flashmp by darkfader to fix my bricked supercard. I've put LOADS of money into this, and I still can't fix it.. btw, I got my linksys thing off of ebay, so I can't return it.
<br/>
<br/>
and also, i'll take pictures in the steps I do them if needed..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry your card is not compatible.  If it was compatible then the VID/PID would be 1814/0201.  The tutorial needs to make this more clear.  Many cards have multiple revisions, it's getting harder to find one with the correct chipset.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
