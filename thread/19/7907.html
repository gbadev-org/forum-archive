    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">What I have:</span>
<br/>
-nintendo ds (purchased within the last few months so it's probably new firmware.. not sure)
<br/>
-linksys wireless-g pci adapter (tested wifime with signed nintendo demos and it works.. i wont be using it much anyway)
<br/>
-Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow cart
<br/>
-PassMe2 - preloaded with castlevania data - this is currently purchased and being shipped from dspassme.com
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What I want to do:</span>
<br/>
-get a small flash cart and linker (I do not have a GBA so the linker has to write to the card directly)
<br/>
-run true nds homebrew code on the ds hardware (i.e. stylus.. mic input.. etc)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK, so I've become so confused with all the cart types, numbers, sizes, and abbreviations. I'm not sure what to buy and I only have about $85 USD to spend. I found a nice site that might have what I need (plus it takes PayPal which is a must for me):
<br/>
<br/>

According to dspassme.com, there are only certain carts that work with Passme (and/or passme2?). Here is the current list of carts that work with passme.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.dspassme.com/docs/html/pm_07_flashcarts.html" target="_blank">http://www.dspassme.com/docs/html/pm_07_flashcarts.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, according to some websites some carts don't load DS code (do they only load GBA code? like no stylus input?). So I guess it needs to be on this list as well.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope it's as simple as one of the many carts on WinSunx.com, but for some reason I get the feeling it's not. :-) 
<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the main options I am looking at:
<br/>
 - EZ-FLASH 2 (512MB) US$ 75 
<br/>
 - XG2Turbo 2005 Flash Kit ( 256Mbit ) US$ 40 
<br/>
 - EZFA (256MB) US$ 53 
<br/>
 - EZ1- Flasher ( 128Mb ) US$ 31  
<br/>
Also this might work from Linker4u.com, but I don't think they take paypal.
<br/>
 - EZF Advance III (256M version) Cartridge and Linker Set
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, what would you suggest?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is what worried me about the SuperCard. I've read in several places that SuperCard has problems with the PassMe.. but I'm not sure.  Other places say it plain doesn't work (which i find hard to believe).
<br/>
<br/>
dspassme.com states that it works with the latest firmware.. is that the PassMe2 version? or a new version for the supercard? Or are they talking about ds firmware? hehehe, with as much as I know about computers, this stuff still confuses me sometimes
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
OK, thanks for the info. Ignore my above rant. :P
<br/>
<br/>
Let's say my Passme2 works with the above supercard (which I will now have to outbid on! Bwahaha). Will it be able to run functional DS code? Like I said in my first post, I want true DS dev, not just gba stuff (been there done that).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I assume this means I need the Supercard AND a CF card.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I found this:

<br/>
<br/>
The website says it contains 256Mbit built-in memory...  would I still need a CF card?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<div class="post">
    <h4>#64954 - drako - Wed Dec 28, 2005 9:05 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So it looks like jsut about any CF stick will work. I might as well pick one up just in case. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions on a CF Writer? Or does the supercard have a built-in USB adapter so I can upload data to the CF stick?
<br/>
<br/>
So far, I'm still under my money allotment... so far... :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It means it has 32MB of RAM built-in.
<br/>
You need the CF card, but you'll be much happier with it eventually, believe me. Search for a cheap 128MB CF for a start. You'll see how quickly you'll be whining you haven't got enough space ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
