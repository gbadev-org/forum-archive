    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Recently i purchased "R4 revolution for the DS" and it came with a disc in chinese.. unforunately i cant read it, and it had a program called moonshl 1.6 and i have no idea how to install it. i tried looking through the forum but i couldnt find a post on it (maybe im blind) so if someone is willing to tell me step by step or link me to a website that does that i would be very grateful. Also, after i set up R4 do i need to do anything to my wireless router if i wanna go Wi-Fi on Mario Kart or Bleach 2nd, the regular way doesn't work cuz they are roms. and please dont say " USE THE SEARCH NUB".. i tried but couldnt find a post relative to that. Thanks :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You did buy the English version, right?

You have to copy the files "_DS_MENU.DAT" and "_DS_MSHL.nds" and the folders "moonshl" and "_system_" to the root level of your microSD card.

Eject your R4 and plug in an authentic DS Game Card, and the games should connect fine. (Read the announcement at the top of the DS Flash Equipment if you disagree.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
