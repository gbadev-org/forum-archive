    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I recieved an EFA not to long ago and I've tested it out a couple times.
<br/>
<br/>
For some reason my PC (running XP) won't reconize my EFA when connected to my PC via, USB. It's asking me for drivers that I've already installed.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried about everything, so I was wondering If I would be able to transfer the demos you guys post here through a usb-to-(ext. port) cable with my EFA.
<br/>
<br/>
I know it's used for others but I was wondering If I could use with EFA, even though it has it's usb port (my isn't working).
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a workaround?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

XP has a f'ed up usb logic every time you plugin the same device into a def usb port xp tries to reinstall the drivers. I don't know but I think it has to do with microsoft trying to make there "OS" "multi user"/"user freindly". at least win2k doesn't get confused with my stuff.<br/>_________________<br/>Comming Soon: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.spyingwind.com" target="_blank">http://www.spyingwind.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That way you don't accidently use the wrong port and make Windows ask for drivers again. It only asks for driver when it's not certified I think.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

At this point, I almost always have to go in to the device manager and "uninstall" the item that shows up on the USB list when I plug in my EFA cable. Then I unplug it and replug it to get the hardware wizard to run again.

It stinks, but it works.

Windows XP stands for Windows eXPerience.  I know this because I watched all the press covering the release approx 3-4 days before official release (Tech-TV had a big story covering it).<br/>_________________<br/>Current high scores on Super Mario 64 DS:

You think it might be a registry problem? Cause I can still view the content (had an ebook on it) that I had on my cart through my DS/GBA, it's just that I can't remove it or add any new content.

<br/>
Maybe I should try Windows 2000 instead.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
