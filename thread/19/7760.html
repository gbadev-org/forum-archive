    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A while ago, my blue DS died when I tried to use a passme 2 with an M3, and natrium42's Sram writer.
<br/>
So, I waited for new stock to come in, and got a new one. I haven't really used it much though becuase it has a quarter tinted top screen and fully tinted touch screen and I'll have to wait for new stock again for a replacement.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd just like to make sure the actual programming of the passme 2, and not just one of the solder points contacting the DS slot could have caused the fuse to blow.
<br/>
The reason I ask this is because of the other topic about the blown fuse which recently popped up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The code definatley isn't at fault, and i most likley isn't caused by a passme short.
<br/>
It seems to happen when the DS has been turned on/off rapidly or left charging for a long period.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I tried it out.
<br/>
Good news: My DS is still working.
<br/>
<br/>
Bad news: A couple of seconds after the health warning screen it white screens.(Or 1 1/4white and 1 green screens)
<br/>
<br/>
I took a look at the board, and I noticed that there seems to be a something connecting two of the pins on the Xilinx chip. 
<br/>
I managed to scrape a bit away, but it's still there.
<br/>
<br/>
So, my question is, is that supposed to be there?
<br/>
In all the diagrams I have seen, all the pins were "independent".
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the game I'm using is SM64DS(US) ASME-1(It says ASMEN1J20 at the back).
<br/>
I assumed this was the ASME1 version of it, since all my games have a 0 where the one is in that number. Was my assumption right? Or does it have to say ASME1 on the front?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, with natrium42's sram writer, there is no option for ASME-1, so I downloaded a .gba file from darkfaders website on the same column as SM64DS ASME1, but it doesn't work either.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any guidance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmm.. Never heard of anything like that, and I can tell you, I beat the hell out of my DS testing PassMes.  I turn it off/on quickly a lot.. and leave it charging over night before I leave for work the next day.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm actually supprised at how good the hardware is holding up to the abuse I am putting it through.. Not to mention that I had tested some 50+ PassMes before it was discoved that we needed to "insulate" the back of the PassMe, so when people blow the internal fuse, I personally can't "imagine" how they are doing it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
