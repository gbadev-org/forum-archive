    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Today I went out and bought a WMB (Ralink) compatible card as well as a new Nintendo DS Lite.
<br/>
<br/>
I already have an EZ-Flash II 512mb GBA Flash Cartridge so I thought I was all set but it looks like I need a NoPass device.  Is this true?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, any comments on the G6 Lite vs Supercard Lite?  I'd like to buy a new flash device that fits perfectly inside the DS Lite.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, you do need a nopass device. WMB doesn't work on DSLite. I wouldn't know why people consistently look at WMB as a PassMe solution. It's difficult to find a working card and then getting it setup. It's much easier to pickup a NoPass, not to mention cheaper.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because they don't want to play musical CF cards for each build once they <span style="font-style: italic">do</span> get their DS flashed. And if you can get by with WiFiMe-&gt;FlashMe, and you happen to be enough of a fanboy to have bought a DS during week one, then you don't have to buy a NoPass. It'll look less attractive once HTTP Download Play becomes stable.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
