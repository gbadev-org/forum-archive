    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just bought a nintendo DS and I am trying to load Linux on it via WifiMe.
<br/>
I bought a supported PCI Wifi card (D-Link DWL-G510 rev C1) but the driver rt2560_driver_1_0_0_8 does not start (gives an error 10).
<br/>
<br/>
I ran PCITree and looks like the Vendor ID/Device ID is
<br/>
1814:0302 (This seems to be the right ID for RT2561 chipset).
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if this device is supported ? Can I get the source code
<br/>
for the driver so I can fiddle with it ?
<br/>
<br/>
Any pointers appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,
<br/>

I just returned the D-Link card and bought myself a Linksys WMP54G.
<br/>
I made the store assistant search for the "oldest" box (based on the serial number), and guess what, it is indeed the right one!
<br/>
<br/>
But now I realised that nintendo DS is not compatible with the windows WMB, however the Linux libnifi based WMB seems promising.
<br/>
<br/>
I am just trying to set this up. BTW, is anyone bothered that there is no working WMB on windows for DS Lite (or for that matter a windows WMB with sources?)
<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking of porting the libnifi to windows, does anyone have any opinions ? (There could be other todo's I can make myself useful with!)
<br/>
<br/>
Regards,
<br/>

I believe libnifi is no longer being maintained and it is not as complete (it cannot do wifime for example) as the linux wmb host I developed. If you do fancy porting  a linux wmb host I would suggest you port my one (source code is available on my website).
<br/>
The OS/platform specific parts (wifi and file access) of the code are seperated out to make porting easier (I have ported the code to DS linux and native nds - both not working for varying reasons). So it should not be too much work to port to Windows.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Neat, I really like this version better. Yeah, I found some bugs in libnifi, infact it couldnt download half the E3 demos!
<br/>
<br/>
With your wmb I can now download all the demos to my DL Lite. Cool!
<br/>
<br/>
I think I will get this version ported, esp. since all the platform related code is already separated out.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
