    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got a R4DS in Asia and it is in Chinese.
<br/>
I downloaded the English version from their website but somehow it does not work.
<br/>
<br/>
For some reason.. only the files from my original CD works corrently
<br/>
i only files _DS_MSHL.NDS and _DS_MENU.DAT that come with my CD are the only ones that .
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any difference in the Hardware for chinese and english version?
<br/>
If so.. can i change via Firmware?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are some instructions at the SCdev forums, though you may need to register first.  Note that it only works on the first batches of R4 and M3 Simply, as later ones have the pads removed, so although the conversion is still possible, it's incredibly difficult and potentially dangerous.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
