    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Using the passme on my ancient DS, I boot the flashme.nds file off of my EZ-Flash 2.  All that comes up after the health warning are 2 white screens (whether I have something in the sl1 slot or not).  Otherwise my passme works fine.
<br/>
<br/>
A couple of questions:  What am I "supposed" to see?  Also, could anyone suggest steps to resolve my problem?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What does your PassMe "work fine" with? Have you tried DesktopMan's Tetris 1.1 from ndshb.com?
<br/>
<br/>
If that worked, have you tried prepending a loader?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">By working fine I mean that my passme is working as it is supposed to.  Using the passme, a real ds cart, and homebrew on my ezflash2, I can execute homebrew code.  
<br/>
<br/>
I tried your suggestion (to the t).  It doesn't work, however something interesting happens.  It goes into the DS menu (where you can go into pictochat or configure system settings).  It doesn't recognize as a cart existing in either slot at this point.  
<br/>
<br/>
For some reason this .nds file, with or without the ndsmall.bin loader, or the ezflash nds or gba loader, or without any loader - doesn't seem to work with my old ds (I got it the first day).  
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions are appreciated!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was able to load the flashme code on my EZFlash2 using the following steps:
<br/>
<br/>
1)  I downloaded the flashme.nds file
<br/>
2)  I renamed the file to "flashme.nds.gba".  
<br/>
3)  I made sure that neither the gba or nds loader were selected in the EZClient software that the EZFlash2 uses.
<br/>
4)  I flashed the software as usual.
<br/>
5)  I booted the software as usual (using my PassMe).
<br/>
6)  The flashme instruction screen came up!
<br/>
<br/>
So the hurdle I overcame was that flashme.nds had to be named flashme.nds.gba
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help!  I hope this info is useful to someone else.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
