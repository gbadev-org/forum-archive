Reading through that topic has made me consider getting a Supercard SD/miniSD if it actually supports autobooting with this firmware hack then, as the extra RAM it has might also be handy down the road. 
<br/>
<br/>
Just to confirm though, as I'm a bit confused after reading through that topic twice now... the firmware hack works with the miniSD version too or no?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It does, but this hack breaks the sound on moonshell's DPG playback (it doesnt work)
<br/>
As far as I know no one knows why...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

do not get the DS-X if you want to start your homebrew quickly. Going through the menu takes roughly 20 seconds to get your homebrew started. Supercard slot-2 devices take around 2 seconds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, I know. :p I have a DS-X, and actively working on a project with it is quickly becoming annoying. This alone wouldn't be enough to make me want to purchase another card (close, but not quite), but the extra ram in a Supercard slot 2 puts it over the top for me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh snap, didnt know the firelink had an autoboot, dont suppose you have a link to information (i really struggle to find any real documentation about it)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's an INI in the DSYSTEM folder that as an autoboot option which you can turn on and off.  The NDS to be autobooted also has to be in the DSYSTEM folder and it should be named AUTORUN.BIN (despite the BIN extension it should be a regular NDS file).
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't tested this, so I don't know how it works.  I don't actually have one of these cards, so I haven't been able to try it.  I was looking forward to getting NeoFlash's version when I made my last post, which is why I'd been looking into the card's features, but the card I was supposed to get from them was lost in the mail and NeoFlash refused to send me a replacement (which seems totally unfair considering the card was a prize I won for my first ever coding effort on the DS and they'll give free ones for review to any monkey with a domain anyway, but...well...I digress).
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know how it works if you try it.  I know that the R4's autoboot feature is sort of lame since it actually loads the regular menu and then loads the AUTOBOOT.NDS file from there rather than loading the autoboot file in place of the GUI.
