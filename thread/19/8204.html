    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can send wifime to my ds using the WMB but i cant get the flashme file to load from my g6 cart... When I download flashme with WMB it loads then i get the nintendo logo and then then bothe screens stay white... My flashme file is on the cart but i dont know why wifime dosen't load it... I have tried appending the file to .nds.gba and flashing it to the cart using the g6 software... i have also tried the drag and drop method but still no luck... i read in another forum that i must patch the file using ndspatcher but the patcher fails to work with it... i went through a lot of trouble looking for a pci card to use wifime and really want this to work...
<br/>
