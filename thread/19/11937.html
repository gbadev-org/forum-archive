    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After a long hiatius, I am looking to get back into DS homebrew. I am looking for an SD-based cart, and I've heard good things about the Supercard SD. However, the shop I am looking to purchase from has the Supercard SD Rumble for a lower price. I've also seen some posts around that suggest that the Rumble card is not as compatible as the regular one. Is this true? Is this a temporary issue that will fade as the Rumble carts come into wider use? Does anyone have other suggestions for other good SD-based carts? I already have a flashed DSheavy, so all I really need is the cart. I would also be interested in a microSD-based card for DSheavy, but it looks like all the micro carts are shorter for the DSlite, and I don't want to have to have miniSD cards bumping around my already cluttered collection of SD and microSD cards.
<br/>
<br/>
Any help or insight is appreciated. Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
1) can't use the advanced features of dslinux
<br/>
2) can't run any gba homebrew
<br/>
3) a few older homebrew will not run (there are some older homebrew that require GBA ROM space to run)

I think libfat works on supercard rumble fine? Though I have not seen this confirmed 100%</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GBA MP is so gigantically huge... I don't understand how anyone would want something like that. :P

Definitely go with the supercard/superkey, they have worked flawlessly for me so far and fit nice n' snug into each slot.. ;D<br/>_________________<br/>Nintendo DS Onyx :: Supercard Lite :: Superkey :: 1GB microSD</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
