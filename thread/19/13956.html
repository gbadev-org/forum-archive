    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Simple WiFi issue. I connect to WiFi perfectly with all my real games (Custom Robo and MPH were my main "test subjects" to see what was wrong). Then, I boot up my Max Media Dock and try to run WiFi Voice Chat Client, DS AIM, and IRC DS (which have all previously connected with no issues). But for some unknown reason, none of those are connecting at all. I tried putting them on my R4 to see if that would help, but the same issue came up.

Anyone know what's wrong or how to fix it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
