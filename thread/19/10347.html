    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
Just wondering what everyone knows about these, I've seen brief mentions of them on a couple threads, but not much detail.  Are people able to launch code from the DS slot?  I'm sort of new to the whole scene, but I don't remember ever seeing anything that eluded to that.  Does anyone have links to the details on how this is being done, is it only the bigger companies or have people been getting this themselves?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, hopefully this wasn't a dumb question...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes: recently there has been "information" released about DS based flash carts.
<br/>
<br/>
as of now.. none of them are supported.
<br/>
GBA carts are working fine and are the backbone of the community.. that said the homebrew community will always grow using newly avaliable technology.
<br/>
<br/>
The future may hold them.. I don't expect the homebrew to switch to DScarts anytime soon.. until the ram expansion is released and can be exploited.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://MrShlee.com/" target="_blank">MrShlee.com</a>

However i can't understand it, as i think at their current state, those devices help more to homebrew (removing the multiple device barrier) then it helps pirates, which have better solutions, as space is a primary decission maker for them.
<br/>
<br/>
But well, google is your friend. There are at least 4 devices i've heard about now.

I got a DS Lite recently and have been playing around (though not making much progress) with devkitPro and various emulators to get some working code, but it doesn't quite do the job. :)  I'd like to get homebrew going on my DS but the price is kind of discouraging.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think your most cost effect method of homebrew right now is a NoPass + GBA MP (CF) as both are fairly cheap.  If you are wanting to develope your own homebrew, than the only real drawback to the GBA MP of not being able to run a few select homebrew/ports out there.. isn't really a drawback for you.  Plus, using Chishm's FAT lib, you will have full read/write access to the CF card..  Plus, a lot of homebrew really take advantage of that feature.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm guessing this is the sort of deal the single slot solutions are going to use.  The NinjaPass somebody mentioned seemed to be (from what I could see) a two card solution, one must load into memory or something, or prepare for the execution from the second, which is basically just storage.  I really don't know any of the details (the pages weren't english), but this still seems sucky.  If the NoPass can run any code, why not build a single card DS slot solution that has an CF/SD/mini-SD slot built in?  It would probably stick out some, but that would still be the most convenient I think.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd love to see a device that just plugs into slot 1, and emulates a DS card using Transflash, without needing any slot 2 device. Sure it might help piracy (not like it could make the process any easier anyway), but think how much easier homebrew would be. You could do things exactly how Nintendo does, people would only need to buy the adapter and a Transflash card, you could connect whatever crazy device to the GBA slot (how about that adapter that lets you plug in NES carts?), etc. If they were cheap (don't see why they wouldn't be, if a NoPass can be $20) they'd be the perfect solution to the problem of having so many different devices that programs need to be compatible with. You wouldn't have to mod your DS at all, you could put an HTTP download play client on it, you could share it with your friends who know nothing about technology, and you wouldn't have to have some big bulky device hanging out of the DS. Plus you could keep a GBA flash cart plugged in, so you could have all your DS homebrew stored on one card in slot 1, and all your GBA homebrew stored on one card in slot 2, and never have to swap cards except to play commercial games. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly I think the money lost to piracy via such a device - keeping in mind that it's already quite possible with other devices, and that most pirates wouldn't have bought the games anyway - would be cancelled out by the money gained by people buying DSes just for homebrew, secure in the knowledge that they don't have to muck around with SRAM, buy some weird GBA cart from a website in Hong Kong, or take the risks associated with firmware flashing. Especially if the device itself promoted and/or came with some of the better homebrew such as Moonshell and DSOrganize.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Except that those people in your little theory aren't going to be buying commercial games so software companies stop writing games for the DS, the console then gets marginalised and discontinued. 
<br/>
<br/>
Still, from what figures I can glean, the DS appears to be one of the most popular handheld consoles in a long time and I sincerely hope that popularity spreads to the Wii.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

There's probably many people who think the games are cool but not worth buying a DS for; cool homebrew could be the push they need.

<br/>
Besides, the DS is incredibly popular. More people buying them for homebrew alone doesn't mean less people buying both them and the games.

Bah, that's just ridiculous.  Did this happen to the GBA (who's software is the easiest to pirate of all consoles in recent memory, aside from maybe the Dreamcast)?  Or the PS?  Or the XBox?

PSP Value Pack: 250 USD; Lumines: $40 at launch (now $30). The issue to Ubisoft and other PSP game publishers is that people who play Luminesweeper on their GBAs aren't buying PSP hardware to play Lumines and then impulse-buying more PSP games now that they have PSP hardware.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
