<br/>
The DS isn't a very strong device, and viewing video's on it is quite a heavy job.
<br/>
To make video's play with a steady rate (and also play audio) the video quality has to be lowered.
<br/>
Still, I think moonshell is doing a great job.
<br/>
Especially when watching anime, it really look s great (as long as you don't create the stuttering).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
