    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Should i use flashme-lite or flashme v7 on my ds lite??? . Im not sure because ive herd flashme-lite can make your ds turn off or somthing and brick it. Why dous that happen is the reson because there flashing the ds with flashme-lite and theres a problem with the flashme-lite file or is it that its just ds lite and either flashme has a chance of bricking it?. Like where dous the problem lay that bricks your ds the ds-lite or the type of flashme im using,
<br/>

OOOO yea if the problem is the flashme-lite version of flashme thats the problem and its not the ds lite thats killing it self could i just change the ds lite to the brightess setting then flash it with regular flashme and it will stay at that brightness steting every time i turn it on after flashing but wont be able to change it. thanks in advance<br/>_________________<br/>I go to pet store and fart on puppys and kittys        ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
