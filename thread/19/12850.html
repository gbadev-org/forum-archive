    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ive been reading up on these guys and they seem to be what im after, but i was just wondering what the maximum storage space it can hold is? The product description states its using FAT file system, but not what type of FAT 16/32? Obviously there is a big difference.
<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, i am wondering if it is viable for the following needs:
<br/>
mp3's
<br/>
videos
<br/>
homebrew games (particulary Doom3DS and Duke3DS)
<br/>
IRC
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.
<br/>
<br/>
Yata.

There are non-SDHC 4GB cards. They are non-standard though, much like 4GB FAT16 partitions. I know the Slot-2 M3 supports it, but I've got no idea if the Simply will.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">wasn't SD designed after CF? it seems odd that they would put the storage limit in, seeing as how CF came like 5 years before SD, and CF has a max size limit of 137GB. it's just something that's always bugged me...why is the older, larger, format, more technically capable?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">CompactFlash is merely parallel <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Attachment" target="_blank">ATA</a> in a different form factor and inherits its addressing scheme (28-bit sector number, 4096 bits per sector). MultiMediaCard and its derivative Secure Digital were also designed to be used in physically smaller and cheaper devices than CF, namely pocket digital audio players and cameras. The rationale was that larger and more expensive devices would use CF. At the time, 32 MB was a lot of memory. Nobody foresaw the faster-than-Moore improvement in flash memory density and the deflationary price wars that ensued.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
