    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
I want to start developing programs / games for the DS and so i need some starting equipment. So I want to ask which is the best solution to start, because there are so many terms in this forum (M3, PassMe, PassKey, FlashMe, Wifi-Me, ...) that i dont know, which is the best solution to start with. The only thing i know yet is, that i have a Wifi-Me compatible network card, but i also want to use my modules without my pc, so a exclusive use of wifi-me is nothing for me. Also the hardware should be available for buying in germany.
<br/>
Maybe someone can give me some advice.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance

Soon ;)
<br/>
I know, there are 2 Versions (Serial Number 12xxxxx and the others). So i can look to get the one or the other, which one is the better alternative?

Thanks for the information. How good is the compatibility with GBAMP 2?
<br/>
And one other question from a noob: when i flash the firmware with wifime and flash me on a new DS (thats possible, isn't it?!?!), can I then also use the GBAMP 2 with a newer DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nope. All you can do are PassMe2 (which only works with a few exploitable games and doesn't work with GBAMP because PassMe2 requires SRAM, which the GBAMP lacks) and ppflash (which requires soldering).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yup, you need PassMe2.. but you can get PassMe2s programmed for pretty much any DS game that has an SWI call.. check out DarkFader's list for compatible DS games:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://darkfader.net/ds/games/" target="_blank">http://darkfader.net/ds/games/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
And, since it provides the .jed file, I can program it prior to shipping..  I can't test it with that perticular game, but I test all PassMes with standard code prior to reprogramming with PassMe2 code, so I know the device is working.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">These are just my personal decisions, so take this data with a grain of salt.  Your needs may be different than mine.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I bought my DS, I deliberately bought an older used one so that I could avoid certain compatability issues once I started dev-ing.
<br/>
<br/>
I ended up paying about $90 (including tax) for the used DS, another $40 for a GBAMP2 + SuperPass, $10 for a cheap USB CompactFlash adapter, and another $10 each for some 128MB CF cards.
<br/>
<br/>
If I had decided to NOT buy a game for the DS, I could have borrowed somebody's commercial game to flash my ROM, but I went ahead and bought a used Mario64 for $15.
<br/>
<br/>
$90 DS
<br/>
$40 GBAMP2 + SuperPass
<br/>
$10 CF Adapter
<br/>
$10 CF Card
<br/>
$15 Mario64
<br/>
<br/>
So for a total of about $165 (including the DS), I was jamming, and everything worked as-advvertised.  BTW, flashing the DS was easy: I just followed the directions exactly as written.  So now, I don't even need the SuperPass.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Although certainly not what I started out with, I currently use a GBAMP 2 and a ralink card to develop.
<br/>
<br/>
I stick non-code stuff on the CF card, and then transfer the binary over via WMB while testing, and I can leave the binary on the CF when I'm done, and run my code away from the PC.  This way I don't have to take the CF out while bug-fixing, only when creating new art or grabbing debug logs, and if I got around to making a ftp-ish program, I wouldn't even need to then.
<br/>
<br/>
Like others have said, the one drawback to the GBAMP is that it doesn't have SRAM, so it cannot be used for passme2, but if you can get a used DS or a new one that has been at the store since before October (sadly, doesn't seem to be a particularly good way to tell by serial number (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.dspassme.com/dstrackerlist.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.dspassme.com/dstrackerlist.shtml</a>)), then you're probably fine with a regular passme.

In the US, NU41 is a guaranteed new-firmware :(, (NU40 can be either), but also beware of refurbished ones, as they could also have new firmware (danger everywhere, I'm afraid).<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

How can you say that?  Mines a NU40, and PR's is a NU41, and both have old firmware..  I think if anything, the SN list on dspassme.com proves that there is NO WAY to tell based off of SN..  Basically, if you purchased after Oct. 1st, expect new firmware.. if before, you <span style="font-style: italic">should</span> be safe..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My luck is, that i live in europe, where you can see what firmware is installed if you have a look at the serial number. (&gt; 111..... is new firmware).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
