    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I sold my M3 CF over a month ago just after the DSLite came out because of it's size, and I was eagerly awaiting the release of such products as the G6Lite and EZ4Lite, but upon checking out sites like Divineo and Winsunx I came across this handy little device:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">URL removed by MOD</span>
<br/>
<br/>
There are 3 products there, and the broken English on both Winsunx and the official site really aren't helping me, but I was wondering a few things:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Does this work as well as M3/G6/EZ4/etc.?
<br/>
2) What do I have to buy?  What are all of those products?
<br/>
<br/>
That's really it, thanks a lot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well it depends on its loaders but if it ran howmbrew its compat will only be good (max) as GBAMP since it lacks any ram which ofcourse means you have to run small binaries.

<br/>
I dont know but it will also mean that gbfs wont work since the device looks like a data streamer(due to lack of ram) and homebrew apps cant be patchced with their arghhh patcher.
<br/>
<br/>
if homebrew has anychance of working on it it would:
<br/>
1-the main menu should be hacked, and the whole homebrew rom should be loaded to the ram
<br/>
2-homebrew has to be rewritten with its i/o code
<br/>
3-or homebrew would need to be written with NITROFAT then patched with their patcher</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
