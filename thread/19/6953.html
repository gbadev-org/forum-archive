    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As my topic earlier stated, I had no luck with WMB v1.4 --- "can't find header.bin"
<br/>
<br/>
However, I had luck with v1.0.
<br/>
<br/>
However, v1.0 seems like it's only good for launching a .NDS off of a cart... there doesn't seem to be a way to have it send a .NDS from my PC to the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
( Note: Using v1.0, I was able to flash my DS, so this point is slightly moot.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
