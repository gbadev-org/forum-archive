    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello there,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry in the case this is not a homebrew reflection, but was asking me if that dreammy crazy functionality might be possible with the couple FlashMe / flash card:
<br/>
<br/>
The idea is to extract all the ascii text we can find in a commercial game(main &amp; options menus, story...), then translate them thanks to great charitable souls and dump the translated Ascii memory map into the a flashcard, and finally have a firmware which will be able to load/manage the original commercial game with the ascii text replacement.
<br/>
<br/>
I saw a darkfader's pict/video where he done something similar on Metroid. Did you needed to modify the full rom and break the encryption to have been able to re-label that text?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not interest by DS's ROMz, only want to know if a language selection mechanism could be a possible way.
<br/>
<br/>
So is that possible or will we have to be happy enough with our imported DS games(or waitting the native language for some important stories specific games) ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I remember people doing translations of pokemon games ages ago, so I suppose with the rom and heaps of free time it is possible. But of course to translate the rom yourself you would really need to speak both languages meaning you could just play the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I say just wait and buy it in your language. RPG's are pretty bad to play in another language (I tried to play Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicals in japanese and it was a real pain), but games like Wario Ware and so forth are an even better challenge!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

So where can I buy a genuine copy of the official English translation of, say, Final Fantasy 3 (J) or Mother (J)? I've already been waiting since the NES era. Point is that not all games that have demand in a given language will eventually have a supply in that language before you die.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
