    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have the v1.17 kernel and soft reset appears totally disinclined to work.  I've tried switching it on per-app and for all apps and it's just doing squat.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone got any clue why (beside crap kernel software)?  swiSoftReset() doesn't work either.

It's not the end of the world but it's pretty annoying.<br/>_________________<br/>It's not an illusion, it just looks like one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not very many homebrew applications will soft-reset correctly, and those that do have a higher chance of success on older devices for which Lick managed to write reset code for.  I know the CycloDS Evolution and Supercard DS contain features that patch homebrew files to soft-reset, but I don't know how good the compatibility is for that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
