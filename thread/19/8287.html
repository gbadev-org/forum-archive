Looks like part of the link got nicked by a word filter. :-(
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, pros/cons of SD:
<br/>
+Smaller
<br/>
+Faster
<br/>
-Most homebrew is designed for CF
<br/>
-No firmware hacks currently available for GBAMP SD, if you're using it
<br/>
<br/>
CF:
<br/>
+Compatible with nearly all homebrew
<br/>
+Harder to lose ;-)
<br/>
-Slower
<br/>
-Easier to break (them little tiny pins)
<br/>
-Somewhat outdated; CF will probably die out in a few years, while SD (if it's not replaced by something even better) will still be common
<br/>
<br/>
Both are about the same price, so it mainly depends what you want. If you want to use existing homebrew, get a CF and a GBAMP for best compatibility. If you want to write your own and don't care a whole lot about compatibility (IIRC current libs support both anyway, just that older programs were compiled with libs that don't), an M3 SD might be a better option. If you just want to use NES and Gameboy emulators, a GBAMP can do this without any hacking. (CF version at least, pretty sure SD can too.) If you want SNES emulation or the ability to play MP3s and movies, go with M3 SD (GBAMP's built-in music/movie playback suck, since they don't take advantage of DS's full power) and use Moonshell and SnesDS. And if you just want movies and music, there's an official adapter by Nintendo that does this (pretty sure it uses SD); like GBAMP, it's only designed for GBA, but it has an on-board MPEG decoder, so it should do a much better job.
<br/>
<br/>
Either way I suggest you also get a flash multi-writer, and a WMB-compatible wifi card if you intend to write your own apps. I have a Flash Genie URH722, which is very nice; reads and writes CF, SD, MSPro, MSC and SMC, sits in a 3 1/2" bay, adds 2 USB ports, and you can remove the actual reader and plug it into another computer's USB port. :-D For wifi cards any PCI (<span style="font-weight: bold">not USB</span>) card with a Ralink RT2500 or RT2560 will work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't understand how "Most homebrew is designed for CF"... Aren't both CF and SD storage means? Or the difference is that they have different structure?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,I want to write my own apps,but I surely want to test other peoples apps,so I think <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bb92q" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/bb92q</a> would be a good choice,huh?
<br/>
<br/>
I already have a compartible wireless card with the modified driver installed (having the E3 2005 + various Jap demos surely is a privilege),so I just need to buy this and a CF card... :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The code required to access each type of card is different. Newer programs should be able to do both, but some of the older ones only know how to work with CF.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
