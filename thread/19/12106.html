    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I may have found a solution for those who keeps getting the CF card not formated eror message. It seems like the pins don't make a proper contact in the DS. So I opened the GBAMP and added 2 layers of electric tape just on the edge under the connectors. That will raise the board a bit so the case won't close flush but it still fits in the gba slot. This solved my problem for good. Hope this can help others
