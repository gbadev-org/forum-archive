    <h4>#127174 - dantheman - Mon Apr 30, 2007 4:46 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most likely you're referring to the fact that many DS Lites have a tendency to turn off in the middle of flashing, creating a brick.  As far as I know, this still occurs, and the recommended solution is to use a tool insulated all around except for the tip, and to make absolutely sure you go straight in so you don't hit the other two contacts.
<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, flashing on a DS Lite with a device FlashMe can't boot is risky, since you won't be able to initiate the emergency recovery booting if the DS turns off mid-flash.  You can borrow a friend's slot-2 device and use the recovery mode then, but you can't do it yourself on a slot-1 device or MMD (and now the MK 2/3 as well?)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  didn't see Lynx's post there where he mentioned that slot-1 recovery mode doesn't exist at the moment</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But a little more information on your "official download page" would help, for example if this versions are also for NDS lite and a list of button configurations (Select=Boot from Slot1 etc.) If you dont like to write docs, I think a lot of people would be happy to help you with that ;)

<br/>
If you have a slot-2 card that FlashMe normally autoboots, first eject all cartridges to get to the DS menu and then change it to "boot to menu by default" mode instead of Automatic mode.  Then hold Select only upon bootup to access the firmware menu, and from there you can load the DS game cartridge.  I can't get it to autoboot to the DS card like it used to, but it's not a big problem since you can get to the menu itself.

One fix: Assign each booting method to a direction on the +Control Pad, and try booting that method only if the proper button is held. <ul><li>Up: MK2 </li><li>Down: PassMe </li><li>No button: Try official firmware, much like Select on normal FlashMe </li></ul> If possible, modify the help screen to list them.
<br/>
<br/>
dantheman: You can get the same effect by holding Select+Start+power on. Select skips FlashMe's check for game code in SLOT-2, while Start skips the check for DS and GBA games. (At least this worked on FlashMe 7.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

flashme.nds is in root of card.

<br/>
<br/>
No carts in, Select+Start then power on blinks the light, so recovery code is okay...

<br/>
<br/>
Only SuperCard CF in, Select+Start then power on...when I let go of Select+Start the SC's file selector comes up where I'm able to run FlashMe.  I'm guessing it's correctly in recovery mode since the brightness isn't what it's normally set to.

Only R4 in, Select+Start then power on...I instantly see the R4's "Loading" text on the top screen for a split second then 2 black screens.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good to hear; your results with the icon and name weren't unexpected (the R4 header dump I did a while back showed no sign of an icon or name). Just out of curiosity, the modification you tested doesn't override the "default boot" setting in the firmware, does it (so one should still be able to choose to autoboot R4, anyway).
<br/>
<br/>
How about a way to basically configure flashme.nds to your own preference before flashing it (perhaps a builder app instead of just plain pre-constructed .nds files)? Though, a "simple" built in config screen would indeed be the cats.... meow (as if it wasn't in V7, as-is anyway). PSP "custom firmware" recovery menu is the first thing to come to mind when you mention it, though.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">JLsoft</span>: try reseating your R4 or something, the slot1 recovery code boots up into R4's menus for me (gba slot empty).
<br/>
edit:/ looks like it changed its mind, now it won't do it (only swapped SD cards)
<br/>
edit2:/ there it goes again, swapped out SD cards and it started working, swapped back and it is working on both now... how odd.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by cory1492 on Tue May 01, 2007 7:06 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

It still won't do anything on my DS Lite though! I'm shorting SL1 with all manner of different things and nothing happens. WTF!

<br/>
Hm, and with slot-1 booting, recovery mode can be used as a quick-boot function. Hold Start+Select at bootup and your DS game loads instantly. :-p It works with Diddy Kong Racing at least.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Finally got it to work here every 1 in 50 tries or so, sometimes after deleting the .SYS, renaming the Themes dir so it can't load skins, ejecting/reinserting the card or cart, and other times by letting go of Select+Start right as I see the light blink...can't narrow it down, but at least I've seen it work more than once :D

My theory is that the NinjaDS is generating a card removal interrupt when it receives the MK2 "prod". This isn't picked up until the firmware gets to displaying the menu screen, which is why it freezes there. Perhaps you could just intercept the interrupt before it gets processed by the firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, START+SELECT is the combination used to skip nopass booting and autobooting of the DS card (if this is set in the firmware). Maybe add in L+R to the combination.

Wait, why can't you make a Pictochat-less version? That would free up space for the developer(s) at virtually no loss for the end user (since Pictochat is mainly a useless tech demo).
<br/>
Another thing you could take out if you need space is the alarm clock, though I don't know if it's big enough to merit a removal. It is THE single most useless thing on the DS, if you close the DS (which you most likely will when sleeping :/) It is so quite that you can hardly hear it. Of course, that would be in a seperate version so that people could still have all the original features of the Nintendo firmware if they wanted to.
<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, a good homebrew FW can come out, which, by the way, would own. Hopefully it would stay alive longer than the rest, as long as flashme even :O. I seem to remember a few Homebrew FWs that had one initial release or announcement and has not been heard from since.
<br/>
<br/>
Other thoughts: a config before flashing would be nice, and it would eliminate the need for a billion different versions. You could posibly offer patches for small things like inserting the MK2/3 boot code to boot the DSLink if that's possible. tepple's idea of pressing different D-Pad buttons for Different bootups would work too.
<br/>
<br/>
Chism: what would this useful feature be? Just out of curiosity, I would like to know, even though knowing would be of no practical use to me :P

I've had a few customers who've bought from me, flashed and then had a screen or hinge break sometime later.  I've also had two customers who had their DS Lite power down and they didn't realise there was a recovery keystroke (why does the DS Lite power down sometimes during flashing and sometimes sail though it?).
<br/>
All of them returned their consoles to Nintendo or their point of purchase (both Europe and US) with no issues.  I myself had two faulty DS's (slot problems) both flashed, both returned through Nintendo UK under warranty.
<br/>
So, as far as I know, nobody has ever had a problem. I guess they just recycle them - maybe it's too expensive to repair small electronics items.  I did have one customer who said 'the service rep' quizzed her as to whether she'd used it with a flash cart or flashed her faulty console, but when I did my return, it was entirely web-driven and I spoke to no-one.
<br/>
<br/>
I do know that the fuse that can blow is the one that will blow if any rogue commercial cart malfunctions, so a bricked console could have been caused by a Nintendo product.  Guess the fuse is there to stop the official rumble pack drawing too much current.

When I bought my DS Lite, the original one I bought had signs of use (someone's name was already in the firmware). I took it back and they told me that Nintendo sent them a shipment of refurbished units.

That was worst-case scenario. My original estimate was 4KiB. ~200 bytes for the backlight handler, ~100 bytes for the hook signature, ~100 bytes for the hook, ~1KB for the patcher. Actually, now that I think about it, it's probably do-able in 2KB. That's still too big to fit, unfortunately.

No. The RTC chip has a bit that gets cleared when it loses power. The DS firmware checks this, and if it sees that the power was lost, it goes through most of the setup routine, despite the data still being in firmware.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

Don't worry, I have a DS Phat. It won't reset.

I'm worried about the battery though. An good method to keep it in place?

Ok, I've flashed it now (no autoboot) and it's working! Yay!

I used some tape and a lego brick to keep the battery in place.

And I shorted the pins with a busted LED (I made sure both legs where connected on the LED).

It would be usable at all times(not just during DS games), correct? I would assume so, since it's a feature of the firmware.

Okay, I'll need a bit of time to work on it. I have to trim it by 20 bytes (10 instructions!) for it to work on all games. I plan to fit it in the NDS header logo area (156 bytes) which should hopefully be unused in any official game.

It only rewrites the parts of the NVRAM (what the firmware is stored on) that contain code and headers for the code. Data, like your MAC address, name and personal message are left in tact. I'm not sure what you'd need a checksum for, but you could write an app to read the entire NVRAM chip and checksum across it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

i am french so i use a translator for help me :) :)

 I have a ds lite that I had bought in December and I have flashme V7   because I have in my possession a  supercard lite micro sd I have some small questions :) :).
<br/>
<br/>
 1) I have m3 simply now and when I have the supercard lite the ds start  directly on the supercard in the slot 2, i need the flashme v8 ? 
<br/>
<br/>
2) if I flashe in v8 i must remake the bridge sl1 ?
<br/>
<br/>
3)now I  have a linker slot 1, I do not have too the utility of flashme, i take flashme v8 or to try a noflahme for ds lite? 
<br/>
<br/>
and finally 
<br/>
<br/>
4) which is the disadvantage of leaving the flashme 7 or 8 on a ds lite by keeping one m3 simply on the ds lite?  ( for the hardware and the battery ) 
<br/>
and for the bug when i closing  my ds with my supercard lite micro sd  ?
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. If you use the noauto boot version then it won't automatically start your supercard in slot 2
<br/>
<br/>
2.  Yes you will need to bridge SL1 again
<br/>
<br/>
3.  Use flashme8
<br/>
<br/>
4.  You can leave your M3 Simply in slot-1 and still have flashme installed.  It will drain slightly more battery than having an empty slot-1 but you still get plenty of play time<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

v2.  noflashme installs the version you started with.   You can change the version by pushing select (before doing the XBXB thing).  Undocumented feature ;)</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
