    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am running a M3 SD, and I was wondering if the PassMe 2-Z works with the version 4 NDS firmware?
<br/>
<br/>
There is severely limited documentation on the web for this Card, so I did not know anywhere else to turn.
<br/>
<br/>
I heard somewhere the PassMe 2-Z was having trouble in the newer firmware, but I did not know if that included v4 (yellow), or only v5 (magenta).
<br/>
<br/>
I'll post my result with the Version4 Firmware here when I recieve the PassMe 2-Z in a few days, but I was wondering if anybody else knew this ahead-of-time...
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by sigmaxix on Mon Mar 13, 2006 6:03 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think that the review <a class="postlink" href="http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=29641" target="_blank"> here</a> is talking about the 2-Z...
<br/>
<br/>
Instead, I think the PassMe 2-Z is a different product.  Look at this auction to see the label differences <a class="postlink" href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=8266046875" target="_blank"> here</a>. Also, <a class="postlink" href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=zh_en&amp;trurl=http://www.mygbalink.com/" target="_blank"> manufacturer's</a> Chinese site where they make the PassMe 2-Z says it completely works with the new NDS Lite.
<br/>
<br/>
The site <a class="postlink" href="http://shop.01media.com/en/info.asp?ProductID=16519" target="_blank"> here</a> that shipped the item to the reviewer calls the "PassMe Upgrade" a <span style="font-weight: bold">clone</span> of the "PassMe 2-Z" in the second sentence.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I wrote the person who made the original PassMe, and he said the PassMe 2 (Z) should work with the new firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, the one the GBATemp reviewer got was a <span style="font-style: italic">clone</span> that has a different sticker on the card.  He also mentions NO PassMe 2-Z ID Sticker was on his box.
<br/>
<br/>
I will have the item probably tomorrow, so I can confirm if it is working or not with the V4 Firmware NDS.  This actually is beginning to look like the best Pass-thru option since there is no "invasive surgery" of SL1.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">[EDIT:]
<br/>
I GOT IT WORKING!
<br/>
<br/>
The Box <span style="font-style: italic">DOES</span> say that it works with both the NDS and NDS-Lite.
<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 ways of getting this to work.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, you can download <a class="postlink" href="http://mygbalink.com/passme2zgba.zip" target="_blank">Passme2zgba.zip</a> from mygbalink.com to program the SRAM into the PassMe 2-Z.  Just copy the right .GBA file from the PassMe2-Z Box and run.
<br/>
<br/>
OR you can go to <a class="postlink" href="http://darkfader.net/ds/games/" target="_blank">DarkFader's</a> and download the .SAV for the file, then copy it to the root directory of your SD card as "sram.dat".
<br/>
<br/>
However, programming the card correctly took too many tries to get it right.  I would keep getting 2 white screens on my NDS, which means I did something wrong in programming the SRAM.
<br/>
<br/>
This took a long time for me to figure out.  It's probably not as good as FlashMe, but it does work and keeps you from using Tin Foil &amp; a Toothpick to short SL1.  Plus, who knows if Metroid Prime: Hunters will detect FlashMe?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Or.. who cares?  There would be nothing they could do about it anyway, and even if they could, it would only be a matter of time before the new version of FlashMe would bypass whatever method they used to try and stop it.  You can't loose your recovery code without shorting SL1, so if you insert Metroid Prime: Hunters and it tell you to short SL1.. then you might have a problem.. :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How would you suggest that it be undone? If the program checks for any firmware that isn't either 1. digitally signed by Nintendo using RSA or 2. bit-identical to one of the first six official firmware versions, then no version of FlashMe can reasonably hide from detection code.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The problem with this is people with homebrew (piracy) hardware can keep changing their MAC if it gets banned. If they happen to use one that someone else without homebrew hardware has, that other person will be banned for no reason other than they were unlucky. Going by past experience, Nintendo would never do such a thing, since they err on the side of caution.
