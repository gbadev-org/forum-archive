<br/>
<br/>
do I need to patch the file first? I've read that DS Lazy is a good tool but I don't understand how to get it running.

thanks for any help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is FlashMe the first homebrew you've ever run? Or have you managed to get <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com/modules.php?name=Downloads&amp;d_op=viewdownload&amp;cid=6" target="_blank">t*tr*s  (ds.gba file)</a> to run first?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was able to run the tetris file nds.gba without a loader in EZclient.
<br/>
<br/>
My experience has been that the cart works when there is a .gba or nds.gba
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps that's why the flashme.nds doesn't run? And for some reason I've never come across a good patcher that will work for my .nds files.
<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean by bootloader? Is that the menu setting on the DS (auto/manual) or the Ezclient (Loader/NdsLoader)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The latter. A lot of GBA flash card writing programs (such as ezclient) like to write a GBA-mode ROM selection menu even if only one ROM is written.
<br/>
<br/>
But even if the loader is turned off, some programs like to "fix" the cart header to GBA-mode standards, removing the built-in loader inside many newer .nds files. If you can't figure out how to turn off GBA header correction in your writing program, then use dsbuild or dslazy to add a .nds loader, and you will get a ds.gba file that should be more resistant to misguided "fixing".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

ndstool never worked for me, the screen would just flash for a split second, so I downloaded .net framework. Is that the same as .net runtime?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, that didn't work... even though I don't even know what the .net installation did to my computer.

<br/>
please help</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The .NET Framework allows your computer to run applications written in the C# programming language and applications written in a version of the Visual Basic programming language later than VB6.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
My problem is most likely common amongst the ez-flash 2PS users.
<br/>
<br/>
I used to be able to just patch .nds files into .gba but now nothing works. I tried to follow the steps as you suggested and I did manage to patch a file using nds lazy... but .nds files never work on my ez client.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a v.1 nds (freezes) and if someone knows what to do, perhaps once being in the same situation, I ask that you please help.
