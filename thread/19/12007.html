    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For those who may have seen my topic I made a few weeks ago I did get my GBAMP fixed, when I took it apart somehow the CF reader, or maybe the whole circut board got flipped around so I had to insert the CF card a different way(I felt like a total idiot) Now heres the new problem with my GBAMP which I hope is just as obvious, and I'm to painicked/to much of a noob to figure it out. My brother wanted to play a demo I had recently downloaded, so I let him. About a few min later I hear him calling me, so I go over to see whats wrong, and there is the Firmware hack for the GBAMP open(obviously in GBA mode..not sure how he did that as my DS is now flashed) He  had pressed the L+R and Select command I think....it was the other command other then the firmware hack. I freaked out cause it said something about how it had erased a certain amount of data in KB's or something...am I screwed?-or can I be saved? Any help at all I welcome.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It just gives me a black screen. Then if I take the CF card out it says there isnt one in(like its supposed to) but when I press start it just freezes, before it just went black</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Put a GBAMP update file on the card and update it (update.e19 for example). Then try running the hack again.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok thanks, do I need to re-name the update, or leave it as it is?
<br/>
Also, should I format my card/remove everything thats on it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The update file needs to be named update.eXX where XX is the version number. It has to be in the root directory of your card. I don't know of any other restrictions.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
