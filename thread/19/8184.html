Sort of...there's a specific hole in the back of the DS under the battery cover, it's normally covered by a red and white striped sticker (the hole where you can reach the SL1 contact).  You need to short a pad that's in there...refer to the picture on the FlashMe website if you're unsure of what you're supposed to short, you don't want to go randomly sticking metal bits into any other spot (the other holes you can see under the battery cover) than the SL1 contact.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
