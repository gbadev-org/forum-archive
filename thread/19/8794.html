    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a problem.
<br/>
I got hit by the darkfader trojan. I tried using his flashmp.nds to recover my DS. I have a Supercard SD version. However, I incorrectly pressed the option to recognise a Supercard CF card. 
<br/>
The DS now boots, but will not let me use the Supercard SD card, as it comes up with an error CF card not found. 
<br/>
I have tried using the Supercard SD with a Gameboy advance but it comes up with the same message. 
<br/>
Does this mean that Flashmp has overridden the firmware on the Supercard, and importantly can I recover from this? 
<br/>
I hope you guys can help me out
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does the maker of SuperCard offer a repair program? You might be able to use a GBA with either an MBV2 or another GBA card to load a repair program, pak-swap to your damaged SuperCard, and then start repair.

<br/>
Posting your question at Pocket Heaven or scdev.org might be useful, as the people there are probably pretty good at troubleshooting obscure flash card problems.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So the Supercard works, but can't find the card because it's looking for the wrong one? In this case you'd probably have to flash it from a program running on the DS or GBA, either by WMB (DS) or multiboot cable (GBA).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
