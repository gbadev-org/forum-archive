What do you do if you are just updating your firmware, say for mario kart? Get the new flashme.nds, use wifime to send to nds while connecting the contact in the back?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you're just updating an already flashed firmware, you can download FlashMe via Download Play, then press the button combination it says on the screen.  You don't need to start shorting SL1 until FlashMe is loaded and starting to flash.
<br/>
<br/>
In most cases though, you probably won't need to short SL1 when just updating FlashMe on a previously flashed DS, it'll just flash automatically when  you get it started.  The Mario Kart update is a special case.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
