    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since the DS lite is coming to Europe in the next days I'm considering to buy one. But of course I want to be able to start homebrew software on it (especially scummvm :).
<br/>
Since I have a old PassMe1 (Board v1.4 by natrium42), which has a CPLD and accessible JTAG pins on it, I've been wondering if it is possible to turn it into a NoPass. Is there a public available NoPass implementation as VHDL or Verilog file? (the only implementations i know are those sold commercially) Would it be possible to use the CPLD on the PassMe1 (xc9572xl) for such a implementation?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good idea!
<br/>
But there is a flash chip in the nopass cards... so i don't think it's possible without it :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, NoPasses don't use CPLD.
<br/>
<br/>
Although if you want to run homebrew and have something other than a GBAMP2, you could make your old PassMe1 a PassMe2...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Datel's implementation of a NoPass uses an FPGA, you can think of it as a CPLD, only bigger and badder. Last time I checked, there was no public encryption implemention. Perhaps it would be possible to make the design fit a CPLD, perhaps not, but it's not possible to do what you ask at the moment, and most likely never.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">PassMe is ONLY a CPLD.  And, they had to squeeze the code into the current CPLD on it.. so I dought there would be room to implement a NoPass on the current CPLD either way.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
