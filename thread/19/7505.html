I would HIGHLY recommend installing FlashMe though, as both lose the SRAM data.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hm...not to be a pain in the boots, but with the M3 if you were to boot something on the NDS side that saved to SRAM and had made an autosave file for it (one of those save dats from the NDSSAVE folder  renamed to "filename of NDS program minus extension.dat") and have autosave activated it should back it up even if you reboot into GBA mode (normally, except with autosave, I don't think it lets you back up an NDS mode save while in GBA mode for some strange reason).
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, autosave is available only with a recent firmware update for the thing.  
<br/>
<br/>
It's still would be a pain to have to upload the PassMe2 SRAM every time though even using this.  An extra step you would'nt need to do, besides, FlashMe is just easier.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
