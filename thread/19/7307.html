    <h4>#58866 - Darkflame - Wed Oct 26, 2005 10:16 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got a PassMe a few days ago and have been happly using it for running homebrew apps (using a GBAMP).
<br/>
I decided to try to change my DS's firmware, but (foolishly) didnt pay enough attention to the instructions.
<br/>
<br/>
I started the program and hit the XBXB buttons, but didnt check to bridge the SL1 contact's first.
<br/>
The program is currently paused at 0% and I cant find my screwdriver the right size to get the back off the battery socket ( its around here somewhere...).
<br/>
<br/>
Now:
<br/>
a) If it says 0% has it *really* done nothing, and can it be turned off ?
<br/>
(remember the SL contacts have never been bridged yet)
<br/>
<br/>
b) Are you sure?, and thank you.
<br/>
<br/>
I am hopeing nothing bad can happen without those things being bridged, but am not going to take the risk, so its going to be pluged in and on that screen till someone replies :)
<br/>
Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ps. Sorry again. I know how irrateing these sorts of posts can be.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Btw, when I do flash the firmware, I can bridge those contacts at any time right? (as long as I keep them bridged till its done)
<br/>
I dont have to bridge it before I load it up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">that's right...it doesn't even matter when you pause during bridging/flashing (it can be kinda hard to keep the screwdriver in one place all the time) so there's nothing to worry about as far as that's concerned, as long as you don't turn off the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
(btw. beforehand I made the same mistake as you and turned it off and nothing went wrong, as pepsiman said).
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, not to be dramatic but some people reported mario kart (demo?)messed up flashme, allthough it seems to be nothing you can't easily restore.
