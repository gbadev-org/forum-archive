    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">start up the DS and I'm greeted by blackscreen and "Loading...."
<br/>
<br/>
thinking that maybe it's just a fluke, or maybe my SD card is corrupted, I reseat everything
<br/>
<br/>
same thing.  take the microSD card out, connect it to my laptop and it loads up fine.  filesystem completely intact, nothing garbled, etc etc
<br/>
<br/>
so I then just insert the R4 without the SD and turn on the DS
<br/>
it should start complaining about not seeing the SD, but still just "LOADING..."
<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping that I'm overlooking something simple, but I'm starting suspect my R4 has gone south
<br/>
<br/>
any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I had a problem with my ds-x, and modchipstore.com gladly refunded my money with the cooperation of the ds-x team. (nice guys, all of em')
<br/>
<br/>
I ended up going for something without on-board memory after that. seems easier to deal with, and organizing things is more feasable.
<br/>
<br/>
if you can't swing a refund, then oh well. r4's only like 30 bucks. less than a newly released NDS game.<br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hey, it worked for me.
<br/>
<br/>
To clarify:
<br/>
<br/>
I was at work copying to stuff to the R4. My work PC is a linux system. I was trying to get skins working and somewhere along the way the R4 started presenting the issue you described. I paniced for a little, then used dosfsck (A linux-only tool) and mkdosfs (Another linux-only tool) to format the card and fix any errors on it.
<br/>
<br/>
Using windows, you should probably do a right-click, Format on the card and then run Scan-Disk on it afterwards just to be sure, before re-copying all files to the card.

if the R4 is giving errors without a SD card, how could formatting the SD card possible fix the problem?

(fwiw, I did reformat the card, I also tried 3 other cards, as well as use the 3 cards in my brother's R4 where they worked just fine)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have a working R4 and a working microSD card. Removing the SD card produces an error. Have you tried cleaning the R4's DS card edge? It's more difficult to clean a DS card than a GBA card, as you need something pointer than a typical cotton swab, but it's possible.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yup
<br/>
<br/>
I pulled everything apart, cleaned everything, it's just dead
<br/>
<br/>
it's mid-RMA now, so hopefully modchipstore.com will send me a new one soonish
<br/>
<br/>
in the meantime, I'll probably just borrow my brother's R4, and hit up flashme, so that I can just use my M3 lite until my R4 shows up</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Looks like we suffered the same symptoms: (Loading..., then a black screen) but possible for entirely different reasons...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

mine never got past the Loading.... to a black screen
<br/>
<br/>
well, to be fair, I never let it sit on the Loading.... longer than 5 mins, so maybe it might have eventually gotten there</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
