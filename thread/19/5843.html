    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is the firmware just a .nds with a different starting point.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason i ask is that i am wondering if it would be possible to load the flashme as a .ds.gba file using wifime, so that i can use the rsa free uploads by loading it from wifime first. This way i do not have to flash my firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think your in a catch 22 there. You cant get the firmware via wifi download until you install the firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
At least thats what i think your asking, i  just woke up.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, sorry, i would like to put it on my gba flash card and load it through wifime so that i can use the wifi download play function without having to install it. Saving me timeby being able to send via wifi rather than linking my gbasp to my comp and programming the flash cart each time and swapping back to the ds and then doing wifime.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

*cough*yesyoucan*cough*....  (well, sorta)
<br/>
<br/>
basically, the best sollution would be to upgrade the firmware.  its a 1 time deal, then you no longer have the RSA restriction on downloads.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-
