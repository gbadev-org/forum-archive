    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was just wondering... every flashcart I've seen has just been a cart, with a PC interface. Would it not be possible to make a flashcart that uses expansion cards? It would mean that you could use a standard SD reader to flash new code, and be able to use more SD cards for further expandability, or to keep multiple copies of a game or app.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, it sounds like a good idea to me, I'm surprised it hasn't been implemented. Any thoughts on this?<br/>_________________<br/>Rohaq</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Although an SD one would be nicer; SD cards are smaller, meaning it could be less bulky, and they seem to be taking over from the older CF cards, so it's more likely that people would already own one.<br/>_________________<br/>Rohaq</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If that requires no extra hardware.. then yes, that's exactly what I had in mind :O<br/>_________________<br/>Rohaq</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
That aside, this does seem like a really nice piece of kit. Normal flash memory is too slow to run from ordinarily, so this cart must copy the image from SD and onto some internal ram so the GBA can run it.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd be interested to hear from anybody who has this equipment. I'd like to have it, but it seems to make reference to requiring converter software which would be a problem on Linux (although it can probably be run under Wine). Does anybody know if it needs its own software, or if you can just copy a ROM file to the SD card?
<br/>
<br/>
Has anybody used this company? I think I remember some people saying bad things about them, but might be thinking of another company.
<br/>
<br/>
At just $60, I think I might just buy it then suck it and see.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i used linker4u. i'd give it a 3/10. 
<br/>
<br/>
i ordered an XG2 turbo 512m cart from them, and waited 2 weeks with no information, though i called my card company, and the credit card information came through and there was a nice fat charge there. i emailed them repeatly and got no responce (FYI, and they use hotmail as a mail server). after posting here and on the pocket heaven forums, someone here (i think it was tepples but i'm unsure) contacted them and asked what was going on. it seems that they didn't have any left in stock, but just recieved a shipment and they will be sending it out now. now this is after i emailed them twice regarding the matter. however the cart did get to me, and thats why they recieved a 3/10. though it wasn't sent express, or even recieve a discount or anything because of the delay with no info. dont use credit, use paypal if you can. or even better, use someplace else.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a SuperCard SD, it copies the ROM to the memory off the SD (into 512mb RAM IIRC) but it also allows you to watch movies off the SD (not sure how it does that , direct off the sd or some form of cache to the RAM). 
<br/>
<br/>
I have found that the patching ROM isnt all that necisarry, the soft is mostly for making the corresponding .sav file. It can actually make some games slow down, a good forum where they discuss this at length can be found at <a href="http://supercard.mine.nu/" target="_blank">http://supercard.mine.nu/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Although the SC is compatible with the DS at this point, it does not work with DS mode software.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the information, everyone, particularly the Linker4u feedback. I'll ask my local importer, <a href="http://www.gbax.com/" target="_blank">http://www.gbax.com/</a> , if they're going to import this device.
<br/>
<br/>
It seems pretty obvious that I will need to run a Windows application to use this cart, but because it's basically just converting files, it should be relatively easy to run under Wine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
