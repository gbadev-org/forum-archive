    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I have the right forum this time.. 
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any limit on the size of an SD card for the supercard, or the supercard mini? I heard it is limited due to the FAT file system to 2gb, is this correct? Are there any disadvantages to having a 2gb card over a 1gb? I've heard rumors that 2gb cards will be too slow... 
<br/>
<br/>
But I have my doubts. The card I'm looking at is the OCZ 2gb 133x. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
