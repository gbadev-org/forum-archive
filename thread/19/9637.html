    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone have an example of code I can add to my game to return to the Supercard CF menu without powering off and powering back on again? Or alternatively, code that can load an NDS file from the CF card an run it? 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to use wifitransfer to download games to my NDS, and while it works, it doesn't start the game it downloaded.
<br/>
<br/>
All help appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But does this feature work on SuperCard? I seem to remember that one of those programs can boot homebrew only on the GBAMP v2 CF because it uses the code in the NDSMP hack for a large portion of the work:
