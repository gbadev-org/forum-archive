    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So... the Supercard team released the new rumble series. I've been thinking about getting one, because i'm getting a new DS soon and want a Supercard for that one, anyway. (To be exactly, i'm probably going to get the miniSD version)
<br/>
<br/>
So... i read it won't support GBA stuff anymore. No problem there. Can't use Goomba or stuff anymore, but that's fine.
<br/>
But, does anyone know if the drivers changed, or anything?
<br/>
Like... is it just as compatible with DS homebrew stuff as the regular Supercards?
<br/>
<br/>
'nother thing i've been wondering is if it still has the 32 MB RAM expansion.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So uh... if anyone already got one, i'd love to hear some feedback.
<br/>
If not, i'll just order one myself, next week, and tell you about my experiences, when it arrives.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. Is it compatible with DS homebrew? We wont know until someone buys it and tests it. Supercard is not homebrew-friendly, unfortunately. If it does not work, someone will need to donate one to chishm for him to figure out what has changed.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Does it have 32MB ram expansion? You say it is not compatible with GBA, which most likely means NO, it does not have the extra ram in it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the official website says it's definitely 100% Moonshell compatible, so it must be homebrew compatible, to an extent.
<br/>
<br/>
And about the RAM thing... yeah, that's what i thought too, that's why i asked if someone else already got one. XD
<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, as i said, it's rather cheap, so i just might give it a go and post the results here.<br/>_________________<br/>maggiekarp: Aghhh okay guys why would my right ide hurt in my ribs

I have a Supercard and it has run almost all the homebrew I have chucked at it. Especially with the newest firmware, it seems to support more than other cards I've heard about.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unless it comes with one pre-patched version of MoonShell and that's it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, i got my answer.
<br/>
<br/>
It definitely doesn't have the 32 MB RAM. Got a response from Romman directly. Just thought i'd let all of you know.
<br/>
<br/>
And yeah, won't buy one, then. Too many possibilities gone, without the extra RAM.<br/>_________________<br/>maggiekarp: Aghhh okay guys why would my right ide hurt in my ribs

Sorry, i meant Supercard-the-company is not homebrew friendly. 
<br/>
<br/>
Supercard-the-device (at least current revisions) work well with homebrew.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
