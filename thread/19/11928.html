    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I decided to join the ranks of people that ask painfully simple questions.. but there you go.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Does using a Superkey cart negate the need to use Flashme; for running homebrew apps, backed up roms, etc.?
<br/>
<br/>
2. What are the benefits of getting an M3 over a Supercard - cos they both look the same to me..
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, that should be it for the moment, thanks a lot for all help recieved :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

FlashMe replaces NoPass for most GBA-slot memory card adapters, but you'll still need to use the NoPass to install FlashMe.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Superkey itself does nothing more than allow code to execute from the GBA slot in DS mode.  Once you achieve this, you can install FlashMe, which as you said will render the Superkey obsolete.  It's still a good idea to have a physical passthrough device though just in case.
<br/>
<br/>
As for Supercard vs M3, the main difference would probably be GBA compatibility, where the Supercard is functional but somewhat limited, while the M3 has much better support for GBA binaries.  Also note that if you get a card of the Supercard "Rumble" series or M3 "Pro" series, GBA support is removed entirely.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as I am aware, given that I haven't actually received my Supercard yet (just ordered it 20 minutes ago), the RAM slowdowns affect all GBA binaries, both commercial and homebrew, and therefore even homebrew must be patched before it will run correctly.  So yes, I was indeed referring to GBA homebrew in that post.  I could be wrong about homebrew requiring patching, in which case my point is null and void.  Logically however, it makes sense to think that any GBA binary placed on the Supercard must be patched to reduce the risk of random freezing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, you would need a SuperKey or some other suitable NoPass device in order to run the flashing program.<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

Superkey does not flash the firmware... you just stick it in your game slot and leave it there, allowing code on the microSD to run.... I prefer this way over flashing as well.<br/>_________________<br/>Nintendo DS Onyx :: Supercard Lite :: Superkey :: 1GB microSD</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'll probably just get one of those combo deals. Yeah.. Lynx raises an interesting point - i'll probably run backed up official roms as opposed to homebrew (mainly to save space etc.)

Assuming i get a supercard lite-

Is there an app that will let me play GB/GBC games?

and does FlashMe erase the standard interface completely, or does it just patch it?

Fine, i realise now that it's not a permitted subject on this forum, but i feel that you should have phrased it better such as "discussion of warez is not permitted", etc. No offense meant, but i took that to mean that you were questioning whether M3 had better support than SuperCard - i never mentioned how well they handle gba games.  I simply thought it was a good point, so i raised my view on it. Again.. no offense meant.
<br/>
<br/>
However, on second thought, most of the stuff on my DS will probably end up as Homebrew - after browsing the net a bit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At least the SuperCard's boot ROM has to be able to handle the 4/2 wait state, which is set at power-on, in order to feed a logo to the CPU. You may be right that the RAM can also handle the same 4/2 wait state. But given that a lot of homebrew doesn't write to WAITCNT anyway, there shouldn't be much of a problem, except the issue that GBA homebrew that saves is less likely to support FAT and thus more likely to require QPC (quick power cycle) saving.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
