    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">looking at all of the new PassMe Mods(Serial, Serial-&gt;USB, etc.) I got into thinking of a way to monitor the DS and possibly get more information about the DS, possibly even something to help the WiFi info crackers.
<br/>
here goes:
<br/>
<br/>
we create a device simply made to monitor information passed to the processor and have it then send out data to the PC using a Serial/USB port.
<br/>
<br/>
the device would need to be placed inbetween the processor and the onboard device that sends assembled game code to the processor.
<br/>
the device will most likely also need some sort of button to start/stop sending data so as not to rip a whole game, but just the part that contains WiFi data.
<br/>
<br/>
we would need to have the device pass information back to the DS after sending it to the PC to continue execution of the game.
<br/>
<br/>
please realise that I do not have much knowledge on building hardware and therefore have little knowledge of how his works. also I cannot guarantee that this would allow us to  crack the WiFi.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for taking time to read this, I am on to try porting POSE to the DS.
