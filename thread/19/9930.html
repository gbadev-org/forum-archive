I have built the CheapTag, all I'm missing is the resistor. Will someone verify that pinout for me? Thanks!
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I'm convinced that hat pinout is correct, the GND is on a huge area, which I find is pretty common.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm debating if I should flash my DS Lite or not. Can I still run homebrew without flashing?<br/>_________________<br/>Back.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I got my resistor at a RadioShack. The Cheaptag cable was great, I just had to figure out the Xilinx software install, I had to run it 3 times untill it would do 100% without any errors.

<br/>
I was happy to see the Programming Succeded! message pop up.

Can't wait to get my SuperCard CF!
