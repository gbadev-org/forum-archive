Have you tried it on multiple DS classic and DS lite units? I think it's random, and various things might be part of the equation. But can you get Mario to say "MSN" or "Google"?

<br/>
<br/>
First with an incomplete game file..(tracks not beaten)
<br/>
Second with all tracks beaten ("yahoo")
<br/>
Third if you use a DS lite ("Here we go")

Now that I have flashed my firmware, my game has gone back to "Yahoo"

Before DSLite was released, there were reports of people hearing both sound effects. So it is probably not simply the DSLite itself that is changing the sound.

When you hear about some game with bonus content for dslite, then you can start to worry. Until then, I wouldn't get all worked up about a single sound effect changing. I don't think loopy is going to do a bunch of work reverse engineering firmware and/or mario kart, just so you can hear 'here we go' instead of 'yahoo'</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That was justified, as the Game Boy Color was a significant upgrade to the hardware platform, unlike the DS Lite whose primary difference is just that: the light. Compare the Game Boy to the Game Boy Pocket Light, not to the Game Boy Color.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I know they can't. My post is dripping with sarcasm. First mainly for the "FlashMe V7 bug" that was found as someone said he noticed reduced audio levels. And secondly, there is NO WAY NIN can detect if the game is from from flash cart or original cart so the sound effect is chosen by a RANDOM ALGORITHM. Just as my post says, I think whoever is trying to prove that the startup sound is different because of where the game is run is on some serious crack. Now, the startup sound may change if you make certain progress through the game. I know some games have done that in the past, but again, it's not because of where the game is run from.

Actually they can. They can check for the secure area, and if they put code into the game probably what slot it's being run from.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

But.. wouldn't a patcher just "fix" those checks as well?

No. Part of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection handshake involves an SSL connection, and who knows what is going on there. It might involve downloading code from Nintendo that verifies your Game Card, code which looks for the signatures of common patchers.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

They can't. This startup sound is completely random, although the 'patchers' obviously corrupt that and it sounds always the same.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I know they can't. My post is dripping with sarcasm. First mainly for the "FlashMe V7 bug" that was found as someone said he noticed reduced audio levels. And secondly, there is NO WAY NIN can detect if the game is from from flash cart or original cart so the sound effect is chosen by a RANDOM ALGORITHM. Just as my post says, I think whoever is trying to prove that the startup sound is different because of where the game is run is on some serious crack. Now, the startup sound may change if you make certain progress through the game. I know some games have done that in the past, but again, it's not because of where the game is run from. Get it?</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Ok, so say you are a manager or programmer at the big N. You know how to check the game ROM to see if it is run from original cart or flashcart. Would you:
<br/>
<br/>
A) Write code to have the startup sound play something different from a retail cart or
<br/>
B) Write code to stop the booting/execution of the ROM?
<br/>
<br/>
Choice A does not prevent your company from losses from piracy, whereas choice B does. That's why I just don't buy it because from a cost standpoint, there is no way I would approve my coders from just changing the sound at startup. I'd tell them to write code to block the execution of the ROM file.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I forgot to mention that I can connect to wifi no probs with the ROM and either startup sound.<br/>_________________<br/>2 x Enamel Blue DS lites V5, V7 FW whatever

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well I know everyone says they know why, but no one really does. all I know is that when I have my MKDS cart and put it in my lite ( lets say 10 times) every time I het "here we go" then lets say I put it in my flashed ds ( my silver DS, purchased when they first came out ) I get the whole "v-v-v-yahoo" I go back and forth from both DS's and it is either the DSlite or a change in the Firmware that is unknown at the time.
<br/>
<br/>
as some values in the firmware are known to be changed (WMB, Brightness, something with sound... and whatever else)
<br/>
<br/>
there must be something in the firmware or hardware that can be detected by nds carts ;)    just mt 2cents<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
