    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I went through lots of research to find out what set up would be best for me and I came up with the m3 mini SD. 
<br/>
Apparently, the one that has come through is v2 of the product, whcih is a bit smaller. The thing is, I'm now reading that its going to need a whole new set of drivers written for it to get quite alot of homebrew etc running.
<br/>
I dont really want to play DS games on it, I brought it for homebrew i.e. Scumm and Nitro tracker but now it seems that it could be a while before I do this. 
<br/>
I must admit I havnt tried this out for myself yet as I am sans a mini SD card, so I was wondering what others thoughts and experiences are with the product.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Where did you read that you need a whole new driver for the newer revision? It wouldn't make sense to change the inner workings of the M3 only for a different form factor.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I guess the best thing to do is grab a miniSD card and try it out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
