Many grey area products like modchips and flash carts have homepages with sketchy registration details. It's a good thing to watch out for when ordering a product. However, as this site isn't selling them directly, you need only trust your personal vendor. Ever tried whoising success-hk via .dnsstuff.com?

Or maybe it's a DS-&gt;GBA passthrough (like PassMe) and a GBA flash card (not pictured) sold in one box, where the menu software contains both a .pme binary and a .gba binary.

There is a big difference between packaging up something that is already REAL!  AKA, gba flash carts and Passthroughs.  And just making a bunch of crap up, specially when it's something that people have already failed at.

What are you talking about?  This is a good thing.  Do you think any of the homebrew community could afford to put such a package together?  And, anyone that does this that ISN'T the creator would fall under your "profit of other people's hard work".  And how do you know the creators arn't making a profit off of this?
<br/>
<br/>
So, before you hop up on your soap box, and rant about how people are "stealing" this or that, remember that if it wasn't for companies like this making these things available to the "general public" we'd only have 6 people developing homebrew code for the DS, and they would be the only ones able to run it.  And, on top of that, I'm sure this is the same route the GBA went back when it first came out.  So, are you saying you don't own a GBA Flash cart?  Because that would be another example of a company (the one that made the flash cart you are using) making profit from other people's hard work!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you have to be an idiot if you belive this.look on their site.it says it can support PC engine.so if i put a PC game file on the Card,it will play?this is bull,and if it's not,i will put my head down in shame,but that won't happen anytime soon,because it's a HOAX.

If this keeps on happening, the homebrew scene will eventually cease to exist, as homebrewers are eighter sued for promoting or designing piracy-oriented hacks, or people will just stop putting efforts in designing hacks for fear that their efforts are stolen by companies and used to make a profit by promiting piracy.

This is a pretty outrageous statement I know but in my humble opinion, just like the internet - when the numbers become too many - law agencies focus on those who are doing the worst crimes rather than those doing the petty crimes (like those of us who smoke the odd joint here or there!).  This is good for us - remaining anonymous in a large crowd is a lot easier than remaining anonymous in a small group of friends.  Hope I don't open myself up here to being flamed.

Even if the Magic Key is based on the PassMe design, then one minor advantage that the Neoflash people might point out is that you get a flash card and a passthrough that are tested to work together, and you can write Nintendo DS programs to the card without having to own a GBA (as in the case of F2A and EZFA) or having to do various dirty tricks with the writing software to turn off the GBA menu.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I recommend telling them that if they don't take your name down in 24 hours, they will hear from your lawyer. Also, you could report them or threaten to report them to the Better Business Bureau (http://www.bbb.org/). Further, you could even report the abuse to their web host for their site to be taken down.

And no, it's not my design but I do know that version 0 was a plain PassMe like the picture on my site. They almost have version 1 ready which adds flash+sram or something.

And what gives you that idea? I'd like to know. It's a perfectly good device for homebrewing, possibly without the need for memory address modificitions which render it useless for anything but passthroughs. And I don't want a rant about how everything ever made for the NDS is for warez kiddies, like I  have no doubt I'll probably get anyway.

Let's face it, if the warez kiddies can't play commercial roms on it, they aren't going to buy one.  The homebrew community is to  small for a company to invest in building a commercial homebrew package.  So, this kit comes out.. people find out if it can infact play warez, if it can, 100,000 more people buy them, companies start ripping off the design, etc..

Or a Freudian slip. I'd bet someone's going to out and make a Scorched Earth/Gorillas/Solar Wars/Cannon Fodder knockoff called "DarkFodder" now.

Anyway, one benefit of the pirates getting their hands on homebrew equipment is that the pirates might try one of the homebrew games that start showing up in the GoodNDS set with a (PD) tag and then learn to appreciate the homebrew community.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I called DarkFadder DarkFodder because i think he will gain a good amount of money by selling his warez device (he doesn't sell it on his own but i am sure he gets some payment for his passme design, if not he sure would be pissed that a company uses it for something commercial, no?) and i believe that a real "hacker" should stay all non-commercial in what he does for supporting the NDS (development) scene.

It'd be real handy if you wanted to distribute homebrew games that actually worked on flashcarts.
<br/>
<br/>
As in: Passthrough roms are most likly to be used for debug purposes, as they have altered memory addresses or something that stop them from working on most emulators and flashcarts (Do you think a company will use passthrough technology when they've (No, WE've. No idea why the homebrewing community'd make a flashcart, except for if there are some limitations to a passthrough that I haven't found out about yet.) figured out how to make even cheaper flash carts that they can sell for ten times more?), while normal roms'd be used for distribution.
<br/>
<br/>
Why use passthrough roms for debug purposes? Who knows, someone may code some kind of logger into a passthrough :).

<br/>

How would this work? The proprietary commercial programs use a file system, and unlike a directly addressable flash memory, a file system is dead easy to patch to use a different form of memory. How can a form of memory be developed that allows for the full use of the machine for <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_blank">free software</a> without giving crackers the ability to patch proprietary commercial ROMs?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Well.. there's no question that it can, if you patch the card access routines to access GBA cart instead. It's been done.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I do remember seeing screens or a video of darkfader's (I think) hacked Metroid demo playing through his passthrough.  That was definitely at least a portion of the commercial code from a game run using a passthrough.  Given more flash cart space, I bet he could have patched the whole rom and put it on there.

He must know something about what they are using to know that they (Neoflash) are almost ready with version 1. ( unless they is someone else)

If it's something you don't care about why advertise them on your site..

Sure there is: If they have an account that they've used to post at least once in the dev section of DSLinux, and have public email or the like enabled, you can check.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
