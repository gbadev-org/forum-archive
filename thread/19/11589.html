    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Im new here and for the past couple of days i have been doing some homework on the ds.
<br/>
<br/>
I am very familiar with the GBA and PSP, XBOX, PS2 hacking. solidering..etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I know how to install things once I have the right tutorials and people to give advice. :D
<br/>
<br/>
I am looking to get rid of my PSP and get a nintendo DS (sick of the psp game selection)
<br/>
<br/>
Here are my questions, sorry if they are posted 2000000x, but i find it very hard to search when i dont even know what im looking for.
<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
1- I already have a supercard CF for my GBA, i can use that for the DS.
<br/>
Is there any disadvantage besides the size over other cards out there?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2- Nintendo DS regular or lite? which is better for homebrew and easier to hack? should i be worried about a certain firmware(thinking psp style)?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3- Besides a DS and supercard CF, what do i need? nopass?!
<br/>
what is the difference between nopass and a flashed DS?
<br/>
<br/>
4- What is involved when flashing the DS? do i need to buy anything?
<br/>
what are the advantages/disadv. of flashing?
<br/>
<br/>
If someone can answer these question, that will clear things up for me and i can pick it up from here.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yes, you can use it. It will stick out a lot, especially if you buy a lite, but it works very good.
<br/>
<br/>
2.
<br/>
Lite is hotter. If you buy a phat you won't have to worry about using wrong flashme versions and losing your brightness settings.
<br/>
<br/>
3.
<br/>
Yes, a nopass. The difference is that with flashme, you don't have to have the nopass with you, and can have a game in there instead. Also see next question.
<br/>
<br/>
4.
<br/>
You need a way to run homebrew, which in your case probably would be a nopass and a SC CF. The advantage is that you get some protection against wierd programs bricking your ds.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">2. If you want to install FlashMe, regular is less likely to go wrong.
<br/>
4. You will also need a screwdriver and something thin and conductive (bent paperclip, tinfoil rolled together, etc).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1.  I think all homebrew works fine on Supercard CF, it's better supported than SD cards.  It drains battery faster than most other solutions but you should still get around 4 hours.
<br/>
<br/>
2.  Firmware doesn't matter anymore since everything works with a nopass.  If you wanted to use an old bulky passme1 then you would need a fat DS with firmware v3 or lower.  Homebrew works fine on Lite and fat.
<br/>
<br/>
3.  You just need a nopass.  If you flash your DS then you will no longer need the nopass.
<br/>
<br/>
Flashme advantages:
<br/>
Flashme gives you a way to recover if the unprotected part of your firmware is overwritten.  It can remove the annoying health and safety screen.  It removes the signature check from "DS Download play" or WMB (wireless multiboot).  If you have a wi-fi card with a compatible ralink chipset then you can send homebrew to your DS wirelessly from your PC.  You don't need a nopass anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
Flashme disadvantages:
<br/>
If you don't follow the correct instructions then you could brick your DS.  It voids your warranty but if you use flashme stealth, Nintendo will probably never notice.  I have read that if you try to remove flashme on a DS Lite by using noflashme then pictochat and other wireless apps stop working.
<br/>
<br/>
Flashing your firmware without a method of running homebrew requires opening your DS and doing a lot of soldering.  Search for PPFlash.  It would be the cheapest way but it's much easier to just buy a nopass.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1: Hmmmmm, I would consider size a big disadvantage. An SC:CF sticks out of a DSL like nothing on the planet. Other than that, no. It's a comfort thing, really. I like to use my DS as a music player, so having a compact fit is useful...
<br/>
<br/>
2: DS Lite, unless you're strapped for cash and want to pick up a second-hand DS Phat on the cheap. Seriously, though, the DS Lite has a greatly improved display and a much less bulky form factor. Issues with the FlashMe version are very easy to solve: Use the latest version of FlashMe (That's v7...). Easy.
<br/>
<br/>
3: A NoPass is best, even if you plan to install FlashMe. A FlashMed DS differs from NoPass in a couple of ways. The FlashMe firmware includes recovery code that can allow you to unbrick your DS. Also, it allows for homebrew wireless multiboot, if I recall, which devs find useful...
<br/>
<br/>
4: Flashing the DS is very easy. You don't need to buy anything other than a NoPass and a paperclip. Advantages were discussed above. Disadvantages: If you're ham-handed you might brick your DS, but that's only if you're very very very ham-handed. Seriously, flashing is a quick and painless process that only requires you not to get the shakes for a short 10 seconds. Not much to ask :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI
