    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I updated it. It seems to be due to the fact that I was clearing main RAM before moving the ARM9 wait function to the NDS header. This was fine on FlashMe, since the ARM9 function was already in the header. However, that didn't seem to be the case with WifiMe.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't looked to far into why it isn't working with the recovery code in FlashMe. Try this version and tell me how it goes.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just loaded it.  It still screws up the screens for me and will not load _BOOT_MP.NDS.  At least I can confirm it's not brickware.
<br/>
<br/>
I just bought a used DS to use while I'm trying to fix my first one and stuck the GBAMP in and the screens were fine.  Apparently that bug only exists on a MK bricked DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
