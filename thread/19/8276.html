    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Multiboot: Put the .gba file on your CF card. Go to FC game and run it. Don't turn your DS off until it says it's safe to shut off (only takes a few seconds). As with any firmware update it's best to use AC power.
<br/>
Moonshell: Run WriteFiles_IMFS.bat, then copy _BOOT_MP.nds to your CF card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
