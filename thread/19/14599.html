Interesting that it uses a very similar design as many unofficial flashcards, including microsd. why not internal flash?

But... how they would have to apply DRM...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So is there actually any solid truth to the fact that Nintendo are thinking about enabling people homebrew officially?  Personally I think it's all just rumour and hearsay.
<br/>
<br/>
There's several good reasons to do this (good PR, more people developing for their platform), but the reasons not to in my mind outweigh this.  
<br/>
<br/>
For one, it would take a considerable amount of money and effort to develop a separate SDK as evidenced in devkitARM.  Sure they've got an existing SDK to work from but it's still a lot of work to repackage it for hobbyist use.
<br/>
<br/>
They don't really need any more people developing for the DS judging by the steady flow of releases for it at the moment.  Also as it's pretty much more than halfway through it's lifespan already it wouldn't make financial sense to release a SDK that late in the products life.
<br/>
<br/>
To me this looks more along the lines of a iTunes-for-the-DS, no actual applications to be downloaded, just media like music and video.  The fact that a lot of flashcarts have identical features is probably why a lot of people are thinking this will be used to run homebrew.  The same company (am3) were trying to bring downloadable anime to the Gameboy. 
<br/>
<br/>
Just my two tuppence worth.

Card that can store multimedia is one thing, enabling hombrew officialy is another. While the news was about first part, nothing was said about the later. Of course chances are that you will be able to run programs from the card, but i doubt it.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would think that the only way to run homebrew applications on it is if it has upgradeable firmware and someone hacks it. From all descriptions I've read, it's meant for downloading images, videos, music, and ebooks to it for viewing on the DS. There's no mention of running applications anywhere. If it does have upgradeable firmware, it's possible they may add the feature, but it's more likely that someone would have to hack it in order to make it work. So while it may fill the role some want with a portable media player and carry the functionality of a lot of homebrew apps, I doubt it's going to be able to play other apps.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought that at first too. The same thing with the Datel Max Media Dock (and all it's variations). The thing is, the GBAMP was also capable of running emulators and had upgradeable firmware that, thanks to the excellent work by Chishm, was hacked to boot homebrew. The MMD was based on the GBAMP and ran Moonshell, so it was possible to run homebrew as well. This device appears more closed off and first impressions don't seem to reveal anything besides the built-in media players. If it is based on Moonshell, there's potential for running homebrew, but I highly doubt an officially licensed product would be. That leaves hacking the firmware. But that's not necessarily guaranteed, either. I seem to recall the Play-Yan being upgradeable, but haven't seen much in the way of hacking it (unless I completely missed it). I guess it's just a "wait and see" kind of thing. But in the meantime, I'll just stick to my unlicensed hardware for guaranteed homebrew support.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

Found myself mislead as well - chances for seeing downloadable executable software on this are really next to none.

Might as well refer to it as "First slot1 MediaPlayerCart" - The company pushing the content seems to be in it for the long haul though.

Stores in Fort Wayne, Indiana, sell only Datel's Games n' Music, not R4, CycloDS, or SuperCard DS ONE. When I try to play a DPG on my GnM, it pauses every once in a while. A microSD adapter that actually uses the SD interface (not the MMC/SPI back-compat) could transfer more data from the card per frame, making playback at higher rates more reliable.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They could also put a little more quality into the construction of them. Datel's products tend be be cheaper in both build quality and performance. If they would improve those to match some of the other vendors out there (and add MicroSDHC support), they'd do much better. Although, I suppose the faster interface is also a double edged sword. With a slow interface, it's not really worth while to run pirated content on it (I'm not sure if it can or not). This is beneficial to them. If they did speed things up, and improve their feature set to better compete with other hardware, they could very well be viewed as being that much closer to the piracy crowd by Nintendo.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the fact that Datel products are available in major retail stores, I doubt they will change anything.  What do they really care about?  Money.  By using cheaper hardware with less performance, they maximize their profits.  I'm sure if it was able to run romz, they wouldn't be in the market they are, they'd be with the rest.. on web sites.  I wouldn't be surprised if you compared the GnM sales to any other slot-1 device, and it's sales destroys them all.  
<br/>
<br/>
You don't have to be the best device, just available to the largest audience at a reasonable price.  Now, at only $20 for everything you need to run homebrew as you walk out of the store, there is no reason not to think, eh.. it's only $20, and if it sucks.. no big loss.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
