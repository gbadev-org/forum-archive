    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">R4 has a 'boot from slot-2' option in the main menu. I can boot any slot-2 cart and can now (with the lates firmware) tell the difference between gba code and ds code when booting slot-2.

<br/>
Or I could have just said Yes.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does the R4 have any advantages vs a regular passme and supercard, aside from being compact and easier? Does the latter not support Wifi or Download and play? 
<br/>
<br/>
I mean, if I can use the R4 it's great, but it's like $70 and a regular passme is $14. So I want to know if it's worth it. What do you guys think</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most shops I've seen are selling it for $40 or so, and one shop I've seen even sells it for about $30, plus about $10 for a microSD card to go with it, though I also heard that it typically takes 2-3 weeks for shipping from that store.
<br/>
<br/>
The R4 is more compact and easier for newbies to use, but in terms of homebrew compatibility, slot-2 devices are still a slightly better choice since older homebrew that accesses the filesystem will often not work on slot-1 devices.  The additional RAM is nice too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
So is the ability to run GBA homebrew and DS save backup tools, which SLOT-2 cards have but SLOT-1 cards lack.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't really think of any reason to get an R4 over a passme/nopass since you already have a slot-2 card. Unless you want to use your gba slot for something else (no idea what) or you have a supercard that sticks out and wanna run an mp3 player in your pocket off of the R4.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
