it don't have to be a passme, anything which allow to execute a nds file would help (any slot 1 card).

what is this max media player for slot 1? is it possible to execute a nds homebrew? if so, this slot 1 should work fine.

ok good now please give me a step-by-step mini tutorial on what i need to do and hey btw whats an estimate percentage of the chance i could brick my ds.
<br/>
<br/>
one more question what are the pros and cons of having a flashed ds</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#121951 - dantheman - Thu Mar 15, 2007 10:07 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Rather than spending 20 minutes typing up a detailed step-by-step tutorial, I'll simply link you to <a href="http://www.dslinux.org/index.php?showtopic=2011" target="_blank">http://www.dslinux.org/index.php?showtopic=2011</a> where you asked this two weeks ago, and I gave you several resources you could use for this occasion.
<br/>
<br/>
With a regular DS, the chances of bricking are fairly low.  Just make sure you don't lose power.  If you get at least 3-5% of the process done, you can probably use the failsafe feature to recover it.  With Lites, there's more of a chance it will shut off in the middle of the flashing, but regular DSs tend to be fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Wait a sec, can someone confirm if the failsafe works on the MMD?  Since FlashMe cannot boot the MMD, would the failsafe work at all?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, it just means that you will still need to use your MML in order to boot the MMD.  Normally, FlashMe can boot the slot-2 card directly, without the passthrough device, but this doesn't work on the MMD.
<br/>
<br/>
I merely do not know if the failsafe recovery mode will work on an MMD, that's all.  If you don't screw up the installation, it won't apply to you, but I would probably rather have the additional insurance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So Reaper, there is a chance that if you screw up the FlashMe installation, you could brick your DS.  The only benefits you gain from it are the ability to run unsigned WMB demos and the removal of the health and warning screen.  You also might gain the ability to use the four brightness controls if your DS has firmware version 5.  I'll leave it up to you to decide if it's worth the risk or not.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you're only gonna be using DS homebrew casually then flashme isn't really worthwhile of you've got a nopass and you're worried about bricking.
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;this sounds SO dodgy&gt;
<br/>
My first flashme I was pretty worried but I was surprised just how quick and easy it was to do! The second time I did it I was completely laid back about it :-)
<br/>
An alternate way of flashing a DS is to get a screwdriver and open it up and do the short. No fumbling in a tiny hole - you can see exactly what's going on.
<br/>
