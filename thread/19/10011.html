anyone is free to correct me,
<br/>

<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well Compact Flash card adapters (and presumably the MMP) use the card in IDE mode. Since all CF cards support LBA, this gives a maximum capacity of 2^28 addressable sectors * 512 bytes per sector, or approximately 128GiB (137GB). If the driver they use is written properly (ie, supporting 32 bit addressing) then they should be able to support cards that big. However, files are still limitted to 4GiB in size (this is a limitation of FAT).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

your good with that search feature arn't you?...
<br/>
<br/>
oh and to respond to Pinesal,
<br/>
i would say your safer getting the 4GB microdrive,
<br/>
but im not sure if you can cut in that spot i cut in on the m3,
<br/>
since i don't have one...
<br/>
<br/>
someone should make a half sized 4GB type I compact flash card :P...
<br/>
<br/>
it would be completly engulfed into the supercard :P<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

The ZenMicro can take a standard CF card without modification. I think microdrives have the same interface as CF in general although, from what I've heard, some manufacturers modify the connection to prevent use as a cheap source of microdrives.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

It used to. But they changed the connector to stop people taking microdrives from them, or using CFs in them.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

<br/>
If BIOS for the M3 is written to recognize the LBA, why wouldn't it? 4GB is NOT the limit. Only reason Datel sells a prepackaged 4GB Media player for DS/PSP is because the 4GB microdrives are mass produced and are cheap. Look at the Datel Max player empty shell where you put in the media: <a href="http://us.codejunkies.com/shop/product.asp?c=US&amp;cr=USD&amp;cs=$&amp;r=0&amp;l=1&amp;ProdID=750" target="_blank">http://us.codejunkies.com/shop/product.asp?c=US&amp;cr=USD&amp;cs=$&amp;r=0&amp;l=1&amp;ProdID=750</a>

They state you can put up to 8GB, but it must be in the CF format.<br/>_________________<br/>2 x Enamel Blue DS lites V5, V7 FW whatever
