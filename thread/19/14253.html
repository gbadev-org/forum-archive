    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a problem with an AP too. It doesn't use any encryption, and I can associate with it just fine, but there doesn't seem to be any actual Internet connection. DSO freezes trying to access anything, Mario Kart DS gives me an error in the connection test (I don't remember which &lt;_&lt;), etc. I've tried setting IP and DNS manually, though I'm not 100% sure as to just what IP and gateway I should be using. DHCP works in DSLinux, but I still can't get through to anything, even pinging the default gateway address times out. Only my own IP responds. Is there anything else I should try?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Seriously, I've tried three different APs.  One worked quite well, if extremely slowly, another kept dropping out at matchmaking, and my new one is rejected completely.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?cuyb10fzdz2" target="_blank">Strummer</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?71zxcztscix" target="_blank">Drummer?</a>.

Or maybe you would rather play with sand? <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?a05z5wmdvxm" target="_blank">Sandscape is for you in that case.</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
