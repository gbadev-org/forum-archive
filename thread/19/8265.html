    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was woundering what would be the best way to go about ripping a save file from a ds game / taking a save file from a friend and placing it on my ds game. I have been lookin for a bit but I am just confusing myself.
<br/>
<br/>
[edit] I just checked the rules I dont think that this is breaking the rules so Ill keep my fingers crossed.
