    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just to let you know, noflashme does not restore a DS Lite to full functionality.  It will boot and will play DS and GBA games (I don't know about wifi), the Alarm clock icon and brightness icon works, but trying to change any of the options, picochat or DS download play hard locks the DSL.
<br/>
<br/>
I suspect the "V6" firmware that noflashme installs is for one of the old DS' that have the brightness chip hardware of the DSL (which is why some people can install flashme7 for the DSL on their DS and get 4 brightness levels).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well that kinda sucks. I came here looking for people with experience running noflashme on DS Lite's and now I get this bad news :(
<br/>
<br/>
I want to reflash my DS back to the original Lite firmware so I can warrenty exchange it because of a faulty d-pad. I doubt they would be too keen on exchanging a flashed DS Lite.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, that might work (unless Nintendo has a bunch of Supercard's laying around they can stick in and see if they boot.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Or they could just hold A+B+X+Y at bootup with no GBA cart, and if it fails to boot, it's flashed.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
