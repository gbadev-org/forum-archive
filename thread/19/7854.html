Yes. Unlike Microsoft, Nintendo currently isn't banning modded machines.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

And you can UNflash DS with no problems.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

it's on the very same page as the flashme install file? it's the blue underlined 'uninstall' that you want to click on. <a href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/" target="_blank">http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can someone give me some help with a flashing problem? I flashed my DS a few months ago and all went well. But now I want to flash the new firmware so I can play Mario Kart online. I downloaded the new Flashme.nds file from <a href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/" target="_blank">http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/</a> and tried to run it, but all I get are two white screens. The old utility will still launch fine when I try it.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using a Flash2Advance flash cart, and programming it with a Game Wallet on a GBA. I don't know what my current FlashME version is exactly, because the install utility doesn't say, but I downloaded it on the 5th of July. The problem only seems to be that I can't run the new utility.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, when I get it running, will I need to short the contact in the battery compartment again?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think it is necessary so the firmware enters the "write" mode to be flashed.

correct me if I'm wrong.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's correct.  v5 needs to rewrite the first bit of flash, again, because the firmware was moved around to fix MK:DS.  In addition, make sure you prepend a loader to the firmware image (there's one available on the firmware site, IIRC).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unfortunately that site's down at the moment, but do you mean "ndsloader.bin"? The site says that it already has one built-in!
<br/>
<br/>
How can I prepend this loader using Linux? Is it just a matter of joining the files together (using "cat", probably)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">.nds files built with newer versions of devkitARM, such as newer versions of FlashMe, have a built-in .nds loader that sits inside the GBA header (first 192 bytes). However, some GBA flash cart writing programs insist on repairing the GBA header, which breaks the loader. For these, you're going to have to prepend ndsloader.bin or ndsmall.bin or something similar.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I hear what you're saying Tepples, but GameWallet doesn't seem to have this problem; it worked fine with the old version of FlashMe, the Transformer demo, and a couple of NeHe demos (ie. everything else I've tried it with!). It just doesn't work with the latest (NDS-FW-V5) Flashme. That would imply that something has changed between this version and my currently installed version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To prepend the loader using Linux use "cat ndsloader.bin flashme.nds &gt; flashme.ds.gba".<br/>_________________<br/>The future of gaming is mobile Handheld Gaming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks, that works nicely! I've now successfully upgraded.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if this has been mentioned here before, but it appears that ANY playing of Mario Kart will corrupt the old firmware! I was just playing a friend on download play (no card of my own), and later found that my system wouldn't start. I fixed this with a START + SELECT + A + B restore.
<br/>
<br/>
So, if any of you think you can get away with not upgrading just because you aren't going to play online, think again! Don't play MKDS until you've upgraded!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
