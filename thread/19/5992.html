Anyway, I am interested in the whole "Nintendo DS Download play using a Wireless NIC" thing, however, I do not have a GBA flash cart.  I know the instructions call for one.  My question is, do you believe that one day we shall figure out how to send programs to the DS using a Wireless NIC WITHOUT the need of a GBA Flash Cart?  I know it has to be possible, we just have to figure out the right sequence of 1's and 0's.
<br/>
<br/>
But I know that might be extremely difficult, do you all think it will ever happen?  Thank you,
<br/>

To whoever is trying to crack the code (if anyone): good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">cool cool, thank you strager for the info.  I wish you (and anyone else trying) the best of luck.

Also, I appreciate what you all do, and ONE DAY I hope to be a member of your ranks.  I'm still learning C/C++, but I've come a long way :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm pretty sure you can send files to the DS with WiFiME, however it is limited by the DS's 4mb RAM space. I forogt how, but I tink you create a 'data' folder in the wifime program folder (where wmb.exe is contained) and put your rom in there. Check the readme? I dunno, but I do know it can be done.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That only works if your DS has had the firmware patched using FlashMe, which you have to run from a GBA Flash cart.  Once that is done, you can download unsigned demos over WiFi.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In order for WiFiMe to load unsigned code without the flash cart, we'd have to first disassemble the Super Mario 64 DS stub that gets sent when booting with the flash card. Then I'm guessing that instead of the SM64DS assets, we could send unsigned code.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would that be done with a "packet capture?"  And if so, if it's not asking too much, could someone let me know what tool(s) they use to do such a thing?  I wanna do some packet capturing!

Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
