    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a good feeling that I may have destroyed my MPv2, but I figured I'd see if there is anything I can do first before I declare it dead.
<br/>
<br/>
Hardware:
<br/>
Movie Player Advance version 2
<br/>
Old silver DS
<br/>
Kingston 1GB CompactFlash card
<br/>
<br/>
I've had a flashed DS for a while, and using MP2 w/ MoonShell as my media player.  I decided that I wanted to play around with it a bit tonight (I know, stupid idea to try and 'fix' something that isn't broken) and try to get some GBA ROMs to load.  Long story short, I ran "ndsmp.nds" v2.0, at which point, my MP2 wouldn't load the _BOOT_MP.ds, and when trying to at least get into the original firmware using "Start GBA Game", it gave me a black screen and froze.  I put the "update.e19" in the root of the CF card, hoping to update it, or at least get the original firmware to boot properly.  It loaded it, told me it was updated, then froze.  Now, when I boot up my DS with the flash cart in it, it tells me "There is no Game Pack inserted."  If I try to load it up on my friends non-cracked DS, it says the same thing.  I've tried a couple different things, including formatting the CF card, but to no avail.  Anyone have any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated, but I kinda have a feeling the thing is beyond repair at this point.  I was thinking about picking up a M3 for replacement, but I'm still undecided.  Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if you have any other way of running homebrew (know someone else with a flashcart, or another gbamp, or you have a wifi card), then launch the ndsmp.nds that way, with the gbamp in the slot. then i would try these things:
<br/>
<br/>
1. use ndsmp to uninstall/revert to original firmware
<br/>
2. install update.e19
<br/>
3. install ndsmp normally (either via .gba or .nds method as in #1)
<br/>
<br/>
also, if you are getting a replacement, i'd suggest a supercard CF over m3 CF. it has a nice frontloading slot, and tends to be a bit better homebrew compatibility.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
