    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi,
<br/>
i'm thinking about getting my first flashcard to do some development and maybe try some homebrew stuff like DS linux.
<br/>
one thing i don't like about most solutions is the constant (un-)plugging of the cards to store a new build. 
<br/>
a solution with a direct USB connection, where i can automate copying the ROM as part of the build process and then just restart the DS, would be ideal.
<br/>
so far i found DS-Xtreme, but that seems to be hard to get and is very expansive.
<br/>
whats up with DS linker? it has some USB connection cable - is it directly plugged into this slot 2 card thingy?
<br/>
btw, it has to work under linux ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's the reason I got my DS-X, so that I wouldn't have to keep swapping my SD-card from my Supercard, it was getting pretty long! However the thing that annoys me about my DS-X is that I have to keep plugging and unplugging the USB cable otherwise it won't turn on. I read on another thread that with the Acekard you can keep the cable plugged in and still turn the DS on, so you simply build your project, double-click a batch file that copies it to the card, and turn it on. If someone can verify this it would be great.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I then browsed to it to make sure I could read it fine.

I then turned on my DS and it boot to the previous folder (svsip) with a single .nds file in it. At the same time, I tried browsing the folder and was able to. I created a .txt file and was able to save it. But, at some time, the DS locked up.

just turning the DS off isn't a problem imho.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">With my computer and the Acekard RPG with latest firmwares, the card doesn't even get recognized as an external drive if the DS is on.  When I turn the system off, though, it gets recognized and I can transfer files to it.  Then when I turn the DS back on, my computer thinks the drive has been removed (unsafely).  Rinse, repeat.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't done a lot of playing around with this since I broke my laptop's screen shortly after getting the Acekard, but for the week or so that I had them both and was transfering files as described above, I did experience a number of corruptions of the Acekard's NAND.  Something in that file transfer process may have been causing the corruptions since I haven't had any in the the three weeks since I stopped doing that (because I'm not actively developing anything that needs to be tested thousands and thousands of times, I find it easier to just transfer files using the microSD card reader when I want to put something new on the card).  When I was handling my card the other way I was also doing a lot of file copying from the internal NAND to the microSD, though, so that may have been the root of the problems, as well.  I don't know.

I'm currently using a GBAMP-CF, which is pretty old-skool.  I've really learned to HATE the constant in-and-out of both the CF card and the GBAMP, just to debug and fix some problem with my code that only shows up on real HW.  With the CF card slot on the SIDE of the GBAMP?  Ugh.
<br/>
<br/>
But that painful dev process should be a thing of the past soon, as I have a DS-Fire 2G card on the way, with a slot2 USB linker. :D<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Man, I don't trust the strength microSD cards, the microSD slots on flash cards or even the mSD reader enough that I would be willing to go through that process with any flash card that takes microSD.
<br/>
<br/>
That old routine has worked well for me with my Supercard SD, though.  In fact, even if using the Acekard RPG's NAND doesn't turn out to be problematic, I'm not sure I'll stop using the Supercard for development.  Something nice about having a cart dedicated to development and nothing else.  Especially with the _BOOT_SC.NDS autoboot feature (thanks to chishm and Grizzly Adams for that).

I so want to do this.  How homebrew-friendly is the DS Fire then?  FAT work fine?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">FAT works just fine on the DS Fire.
<br/>
<br/>
I've got a single large (&gt; 4MB) .nds "ROM" of my game that's working on the DS Fire, but it also works EXACLTY the same when I run it as a tiny .nds program that accesses the files from nested folders on the cart's file system.  File saves work fine too.
<br/>
<br/>
Even more demanding FAT-dependent games like QuakeDS work great, game saves and all.

<br/>
A word of warning: if you order from <a href="http://www.dealextreme.com" target="_blank">www.dealextreme.com</a> like I did, be prepared to wait for a while.  They supposedly had them "in stock", but in reality, they had to wait a couple of weeks for their supplier to get them in to them.  Once dealextreme received their supply, they shipped my unit immediately, and went from Hong Kong to my house in California in only two days.
<br/>
<br/>
So although I wouldn't order from them if I needed something right away, I wasn't in a hurry on this one, and I did have a good, trustworthy purchasing experience with them.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

With the default firmware, if you're connected via the slot-2 linker, it gives you the option to launch in either "USB Mode" or "Menu".  "Menu" launches to the normal cart file selector, and USB Mode is dedicated to passive flash device filetransfer.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling that simultaneous memory access via USB linker AND the DS would cause some sort of conflict.  But it's a cool idea.  I could certainly streamline development even more if I could do tricky soft-controls of the DS from the PC.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
