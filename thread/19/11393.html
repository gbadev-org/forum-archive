    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is the G6 lite menu in DS mode? In that case, you'll not have to worry about doing soldering and stuff, you'll probably just need another gba slot device, if you can't make it work with the G6.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">G6 menu uses the touch screen and just doesn't work with the flashme fail safe.  You will need to use a different device to recover with (M3, supercard, GBAMP or an old flashcart).  Email the g6flash guys and tell them to make their firmware compatible with flashme fail safe.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I hope to find someone with a supercard or something...
<br/>
