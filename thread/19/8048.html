    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all...
<br/>
<br/>
Been lurking around many DS development forums for a while now and finally decided to start learning how to run some of the homebrew programs. 
<br/>
<br/>
Using the Pictrochat test I've learned my DS is FW3 and have decided to go with using WiFiMe.
<br/>
<br/>
But before I even get into that I first want to find a good <span style="font-weight: bold">PCMICA</span> card for my laptop that can be used with Wireless Multiboot so I can play the official nintendo demos. From there I'll purchases the other hardware needed to be able to run homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
I know that I need a card from this page <a class="postlink" href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">http://ralink.rapla.net/</a> but there are quite a few and was hoping anyone would have any suggestions on a good and inexpensive card I can buy online. I was looking at some (A Zonet ZEW1501) but can't figure out if buying it owuld be reliable to get the correct chipset (the one mentioned above it in the list is starred).
<br/>
<br/>
Any response would be greatly appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">actually the ZEW1500 is starred. the ZEW1501 is not. The Zonet ZEW1501 is also $13 at TigerDirect.com</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
