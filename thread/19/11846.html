    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all. I just got a SC Lite, but I'm dissapointed in the fact that most programs aside from dslinux have trouble writing to the microSD card. I've got some extra cash and I was thinking about getting a different card. Any recomendations for maximum compatibility with homebrew apps?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Personally I would think the Supercard or M3 would be more compatible, given that they have the extra RAM, useful to DSLinux and also GBA homebrew as well.  Some programs that use GBA-like filesystems (like Comic Book DS and SnezziDS) will also not run on a GBAMP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh.. what's that?  you weren't talking about homebrew.. oh.. That's right..

all <span style="font-weight: bold">homebrew</span> works great speed on my SC-CF, don't think I've ever had any FAT problems or anything with saving, never had to use whatever that moomshell converter thing is either.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Saving doesn't work with GB, GBC, NES software or GBA/NDS software that doesn't use the file-system. Even some homebrew software uses non-file-system saving (well, most GBA software uses SRAM but a lot of NDS software uses the file-system) and it doesn't work on SuperCard CF. I wonder how I can make it work properly...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, you can save to SRAM on the supercard CF/SD. Probably other versions of Supercard as well, but I haven't personally tested them.
