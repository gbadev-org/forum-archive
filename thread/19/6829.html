    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just bought myself the m3adapter from xalpha <a class="postlink" href="http://gbatmw.proboards44.com/index.cgi?" target="_blank">http://gbatmw.proboards44.com/index.cgi?</a>.  I'm now wondering how much its gonna take to get a working cf reading driver for this one.  Will it have to have its firmware hacked/rewrite or would it be a simple modification.  Lets just hope it works! i cant wait to try out its movie playing abilities since its already been updated to properly support the nds capabilities (with fullscreen playing).  Apparently they are processing the sound on the arm7 with the video done on the arm9, with native mp3 coming soon. 
<br/>
No passkey yet though but im not interested in pirating nds games so i dont think that matters</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am not too sure, as I haven't got one. It depends on how they access the CF card. If it uses the same registers and there is a known method to switch from GBA cart memory mode to CF mode and back then it should be pretty simple. Even if the registers are in different addresses, as long as they behave the same it should be pretty simple to modify the pre existing driver. If you could get a hold of the required information then I will be glad to incorporate it into my driver.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'll have a little play with the cf drivers for you too chism hopefully it wont be too different but things are never that simple!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Please don't jump to conclusions about piracy. Format-shifting Lucasarts games from lawfully made copies onto ScummVM for Nintendo DS is thought to be a fair use.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Are there any sources that outline the reasons for the limitation?  I'd just like to get a better understanding of why it exists.

Is it a limitation of the PassMe or the cart?  Why the GBA limitation if the system is running in DS mode?

That is the reason, the gba port has a logical address space of 256Mbit which means it cant see any more than 32 MBs of memory.  Another example would be a pentium processor has a logical address space of 4GB hence amd64 is needed which extends it much further.  The real reason? cost the gba roms are only around 8 megs so why would it need to be aware of anymore?  
<br/>
hopefully my m3 will be here in a day or two then i can update you with compatability.  Im looking forward to getting some hexen action going! With the breakthrough of wifi cracking not too far away maybe in the coming months we'll get some internet homebrew games going.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And the Famicom couldn't see more than about 48 KB. That's why the FDS (Famicom Disk System) contained both 32 KB of RAM and an interface to a disk drive. Conceptually, the SuperCard and the M3 for GBA/DS work just like the FDS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

That'll be a great thing when it happens.  Some sort of online HB library with a cart loaded download client would be great.  I should really donate some $ to the cause.<br/>_________________<br/>dz
