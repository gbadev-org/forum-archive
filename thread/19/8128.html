    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just found a sale on a Linksys WMP54G nic and as it is on the wmb compat list would like it but it says only v4 is supported how can I tell if I am getting the right version without opening the box?
<br/>
<br/>
I am also hoping that it will work with the Linux WMB drivers as I Single boot Linux on my computer</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I looked pretty hard at a box and didn't find anything to show revision blatantly.
<br/>
I looked for the basic stuff like v{whatever} rev{whatever} and stuff like that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I also considered buying a Linksys when I was shopping for an adaptor...  I had no luck finding a rev. number on the box.  I understand your frustration.  I wound up buying an adaptor which I thought was OK according to the list (but in fact only certain rev.s of the adaptor had the RT2500 chipset, and the Ralink list didn't say which ones.) and had to return it.
<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest one of three routes.
<br/>
1: Instead of buying at retail, buy an OEM card at a computer show.  You'll be able to see the card itself, most likely, rather than marketroid packaging.  (Returning if you screw up is more complicated, though...)
<br/>
2: Buy online according to the shopping links on ralink.rapla.net, which supposedly point you at adaptors which have the chipset (caveat emptor...)
<br/>
3: Stick to retail, but either be willing to abuse the return policy if it's the wrong chipset, or else buy a card that shows its rev. number on the packaging.
<br/>
<br/>
Me, I lucked out.  I was shopping at Circuit City and I found a nice v3001 Belkin adaptor at a good price.  Works like a charm.

I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.
<br/>
Thank you, everyone, I look forward to taking advantage of your work.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by tetsujin on Mon Jan 16, 2006 2:05 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
