However, I'm curious what the legal status of something like this is.  Of course you can legally transmit the demo from one DS to another, since that's how it's designed to be used.  Does this extend to DS -&gt; computer -&gt; internet -&gt; other computer -&gt; passme -&gt; other DS?  Or would this be considered illegal copying?
<br/>
<br/>
In this case, I don't see how copying the demo could harm anyone at all.  If it does actually work, then it's essentially free advertising for Nintendo, since people who play the demo are more likely to get hooked and buy the full version.  However, for other games down the road with multiboot content, it may not be as benign.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think that's the problem.  TI-Calc emu uses a different title, but you can force it to boot by holding a,b,x and y.  It seems that it <span style="font-style: italic">tries</span> to load the demo, but I get two white screens.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sage, it sounds like you're referring to the patched firmware as v2 (possibly v1).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">weirdest of things - worked perfectly without passme (flashme only) first time I used it.  Then I put in the passme and checked it ran on that.  Then I tried to run again on flashme version - now it doesn't work on flashme! Anyway - not too devastated.  It's a pretty dull demo :).
<br/>
<br/>
new note: definitely has done something to the firmware flash I beta tested.  Firmware now requries passme to work!  With passme plugged in, I skip health screen etc... without it... I have no joy.  Gotta check my homebrew stuff still works!
<br/>
<br/>
final note: Only has affected Polarium demo which worked fine first time  Iloaded without passme.  Trying it with passme and flashme caused flashme to no longer like polarium without passme.  God knows why... who cares... flashme still works nice with ds paint etc.  No big deal.  Was getting worried there.  Something defintely did get altered though.  That certainly is of interest.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The firmware difference shouldn't matter at all. Using FlashMe, it should still load the header from inserted cartridge. So that doesn't matter either.
<br/>
The reason is that the loader forgets to load the polarium cartridge header into memory :)
<br/>
Anyway, the nicest solution would be to convert this into an NDS file, so it can be used with any NDS loader.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by darkfader on Mon Apr 25, 2005 2:48 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I'd suggest you start by finding out what WiFiMe does. There's a lot of information on this forum if you search for it (try searching for "wifime").  
<br/>
<br/>
Or use a search engine to find info about it on the net. The first hit for "wifime" on google.com explains exactly what you need to use WiFiMe at the top of the page.<br/>_________________<br/>---

It works now!  I had even tried FlashMe with a card (Yoshi Touch and Go) in the slot, but it didn't work.  Metroid demo + FlashMe/PassMe runs polarium demo.   I tried yoshi touch and go with a regular PassMe and it didn't work with polarium.  Yoshi+PassMe worked with, for instance, nibbles 1.1 though.
<br/>
<br/>
I was stuck on level 5 for so long... the tutorial helped a little; I didn't realize that only each horizontal line had to be a single color, not the entire puzzle.
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if dumping download play demos will become commonplace.  Maybe we could start trying those demos from the kiosks in japan, if it is determined to be legal.

All you need to run the polarium demo is a compatible wifi card.  Homebrew demos still require a flash card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To me that makes it seem like FlashMe isn't all that good after all..

What I am wondering is about this post:

Which implies you can get the demo working simply by sending it over wirelessly and using the "ds download play" option. I dunno, getting this demo working without a flash cart sounds a little unlikely to me since firefly has just got wireless multiboots's to work without RSA signatures, and I don't think he's released this firmware yet ( <a href="http://users.belgacom.net/bn967347/" target="_blank">http://users.belgacom.net/bn967347/</a> )<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
