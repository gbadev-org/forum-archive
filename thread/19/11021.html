    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What a particularly *great* review! And how nice of you to share it with the GBADev community, since you have tested this device so extensively with the various flavours of FAT libraries. Looks like the M3lite is finally a worthy successor to the GBAMP!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Btw. got a M3 Lite / MicroSD a week ago. Works perfectly and is so far the flash adapter I'm most pleased with - only difference you can notice to the normal DS Lite face plate is that the color is matte, not shining as the original. And they even hand out white + blue + black covers so you can match the adapter with your DS Lite color.
<br/>
<br/>
Only downside I can see from the developer point of view is slow exchange of flashcards - you need to remove the adapter, take the MicroSD card out, put it in a SD-adapter and only after that you're set for copying files. Comparing to wmb or let's say M3SD it's ages slower. Well, using DS Phat with old M3 models or wmb for development in most cases so this doesn't matter for me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
