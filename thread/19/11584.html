    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I?ve looked troughly in the forum and found nothing of the sort... If I missed the topic, forgive me.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I saw this only on site of a store (will not mention here for obvious reasons) that performs the Flashme service and, they say that there are some DS Lite models that are not flashable.
<br/>
<br/>
Is that true? How can I identify them? Or is there any model that is harder to do it?
<br/>
<br/>
Any info is appreciated!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh.. sounds like it.. You should send them an e-mail asking if there is a way to identify the models that are not flashable, as you plan to buy a DS Lite and want to make sure they can flash it.  I'm sure they will respond with "There is no way to tell until we try." in which case.. if they can't flash it.. what do they do?  Just send it back and you waste shipping charges?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<span style="font-style: italic">Hello!
<br/>
<br/>
On your site, you say: Some new released NDS Lite machine is not Flashable!!
<br/>
<br/>
How can I identify my Ds Lite to know if it is flashable or not?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!
<br/>
----------------
<br/>
There is no way to identify it at the moment. you will only know when
<br/>
you flash it.
<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Haven't heard anything of unflashable Lites myself either... in fact just flashed a brand new pink DS Lite two days ago as smoothly as before. Too bad FlashMe doesn't recognize the firmware version of newer Lites so there's no way of telling if there's been changes in the retail firmware lately.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you know if those DS's are out in the US or are they just in Asia?
<br/>
<br/>
And, does the DS turn off anytime you short the SL1 (i.e. flashme is not running) or just when it is about to write the bios?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yyjoy said the DS is an American version. I think it will turn off whenever SL1 is shorted, FlashMe running or not.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
