<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">The main problem with this method is related to the fact that the modified firmware is slightly bigger than the original one. When Nintendo adds more functionality to the firmware, (wifi parameters) it breaks compatibility with the current version of FlashMe. Users of version 4 (and lower) of FlashMe encountered firmware corruption with wifi enabled games. Newer versions of FlashMe (versions 5, 6 and 7 as of this writing) were shuffled around and recompressed to be compatible with wifi-enabled games, such as Mario Kart DS.</span>

<br/>
I have firmware v4.
<br/>
<br/>
I also found this on wiki.PIRACY-DOT-COM:
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Fallback to standard firmware: The Select button skips gamecode detection. This means you can hold Select to boot the DS card, Select+B to boot the GBA card, or Select+Start to enter the firmware menu.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Does this mean I have to hold a/some buttons everytime I want to play a game?
<br/>
<br/>
And I also found this:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Backlight fades in at startup. </span>
<br/>
<br/>
What happens after that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Auto-mode overrides that i know of:

Start - Main Menu

B - GBA mode

nothing - DS mode</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
