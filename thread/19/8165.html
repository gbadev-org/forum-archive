If so, do my friend codes change and will I have to reset my cart+DS bondings?<br/>_________________<br/>Aughr</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It didn't change any of my settings, and Mario Kart didn't do anything odd when I ran it. I think all games store their wifi settings in the same place.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dont think its stored in the firmware. Your online data will probably be stored on the Nintendo server and other data will probably be stored on your game card. Now I dont own mario kart myself (out o money :P) but I think if you run mario kart form another DS it will still know your data and not the data from the other DS. And the online data should be stored on the Nintendo online server, otherwise it would be way to easy to cheat :P.

<br/>
But like I said I dont know how mario kart stores its data cause I dont have it (yet).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, the DS stores WiFi configuration settings in the firmware.  You can configure it offline as much as you want.  Any online-enabled game with the WFC configuration utility built in can access it.
<br/>
<br/>
Now if you mean other types of data like a win/loss record or some such thing, I'd assume that's up to the specific game.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Definitely...if you have a bunch of WFC enabled games, that means you could set the settings once and all the games could use those same settings without  you having to enter anything additional in.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
