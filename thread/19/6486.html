<br/>
Thanks for your interesting our products.
<br/>
M3 adapter has not sold now. M3 will be put out about 2 weeks later. We will
<br/>
have our agents in every country and district, and you can contact our agents
<br/>
for purchasing our products.
<br/>
We will inform you after our products have been put out formally.
<br/>
Different places have different prices. The estimated retail price of M3 perfect
<br/>
-SD version is around USD 88-96 range, and M3 perfect -CF version is around USD
<br/>
80-88 range .
<br/>
M3 can run more than 256 M roms.
<br/>
Regards
<br/>
Danny

<br/>
 looks like it will be around 80 dollars without shipping for the cf version, and if you look at m3adapter.com it now states that the product will be out on August 30th, adn the name has been changed to M3perfect due to the fact that the gba and nds verison of the m3 are the same now. It also says that it will be able to run clean dumps of nds roms over 256meg.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">CF is based on ATA, and SD is based on SPI. (Almost all MMC cards support SPI as well.) Neither interface has any known essential patents that would apply to card readers. SD does have a smaller form factor, which may allow for a smaller unit or make it easier to lay out the parts on the PCB.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

So would I be better off just buying a reader/writer or a USB-to-Mini cable?

<br/>
Also, would a 512MB CF card be a good size? Could I fit a movie and some homebrew stuff onto that? You can put multiple .nds files onto the M3 right? I'm going to start coding when I get my M3, it'll be great.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you are not experienced in this sort of thing, wait until reviews and tutorials come in before making decisions. Baseless speculation belongs in the offtopic forum.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

so, hang on, just to clarify in my mind...
<br/>
<br/>
out the box, the M3 will NOT be able to boot .NDS files off an SD card?
<br/>
<br/>
in addition to the M3 i'll also need a pass through device such as the Neoflash if i want to boot .nds files?

i'm surprised this is making me look so dim ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">AFAIK, untll a 'real' DS re-writable cartridge that actually goes into the DS slot is created, you'll always need a PassMe (or whatever they choose to call it) in there.

The only way around having to use a physical PassMe is to use a virtual one - the FlashMe - but I don't know if the M3/G3 will be able to take advantage of it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
