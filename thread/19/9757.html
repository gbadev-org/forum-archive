    <h4>#85628 - grooverunner - Thu Jun 01, 2006 11:33 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi I'm from Australia and I picked up my DS Lite today (June 1).
<br/>
<br/>
I was about to install flashme v7 but I got the following message:
<br/>
<br/>
"Your firmware is not recognized. If you continue, it may not be possible to restore your firmware to its original state".
<br/>
<br/>
"Push START to continue anyway".
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone else out there got the same message when they were flashing their DS Lite with Flashme v7? I'd be interested to know if this also happened on Japanese units?
<br/>
<br/>
I can load .NDS files if I use my Passkey2 so I can afford to be patient.
<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed that with the Passkey 2 I didn't need to write to the SRAM to load NDS files. As soon as I booted up the M3 with Passkey2 I was able to load NDS files. I recall having to write to SRAM with my older model DS so I found this strange, but convenient.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
just bought my aussie dsl this morning.. spent 2 hours installing flashme lol (i was scared of it turning off mid flash)
<br/>
<br/>
make sure u have the right version of flashme
<br/>
<br/>
when it says 
<br/>
"Push START to continue anyway". 
<br/>
press start
<br/>
<br/>
the first line should say 'FLASHME INTSALLER (DS LITE)'
<br/>
<br/>
if it does.. continue to flash it should be fine
<br/>
if it doesn't i wouldn't recommend continuing.. and find a diff version of flashme
<br/>
<br/>
not sure about the 'DS Lite Beta' tho... someone give it a try...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Was it taken down? I believe v7 is the latest one anyway so I'll give it a try tonight and post my results. I've already insulated the tool I'm using to short SL1.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You will probably be able to recover your system. Read the last few pages of the long thread in this forum for instructions. Basically:
<br/>
- remove everything from your SD card but flashme.nds
<br/>
- remove your passme device
<br/>
- boot the DS Lite, even though the screens don't work
<br/>
- press A a few times until the flashme screen appears again
<br/>
<br/>
Please post your results.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Success!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!
<br/>
<br/>
I managed to download flashme v7 from:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://mobiles.gx-mod.com/modules/mydownloads/visit.php?lid=1700" target="_blank">http://mobiles.gx-mod.com/modules/mydownloads/visit.php?lid=1700</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I checked the MD5 against what bug suggested and it checked out. I even got the the "FLASHME INSTALLER (DS LITE)" screen chaRwie mentioned.
<br/>
<br/>
I cut off the end of a metal coat hanger to short SL1. I used a dremel tool to make the metal surface bare / clean. I insulated the sides of it by taping it up with some electrical tape. It was a perfect fit, didn't move around very much yet I could still spin it around if it wasn't making any contact. All up it took me about 2 minutes to get to 100% with some slight rotation every now and again to achieve contact. I made sure not to wiggle the wire around too much.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps someone else hoping to flash an Aussie DS Lite.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ennead,
<br/>
<br/>
An MD5 check is something you do to ensure you have the correct/original file. It would be the equivalent of doing a fingerprint analysis to determine a person's identity.
<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded Flashme v7 from a French forum so I wanted to make sure it was the original thing and not something that would brick my DS. It turned out the be the correct file so I went ahead and installed Flashme v7.
<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest reading up on how to install Flashme on the DS Lite if you haven't done this sort of thing before. From what I understand it is very easy to short out other components on the DS Lite so it helps to be prepared.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#85843 - Ennead - Fri Jun 02, 2006 4:05 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, thanks grooverunner.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm indeed reading up on it. I'm currently thinking a taped in paperclip with just the end exposed might do the job. As far as I understand, the only danger there is to bricking the DS, is when you touch more than just the SL1 with a piece of metal. So if I just tape up all but the end, I could be sticking goalposts up there...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Good luck with your flashing. Don't panic if your % meter isn't going up. Move the tool you're using to short SL1 around a bit until you make contact and it will resume. Don't be too vigorous about it though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I did get the warning text saying the firmware didn't match also. =)

These DS Lites's were bought on 1st of June at Myer in Sydney.
<br/>
And it works very well with EZ4 MiniSD flashcart.

<br/>
It's so easy to flash it that I don't know how people could mess it up.
<br/>
Just use a very small flathead screw driver with tape around the sides.
<br/>
Then put it in the hole vertically towards the middle of the SLI bridge contacts (so it doesn't bridge)
<br/>
Then once in, turn the screw driver 90 degrees to bridge. Simple! =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
