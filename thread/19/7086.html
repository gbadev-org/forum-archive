<br/>
<br/>
Now about what has been "released"...
<br/>
(1) It poses as a loader for illegal commercial ROMs
<br/>
(2) It's meant as vigilante punishment of warez0rs
<br/>
(3) It deletes FW of a bunch of different devices (NDS included)
<br/>
<br/>
No respected homebrewer will ever put that thing into a homebrew app. So the only people that should be afraid are the pirates.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW: I know not everybody agrees with vigilante justice. I also don't say that I agree with vigilante justice. I am just explaining what that thing is and is meant for.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Because the metal thing in the hole is to allow the flashme to overwrite the first sector of the firmware with a fail-safe boot block, precisely for protection from malicious code. The rest of the firmware is wide open to attack. 
<br/>
<br/>
Non-flashmed DSs aren't known to have this style of fail-safe, so if the rest of the firmware is corrupted there is no way for them to recover. It is *safer* to have a flashed DS than to use an original firmware with Wifime or Passme. Now that is ironic.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, no source was released, so this isn't likely to make it into any other homebrew yet. I'm sure it will be reverse engineered, though. Even if it isn't, the information on how to write to the firmware is already available on the internet. Just read bottledlight, Neimod's DSTek, and the spec sheets for the firmware chip.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i was talking to ROMMAN ( Supercard creator ) he will try to make a file scan so look the code.. mey be it will check for Supercard fimware changes..  and probably will work for everyone..

i just hope  other people start making one too.. becouse romman is a lot busier wiht the new firmware in prodution.. ( no file size pro NDS files.  no more 32MG limits for hombrew )

How can he be anymore? And furthermore, what's to stop Nintendo accusing the homebrewers of writing a Nintendo DS-specific virus? The simple fact is, someone wrote malicious code for their system, effectively causing people to destroy their systems, and no doubt hundreds of people may actually send their DS's back to Nintendo claiming they're faulty.
<br/>
<br/>
Surely, people will be weary of going online with their Nintendo DS now...

I play games that I own for my SNES, and NES on my Nintendo DS. I own them. Should I worry about other homebrewer authors following DarkFader's lead?

There has been a single isolated incident in which DarkFader has written a program with the purpose of overwriting the firmware of the DS, and a few other systems. The homebrew community (and #dsdev) has not endorsed this, nor are they responsible for spreading it.
<br/>
<br/>
Quit the hype please, people. A destructive program like this is intentional, and will not affect normal homebrew; DS wifi will NOT be affected. As usual, use caution in what you run, and don't run every odd program off of obscure/illegal forums, you'll be fine.

Rather than "[expletive deleted] [expletive deleted]ers broke my DS, I'll show those [expletive deleted] by spreading the file I now have in 2000 different repackaged versions everywhere on the 'net."
<br/>
<br/>
I don't recall anyone writing code to try and nuke GBA carts even though we suffer from rampant piracy there, and I'm sorry to see this show up on the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I test every file prior to adding it to ndshb.com..  I don't have FlashMe installed.. but I guess I will need to buy another DS so that I can have it installed.. (I test every PassMe prior to shipping, so I can't use a FlashMe'd DS).  Which, I need to buy anyway, so I can try to find a new firmware'd DS..
<br/>
<br/>
At any rate..  As Natrium42 said, this is nothing new on the internet.  If you want to be mad at someone, how about Nintendo?  They are the ones that designed the hardware to allow this kind of code to be created!  Sure, they didn't have "plans" for unsigned code to be run on the hardware, but let's just face it..  Nothing is hackproof.  If anything, everyone that is safe with FlashMe, should go to loopy's site and donate.  Anyone that briked their DS and were able to recover because of FlashMe should go to loopy's site and donate.  Anyone that is a pirate, and plans to run stuff downloaded from questionable site (ya'know.. the warez sites?).. should install FlashMe.. oh.. and don't forget to DONATE!
<br/>
<br/>
See.. I think it is so funny for people to run around.. downloading free stuff.. pirating, complaining about the free stuff that is available.. etc..  and then when something big comes along, everyone is ready to place blame on someone else.. and are all pissed about it.  No one want's to remember that the homebrew community is made up of a bunch of people that do it because they like it.  They are not getting paid to do it.  They do it for fun.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think this whole issue has been blown up a bit. If you check the logs, you will see it was a joke shared by the people on the channel at the time. I myself do not endorse it, those comments on IRC were meant as a joke about my GBAMP firmware and should not be treated as my personal opinion. I just thought I had to clear that up.
<br/>
<br/>
Apart from the links being spread with the reports of the "virus", it has not been given out by anyone on the channel. I won't send it to people, even if they are ROMz lamers bugging me about GBAMP support. That is not right.
<br/>
<br/>
I think this issue is making a mountain out of a mole hill. It seems that the people doing the most damage are infact warezers (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.tehskeen.com" target="_blank">www.tehskeen.com</a>) who seem intent on getting revenge on the DS dev community. A lot of the information being spread is false. This was not made to eliminate NeoFlash's competition, DarkFader is not the ring leader of GST (as far as I know), and the legitimate DS dev community will not be putting this into any other program. 
<br/>
<br/>
As for warezers who are going on an offensive towards the DS dev community, talk about biting the hand that feeds you! Who was it that created the code for the first PassMe? DarkFader! Who was it that dumped the first ROMs (for educational purposes)? DarkFader! We may have gotten sick of your constant piracy, but that doesn't mean that any of us would purposely damage your DS. Again, I say check the logs, and notice the blatant warnings.

TROUBLE is a trademark of Hasbro, as are SORRY! and PARCHEESI. If any Nintendo DS game came out with this name, it'd be a Hasbro product, and it'd be a commercial ROM. But there are generic terms: "ludo", "slide pursuit", and "pachisi".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Hey, I trust the dev'rs still.  I could recover my firmware anyway if it got trashed, but honestly, I can't imagine tons of people putting this in their games or DS applications or anything like that.  If they make these games, dont' they want them to get played?  How would they get played if someone tried it, it bricked their DS, and they ran off screaming "OMG OMGOMG!  IT IS TEH VIRUS!"
<br/>
<br/>
They game wouldn't get played because no one would touch it or their other work with a ten foot pole.

he did make something bad, targeted at pirates like you. look on darkfader's website, do you see r0mloader anywhere? where do you find it? on ds rom websites:
<br/>
<br/>
r0m loader for Nintendo DS
<br/>
It automatically patches the game during load.
<br/>
You can switch DS card/GBA cart save and save settings per game.
<br/>
Put the loader on a CF or SD card together with the NDS files.
<br/>
Start the loader and select the NDS to play!
<br/>
Enjoy.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi! all,
<br/>
<br/>
    Maybe you're right about piracy, and everything... BUT Why did the DS Bricker kill the GBAMP? This one is known to not allow the launch of original roms. Why attacking this device?
<br/>
<br/>
    I have bought DS games, but I mainly buy the DS for using it as a PDA, that can also play good games in decent conditions. That's why I have lots of hopes into DSLinux, Wins, etc... Sadly, I couldn't contribute to the DS scene, as I have no time to developp (children, work, and a really busy life) and I hope I can find some time to(as I'm a computer engineer). 
<br/>
<br/>
    Now, if there is a loader on the GBAMP, that can launch commercial games too; it can be very usefull, as I can use my personnal games stored in a flash card,and Linux on the same DS without having to change anything on the DS. BUT did this use make me a Pirate hungry of the blood of the developpers????
<br/>
<br/>
    I also have a supercard because some homebrews cannot be launched from the GBAMP (or couldn't at the time I bought it BEFORE it can launch NDS commercials).
<br/>
<br/>
    To resume: I found extremely troubling in attacking an honorable device like GBAMP. Natrium42 who has done a lot for the DS Scene (an the one who made my passme (one of the 100 first sold serie)) say that gbatemp is a headquarter for piracy? Why did Darkfader post on this forum? I know this forum because I was looking for the beginnigs of the "legal homebrew" DS Scene....
<br/>
<br/>
    Trust me or not, I'm not a pirate, BUT I condamn this DS Bricker. 
<br/>
<br/>
    I don't want to bother the ones who made the homebrew start; but at the beginnings, there was lots of rumors about the "collaboration" between NeoFlash Team and Darfader, and a possible leakage from original Nintendo documentations. Rumors are rumors.... But the things that really makes me surprised is that possible attack of the GBAMP....
<br/>
<br/>
    Unless there has been a loader that I'm not aware of on the GBAMP, I'm in great troubles about the fact that the only device that is not affected is the Neoflash one....
<br/>

Last week, the neoflash team finally released their backup manager/patching software. Is it to make their device "clean", as it can now be used as a legal "backup device"? So now that they are not in the piracy business?

<br/>
But the GST roms where exclusively for them! They start the commerical launch of non-clean backup (meaning you couldn't backup the game and make it start yourself). Maybe the DSBricker could have started attacking this SYMBOL of piracy....

I can't remember I put my name in the executable or text file. So you don't have to trust the executable in that case.
<br/>
Whenever I release something trustable, I put my name in/with it. (No guarantees that others could not use my name)
<br/>
I did lower the trust level of the whole DS homebrew community though. But it might also scare off some pirates. So it's like a double edged sword.
<br/>
It was fairly simple to make and I had this idea for a long time. If PSP has malware, DS can have some too. It's proven now that both DS and PSP are vulnerable and this stuff doesn't need to happen again. Perhaps Nintendo and Sony will try to protect their next systems somewhat better.

Considering how many DSs people have bricked and had replaced so far, I think it could have saved money ;)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'll just leave it at this for myself, and some sensible others may decide to follow:
<br/>
It's done. Randomly taking shots at DarkFader won't fix anything -- what he did wasn't black and white, but it probably has had a positive effect, assuming that Nintendo NEVER KNOWS. Unfortunately, they probably will know, and this is even more likely considering the spectacular number of discussions about BrickMe.
<br/>
Find a way to detect the problem. 
<br/>
Use this check if wanted... Better safe than bricked.
<br/>
Seeing as the check will probably not be done (or known of) by the mob of software pirates, all will be fine.

I have worse things to worry about, and I'm sure you do too.

That's because the BIOS is a mask ROM on the same die as the CPU and because games call the BIOS directly through SWIs. Firmware on the other hand is an application loaded only at power-on (apart from the saved settings), and games don't call into it. Therefore, changing the BIOS needs a lot more re-verification of correctness than does changing the firmware.

I can guarentee that this code will get into Homebrew some how and thats where the most damage will happen.

<br/>
No person has the right to release programs like this and any idiot who thinks its amusing it seriously tapped, personally i hope Nintendo get a hold of his name and address and thats not hard thankfully and prosecute the man.

<br/>
He has also given Nintendo the go ahead to have a real go at the homebrew scene as a whole and also bring out new firmwares that close of all routes into the DS.

[08:08] &lt;SolidSnak&gt; since we need to flash it to a card in order to work

[08:08] &lt;sgstair&gt; it's been that way for a while, just add a loader to it (the directions tell you how)

<br/>
this guy wasn't looking to play scumm games. when a homebrew app (like scummvm) needs to exceed the 32MB barrier it can use bankswitching code and get the data it needs. I don't see how this would be possible on a commercial nds game running from a flash card. it would require rewriting code when data/code beyond that limit needs to be read. again, good luck to nds pirates when more games are larger than 32MB.
<br/>
<br/>
gba flash cards have limited rewrite cycles of like 100,000. anyone could have wrote a little demo that erases the first sector of a card that many times in a couple seconds and render the card useless. this kind of thing was gonna happen some time. and DF with all his hardware knowledge mine as well been the one to do it. again I don't see it on his site, so if some pirate site posted it, I wouldn't try it. that's what the rom kiddies get, flashing their bios from shit they got off a rom site.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
But those changes might have timing or other effects on the other routines in the BIOS. For this reason, and because the BIOS sits on the same die as the CPU, you have to re-QA the whole thing and make a new tapeout. This gets expensive. Besides, it's an Open Secret(tm) that official developers use Chinese flash cards, and if they have to buy Nintendo's own expensive cards in order to test multiplayer code on production units, then somebody's going to defect to the other guys' platform (N-Gage, Palm, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/pocketpc/default.mspx" target="_blank">Xboy</a>, or PSP).

Easy: the patcher inserts code to set the bankswitch whenever loading a 512 byte block of data. The GST patcher is rumored to do exactly this.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The code to reflash firmware was known for a long time.
<br/>
That's why the "homebrew" firmware got a recovery stub.

No doubt programs that erase firmware would surface, but it is not a big deal as the first 64KB region can be protected (or all regions with Sanyo chips) and replaced with a much smaller sized firmware.

The DS, as we know, is a world more complicated and things like flashing and wifi loading nd whatnot become buzzwords that some newbie night not understand.  and if someone like dark fader comes out ad say here, use this to run games, a newbie might just very well do what he says.

True, if you go by the terms used by comp.geek people, or look up the medical term of virus in a biological organism.

layman:
<br/>
I dont go to the store to buy the product "symantic antivirus" and "symantec antitrojan" and "symantec antihijacker" and "symantec anti whatever else you can come up with" - virus describes all of these as they are in the net/pc world - malicious code that generally either hides as something else and does something bad or benign code that either hides as something else and does something insignifigant.
<br/>
<br/>
but in even simpler terms: if you support or laud the actions of the virus (whether spread to warez ppl or not) you will be more inclined to side with the geek/bio definition of virus, and if you dont support it (or for that matter dont know much about PC's in general) you will be more inclined to support the layman definition (ie: someone infected with a trojan and seeing strange behavior of their device will likely go to check if they have a VIRUS).
<br/>
<br/>
and the link has many def's of virus, I chose the one I beleive to be accepted by many non-geek people who are often even capable of programming.

In other words, if someone corrects you and says.. It's not a virus, it's a trojan.. Go look it up and see instead of trying to find a definition that fits into your arguement..

Your right, Thats not what I'm saying.  I'm saying that if some newb thought that to run ds homebrew he had to run this flashed thing that DF made, he might not know any better, and ruin his DS for DF's private mission to hurt all  pirates.  I know when I was new to this, if someone told me on these boards to run X program and it will work, then I would.  If X program was DF's little hack, then I would be screwed.

<br/>
<br/>
Juhees: so you say we should trust sites with homebrew?
<br/>
I dont get it. Some people say its dangerous to run homebrew now.
<br/>
nintendo-ds-roms seem to be flashed copies of the actual games. I'm guessing this site is illegal. I dont think I trust that site anyway. But I did run some of those roms they have with iDeas and some run (but very poorly). has anyone downloaded from this site and tried it on their DS?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry if I sound ignorant, but I am new to the scene. I am a programmer and I would love to learn more about how to program these handhelds.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone list trustable sites? 
<br/>
<br/>
Should I change my NDS firmware? or should I mantain the original firmware? (by this I mean, avoiding nds files completly; reason why I ask about gba files).
<br/>

<br/>
I can’t remember I put my name in the executable or text file. So you don’t have to trust the executable in that case.
<br/>
Whenever I release something trustable, I put my name in/with it. (No guarantees that others could not use my name)
<br/>
I did lower the trust level of the whole DS homebrew community though. But it might also scare off some pirates. So it’s like a double edged sword.
<br/>
It was fairly simple to make and I had this idea for a long time. If PSP has malware, DS can have some too. It’s proven now that both DS and PSP are vulnerable and this stuff doesn’t need to happen again. Perhaps Nintendo and Sony will try to protect their next systems somewhat better.

I should have realized the impact. Not just few DS'es that were hurt, but all the damn media and whatnot.
<br/>
I cannot really justify my actions. It was also very selfish to draw some attention, which I tend to do in odd ways.
<br/>
It caused some harm to some non-targetted and targetted people owning a DS with non-Nintendo-approved hardware.
<br/>
And that is a terrible thing to do. Even more so with the reputation I had in the DS homebrew scene that now completely abandoned me.
<br/>
I do not have clear reasons and I can't blaim the little headache I had at the time. I just had to realize the idea I had after seeing the PSP variant of a bricker.
<br/>
The files do not come with any form of name/signature of me, a thing I would do if it could be trusted.
<br/>
I won't release any more of this crap for DS and I don't think parts of this trojan or the idea itself will emerge in future homebrew releases.
<br/>
The point is probably clear. Do not run any form of untrusted code that just suddenly appears without any name.
<br/>
If you only use official Nintendo games, there is absolutely nothing to worry about.
<br/>
Untrusted code includes ROM loaders and that sort of stuff. It's probably not a very good reason since it has been proven before.
<br/>
I can tell that the negative feedback is far greater than the positive ones. I received one donation of $6.66 and I'm not proud of it.
<br/>
One news site completely ignores the r0mloader version and reasoning behind it. grrrrr.
<br/>
Another common mistake: A TROJAN IS NOT A VIRUS! That means that it does not propagate on its own. And thus non-intrusive.
<br/>
<br/>
The trojan was released in two forms:
<br/>
Trojan.DSBrick.A, 151361 bytes, md5sum a959cfa514f4c7162a81421ee99d3356, r0mloader.nds
<br/>
Version A was intended for the so called ROM-pirates. Hence the name of the filename and description.
<br/>
<br/>
Trojan.DSBrick.B, 548673 bytes, md5sum 8e7a3728759df265ca3a78553cf27bb8, taihen.nds
<br/>
Version B was not really released into public and should rarely be seen. It was only directly released in a closed IRC channel with prior notice of what it did and a comment that might have triggered some (less evil than me) persons to pass it along.
<br/>
<br/>
I cannot control the propagation of the files or the names it might be disguised as.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, on to the more technical details:
<br/>
The trojan _tries_ (but not definately succeeds) to:
<br/>
* Erase DS firmware. Practically the first 64 KBytes are write-protected and thus is recoverable when the FlashMe firmware was installed.
<br/>
* Erase first few sectors of CompactFlash card inside GBA movieplayer. You can try to sort out your data sectors if you really want something back.
<br/>
* Erase GBA movieplayer firmware. Fairly easy to fix using flashmp utility.
<br/>
* Erase Supercard firmware. A fix is currently being worked on.
<br/>
* Erase/lock XG/Neo flash card. Seems it was forgotten to be mentioned in r0mloader.txt.
<br/>
If you have a legal use for these functions like testing recovery tools, you're welcome.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are some fixing utilities and links:
<br/>
ppflash.zip - Contains info, sourcecode and binary to flash the fail-safe loader also contained in FlashMe using a parallel port connection. Some soldering skills are required to perform this operation. Don't worry about voiding your warranty because you already have according to the DS manuals.
<br/>
FlashMe - The page to get FlashMe. You can't survive without it.
<br/>
flashmp.zip - Firmware flasher for GBA Movie Player. Supports writing to Supercard, but the included firmware IS NOT WORKING probably because of a bad firmware dump! If you have an original firmware version and Flash Advance Linker, let me know.
<br/>
Probably more to come.
<br/>
You can detect DSbrick by using DSbrick.signature and the utility grep:
<br/>
grep -F -U -f DSbrick.signature FileToBeTested.nds
<br/>
A good way to prevent malicious firmware access is to keep a record of known ARM7 binaries. This could be incorporated into ndstool.

One of the slide show homebrew software was found that it would destroy the NDS firmware and most of the flashcard firmware. However, unlike another flashcard product, the first part of the M3 firmware is hardware protected so it is safety to recover the firmware by re-installing our update software. To prevent NDS firmware form permanently destroyed, we suggest installing the “FLASHME” as it can allow users to recover the NDS firmware by re-installing “FLASHME”.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Normal, unmodified DS's will only be able to run wireless multiboots that are cryptographically signed by Nintendo.  FlashMe allows the DS to run unsigned multiboots.
<br/>
<br/>
It's practically impossible to sign r0mloader with Nintendo's private key, unless you are Nintendo.  Like Nintendo would ever sign anything like that!
<br/>
<br/>
So, there's no risk of permanent damage from wireless multiboot abuse, except for users with no way to run a restore program on their brickified GBAMP.

Anyways, it's probably true that messing up the firmware is an easy thing to do, so it could be sort of considered a good thing that DarkFader did it before some other doubley manic maniac.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since noone has the source code except for DarkFader, I think we're safe to assume that it won't get any worse -- For example, MoonShell DS's BrickMe protection will probably always work.
<br/>
If someone creates his own version, it's pretty safe to assume that it means that it could have been done by anyone, and it's kind of an advantage that we learned of the possibility from someone who wasn't crazy enough to crash all of <span style="font-style: italic">our</span> DSs. It can be considered a good thing that we are now aware of the possibility of malicious software getting onto a DS.
<br/>
<br/>
So... my plan is to not download something unless I know that it works. ie: A video of it in action on the system. Most people who manage to create something good will not hide a trojan in their wonderful application that took them two months to build, and they also won't release a trojan instead of the application. Simple reasoning.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

It is very easy to rename the r0mloader.nds to something else. The MD5 can be changed simply by pasting a few bytes onto the end of the file, which will be ignored. And if someone really wanted to they could "unbuild" the nds file, add some useless bytes to the ends of the binaries, change the icon and name, then rebuild the file. This is a farily obvious thing to do, so "Security through Obscurity" isn't likely to last.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I'm not particularily worried. I hope that people don't freak out and not trust me due to my complete newness, for example, but it's not really that big a fear. One brave soul will always try something, say that it works, and alleviate any worries anyone else might have.

I don't think that pirates should have their DSs bricked. Who's to say that the game industry is much better than the music industry? And BTW: I do own quite a few games, so no I'm not a pirater. And if my DS was bricked with brew, I would try out a gp2x instead, cuz it looks kinda cool. So yes, they would lose business anyways.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
