    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all, i'd like to say hello :D
<br/>
<br/>
Now, what i'm trying to do is to flash my DS Lite with FlashMeV7 using a G6 Lite 3rd Generation (4Gb) an a SuperPass2...
<br/>
<br/>
I programmed the SuperPass2 for Mario &amp; Luigi 2 [NTR-ARMP-EUR / ARMPN0J22], flipped the switch and put the game inside the SuperPass2.
<br/>
Then i copied the armp-0.gba and armp-0.sav (i even copied the .sav file to a .0 file, as the G6 seems to be using this extension) file onto the G6 Lite and booted to the menu.
<br/>
I tried to start the armp-0.gba using the Game Flash Loader and the "MyCard" Menu.
<br/>
Then i start the sram program, it says "Writing SRAM... done.", i insert the SuperPass2 with the original game in it and restart the DS.
<br/>
But after the Startup-Logo there are just 2 blank white screens and no reaction to anything.
<br/>
<br/>
I already tried Pepsiman's SRAM Loader, downloading the files in different ways... even inserting the SuperPass2 with flipped/unflipped switch and before or during restarting the DS Lite.
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing i get are those damned whitescreens... what am i doing wrong? :(
<br/>
<br/>
Please help me... Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
