    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
i got a black ds lite which seems to be one of those with the wifi bug that forces you to use channel 10 on your router in order to "see" it.
<br/>
while i can connect to my router using channel 10 fine with the nds wifi homebrew test application, commercial games wont connect to it. This seems to be a known buggy firmware version so i'm wondering if flashing the firmware of the ds might help. Sofar, i only found flashme firmwares for download. I there hope that this upgrade might fix my ds?
<br/>
I'm using a M3Simply / R4DS btw.
<br/>
<br/>
thx in advance,
<br/>

My friend has a black DS Lite with the new WiFi system, though he is able to play commercial games (real cards) just fine, and when he changes his router to channel 10, he can run things built with the latest WiFi Lib as well (DSOrganize, DSAIM, WiFi Lib Test) but not thing built on the old system.  I have no DS Lite, so I don't really know the entire story behind it, but if there's a bad firmware out there, FlashMe might fix it, since it's based on a good firmware.  Make sure you find the right one though, some FlashMe's will break DS Lite brightness control, others won't.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Your friends situation sounds a lot like mine, maybe if i resolve my issue, you could tell him about it, will post it here.
<br/>
I will try to reflash with flashme v8a tomorrow, seems to be the most recent version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i flashed it today. While i guess i know where you're getting at, it promptly worked, connection to non-channel 10 networks worked right away. I also got rid of the health warning and no brightness probs here.
<br/>
Dont know, dont care. Worked, try it if you experience similar problems.
