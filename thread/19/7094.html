<br/>
<br/>
i've just bought a blue DS, and it won't work with hombrew because of the new firmware
<br/>
i've heard about the iQue PassMe
<br/>
<a href="http://home.utah.edu/~u0422123/iQue/" target="_blank">http://home.utah.edu/~u0422123/iQue/</a>
<br/>
a modified passme that may work fine
<br/>
<br/>
but is it usable with wifime?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right now, WifiMe won't work. However with a change in the binary, it should.  ARM7 and ARM9 entry points should point into game code so that DS will execute it. Of course, it will be DS card specific.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if FireFly is planning to add this kind of support, though...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so are you saying that those of us that have the blue DS should wait a while so that "iQue" can be better developed before buying a PassME.  Oh and one more question, will the Super Passkey have the updated iQue programming?  Sorry im a total newb to DS, i just got it yesterday.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right now, it should work if you have following things:
<br/>
(1) PassMe with iQue code
<br/>
(2) iQue-code specific DS card (Metroid demo, if Loopy's PassMe code is used)
<br/>
(3) GBA flashcart with SRAM
<br/>
(4) Modified NDS loader (the one that gets prepended to .nds to get .ds.gba)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">is the ndsloader thats on the firmware replacement page ok to use?  i know i need a passme to boot and a flash card to install, but is it the same installation as the old way?  also, which flashcart do you recommend, im getting different information from everyone, and even being a newb i tend to know that you know what youre talking about around the forums, so thanks for the help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Uh.. I wouldn't do that if I were you...  There is no new Firmware update available for the iQue (that I know of)...  It is totally different..  The iQue DS PassMe code allows you to run homebrew..  Untill someone dumps the firmware and patches it, you will be stuck using PassMe/WiFiMe.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the Super PassKey and other "commercialized" versions, none of them are strait forward reprogrammable.  I haven't looked, but some might even be "write" protected.  Though, with the CPLD we are using, that doesn't really mean anything, as DF researched, and there is a way to overide that function.  But, the Super PassKey is glued together, so opening one would be a pain in the butt.  The Magic Key on the other hand, opens very easy..  You'd still have to figure out the JTAG programming points.. but it could be done.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so ur saying that i shouldnt softmod and just use the PassMe.  i was going to buy one anyway, its just, with the enclosure it would be more protected, which was my reasoning for the super.  as for GBA flashcart, which one should i get, an M3, EZflash, GBAMP, etc., as well as a store with it cheap?  just a total newb wondering what "should" work best.  thanks for any help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">FlashMe checks what FW you have and if it doesn't recognize it, it won't flash. Right now, it recognizes v1 and v2 FW. That's why it will refuse to flash DS with the new v3 FW. If that check is modified, it should work on an iQuesque DS.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, but how would one get around the v3 FW check?  and in research im pretty sure im gonna get the GBAMP unless anyone can tell me a reason why not to.  im gonna be using it basically to play homebrew and the occasional ROM, but who doesnt?  i just want to make sure the one i get will work with this DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GBAmp doesn't have SRAM, which is vital to run the iQue bypass.
<br/>
Go for a SuperCard and sell it after iQue FlashMe comes out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

the only way to go forward in the homebrew community is to support the newest hardware, which happens to be the iQue DS.  without people who will help out the people who have them we (the homebrew community) cant move forward into the better development future.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's only available in china.

The homebrew community is meant to support any hardware, rather than commerical stuff that (not applicable to this but..) forces you to ugrade or be left behind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
