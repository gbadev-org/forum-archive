    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone,
<br/>
I am able to boot SRLs off my flash cartridge when using my PassMe2 + Castlevania US (after I incorporated GBFS).
<br/>
Today I flashed my DS, and it flashed successfully, but when I attempt to boot the SRL from the flash cartridge, the DS just displays two white screens. (This is without the PassMe2/Castlevania US inserted).
<br/>
If I reinsert the PassMe2/Castlevania US and bypass FlashMe by holding Select, the SRL will run normally again.
<br/>
<br/>
I assume the flash was successful because the counter reached 100% and it said completed, and the health warning screen no longer appears. The DS operates normally otherwise in that it can still boot commercial cards.
<br/>
<br/>
What could be the problem causing FlashMe not to work as expected?
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I have just tested a homebrew ROM (TickleGirl) and it works with FlashMe. I assume this means that FlashMe can't run SRL files? Is there any workaround?
<br/>
<br/>
(Since I received some flames last time I posted an issue like this, I'll just mention that I'm not trying to warez ROMs. I work at a small games development company and we were hoping to use this setup to debug our game).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You have to prefix a loader (like ndsmall) to the .srl file.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry, I should have mentioned that I am prepending Darkain's loader to the SRL file, so that it is actually a .ds.gba file I am writing to the flash cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
When FlashMe is used, the loader will indeed boot, but when I select the SRL the white screens appear.
<br/>
If I use the PassMe2, the loader will boot, and so will the SRL.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
