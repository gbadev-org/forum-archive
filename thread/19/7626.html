    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">on the page <a href="http://darkfader.net/ds/" target="_blank">http://darkfader.net/ds/</a> i have seen the schematic to connect a normal CF-card to the NDS. 
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to run homebrew programs on the DS using a CF-card and wifime ?
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to store the data on the CF-Card using a normal usb-CF-card reader/writer ?
<br/>
<br/>
I have got the "new" nintendogs-bundle-blue DS. and the mariocart-bundle-silver DS. I can solder directly to the connector ...

An adapter that includes a circuit nearly identical to DarkFader's adapter is mass-produced, called the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.movieadvance.com/" target="_blank">GBA Movie Player</a>. However, the GBA Movie Player currently cannot function in DS mode on a Nintendo DS system with <span style="color: red">new</span> firmware until the DS has been modded, and you can't use the GBAMP to mod the DS either.

<br/>
Yes, but if you're using WiFiMe or a GBAMP, your programs can use only GBA mode unless your DS either has old firmware or has already been modded.

If you have a DS that was bundled with any game other than <span style="font-style: italic">First Hunt</span>, then ten bucks says you have the <span style="color: red">new</span> firmware that does not work with the GBAMP or with WiFiMe.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

This means i will have to mod the DS...
<br/>
I will search on how-to do. 
<br/>
<br/>
PPFLASH would seem the right option, eliminating the need for a CF-Card, but i think it does reflash only a part of the firmware  ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The best option is to flash the FLASHME firmware to the DS, then use either a M3 Perfect CF/SD or a Supercard CF/SD.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I seem to remember someone saying that it only flashes FlashMe's recovery code, meaning you can then use FlashMe to boot up a device capable of running DS homebrew (that has FlashMe on it) to complete the installation.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
