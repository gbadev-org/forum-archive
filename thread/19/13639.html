I'm mostly interested in MP3, and emulators. I don't care one little bit about watching movies.

<br/>
EZ Flash V interested me because of the expansion pack that the Genesis Emulator uses. But.... I don't know just tell me something useful.<br/>_________________<br/>Use your talents for God's glory!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My vote is on R4, which is the same thing as M3 DS Simply. It is easier to use for homebrew, and includes DLDI autopatching and doesn't need the header to have "PASS" in it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

By expansion pack are you referring to the EZ 3 in 1? And what Genesis emulator are you referring to?<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That R4 review is from 7 months ago.  Since then, the R4 has gotten a DLDI file made for it, meaning that nearly every homebrew program in that list works with it now.  The notable exception I can see is SnezziDS which does not run on any slot-1 device.
<br/>
<br/>
The EZ Flash V review states this about the 3in1:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">The Expansion Pack will only work with the EZ-V, so if you have a different slot-1 cart you won?t be too interested in it for the time being. That may change in the future however as the EZTeam have promised that the source files will be released so that homebrew developers can take advantage of it. The homebrew potential is certainly there with emulators like Picodrive utilizing the official RAM pack to speed up the emulation process.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Note that this too is out of date.  The source code has been released, and tools have been made by cory and Rudolph to allow you to use the 3in1's features on most slot-1 devices, with the R4 and M3 Simply being the most compatible with it.  As a result, many people get either the M3 Simply or R4 combined with the 3in1 expansion pack.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, looking at the PicoDrive page, it appears that extra RAM is only used to store Genesis games larger than 3 MB, so it won't really improve performance.  Also note that jEnesisDS was recently released, which uses hardware emulation to attain speeds faster than what PicoDriveDS can accomplish.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You said it yourself, they're the same.  The R4 is the original product, which the M3 team buys and rebrands as the M3 Simply.  As such, the R4 might be a bit cheaper, and the R4 updates come out faster.  Aside from that, there shouldn't be any major differences.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If all you want is mp3's and emulated ROMS...get the Datel Games n' Music.  It's available in your local retailers (I got mine at Best Buy) and it comes with everything you need, cart, microSD 128MB, and microSD USB reader...now that it has DLDI it works with MoonShell and nesDS, SNEMulDS, PicoDriveDS, and any other DLDI supporting emulators.  I also got DSDoom and QuakeDS running on mine.  It's about $35 to $40 depending on where you get it, but you don't have to pay shipping for something in a local store :)<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
