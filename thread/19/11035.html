<br/>
ive got a g6 lite with the old beta eng/chinese fw on it that was found when it first came out and everyone was crapping themselves cause it was in chinese. I want to run an nes emum MegaETK, the snes emu, and the genesis emu (just for stuff like chrono trigge and the sonics since as far as i know my 1.5 psp still &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my ds lite in terms of homebrew and i dont want ot take both of them with me everywhere)
<br/>
<br/>
first problem is somthing i have all the time for some reason. I deleted Bleach DS off of my card and dropped abunch of gba games on it and windows says i have 9 megs left, and the g6 software says 0.01 gig. I know for a fact 9 megs is plenty of room for 20 or so nes games, and i comperssed all the nes games into a gba file with nesds and tried loading it, but it wouldnt go. only option i have checked is RT Saver. The nes games file is 4 megs, and i kinda doubt the rt saver stuff adds like 9 megs. I could be wrong though.
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, i tried making it into a ds file instead and it said i needed a ds rom builder, which i could not find. If i could get a link to this it would be much aprpeciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Third, i manually dragged MegaETK to the g6 since the loader insists there is no space left, and when i tried loading it up i get a white screen. Im not sure if im supposed to use fat or nofat versions.
<br/>
<br/>
Fourth, and one of the more important ones, i see ther eis now a translation patch otu for Jump Super Stars. I tried patching this game and it said there was an error and i should check my rom. The readme on the patcher is very...scarce.
<br/>
<br/>
Fifth, how would i go about getting the snes and genesis emus onto my ds, and which are the best ones. Do they run at full speed?
<br/>
<br/>
Sixth, tell me any firmware updates i should have and if they havfe released a new loader software for the pc that knows how to actually friggen read the remaining space on my card. links are much appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
That is all, thanks aton, and if you need more info tell me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<span style="font-style: italic">Chrono Trigger</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Sonic the Hedgehog</span> are not homebrew games; they are copyrighted commercial games published by large companies. Is there anything you want to run other than emulators?

Have you tried loading only one game at a time into an emulator and working up from there?

Currently, PocketNES is more mature than nesDS.

SnezziDS and PicoDriveDS are the state of the art, but I've used neither.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As Tepples said, GBAdev is not the right place for piracy talk.  There are other communities more suited for handheld emulation discussion.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as the space issues go, how big is the cart originally?  Perhaps the G6 requires some empty space at the end of the cart, or perhaps it needs formatting or something like that.  Have you tried flashing <span style="font-weight: bold">just</span> the currently-non-working programs onto the G6?
<br/>
<br/>
Just on a side note though, Chrono Trigger does not work in any GBA/DS solution as of yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">while ct and sonic arent homebrwe, the emulators are. do the emulators, that are homebrew, work with the g6 lite or not.
<br/>
<br/>
doesnt matter which ones, as there are way to many to list
<br/>
<br/>
i would if i could load the emulator
<br/>
<br/>
ill look into pocket nes

translation patches are also a form of homebrew, they are jsut like rom hacks. zophar.net and romhacking.net are very good exmaples of this, and both are totally 100% legal sites.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Whether or not something is 100% legal is irrelevant, though. You're not going to get many answers about rom hacks and emulation here, because that's not what these forums are for.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try removing all pirated GBA games from your card and then <span style="font-weight: bold">following the instructions to the letter</span> to build a PocketNES or nesDS file containing only the game <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/nes/" target="_blank">Tetramino</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Google finds <a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=pocketnes+discussion" target="_blank">other sites on which to discuss PocketNES</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
