        <h2>DS Flash Equipment > Running ScummVM with Supercard SD and PassMe2</h2>

    <h4>#69110 - luminoth - Sat Jan 28, 2006 3:08 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've searched this forum and other sites, but I can't find a definitive step-by-step guide to getting ScummVM to run on NintendoDS using Supercard SD and PassMe2.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried following <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=60&amp;mode=&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0" target="_blank">this review/guide</a> but it's somewhat incomprehensible at times.
<br/>
<br/>
This is what I've done so far:
<br/>
<br/>
- placed the _BOOT_MP.nds file on my SD card
<br/>
- placed Monkey Island game on my SD card
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried booting up my DS with both the Supercard SD and PassMe2 inserted, but I don't know how to get the game to run.
<br/>
<br/>
The fundamental thing I don't understand in the above guide is how to copy the PassMe2 files onto the CF/SD card. I don't see how that's possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone able to help?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, so to flash my DS, I insert a compatible game in my PassMe2, then switch on my DS with the PassMe2 inserted? Do I need a specific game? I've got the following games (all PAL): Mario Kart, Castlevania, Nintendogs, Meteos, Sonic Rush. Oh, and Ouendan (JAP).
<br/>
<br/>
Then what would I do?

Appreciate any help! x</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm guessing that it had something to do with the fact that a First Hunt bundle virtually guarantees FW1 or FW2, for which one could just buy an original PassMe.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
So far I've:
<br/>
<br/>
- run passme2_mb.gba in GBA mode
<br/>
- selected Nintendogs Lab EUR game code
<br/>
- rebooted DS with PassMe2 and Nintendogs inserted
<br/>
<br/>
Then I've tried running each of these:
<br/>
<br/>
- ScummVMCode.ds.gba
<br/>
- _BOOT_MP.nds
<br/>
<br/>
but the first one just loads up the GameBoy screen and sticks, and the second one just produces two white screens.

Ah, see, if I remember right, the Supercard is a bit odd.  Try renaming that ds.gba file to .nds instead of ds.gba.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It doesn't save and the sound echoes, apparently. You can still build games &lt;32MB into a .ds.gba and rename it to a .nds though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
