<br/>
<br/>
Does that mean if the system shutdown while i am shorting the my ds lite is going to be messed up?
<br/>
<br/>
Anything i should know....
<br/>
I have tried flashme a few times now... Most of the time. i had the system shut down before i got to 100% but all i do is rerun the process.
<br/>
With noflashme.. can i do this?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks

<br/>
Are you trying to unflash for warranty purposes, to make the DS appear not flashed to Nintendo repair techs? If so, you can use FlashMe Stealth instead.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
I used to use the Supercard but now that i have a ninjads that is using slot 1.  I don't like to press the select button in order to start up.
<br/>
<br/>
This is why I am wondering if i can flash my ds lite back to its original state. (not because of warranty purpose)
<br/>
<br/>
If flashmestealth can fix the "select" boot then i rather use stealth of course.  
<br/>
But before restore my dslite...i just want to make sure I am doing the right thing and the advantages outweigh the risk.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Select boot is more likely a problem with the NinjaDS not correctly rejecting commands to probe for an MK2/3. The Ninja team are a bit busy with Wiinja at the moment, so I haven't had much luck getting a fix.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

Any opinions regarding Ninja and R4?  The way it works.

Which ones would be a better solution in terms of usability.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
