<br/>
It's pretty good. Just whack it in and go. No need to anything else to chip the DS. Copy *.nds over with USB. No need to convert it to some GBA format. Everything works as it would if it were a proper DS game like game saving or using the resources.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad I got one. 
<br/>
<br/>
But...
<br/>
<br/>
The build quality is a bit poor. A lot of users need to wedge a piece of paper between the cartridge and the back of the slot to jam it in right. Or else the pins don't connect to the DS right. Others have had to take the case apart and use a razor to take off some of the plastic around the pins but thats rare (and the paper trick usually works with that situation too).
<br/>
<br/>
You also can't play GBA games and it only holds 512Mb. But you can use it in place of a passme kind of thing so you can put something like an M3 in too later (to be used separately...not as a magical memory booster).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#112235 - ikaris - Thu Dec 14, 2006 7:11 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Works great for me.
<br/>
<br/>
The why:
<br/>
<br/>
What I wanted was a dev solution that didn't require me to be constantly removing the cart, putting it into a flasher, compiling, then flashing with a special flashing program, the taking the cart back out and putting it back into the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
The good:
<br/>
<br/>
I can have a batch file run after I compile that automatically copies the appropriate .nds file into the cart... hypothetically, I only have to plug in via USB, compile, unplug, test.  Plus, with the "load last ROM" option, I don't even have to enter the DS-X menu.  Also, if I want to dev on the road (which I do on occasion) all I need to bring is a USB cable (of which I carry a few in my bag for other things anyway).  Also, I can carry a few games with me on the cart for when I'm frustrated with a bug :)
<br/>
<br/>
The bad:
<br/>
<br/>
ROMs cant be played while the USB cable is still plugged into the machine (or you do a Remove Hardware... but thats even longer).  Also, plugging and unplugging the mini-USB on the DS side often makes the cart come out, so I've taken to unplugging the large USB side from the PC instead.  Would have been nice if we could keep it plugged all the time.  It just means the DS has a USB cable dangling out of it while I'm testing, but that's not really a big deal.
<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion:
<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it's a great improvement over my old setup (flasher and GBA cart).  I'd recommend it.
<br/>
<br/>
Build quality has not been a problem for me so far.

From what I've heard, it actually does run most homebrew that doesn't depend on GBAROM space. The unfortunate part is that DSX has not released ANY code or documentation, so how exactly they are making it work is unknown, and it's possible future versions of libfat will not work with it, and there's nothing we would be able to do about it.
<br/>
<br/>
They made a lot of promises of being homebrew-friendly, but haven't really come through on any of the big ones. (No code, no usb debugger support, etc)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

DSOranize or Moonshell - reading FAT

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interestingly enough, the guy who just released that unofficial update of DSDoom to 1.1.0 has a crit of the DS-X on his site it a lot of what he writes with respect to homebrew is not complimentary. Maybe he just got a very shoddy DS-X, but some of the issues he raises are not related to build (Eg, Unresponsive DS-X staff on the forums, etc...)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, his review is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.jefklak.com/Articles/DSXtreme" target="_blank">here</a>. Worth a read, since it's one of the only reviews written that I've seen that is not all positives...

    <h4>#112350 - 0xtob - Fri Dec 15, 2006 1:43 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I received my free DS-Xtreme yesterday :-) Overall, I'm quite happy with the device, but it still needs a lot of improvement. Here's a mini-review:
<br/>
<br/>
I can confirm that the build quality is a bit poor. It feels strange inserting/removing the device and I'm constantly afraid of breaking the slot insertion mechanism. The internal software feels cheap and has several glitches. It even crashes once in a while.
<br/>
<br/>
It's generally slow: After you turn on the DS it takes about 10 seconds for the DS-X menu to appear (with auto-boot activated in the DS firmware). When entering the Apps menu, it takes 9 seconds for listing the 30 homebrew apps/games I have on the card. The mp3 library has to be rebuilt every time you want to use the mp3 player function, not only when you add/remove mp3s. I have 60 mp3s on the card and building the library takes about 20 seconds. A good thing though is that the software also supports OGG.
<br/>
<br/>
The dancing LEDs feature is a nice gimmick, and the LEDs are really bright. The default LED brightness levels can be controlled in the firmware. Each LED has a brightness setting from 0-255, and as there are 2x a red, a green and a blue LED on the back of the device, you have 2 "pixels" with 24-bit color :-)
<br/>
<br/>
The DS-X firmware is a usability nightmare. It took me some time to figure out that you navigate through the mp3 menus by double-tapping, and that you add multiple files to the playlist by holding the stylus down, which brings up a pop-up menu and then selecting "Queue" from that menu.
<br/>
<br/>
When trying to code with the DS-X I used a similar method to ikaris: Plugging in the device, copying my app to the DS-X via a script that also automatically unmounts it, pulling the cable and turning on the DS. My app is then automatically launched using the "Instant boot" option. So, I implemented a new feature in NitroTracker, wanted to test it and it just didn't work. I added some debug output to investigate why it wasn't working, but the output didn't even appear. It turned out that when the instant boot option is used, the DS-X does not boot the file off the card, but from some other internal memory. So when you overwrite the file on the DS-X, it still boots the old version until you disable instant boot and manually launch the app from the menu.
<br/>
<br/>
I contacted them about this using their bugtracking site (<a class="postlink" href="http://support.ds-x.com" target="_blank">http://support.ds-x.com</a>) and already got some replies from the developers and it seems they are working on this. I also sent them an e-Mail asking about the promised features like LED control, USB debugging and FPGA reprogramming, but got no reply so far.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, as chishm said, it is detected as a Neoflash MK2 by gba_nds_fat. FAT access (loading and saving) is working fine in NitroTracker and other apps.
<br/>
<br/>
The homebrew menu looks nice. It displays the icons of the homebrew apps and the names and info from the nds headers. This can become confusing though when a file does not have proper headers. For example, Wordup is listed as "PAlib Demo" with a PAlib icon.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are the test results of the homebrew that Lynx listed:
<br/>
<ul><li>Ticklegirl: Doesn't boot
<br/>
</li><li>Wordup: Works fine
<br/>
</li><li>Tales of Dagur: Saving works, but it crashes when trying to load the save state again
<br/>
</li><li>Moonshell: Boots a bit slow. mp3 playback works, but launching homebrew apps doesn't.</li></ul>So you see there are some glitches. It's still no GBAMP when it comes to homebrew compatibility, but the developers really seem homebrew-friendly, so I guess we can hope that some of this gets fixed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well i can confirm allmost everything.
<br/>
But not the homebrew part. I made same way to update and test my apps.
<br/>
It works on about 70% ...the other 30% it has blackscreens...
<br/>
<br/>
I guess it just works when doing minimal changes. Otherwhise the rom could land on a other part of the memory. I guess the ds-x just saves the adress for doing the instand boot...anyway...it should work with filename instead to avoid such stuff
<br/>
<br/>
What u said about the timing is right. Its a bit useless...my game has  many files and folders at "/rd/"
<br/>
The apps are usually saved in folder called "/apps/"...so when trying to start my rom (without instand boot) it reads the entiry flash-memory to search for roms. So it searches in im rd folder too. but there  is a app-folder to avoid that. why they dont use it in that way? There are many things to be fixed but its a promissing device and testing never was easier for me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I still believe the hardware has a lot of potential, but the software needs serious improvement. The best thing they could do would be to open the firmware for homebrewers.
<br/>
<br/>
Also: Nine seconds for entering the homebrew menu is a long time, at least if you're impatient like me. I just measured: From turning on the DS to launching a homebrew app, it takes about 30 seconds with the DS-X. Using the GBAMP and my devlauncher it takes about 10 seconds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I did recently have mine crash for no reason.  The ds wouldn't recognize it but it still was seen as a mass storage device by the PC.  I was able to format it and run the firmware updater to get it working.
<br/>
<br/>
They really need to get the usb debugging thing out and some other improvements.  If supercard's slot 1 solution comes out I might sell my dsx.  They say they are supporting homebrew but I don't see that.  They haven't released any fat info, little to no info on the usb debugger, and they don't reply to message on their homebrew forum.  I see them reply to the general forum quite abit.  
<br/>
<br/>
The device has been out for over 2 months now with little info.  How do they expect homebrew to work or developers to use it if they don't release any info on it.  I bought it in hopes they would have released the info a little sooner.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, it is possible that some of these development teams will create some method of playing GBA with Slot-1 devices. I'm thinking of a slot-2 cart that has only PSRAM and SRAM, and the ROM is loaded onto it while in NDS mode, then it reboots into GBA. Probably wouldn't be much cheaper than just buying a full slot-2 cart, though...
<br/>
In any case, I doubt they'll stop producing Slot-2 carts any time soon, precisely because people still want GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just don't see the appeal of SLOT-1, really...
<br/>
<br/>
The scene has developed, over the past year or two (Longer if you take GBA dev into account, which you should) to sue SLOT-2 cards. SLOT-2 has got the best support and as an interface for media devices provides more options. Expecting the scene to re-tool to support SLOT-1 devices just because they exist is stupid.
<br/>
<br/>
To me, SLOT-2 is superior. Sure, it may be a bit bigger, but it can still sit flush if you want (SC:Lite, M3:Lite, etc, etc). Also, the size of a SLOT-2 cart allows for more stuff to be placed in the cart. It's dubious as to whether SLOT-1 cart could ever carry a mini-USB plug and a microSD port without extending it out backwards in strange ways. The memory mapped nature of the GBA port also allows for stuff like usable extra RAM. 
<br/>
<br/>
A SLOT-2 device with microSD and a mini-USB port could probably quite easily negate the need to swap the microSD card except when it filled up. (Music anyone?)
<br/>
<br/>
If it ever came to the point that the usual card producers (SC team, M3 team, etc) decided to stop producing SLOT-2 cards I think it would be necessary for the homebrew community to, somehow, set up it's own card production company producing SLOT-2 solutions dedicated to homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully it won't come to that, though :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Still, I'm not hopeful that the SC team will ever produce the SLOT-2 card I want...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

Exactly.  That's why I like my dsx.  However, for developing since it lacks sram which many homebrew apps use.
<br/>
<br/>
An advantage of a slot 1 device is I can keep my rumble pak in the ds.  I am going to play around with programming for the rumble pak, so it will be something slot 2 users won't be able to do.  There are other GBA slot accessories for the ds from other games I might check out too.
<br/>
<br/>
An advantage of slot 2 is you can use the nds motion detector.  well, you can with  a slot 1 device you just have to take out your cart and put the detector in.  If you have a dsx you can't reinsert it without the ds rebooting.
<br/>
<br/>
While the slot 1 device might have eeprom there is little information on how to use eeprom in the homebrew world.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Both have a few advantages.
<br/>
Slot 1:
<br/>
-Smaller cards; if you have multiple cards (including official DS cards) this can be good.
<br/>
-Slot 2 devices require either FlashMe, WifiMe, or a Slot 1 device to launch them in DS mode. Especially important if you want to lend it out or some such.
<br/>
-Compatibility with official games. Yes it means easier piracy, but also means homebrew development can be made more like official development, which means generally more standardization and less hassle if you want to get your app published.
<br/>
-Can keep Slot 2 devices installed such as rumble carts, or your favourite GBA game if you want to muck with its saved files.
<br/>
-Less likely to stick out of the slot.
<br/>
<br/>
Slot 2:
<br/>
-Can support CompactFlash.
<br/>
-Plenty of room for extra RAM, USB etc, and memory-mapped design makes this easier.
<br/>
-GBA compatibility is possible (both playing GBA games and using the card on GBA).
<br/>
-Can keep Slot 1 devices installed such as motion sensors, or your favourite DS game if you want to muck with its saved files.
<br/>
-No risk of poorly-designed hardware damaging the DS card loading mechanism (assuming you use FlashMe or a decent slot-1 device to launch).<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by HyperHacker on Thu Dec 21, 2006 11:44 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I think this is a really nice Thing, so Homebrew can use the RAM Enhancement of the Opera Browser. But Rumble is also nice. I have both Rumble and RAM Enhancement. Who knows what other GBA Slot Cards for DS Software came out in the Future or any Hardware Cracks develop own GBA Cards for DS Homebrew Software? With the bigger GBA Cards its easier.

I beg to disagree.
<br/>
<br/>
The Opera RAM extension is of marginal importance. It offers a very small amount of RAM (Somewhere between 4mb and 10mb) and is not exactly a well-documented device for homebrew use. On the other hand, the SC/M3/G6/etc offer 32mb of RAM and the info on using it is obtainable.
<br/>
<br/>
Rumble is cute but I can't say I ever considered it an important development by itself.
<br/>
<br/>
Whether any future funky official SLOT-2 devices will be released is dubious. There are some low-key ones available, but nothing that is a have-to-have piece of hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
SLOT-1 may be the future of piracy, but it won't make any in-roads into the homebrew scene until the manufacturers actually start releasing details on their FAT functionality and putting out the stuff in large numbers. Even so, I don't see the majority of homebrew developers buying SLOT-1 devices simply because the marketing fools print "The Future of Homebrew" on their boxes.
<br/>
<br/>
They need to do a bit more to actually interest homebrew devs, because the moment none of the SLOT-1 solutions really offers any benefits to the developer and most of them seem to have numerous issues.<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

Totally different situation.
<br/>
<br/>
You couldn't ever run GBA homebrew with GBC carts but you can run DS homebrew from GBA carts. The other situation we have is that some DS hombrew is using GBA cart space for extra storage so it's likely that there will remain a demand for GBA slot devices while the DS is still going strong.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
