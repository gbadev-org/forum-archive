An M3 CF and a PassKey2 should work fine with the newer firmware.  As for game compatibility, that probably should be taken to Pocket Heaven as Tepples and SwimGod would say. ;)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
