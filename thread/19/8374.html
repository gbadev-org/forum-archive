    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Simple question, sorry if it's been anwered before. Does flashing your DS with FlashMe have any side-effects, I mean, will I lose my WiFi settings for Mario Kart and AC? Because I heard that they store the WFC settings in the firmware, and I really wouldn't want to have to get new friend codes (especially for Animal Crossing).

Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
