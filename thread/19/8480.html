    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I've got quite a big problem. This afternoon I tried to reflash the Flashme (I had a v2 or so) in order to be able to play MK and use wifi with games. But when I was at 2%, the NDS rebooted itself, with unknown reasons. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now it won't work anymore...
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way to repair the firmware? Or do I have a new brick?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.
<br/>
Thank you, everyone, I look forward to taking advantage of your work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll explain the full process:
<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, I used wifime to install the flashme (like 3 months ago or so). And today, I wanted to update it, so I put the flashme v6 into my Ezflash II (after appending it to ndsloader.bin) and it starts all the process. When it reached 2% (after a long while trying) it died, for I think I pressed the power button unwillingly... so now it shall show nothing but a mere black screen in both of them. 
<br/>
<br/>
On the GBA slot I currently have the flashme.nds.gba v6, installed into the Ezflash II..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it doesn't look like the failsafe installed for flashme then....i think u should look into trying ppflash if possible. I don't know a whole lot about that but i hear it worked for a few people around here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
