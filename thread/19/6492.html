-- Who?

-- You know, the human.

eeee, IPC structure has all the data what we need about touch screen - if you need 'mouse', just show some image at touchXpx touchYpy (if pen is down) and you get your own 'mouse'<br/>_________________<br/>[ sorry for all mistakes, but my english isn't as good as I wish it to be ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think he's talking about the random line issue, and that it would be nice to reverse a game to see what routines it is using for touch screen input.  There still is an issue with the touchscreen code, but I don't think anyone knows where to look next.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
