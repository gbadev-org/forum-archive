The company is likely to look at similar deals with other manufacturers, such as Nintendo, once this has got off the ground.

Let's assume they are talking about the DS. They'll need something to store the movie on that runs in NDS mode to make this WiFi movie download service work. Will we see a new flashcart from Nintendo soon? Also, how practical is it to download a large movie file over the DS's slow WiFi connection?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDSh" target="_blank">Nintendo DS homebrew on Wikipedia</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<span style="font-weight: bold">Speed:</span> If a 24 minute video is encoded at 256 Kbps (combined video and audio), a typical data rate for DPG, that's 46 MB. Downloading it at 1 Mbps over WFC shouldn't take more than 7 minutes, and one could pull down an entire season of TV that way by leaving the DS turned on overnight.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
