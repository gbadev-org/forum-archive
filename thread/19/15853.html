    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I have a Supercard SD on which the firmware seems to be nuked, as nothing but the onboard ram seems to work. I have an acekard 2, but no working GBA flash cards, so I have no way of getting the official firmware (which is just a GBA rom) on the card. Is there any way to load the sc_185.bin into the Supercard's ram and boot from it?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Jeremy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">never mind, I figured out how to do that for myself. it didn't help, as the firmware doesn't recognize my supercard...
