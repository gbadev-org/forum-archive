    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys, I asked about homebrew earlier this year (2007) but I never bought an adapter because the website I was gonna buy from didn't support other pay-options than Visa. But now I found Games N' Music on a website which seem to be ok.
<br/>
<br/>
I've seen movies and read about the GNM, and some say it doesn't support games over 4mb. Is there a way to make it go around that?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Bjohansen on Mon Dec 31, 2007 1:25 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

hmz, ok. I removed the part which could be considered "warez". But still, the question stands. Is GNM usable as a homebrew adapter?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, the GnM has a libfat-driver and works just fine for homebrew-usage. The microSD is a bit slow - but the card is cheap so, hey...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, thanks. Gonna buy one then, so I can use my NDS for more than playing the few games I got :)
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any homemade games which is a "must-have" ?
<br/>
<br/>
edit: does the beup work on GNM?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To work around the 4 MB limitation, homebrew DS games are generally split into separate files: one .nds, and one or more other files that contain data loaded from the card at runtime. This is where "libfat" and "DLDI" come in, and kusma is right that the GnM works with these programs.

<br/>
Must-have homebrew apps include DSOrganize (day planner+address book+IRC+web browser+text editor+music player+pic viewer), Colors! (paint), and MoonShell (music player+video player). Games popular among people who visit my house include MegaETk, Setsuzoku no Puzzle, and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/lj/" target="_blank">Lockjaw Tetromino Game</a> ;-)

Which DS Game Cards do you own? You might want SavSender to let you manage your games' save files.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I just broke down and bought one of these because I figured it's better than nothing. It works alright except I have one app that fails to init FAT when patched with either G&amp;M DLDI. Other apps work fine. Any ideas why? Would updating it to the latest DKP and libFAT help?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, is it possible to remove that annoying startup logo?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've found that V1 of the DLDI is the one to use, as V2 almost always had issues for me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It was the in-development version of my app, but I fixed it. It was calling fatInitDefault() twice, which apparently works fine on GBAMP but not G&amp;M.
