you don't need nds.gba files for the GBA Movie Player...get an NDS format file and name it _boot_mp.nds as it says in the readme, then boot it with PassMe and it should start the NDS file right up...this means you could use it with the NDS version of FlashMe as well.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">simple instructions i guess for hacking your ds wide open....
<br/>
<br/>
firstly vopy the mp hacking gba file to the CF, and download the update.e18 from liksangto the CF too... dump it in the gbamp and run it...
<br/>
<br/>
now turn off, remove the battery cover, and pull off the small square sticker...jam summat metal in there to short the two points - i used a screw since it was easy to keep in the hole witout holding it...
<br/>
<br/>
now get the flashme NDS file and name it '_BOOT_MP.NDS' and put it on the root of your cf card... put your passme in and the gbamp on...torn on and flashme should boot and just follow instructions....
<br/>
<br/>
now u dont need the pass me anymore. ever. currently to boot stuff on the ds just name it '_BOOT_MP.NDS' and itll boot. hopefully a nice menu will appear soon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
