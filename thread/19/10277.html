<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to play multiplayer NDS games between a DS with a Supercard and a DS with a M3 or G6 cart?
<br/>
<br/>
any info would be appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1P's DS has FlashMe, a DS Game Card in SLOT-1, and a CF adapter in SLOT-2.
<br/>
2P's DS has FlashMe, an empty SLOT-1, and a CF adapter in SLOT-2.
<br/>
<br/>
To do multiplayer between the systems using an authentic DS Game Card:
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>On 1P's DS, Hold Select to skip FlashMe, and start the DS Game Card. </li><li>Choose a menu option for DS Download Play. Names of menu options will vary depending on title.
<br/>
Meteos:
<br/>
Mario Kart DS: Multiplayer &gt; Create Group &gt; Simple
<br/>
Tetris DS: Multiplayer &gt; Invite &gt; Choose game mode </li><li>On 2P's DS, hold Select to skip FlashMe, and choose DS Download Play. </li><li>Wait for a game option, choose the game from the list, and press A to confirm your choice. </li><li>When 2P's DS appears on 1P's screen, choose "Launch" or "Cut Off" or whatever the game calls it. </li></ol>
<br/>
To do multiplayer between the systems in a homebrew game:
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>Verify that the game supports DS to DS multiplayer. </li><li>Get within range of an access point that is powered on. The homebrew Wi-Fi library does not yet support ad-hoc or "Ni-Fi" mode and cannot act as a soft access point; you will need an access point, but the access point doesn't need to be connected to the Internet. </li><li>If your access point uses MAC whitelisting, look up each DS's MAC address using a commercial DS Game Card: Wi-Fi Settings &gt; Options &gt; System Information. </li><li>Start the game on both systems. </li><li>Follow the game's instructions. </li></ol><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The scary thing is, posts are getting editted with no evidence they were changed. It's almost like 1984.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

Several posts in the thread was deleted. Yours because you should have contacted a moderator/admin instead of starting to flame, as is stated in the rules. The original post doesnt mention anything about piracy that I can see. Its "interesting" to note that you didnt comment on the reply that was piracy-related (and thus removed).....or was that part of the trend you were seeing? Please PM me and let me know which "anti-piracy" posts have been deleted, Id be very interested in knowing.

Every member can easily PM me and let me know if a moderator has edited a post without adding a comment in the post. To my knowledge I have not received 1 single PM about this. Please PM me chishm and let me know which posts you are talking about. I will look into it personally.
<br/>
<br/>
I frequently edit posts to remove piracy links but I always make a note of it in the post. I also frequently change thread subjects but I add a "[Renamed]" thing after them.
<br/>
<br/>
If you (as in; anyone) see something...an unsuitable post or member, posts that are changed without a comment, or ANYTHING that you have a comment on, please PM me and I will look into it.
