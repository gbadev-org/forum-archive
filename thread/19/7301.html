The M3 has several SRAM banks.
<br/>
You want to write to the bank that will be used when the M3 is powered up.
<br/>
<br/>
This might work (untested):
<br/>
<br/>
Write a GBA program that waits for a button press, then writes the sram.bin to the SRAM.
<br/>
Put the program on a CF card.
<br/>
Insert CF in M3.
<br/>
Insert M3 in DS.
<br/>
Turn on DS.
<br/>
Select GBA mode.
<br/>
Run the GBA program you wrote earlier.
<br/>
Remove M3.
<br/>
Wait a few seconds.
<br/>
Insert M3.
<br/>
Press button to trigger SRAM write.
<br/>
Insert Passme2.
<br/>
Turn off DS.
<br/>
Turn on DS.
<br/>
<br/>
M3 DS menu should start.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, that would require inserting a wait-for-keypress loop into SRAM code. (Loop would be placed into memory, of course.)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No.
<br/>
When booting in DS mode it copies a wait for a button press loop into RAM, then jumps to it.  It jumps back to 0x080000c0 when you press the button.
<br/>
This could be used with a write once cart, but not with a commercial cart.

If someone changes the SRAM to do this instead, then I can include it in the next version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

From firmware update 11, M3 should have this imteresting feature: it should AUTOMATICALLY load the file "SRAM.DAT" you put in the root of your CF directly in bank0 when you boot the card in GBA mode.

That should save us the trouble of running the .gba program, extract M3, re-insert it and then write the SRAM.

Try this.  Use the program to write to the SRAM, but don't use it to boot a PassMe2.  Instead, make sure there is a blank gamesave.dat in your "GAMESAV" directory, pick a random game/homebrew/whatever from what you have on the CF card, press select, and back up the save to whatever gamesave.dat you're going to use..  Then try renaming that to SRAM.dat and put it in the root directory of the CF card.  I'd think that would work.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I could really use a full walkthrough of sorts, I'm not great with all the jargon so if possible the simpler the better.
<br/>
<br/>
I've got a newer blue DS, a passme2, a M3 adapter set for Polarium and a hard copy of the game, and a CF card.
<br/>
<br/>
I need to know what files should be on my CF card, and in what order to do what, everything I guess.

If this works out for me I'll sent up a hot to page with pics for other noobz so I can try and help you guys get back to more fun stuff.

The M3 passme2 works out which game is inserted and uses the appropriate passme2 patch.
<br/>
<br/>
If he's set the M3 itself to polarium using M3's SRAM writer, then why is he reading this thread?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What I really need is a walkthrough though. More like ok you opened the box way to go. Now plug the game into the passme2 and insert it, then put in the CF card into the M3 with the following files on it. Turn gameboy on, ect, ect... Also do I have the passme2 set for passkey or card?

If the switch on your passkey is labelled with "Passkey" and "Card" then it's a passkey 1, not a passkey 2.

Before you start this flashing process, you might need to upgrade your M3's firmware first.  Download all the softwares from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.m3adapter.com/main.htm" target="_blank">M3</a> first.  The included CD is useless.  In one of the zip file, there should be a readme.wri or readme.pdf, read it (it's in broken English), and it should tell you step by step what to do.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

After you get the "Loaded OK!" in the game selection program.

- Turn off your DS

- insert the correct game into the PassMe (make sure PassMe2 is selected)

- insert PassMe2 into your DS

These programs are only needed for people using a PassMe2 that are not able to write to the SRAM on their GBA flash cart directly.

<br/>
As you do not have a PassMe2 I don't know why you'd want them.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a white ds-lite and a device that says 'Passkey' on the back, I'm assuming it's a Passkey 1. 
<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't matter if the switch on the Passkey is set to 'Passkey' or 'Card' when the ds boots with the Passkey inserted the screens stay white.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone confirm that a Passkey1 can works with a ds-lite?
<br/>
<br/>
The person I bought it from flashed it so it would function with my original game 'Brain Training'. The Passkey doesn't work so could it be that it's improperly flashed? Can I flash it myself to function without any extra equipment/devices?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If it has been flashed to become a PassMe2, then you need to write the SRAM  for that game to your GBA flash cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So my passKey1 could actually be a passkey2 depending on if it's flashed or not? Is there anyway to check?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to figure out if I have a proper functioning Passkey for my DS-lite. 
<br/>
<br/>
If this is the case I will need to write my GBA-Flashcard-SRAM with 'ANDP' brain training (which is currently not in your passme2_mb.gba, I believe). Do I understand this correctly?
<br/>
<br/>
Is that all I have to do to make it work?
<br/>
<br/>
I keep reading about m3 and g6, but I have no idea what these are. They are mentioned on the casing of my Passkey, is that a good thing?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx for your time!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You need some DS homebrew on the GBA flash cart.
<br/>
And the SRAM for the game the PassMe2 is programmed.
<br/>
<br/>
passme2_mb.gba can write the SRAM, you then need to reflash the cart with some homebrew.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, if I understand correctly:
<br/>
<br/>
If the Passkey is working, the gba-flashcard has proper SRAM and some DS-Homebrew, The nintendo DS will boot the Homebrew right after it's switched on without going to the original DS menu?
<br/>
<br/>
This is why right now it's locking on the white screens? It's Looking for the Data on the GBA flashcard and can't find it?
<br/>
<br/>
Ofcourse I will still need the proper SRAM data. Can you tell me which SRAM data to flash from your passme2_mb.gba? Or make one including the brain training SRAM (ANDP)?
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, thanx the the friendly assistance of mr Pepsi I've got it to work.
<br/>
Let me explain what I did so other noobs, like me, can benefit :P
<br/>
<br/>
I burchase a Passkey2 for my ds lite, and the person who sold it to me programmed the passkey to one of the original games I have.
<br/>
<br/>
When the Passkey arrived and I inserted it into my Ds-Lite all I got was 2 white screens. Ofcourse I thought it was broken :P It is not.
<br/>
<br/>
It turns out that once the Passkey is in it immidiatly looks at the GBA slot for data. It doesn't go to the DS menu anymore. No in the GBA slot  -&gt; white screens. Makes sense.
<br/>
<br/>
So you need to put some data in the GBA slot. And to be able to do this you need some kind of flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
You need to put 2 things on your flashcart:
<br/>
<br/>
You need to flash it with the correct SRAM using Pepsi's 'Passme2_Mb.gba'
<br/>
After you've done that you can flash some homebrew to it.
<br/>
<br/>
And you should be ready to boot up your DS-Lite :P
<br/>
<br/>
Yay!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
