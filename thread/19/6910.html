    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">what card would be the best for DS homebrew? i bought an XGflash2 turbo 512mbit awhile ago. and unfortunatly, due to its onboard chip menu it (as far as i an tell) cant be used for homebrew. (that is, unless someone takes a look at the flasher exe that ships with it)
<br/>
<br/>
anyway, i'd preferably like the card also in 512mbits if possible. thank you in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think you should wait for a moment to G6, M3, MK2/MK3 get good position on markt, and then choose something.

<br/>
I heard, that movie player is a good choice ;)<br/>_________________<br/>[ sorry for all mistakes, but my english isn't as good as I wish it to be ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">get an M3...every homebrew I've tried works, *edit* Fine then el hobito - but go back where you came from? and i still reccomend the M3 - its cheap when you consider a gigabit one costs ~$110 US, and and 8Gb one costs ~$150

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">honestly because of that onboard menu thingy it wont load the loader iirc. i think I read that somewhere here, but i have the older XG2t the SIO v1, the one incompatable with the slimflasher. the M3 does sound good, how large was the internal ram again? 4mbytes?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyway, make sure there is no way to turn off the multi-rom loader..  Also make sure that it doesn't work with the current software that is available..  Either XG or NeoFlash..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

gbamp + passme = $50

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are a few problems with that list..
<br/>
<br/>
1) Still needs a CF card
<br/>
2) is in bits, not bytes.. so 64Mb carts just don't cut it anymore
<br/>
3) doesn't it need a CF/SD or flash cart?
<br/>
<br/>
And then,
<br/>
<br/>
Super Card + PassMe = $65, but still needs CF/SD card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

still havent told me what the internal ram on the M3 is. i'm thinking about it, but if the largest game i can load on an m3 is a 4mbyte homebrew, it really cant cut it compaired to a flash cart's 512mbit card's ability to play a 64mbit or higher. not that it really matters, but pocketNES and PocketSPC and what not, i just want to know if i can use the same 16mbyte image i've been flashing to my GBAsp</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The M3 has 256Mbit ram, and can boot roms larger than 256Mbit (not that it matters, since no <span style="font-weight: bold">legal</span> homebrew stuff is even close to that anyway) by swapping in and out of memory. The GBAMP can run files bigger than 4MB/16Mb, if they are designed (like an OS or most games) to swap the stuff they need in and out of the memory.
