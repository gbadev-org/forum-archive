I ordered these 2 Enamel Blue DSs from Lik-sang about 2 weeks ago. I would like to FlashMe these units, but want to be sure it can be done.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cool. Thanks for the link. I have V5 firmware, as the screens are Magenta, not purple. :rolleyes: I have PassCard2s on the way and will be using the M3 adapter. I shouldve done more research before buying 2 Passcard2s. I didn't think I was going to flash the firmware, but with the DS brickers out there, I don't want to take a chance. I coulda saved a considerable amount of $$ if I just ordered a passkey2 and used a retail cart for the flash operation, Doh!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's a reason behind the name: The song played on the <a class="postlink" href="http://defective.ytmnd.com/" target="_blank">PSP eject demonstration</a> and the <a class="postlink" href="http://defectiveds.ytmnd.com/" target="_blank">DS eject demonstration</a> is <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Me_Out_%28song%29" target="_blank">"Take Me Out" by Franz Ferdinand</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
