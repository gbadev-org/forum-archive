    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">USB wifi cards are not compatible, you need a PCI (desktop) or PCMCIA (laptop) card.
<br/>
<br/>
You don't need a flashcard of any kind for DS homebrew, most people are now using one of the SD or CF devices. The gba movie player is the cheapest device but isn't suitable for use with passme2 or GBA homebrew which doesn't run from RAM ( i.e. &gt; 256K )

<br/>
You can get everything you need from here :-

<br/>
<br/>
The only real issue is that DS homebrew which is built for one of the SD/CF devices won't work on flashcards so you might want to get a GBAMP as well.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
