<br/>
may i ask what the passme-z is? and does the GBAMP work with all those you listed? (keeping the passme/whatever in the DS all the time still)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Original PassMe does not work with firmware v4, and GBAMP does not work with PassMe2. You need to buy or borrow an M3, SuperCard, or traditional GBA flash card.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so GBAMP in NO way works with it? not even with keeping the passme or passkey or whatever in 24/7? I have no interest in flashing the DS hardware itself</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
