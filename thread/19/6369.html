<a href="http://www.gbax.com" target="_blank">http://www.gbax.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
If it's in stock, you'll get it the very next day, Special Delivery. If not, they may cock-up and think they've sent it when they haven't! But, they'll respond quickly enough to sales inquiries.
<br/>
<br/>
The prices don't include VAT, and there's an extra ?4 postage, bringing it to about ?28. If you want to offset the postage a little, I heartily recommend buying it with the "Super Memory Hunter" for backing up your savegames on GBA or SP for just ?5!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

One question for Lynx though. 
<br/>
Do you flash the CPLD with the new programm necessary to use the serial port.

Yep.  It uses the GBA's Multiboot function...it's limited by the 256k of the GBA's RAM that function uses.
<br/>
<br/>
And to run homebrew from the GBA MP, you'll still need either PassMe, WiFiMe (a download play program derived from a SuperMario64 capture, tricks DS into loading code from a GBA cart much like PassMe does), or FlashMe (although since this is a firmware upgrade you'll have need for either WiFiMe or PassMe to boot the flashing program).<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Currently I do not sell PassMe+RS232 code on them as it disables read/writes to the DS Cart.  Which, doesn't really matter unless you are trying to save to the DS cart.  I was thinking of adding a few options to the PassMe cart page.  One being the ability to select RS232 to be programmed into instead of the standard.  I was hoping to work with Natrium to get a new PassMe PCB designed with onboard hardware for RS232 and a header with a standard DB9, but have been to busy.  Plus, soldering the 4 SMD caps will be a pain in the ass.. and it just reminds me of the 17 PCI pins that I used to solder.. and how I don't EVER want to do that again..  But, now that I think about it.. do we have to use SMD caps?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

SNES DS, when used with a 3 MByte or larger ROM, needs to read the ROM from GBA ROM space.

I don't know of any such DS-native homebrew titles, other than SNES DS and possibly other emulators. But then I don't follow the DS scene closely because I can't afford to buy a DS myself. Still, if someone wants to clone Parappa, Frequency, DDR, or something, he or she will need more than 4 MB of space to play in. That can't happen on the GBAMP until the CF drivers and the FAT16 and FAT32 file system drivers become more mature.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, there really isn't any.  But, again, that's my opinion..  as I don't consider emulators "homebrew".  Anyway, these could easily be "ported" for use with the GBA MP, and actually.. I think all emulators would be a lot more user friendly on the GBA MP, as they could allow users to just copy the roms to be emulated into a folder and read them from there.  Just like the pocketnet.gba does on the GBA MP now.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the maturity of the the CF drivers, we're finding that out right now.  But, so far they have been working good.  But, we also haven't been writing to it yet.. which isn't even an option (outside of your SRAM, and ask DarkainMX how nice it is to work with if you want to save pictures using it.) with a flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
As with anything that is brand new, there are stuggles in the beginning, but I can see a lot of reasons to homebrew for the GBA MP vs a flash cart.  The quick and easy ones are $$$ and space.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
For Super NES ROMs over 20 Mbit, using a ROM stored on the cart would require software-implemented virtual memory, treating the ROM as a swap file. Dwedit is busy implementing this in PocketNES (for GBA), but it might slow an emulator down.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
