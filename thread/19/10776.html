    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone, 
<br/>
<br/>
Im having a major delema. I have been searching the web for information about Supercard (minisd). From what i have gathered I can run my backed-up NDS games from the Supercard, but i need a pass device to make it run from the DS GBA slot.
<br/>
<br/>
Will the Superpass make the game save to the Mini SD card ? or will i need WifiME to do that  ?
<br/>
<br/>
If both will work to save data to the Supercard(miniSD), then what is the best solution? In terms of cost the Superpass and buying a compatible wireless card to use the WIFIme will be about the same.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope somone can shine some light on this for me soon
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

sorry, they're not supported here as this is a forum about GBA(/ds)dev - and supporting backups also supports pirates (whether you're pirating, or not)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What you want is a SuperKey, which replaces the SuperPass. SuperKey uses the NoPass method of emulating the DS encryption within the cart rather than piggybacking on a DS game.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
