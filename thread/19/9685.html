Also, some software doesn't work properly with SD card, you might need CF card for some software.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Upgrading the firmware is not risky if you can do it properly, but it will void your warranty. If the DS breaks, there is a way to fix it by opening it up, but first try flashing normally. You need a screwdriver or something to put into the SL1 hole (the hole in the battery compartment with a sticker covering it). Also, leave the battery in and plug into wall power as well. And do not turn it off until it says so, otherwise you will break it.
<br/>
<br/>
The firmware you can upgrade to are 2 choices I know of:
<br/>
* FlashMe = the main menu will stay the same
<br/>
* FWNITRO = the main menu will be different<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dspassme.com/FlashMe.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.dspassme.com/FlashMe.shtml</a> Here you are.  One more thing I should mention, if you download homebrew applications which include a .ds.gba file and a .nds file, you'll probably have to take the .ds.gba file, rename it to a .nds file, and upload that to your supercard.  For example:  dslinux.ds.gba -&gt; dslinux.nds
<br/>
<br/>
The Supercard program is virus-free, and I'm fairly certain you don't need to use it for homebrew applications, at least I don't.  Other things may require you to use it, however.<br/>_________________<br/>SCSD, 1GB Kingston, Flashme v7 on DS v1, Flashme v7 on DS Lite</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
