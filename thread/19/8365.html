    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all, new here.  Have been lurking these boards for a while now trying to slowly absorb the homebrew knowlege (there is so much!), and i think i finally grasp enough to take the plunge.  There is just a few questions i was hoping i can get confirmed though... hopefully you will be kind enough to endulge me.
<br/>
<br/>
1) I had always assumed my black DS bought in october was the new firmware and that i would require a passme2, however having just done the test outlined on lynx's site, i discover mine is actually firmware v3.  This means i can use the passme1 right?  More importantly, i can use the much cheaper gbamp2 instead of the m3?
<br/>
<br/>
2) Speaking of gbamp2, is there a difference between the CF and SD versions when it comes to homebrew compatibility?  Specifically, with scummds?  I have the entire lucasarts scumm collection just itching to get some touchscreen love, so needless to say that program is my top priority.  Any advice appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
3) I remember lynx's site used to sell the passme1 with gbamp as a bundle, but dont seem to anymore.  Is this permanent, or will they be offered as a bundle again?  Can i special order the bundle (lynx)?  If not, can someone please point me to a good (cheap) place to get the gbamp v2?  Something independant like lynx's site would be best.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you guys in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Were you involved in the GBA homebrew scene at all, even as a consumer?

If you have firmware v3 (green), you can use PassMe with a GBAMP v2 CF.

GBAMP v2 SD currently does not work with homebrew at all. Get a SuperCard if you have a lot of SD cards.

Given the number of Nintendo DS units that come with firmware v4 (yellow), demand for such a bundle might have dropped off.

Until someone responds specifically, you can cross-check <a class="postlink" href="http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=gba%20movie%20player" target="_blank">Froogle Search: GBA Movie Player</a> against the Retailer Feedback forum.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you so much for the quick reply!  That helps alot... now im confident about what i need to get.  I have never even owned a gba before so need to get all this homebrew gear from scratch, which would have been quite costly if i had to go the passme2/m3 route.  I dont even have a CF card yet! =P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
