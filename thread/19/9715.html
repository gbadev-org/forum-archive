    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have wifime working (downloading at least).  I have an EZ-Flash II PowerStar 512Mb flash cart.  I am using EZ Client 3.24 to write flashme.nds to the cart and I think that may be where im doing something wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
When I add an NDS file it looks like this:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://img111.imageshack.us/img111/4218/ez2zw.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

<br/>
doesnt show any rom info..  didnt seem right to me.
<br/>
<br/>
wifime downloads and starts..  it shows the nintendo logo and then just fades out and both screens stay white.  Also, when I use the NDSloader that's built into EZ-client it boots into that fine (it shows rom "." and when I click on it it goes to the same white screens).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, I didn't..  But I figured out my problem.  I didn't know that you had to rename the file .nds.gba.  Also, when I add it to the flash cart, after it's written it doesnt show up in the list anymore--but its still there--which confused me too.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I got it flashed no problem after that...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
