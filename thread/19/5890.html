    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I am playing with wifime. Works great, but what would
<br/>
really make me happy is a loader with rom filesystem support.
<br/>
(I mean filesystem inside nds, not multi-system for many nds files like darkain's)
<br/>
Is anybody working on it right know ?
<br/>

But tepples would be better qualified to explain that.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not qualified to speak specifically on Nintendo DS hardware issues, being only a GBA developer and a DS forum moderator, but the word on the street is that once you grant the ARM9 CPU access to the cart, GBFS works nearly unmodified.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The loader could determine what filesystem driver is required and then load it into memory together with the program that's to be started. Once the app/game is loaded, it can relocate it to wherever he wants (if neccesary). A block device is somewhat limiting. I wouldn't want to make an extra GBFS partition on my CF card :)
<br/>
There should also be a function to select between savegame storage, game-data and multimedia files.
<br/>
Where either of them can be mapped to NDS rom, GBA flash, GBA SRAM/flash, other cards like CF,SD,SMC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All the Nintendo DS hardware knows about is a block device. Each game implements its own file system on top of the block device; most commercial games just use Nintendo's file system library.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
