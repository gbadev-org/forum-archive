Given that the EFA card has a USB compatible connector on it, I can see how a future GBA card might have some sort of JTAG connector on it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

If I could afford to stock 100 units of a game, I would sell them as an "upgrade" and it would make it a lot easier to program PassMe's for the upgrade, as well as give a specific tutorial on exactly how to use a PassMe2 with the upgrade, and what SRAM data to write, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, why would anyone pay $30 for an "upgrade" when you can pick from a bunch of retail games for $15 - $20 (Ping Pals for example), beats the heck out of me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The ezpass2 is pretty cheap (US$20 from winsunx) and comes with a parallel cable for programming it (actually it also has a USB connector on it - this is just to power the device while programming).  Admittedly you have to install Lattice Semiconductor's ispvm CPLD programming software to program the device, but it's almost as simple as downloading a JED file for whatever game you want to use and clicking "go" in the software.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
