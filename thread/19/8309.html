    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As some of you may have noticed, the modified driver used to do WMB doesn't work once you've used Windows' Hibernate feature, until you actually reboot, it just says DeviceWritePacket() failed. Is it possible to fix this without rebooting, by unloading the driver or some such?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
