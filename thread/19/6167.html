    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">NeoFlash is the same thing as the PassMe adapter with an XG2 GBA card. You can get a PassMe adapter plus an EFA-Linker 256 Mbit GBA flash card for under $100 total.

So-called "WMB" programs load entirely into RAM before running. But programs distributed on official Nintendo DS cards access a file system on the DS card to load code and assets after the initial boot process. These will need to be retooled slightly to access a file system on the GBA ROM rather than a file system on the DS card. There are several different simple file systems available that could be made to work from GBA ROM space, such as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#gbfs" target="_blank">gbfs</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/tar.html" target="_blank">tar</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.info-zip.org/" target="_blank">zip</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://romfs.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">romfs</a>, and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.obsession.se/pocket/" target="_blank">pogoshell</a>. Pick one and see if you can't make a wrapper around Nintendo's API and the other API so that the difference between a version for a DS card and a version for a GBA ROM is a mere recompile.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I think that's a fair question. As for any question though, be mindful of what knowledge about the official Nintendo SDK/development tools you share. The NDSTech Wiki puts it best:</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>http://www.auia.net/ds/ wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">LEGAL NOTICE
<br/>
If you have the official Nintendo SDK, DO NOT use it in your documentation efforts here, as it will endanger the legality of our project; anything that is suspected of being ripped from the official Nintendo SDK will be taken down immediately. We do not support piracy or the illegal use of the copyrighted Nintendo SDK by non-licensed developers. We have gone to great lengths to keep it free and legal - we will not tolerate anyone who endangers our project. Thank you all very much.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"><br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
