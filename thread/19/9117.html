-I run the ndsmp.gba to flash my cf card
<br/>
-then from there i plug my cf card into my computer and put one of my homebrew apps
<br/>
for testing i am using OMalone.nds
<br/>
-once i put it on the cf card, i then change OMalone.nds to _BOOT_MP.NDS
<br/>
-then i plug my cf card into the gbamp and turn on my nintendo ds
<br/>
-from there i go to wifi thing and download my wifime passme.
<br/>
-on my computer it begins to load 10-20-30 exc till %100
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">what version firmware do you have?
<br/>
if it is v4 or more (yellow, magenta mean its v4 or more...)
<br/>
<br/>
then you can't load unsigned homebrew over wifi,
<br/>
and you need a passme2 device to run homebrew :P
<br/>
(unsigned meaning software made by people outside of nintendo's developer list...)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">its version one, i got it like 4 weeks after the ds was released
<br/>
things seem to work its just when i try and start nds in nds mode with wifime it starts and then goes back to the gbamovie player, its not loading the _boot_mp.nds files</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">incase you were a little confuse about my problem
<br/>
<br/>
when i put a .nds file on my gbamp and change it to a _boot_mp.nds
<br/>
and then when i go into my dowload play and download firefox passme
<br/>
it goes into the double light screen with nintendo on the top screen, and then instead of loading the _boot_mp.nds file like i assume it should, it loads the gbamp and i can't figure out what to do from there</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">nope that didn't work- im going crazy!
<br/>
<br/>
i have my wifime showing a multipass when i go to download, and then from my understanding once i hit that, what ever homebrew.nds file i have in my gbamedia player cf card, that i have renamed _BOOT_MP.NDS should load
<br/>
<br/>
but for some reason when ever i try and hit download, it downloads, loads two white screens with one nintendo sign on the top and then proceeds to load up the gba media player normally, aaaaahhhh
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for your help swim i will try and post a video of what i am doing tommorrow</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
