    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the M3 Perfect SD Pro is a new m3, i was on gamersection.ca and they had it for 55.00 instead of 84.50 and the picture was the same as there pic for the M3 Perfect SD being curious i emailed gamersection and also danny m3's support guy the response i got from m3 support was was 
<br/>
"Hi , 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your concern about our products . 
<br/>
The M3 pro has not been put out . 
<br/>
It will available around this week . 
<br/>
M3 pro is mainly support NDS , but it also support GBA roms 32M or lower than 32M . 
<br/>
Please contact our reseller later . 
<br/>
<br/>
Regards 
<br/>
Danny" 
<br/>
<br/>
and for gamersection it was 
<br/>
"Hello, 
<br/>
<br/>
It is the same product except that they removed the ability to play any homebrew/backup GBA games, the Pro (it shouldnt be called pro, since it has less features) can only play backup NDS games but still requires a passcard 3 for its functionality. It's no on M3's site because its still new and we are offering it before its official release date  " 
<br/>
<br/>
from the sounds of this it is the same physical product, my question is couldn't you flash it to be a regular M3 Perfect SD thus saving money?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">according to my information it's a m3 without the 32mb additional ram. so no homebrew support would not really make sense. but oh well neither locking the language.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As I understand it, the "support GBA roms 32M" means it has 32 megabits (4 megabytes) of RAM mapped in GBA ROM space, unlike the regular M3 that has 256 megabits (32 megabytes).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
