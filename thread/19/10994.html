    <h4>#100735 - TheCatPhysician - Wed Aug 30, 2006 4:56 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, I started out with my regular DS which I have now, a SuperCard CF, and a Superpass2. My Supercard died after a while, so I bought an M3 Perfect CF. Now I'm considering buying a Black DS Lite when it comes to America on September 11th.
<br/>
<br/>
My questions are:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Does anyone know for sure if the current FlashMe software will work on the Black DS Lite? 
<br/>
<br/>
2) Will I be able to flash my DS Lite with a Superpass2 instead of whatever the M3 is supposed to use? The M3 site says not to use Superpass, but I'm wondering if they just want you to buy more of their products or if it is actually impossible to use a Superpass with an M3.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can probably use your SuperPass 2, as it's just a PassMe2. Follow the instructions that the M3 uses to boot with PassKey2, except for the different kind of reprogramming.

Flashed it fine. FlashMe v7 works fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Flashing the DS Lite really isn't that hard. For best results I'd recommend having a friend on hand to help you, plus a small mirror.
<br/>
<br/>
Have the friend hold the DS steady, screens facing towards the mirror. Then just short SL1 using a U shaped piece of wire. It takes all of 10 or so seconds to flash and that's that. Just make sure your friend knows what Hold Her Steady means...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

No, you are dead wrong here - first - what malware ? i dont know even if enough of any malware exists (which does not) do you install everything you find from any untrusted source ? i sure do not
<br/>
<br/>
furthermore - you do not have to spend money again for a new NDS - because its under warranty - you didnt modify it in any way - its still the original firmware - but what do you think will happend if you bring in a flashed firmware NDS - yes you actually have to spend money because you tried to flash it - so in other words dont do it there is no advantage in doing it while using passme3</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyways, I got the Black DS Lite now, and I'm having problems flashing it with my M3 Perfect CF and SuperPass2. The SP2 is still programmed for the Metroid Demo which is what I flashed it with last time. But when I run the program that writes to the SRAM and restart the DSL with the SP2 in, the screens just go blank after the health start-up screen. I don't remember much of what I did to flash it before with my Supercard when it existed, but I looked it up and it said to hold A+X+B+Y, and I guess that is only for Supercards because it didn't make a difference.
<br/>
<br/>
Could it be just something to do with the fact that this is the newest firmware? I don't know if I have to reprogram the SP2 or what. Mine came pregrogrammed for Metroid First Hunt so I have never messed with that yet, but it worked fine for my old DS. Are you guys sure that the M3 should be compatible with the SP2?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I sent mine in to Nintendo with FlashMe Stealth, no problems. There's really no reason not to use Flashme, it's so easy to do and extends your battery life too. :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
