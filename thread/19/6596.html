I'll be getting a flash cart now.... any recommendations?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But, this is a topic better served in the DS Flash Equipment section of this forum.  There is a lot of good information there already.  You should check it out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Until the flash cart arrives I'll have to use the GBAMP. Can I run .ds.gba files or only .nds?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The supercard is a cheap option if you already have an sd card... It runs all the homebrew apps/games I have tried without issue... to run them you need to use the '.ds.gba' file and rename it with a '.nds' extension...   
<br/>
<br/>
Much quicker to copy stuff onto a SD card than most flash cards, I got the whole dev pack off Lynx just to have an extra card, but am not using the XG2Flash and slim loader for DS homebrew as I change whats on the card too much and it takes forever...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
