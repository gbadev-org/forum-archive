    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I have a G6 Lite and a Supercard SD and while I generally like the G6's menu and interface a lot more, one thing the Supercard has going for it is the ability to launch GBA stuff from the same menu as DS stuff.  On the G6 launching a GBA ROM requires rebooting into GBA mode and then selecting the game from a really clunky interface.
<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't it be possible to create a generic header that would allow GBA games to be launched from the DS interface?  I imagine something similar in nature and the way it's used to the loaders that are needed for launching DS homebrew, but different in what it does obviously.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not really knowledgeable enough about all this DS and GBA stuff to know what stands in the way of this or how to do it if it's possible since I only just got my flash carts within the last couple weeks and haven't even begun to look at all the dev stuff (though I plan to), but I figured that some people here would know.
<br/>
<br/>
How about it?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the short answer: unless you are able to write it yourself, it probably wont happen.
<br/>
<br/>
the long answer: the code to launch a gba rom is specific to the flashcart. This is why you don't see many 'menu' type apps outside of the ones provided by the flashcart makers. Most flashcart makers are NOT cooperative with homebrewers, as they mostly only care about piracy, and thus they do not release any code on how to control their cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
