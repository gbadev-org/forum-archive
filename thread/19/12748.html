<br/>
<br/>
In any case, some slot-1 carts like the R4 come with a card reader, but most do not, in which case you'll need to buy your own for about $5 or so at a local computer store.  Cards that come with their own built-in memory, like the DSLinker or N-card or any of that family of clones, are written to using the supplied USB cable through the included slot-2 cart.  However, most people recommend using removeable storage for normal usage, as it's much cheaper to upgrade that way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you buy a card that has its own USB connector, then you read and write the card through the USB interface, and you don't have to buy a separate SD writer. But it might still be worth it for a few reasons:
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>As I understand it, cards that have internal NAND flash memory may use a lower-level protocol such as SmartMedia to access the flash, which requires the software on the GBA or DS to handle error-correcting codes and makes homebrew marginally more difficult. G6 especially suffers from this. Cards with an SD slot of some size are more likely to use simpler, better-understood methods for reading and writing the flash. </li><li>It can be difficult to disable pirate-oriented features on some cards whose USB interface is the only way of loading programs onto the card. </li><li>If you have a Wii console and want to put pictures on your Photo Channel, you'll need an SD writer because Wii takes SD cards. </li><li>Expanding your SLOT-1 or SLOT-2 card's memory by buying more SD cards can be cheaper than buying more SLOT-1 or SLOT-2 cards. </li></ol>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want GBA compatibility, you must buy a slot-2 card.  The only exception is the slot-1 EZ-Flash V that has an additional slot-2 extension you can use for GBA compatibility.  However, for your purposes, it would probably be best to use either a Supercard (not Rumble) or M3 (Perfect, not Pro) with a slot-1 NoPass device.  
<br/>
<br/>
Depending on whether you have a DS Phat or DS Lite, you probably want either the MiniSD version or MicroSD version in order to fit flush within your DS.  
<br/>
<br/>
The NoPass device you use can vary.  The Passcard 3 and Superkey are the exact same aside from the sticker, while the Max Media Launcher will also boot any slot-2 device you need.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It was very difficult to understand what you wrote. Not using punctuation is like mumbling in a monotone; I can't tell where one thought ends and the next one starts.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want compatibility with both GBA and DS homebrew, what you want to order right now are SuperCard and SuperKey. The rest you can pick up cheaply at an office supply store. Or you can use an Action Replay DS instead of a SuperKey if you wish.
<br/>
<br/>
SuperCard: firmware, SD card interface for data storage, and 32 MB of RAM to hold a running GBA program
<br/>
NoPass: tells the DS to start running the SuperCard firmware in DS mode<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Yes. The R4 can act as a NoPass so you don't need another one. Note both the SCL and the R4 need a mSD card.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDSh" target="_blank">Nintendo DS homebrew on Wikipedia</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
