    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, so I just got wifime working, but I don't own a flash cart. My question is, can I play homebrew apps without a flashcart, or is this not possible because they are not digitally signed?
<br/>
<br/>
Also if that is the case, how does wifime launch code from a gba cart? Doesnt it have to have a signed application to launch first to call the code on the gba cart? I read that it used a modified Mario 64 demo, but doesn't that invalidate the signature by changing the checksum?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It only modifies the header to make it read from the GBA port.  The header does not need a valid sig.  You need a flash cart/card to run homebrew using WifiMe.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Sat Oct 01, 2005 4:21 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Or if you can't afford a flash cart, and you're not interested in playing .gba games, then get a GBA Movie Player and a cheap CF card. It'll only run .mb.gba and .nds files, but many of the ds.gba games are being ported to work in .nds+CF mode.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
