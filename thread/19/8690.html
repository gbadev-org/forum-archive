    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am looking to buy a DS and I wanted to know if I have all my info correct.  I have a friend who has a FW1 DS and is running FLashme V6.  He told me that I need a FW1 inorder for him to flash my DS.  I cant find a FW1 (new or used)in my area.  I did find a used(though it looked new) <span style="color: blue">Blue</span> DS and I did the DS Pictochat trick and I got a <span style="color: green">GREEN</span> screen.  I did not buy it yet because I wanted to make sure I could use my friends stuff to flash it.  I plan on buying a SuperCardSD(have 3 1gig sd cards).  Will this work with his flashme or do I need to keep looking??  Please Help</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What about a new one?  I see silver and blue DS in the box new at a lot of stores.  From what I've read I just need to stay away from the red, light blue, and pink?  Is that correct, or is the Pictochat the only way to really know?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well actually, from what i read 
<br/>
the time nintendo made those colors they put the new firmware (v5)
<br/>
which is really badly documented since it has not been dumped
<br/>
<br/>
so... AVOID IT...
<br/>
<br/>
and you should be able to flash what you original wanted :)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">
