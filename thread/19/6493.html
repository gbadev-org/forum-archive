<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If it flashes through an external writer and allows you to turn off the multi-ROM loader, it'll work with *Me. <ul><li>XG2 Turbo cards in an XG2 Slim Loader </li><li>Many cards supported by LittleWriter in a Visoly writer </li><li>Visoly Flash Advance cards in a Visoly writer </li></ul>
<br/>
If it flashes through a port on the card itself and allows you to turn off the multi-ROM loader, it'll work with *Me. <ul><li>EFA-Linker </li></ul>
<br/>
If it flashes through a USB-to-GBA cable and allows you to turn off the multi-ROM loader, and you own a GBA, a GBA SP, or a Game Boy Player, it'll work with *Me. <ul><li>Flash2Advance </li></ul>

Well thanks alot though. I'm going to go look for an online store right now that has EZF-Advance. I just needed verification from the experts. I got a low budget, so I can't just keep buying and trying. :p

EDIT: Pfft. I'm worse than a noob :p If Aaron Rogers did it, hopefully I can too. &gt;_&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
