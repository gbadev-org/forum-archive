Would be nice to list the non-working carts for reference, so they could be included in the list. I tend to think that either you have bad luck, or aren't doing something correctly, if 6 flash carts all don't work. (unless they are all the same model and it's not compatible?)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Does the problem persist even if you uncheck "Use Loader" or put the writing software in "Single ROM Mode" or whatever the option to disable the bootloader is called on your cart?
<br/>
<br/>
If that doesn't work, how old is your DS? Can you find a manufacture date? (If it's new enough, you might have got a 1.52 like the iQue DS and the red DS.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Hmm.. That's a good idea.. Do we know of any flash carts that are not compatible FOR SURE, besides the Play Yan?  I'll be more then happy to add them to the list.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got my DS on release day from Japan so thats not the prob
<br/>
<br/>
Ive tried a Gcube and theres no option to remove bootloader (afaik)
<br/>
<br/>
also Qbus doesnt work either
<br/>
<br/>
I tried 2 of my carts (both flash 2 advance) and the damn cpu isnt recognising them properly.
<br/>
<br/>
The supercard just boots into GBA mode when i put any gba.ds files on.
<br/>
<br/>
ill report back if my stupid PC plays ball with the F2As again</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i did however manage to get my supercard to play homebrew although it was a funny way of going about it.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically i downloaded grid challenge
<br/>
<br/>
put both files on the supercard 
<br/>
<br/>
the normal .nds went to a white screen when clicked and the .nds.gba went to the GBA screen so i renamed the .nds.gba to just .nds and now its working :)
<br/>
<br/>
took me a week in between working on all my sites but i got there in the end, now to test more homebrew.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
