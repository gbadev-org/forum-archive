<br/>
<br/>
Does the FlashMe bug apply to commercial games too?
<br/>
Are there any other bugs in commercial you may know about that only happen when using a flashed DS?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by elmafiacs on Sun Mar 16, 2008 5:46 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

FlashMe causes no problem with sleep in situations a, b, d, and e. You will run into c if you use game demos ripped from DS Download Station, but you can keep an authentic DS Game Card in SLOT-1 to work around it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
