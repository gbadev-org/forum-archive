It is most likely Nintendo will add an alignment check in next firmware which will reduce potential jump addresses.

That's exactly my idea :)

People who have working PassMe setup, could run it with different DS games.

And we can make a list of jump positions for different DS cards.

You can already order PassMe with the new code, just specify it in the comments when ordering from me.

That would still be blockable, as Nintendo could just make new firmware that, given a data signature for each WMB stub released prior to the firmware revision, checks for the correct hash value for the header as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Once sgstair gets done, I'd suggest at least starting to reverse the Ni-Fi receive code in the SM64DS WMB stub, and then making something that can send to that on Ralink cards. Provided one can get it working, it would never be blockable.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Glad to hear! What kind of GBA flashcart did you end up using?</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've heard that the timing of the SRAM jump can be rather tricky... but (and note, I don't remember -any- ARM assembly anymore) would it be possible in some way to add a delay loop to allow swapping out cards?
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, since I only have a GBAMP (no SRAM) and a SuperCard (volatile SRAM), I was thinking about being able to copy into the SRAM of a GBA game and switching carts to run flashme from the SC or GBAMP...

Yeah, I had that idea too. It would involve few cart swappings between GBAMP (or similar) and a GBA game. Only thing needed is wait-for-key-press in the SRAM code.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it would be a very good way, because most ds owners have a gba game and then could use their gbamp/m3/sc instead of an expensive flash cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So what of the Nintendogs packed Teal DS? Does it have the same protection scheme as the red DS? This would be helpful to know for people who want to get one...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
