    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi
<br/>
<br/>
I just got my DS, M3 'gba movie player,' and a 2gb compact flash card. The problem I'm having is that when i boot up the DS with the movie player inside, it wont recognize any .nds or .gba files. It can see folders but not .nds or .gba files, and I'm getting really frustrated and discouraged.
<br/>
<br/>
I really hope (beg? plead?) that someone can help me because I can hardly wait to get my ds running those files off the card.
<br/>
<br/>
cheers,
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Try to:
<br/>
<br/>
- format CF
<br/>
- put your files on it
<br/>
- defrag after every file management on it
<br/>
<br/>
Should do the trick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The CF card should work, especially if you see folders.  Are you sure you selected "Game"?  The default selection is "Movie".  Are you using a PassKey/PassMe?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
