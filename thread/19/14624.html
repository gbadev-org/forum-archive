    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone,
<br/>
  I have been poking around the net and various forums (including this one) for the past few hours. I can not seem to find a clear set of directions to fix my problem. Please read on and post back if you can help me out =).
<br/>
<br/>
I have a friends DS Lite which he flashed with flashmev8 (I'm pretty sure) a brief while ago using a borrowed flash kit. I own a m3 lite slot 2 kit and an r4 slot 1. His DS is bricked do to running some lame app he dled off some random site (already slapped him for it). I want to reinstall flashme8 but I am unsure how.
<br/>
<br/>
My issues are:
<br/>
1) I read that you can not install flashme from a m3 lite flash card... please tell me this is not true.
<br/>
2) What exactly do I have to do and what should I see while I'm doing it.
<br/>
<br/>
I personally do not have my DS flashed so I'm unsure what steps to take to reflash his and exactly what to do.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If it's V8, you should be able to recover using the R4..  But here is my guide to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=108" target="_blank">Flashme on DS-Lite</a> and there is recovery information available at the bottom.  I believe there is more recovery information at the bottom of the one for <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dspassme.com/FlashMe.shtml" target="_blank">the original</a> as well.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

 thanks for the links i gave them a quick once over. i mentioned to my buddy about using my r4/v8 to fix the issue and he said it might have been v7a or something that he installed. yeah he just got another slap, and this one hurt because i can still see the red mark.
<br/>
<br/>
  i'm the type of person that likes to know exactly what is going to happen before it happens. i'm assuming then that i can use my m3 lite with v7 of flashme. as i read i'm just going to use the slot2 card with nothing in slot1. is it as simple has just reinstalling it? do i have to bridge the l1 for this? i'm unclear and i don't want to make any moves until i know where i'm heading first.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for your help!
