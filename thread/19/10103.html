    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm 19/m and i've had no experience with the ds, although i did mod my playstation and have built several other electronic thingamajiggarz. Anyway, questions:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Where is it?
<br/>
2. Is it triwing? (3 blades... like phillips has 4 blades)
<br/>
3. Has anyone tried to just remove it before flashing?
<br/>
<br/>
if you'd be very kind, could you contact me through aim or msn because i'm on a verry tight schedule? nuvandibe @ aim, <a href="mailto:ggfreeky@aol.com">ggfreeky@aol.com</a> @ msn. if not, i'll check here regularly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OH NOES!  I saw that.. and tore it up on IRC..  I mean..  The guy doesn't even know what he's talking about 50% of the time..  If your going to show how to FLASH something.. at least UNFLASH before you start!!!  So people can see what it is REALLY going to be like.  I should really get one, so I can update dspassme.com/FlashMe.shtml  cause..  WOW!
<br/>
<br/>
1) Ok, so he tells you to use the power cord.. but then doesn't plug it in..
<br/>
2) If your going to assume anything.. why not assume they can flash the DS without watching your video?  I'm not saying to show them step by step, but in 5 and a half minutes.. you could have!
<br/>
3) BLOW UP YOUR DS LITE!?!?!  That sounds awesome!
<br/>
4) How about suggest you use a flashing tool that isn't conductive on the sides?  Then you won't have to worry about touching the screw next to it?
<br/>
5) oh boy.. SRAM loaded.  How come mines doesn't show the SuperCard screen?  Oh.. because I haven't installed FlashMe yet.. like in the video.
<br/>
6) you can insert the PassMe2 while it's on, you don't have to wait.  Powering off, inserting your PassMe2, and powering back on.. within the 3 sec?  Good luck.
<br/>
7) You don't need to hold down your 4 buttons because those buttons are used by FLASHME!  If he would have removed FlashMe before doing the video, he would have realized that.
<br/>
8) Progress bar is filling?  And why not tell them that if you lose the connection it isn't a big deal?  Instead, he said "try not to lose your connection"..  It doesn't matter.. just make sure you get the connection back, and receive 100% before powering off.

I equate flashing the DS with the case on to that classic board game. Basically best word of advice is to:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Locate the opening for the SL1 port
<br/>
2. Cover your bridging tool with 1 layer of black eletrical tape
<br/>
3. DO NOT WIGGLE THE TOOL SIDE-TO-SIDE WHEN TRYING TO MAKE THE SL1 CONNECTION! The grounding strap is left/right (depending on how you hold the unit) of the unit. Imagine a flat piece of metal that goes across the GBA port opening.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a link to a pic I took of the area. The square hole opening immediately to the left of the screw is the opening for the SL1 port. Keep in mind that the pic I took is of the INSIDE of the case, so the square opening would be to the right. <a href="http://img441.imageshack.us/img441/4803/cimg17223me.jpg" target="_blank">http://img441.imageshack.us/img441/4803/cimg17223me.jpg</a><br/>_________________<br/>2 x Enamel Blue DS lites V5, V7 FW whatever
