    <h4>#44978 - blkdog7 - Tue Jun 07, 2005 1:31 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I went out and purchased the FOXCONN WLL-3350 PCI wireless card for the sole purpose of uploading the E3 demos to my DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
This card is a RALINK card and is on the list of compatible cards per the link at the Firefly site.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I can't make Firefly's driver install properly. I keep getting the little "!" symbol next over the DS icon in device manager.
<br/>
<br/>
I am able to install the driver but when I look under the status in the device manager it says:
<br/>
<br/>
"Device Cannot Start (Code 10)" and it has the menacing "!" symbol over the DS icon.
<br/>
<br/>
when I run WMB.exe it says: 
<br/>
<br/>
"DeviceFind() failed" 
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas? I was so excited to do this today, and I can't get it to work!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
strager, what card do you have?
<br/>
<br/>
blkdog, you said it shows the DS logo in the device listing now. Please confirm that your Device Manager and Driver Details for the Ralink RT2560 Device show the following: <a class="postlink" href="http://kleinw.students.cs.ccsu.edu/driverdetails.JPG" target="_blank">http://kleinw.students.cs.ccsu.edu/driverdetails.JPG</a>
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has trouble installing over the "original" drivers for their wireless card, try the following (there's other ways to do this, but this is the brute force approach):
<br/>
<br/>
1) Uninstall your driver. Shutdown.
<br/>
2) Remove the card from your computer. Boot up.
<br/>
3) Log in to Windows. Shutdown.
<br/>
4) Reinstall the card. Boot up.
<br/>
5) Make sure you select manual selection of your driver when it boots up. If it still automatically loads the original driver, this is a Windows XP issue and you must change a few system settings. Look up operating systems support info elsewhere.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That doesn't make any sense. You are saying that XP is loading the "default driver" (as in original manufacturer's driver), but that your installed driver is listed as the hacked one. Which is it?<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

XP is installing the default driver as soon as I boot the machine or uninstall the driver and then search for new hardware. I never get a chance to not have it install the default driver as soon as it detects uninstalled hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
The only way I can get the hacked driver on is to replace the default driver by selecting "update driver". After I do that, I see the hacked driver that your screenshot shows only it has a "!" next to it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well it probably won't take effect until you restart. So... use the tool recommended by Sektor in this post: <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=5941" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=5941</a>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
Step by step instructions:
<br/>
1) get it here: <a class="postlink" href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q311272" target="_blank">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q311272</a>
<br/>
2) Run:
<br/>
<br/>
devcon -m:\\&lt;your_computer_name&gt; hwids *
<br/>
<br/>
... this will supply your hardware ID
<br/>
<br/>
3) Run:
<br/>
devcon update &lt;driverpath&gt;rt2560.inf PCI\&lt;hardwareid&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
Example:
<br/>
devcon update c:\ds\driver\winxp\i386\rt2560.inf PCI\CC_0280
<br/>
<br/>
