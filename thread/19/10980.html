    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I heard somewhere that some recently released Japanese roms (I know, no rom talk, but bear with me for a sec) don't work on flashed DS's, because they do some kind of check to see if flashme is installed. The same guy said the latest DS Lite batch can't even b? flashed anymore, because it makes sure a shorted SL1 connection turns of the DS for you.
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering, what do you guys know about this? I flashed my Lite for ease and reduced energy use, will legally bought copies of future games actually stop working just because I flashed my Lite?
<br/>
<br/>
And also, if this indeed goes for real cartridges too, would there be a way to put back the original firmware without leaving ANY traces of it being flashed? Or might a new flashme version have a workaround on this?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if this is just a rumor, a hoax or real, so I wonder if any of you have heard about this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Holding Select while booting your DS will bypass FlashMe. Those roms you speak of will work if you hold Select and boot with your Passcard. Therefore, if you buy a game in the future that has this, hold Select and boot via DS menu. This "problem" won't ever be truly addressed as FlashMe was not written with piracy in mind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is a rumor caused by a problem with the first DS Lite flashes, but be ensured, this is not what happened.
<br/>
<br/>
The DSL shuts down, if you connect the SL1 with the ground (i.e. hit a screw with the shorting utility) that's the whole miracle. If you do it correct like advised in the tutorials, you don't risk this.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Of course, nobody has ever actually done any measurements of any kind, as far as I know. I don't see why something taking up space in the DS slot would use up battery power, if it's not even being accessed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, in the case of the PassMe, a CPLD is consuming power (becuase the power is there) even after it has did it's job.  Now, about the amount of power you "save" by not having a Passthrough/NoPass device inserted may not even be measurable.  But, as long as 3.3v is being supplied to the DS port, and something is in it, it will consume more power than if the DS slot was empty.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I say it might not even be measurable because the point the DS turns off could be affected by to many veriables that don't even count devices in the DS Slot.. Like battery health.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, like I said, I use it for energy reduction but it's the psychological, not the functional side of that argument that made me do it.
<br/>
<br/>
I just don't like it when power's draining away on multiple levels, you know. So, like an original cartridge drains power, I wanted my M3 to be the sole energy sucker too, when in use.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the info, I'm glad it's not as bad as the rumor goes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
