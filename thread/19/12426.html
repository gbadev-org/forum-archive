    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was thinking of using my DS for running DSlinux and moonshell and the like. I've been having some trouble trying to decide what equipment to buy, so I decided to ask. (I hope I'm not braking any rules!)
<br/>
<br/>
I have firmware version 3. Here's what I thought I'd get.
<br/>
<br/>
<ol type="1">Superkey
<br/>
GBA Super Card SD
<br/>
a 1gb SD card</ol>
<br/>
<br/>
Would this combonation work on my DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That equipment looks good.  If you don't want to have any part of the Supercard stick out (for instance, if you like keeping your DS in your pocket while listening to music), then you could spend the extra few dollars to get the miniSD version.  The media isn't all that much more expensive either.  I was able to get a 2 GB miniSD card for $20 by looking at the newspaper ads.  Of course, if it doesn't matter, then you should be fine with the SD.  Just make sure you do not get the Rumble series.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
