    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I really tried this on my own, but I just dont get it.
<br/>
I have a PassMe2 and a EZF-3 and a EZ-Flash3 with data storage function.
<br/>
I downloaded flashme.nds
<br/>
<br/>
For some reason I am not able to flash the flashme.nds. 
<br/>
There is no support on the flashcard program to install .nds files,I can only select gba , .lzs or .nes files.
<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded the ezf3me files, and I know I am supposed to replace a loader.bin in the flashmanager directory, but there is no such bin file. The only bin file in that directory is named nesldr.bin
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone help me? I'm really interested in getting this done because I want to develop for the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Run the flashme file through this. Select the option "ndsloader". That'll make it into a ds.gba<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>dualscreenman wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">What about Gaim DS?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You don't need to do that with FlashMe, you can just rename it to .gba.
<br/>
<br/>
But, the issue he is having is different, as his software loads a loader onto the cart no matter what.. which is the purpose of the seperate .bin file that was provided.  Sorry I can't help with that part.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
