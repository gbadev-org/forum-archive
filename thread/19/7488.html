<br/>
<br/>
When using old flashme everything was fine... I updated to the new one (5)  so I wouldn't have mario kart issues... Now my screen calibration in the standard DS software still works and DS games are fine, but all homebrew games are miles out, to the point that if they are touchscreen based software they are basically useless to me... I go back to the old flashme and its OK again, back to new and calibration for homebrew is screwed up... very strange..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I Flashed my DS with the first flashme a few months ago. Then I recently flashed it with the <span style="font-weight: bold">new </span> one. Conclusion: commercial games still work perfectly. And my own homebrew <span style="font-style: italic">ReboNDS</span> works as well as before the new flash-me...
<br/>
<br/>
Which homebrews are broken ?
