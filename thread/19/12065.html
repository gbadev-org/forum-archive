    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is a way to fix it, but only if you feel comfortable with soldering the TSOP flash rom inside the ARDS.  You have to remove it, put it in a test socket, flash it, and return it to the AR.  I'm considering doing this to mine to have Moonshell or another shell boot instead of the supercard menu.
<br/>
Interesting enough the flashrom is 8mbit, even though the dumps of it are 128mbit.
<br/>
<br/>
You might also be able to succeed with something like Milksop and not have to desolder the TSOP, just use a test clip, but those are expensive.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and sorry to hear about your ARDS. I've had many times where I was plugging in the usb cable and managed to eject the card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you still have your old AR?  If so, you can revive it.  The method to do that, is swap from new action replay to old, then force a firmware update onto the old one.
<br/>
<br/>
You do this by draging firmware.bin (usually located in C:\program files\datel\Action Replay Code Manager), onto the area above the code lists. (View image for more details as to where.) <a href="http://ds.caitsith2.net/ards/ards%20firmware%20load%20instructions.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
If after forcing the old one to have "current" firmware, the code list feature doesn't work properly, then you will need to reflash the firmware with my <a class="postlink" href="http://ds.caitsith2.net/ards/firmware_full_erase.zip" target="_blank">modified</a> version.  Still drag and drop it as usual.  In this case, be extra patient, and don't worry about the PC side timing out in waiting for the DS side to finish, the DS side will still finish.  Once that is done, the code list should work from that point on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you can do that, then it must be possible for a program running on the DS to flash the AR. This could be useful for unbricking them and/or putting custom software on them.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
