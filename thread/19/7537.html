    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have some BIG problems with my DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I've received my GBAmp today, but it's a total disaster:
<br/>
What I did:
<br/>
<br/>
- installed e19 firmware with no problems
<br/>
- installed Chishm's GBAmp patch v2
<br/>
- extracted MMax's GBAmp MB to CF's root
<br/>
<br/>
But when I use WiFiME, it loads properly but after the Nintendo LogoI get two beautiful white screens. I've tried formatting CF in both FAT32 and FAT, defragged it - nothing. GBAmp seems to run fine in GBA mode, but that's not the thing I bought it for...
<br/>
<br/>
I highly doubt I have new FW because my DS was bought in August. 
<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE, HELP ME.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">SOLVED!</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I've used v1 GBAmp patch, used it to run FlashME v5 and it works like a charm after applying v2 patch. Yahoo!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by MaHe on Sat Nov 19, 2005 12:11 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I found some VERY useful info on NDShb:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">In HexWorkshop: 
<br/>
(1) Open *physical* disk from the menu. 
<br/>
(2) You should now see 0x200 bytes of the first physical sector. 
<br/>
(3) Sellect all of them (CTRL-A) 
<br/>
(4) Go to Edit -&gt; Insert and fill with 0's 
<br/>
(5) Close HexWorkshop, reinsert CF and format with Windows.
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is in HexWorkshop. Even after format it gives out a false error that CF is write protected.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
