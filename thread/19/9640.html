    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What is the fastest speed any of the SD carts can read SD or mini-SD memory at? So either m3 or Supercard, what is there fastest read speed?
<br/>
<br/>
I am looking at getting "OCZ 2GB 133X HI-SPEED SD Secure Digital Flash Card" but I doubt the SD card readers for DS can read 133X</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">anyone? I was thinking that maybe that it doesn't matter because the speend of the GBA slot might be the inhibitor.
<br/>
<br/>
But does anyone know that speed?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are 3 limiting factors i guess:
<br/>
<br/>
- speed of the SD card
<br/>
- speed of the card slot (adapter card, supercard or m3)
<br/>
- speed of the GBA slot
<br/>
<br/>
i guess, there could be differences between different (gba adapter) cards, but the limiting factor imho isn't the sd card. 
<br/>
<br/>
you could write a benchmark and run it on different adapters/cards
