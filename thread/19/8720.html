    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, I want a gba flash cart, and I found a M3 + Passkey2 on a dutch webshop, and now my question is... how well does this setup work? (both NDS and GBA) I wanna be able to run homebrew on my NDS and GBA, so would this be a good investment?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The M3 can run most homebrew, as far as I know. The SD version however is a bit less compatible from what I've heard, so it's best to get the CF one. So I think that setup would work quite well indeed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
