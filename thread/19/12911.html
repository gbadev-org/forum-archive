    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can you install flashme with a slot 1 device? Lynx's flashme guide only refers to slot 2 devices, so it really got me wondering if this is possible. If you can use a slot 1, does it require a patch for the flashme file or anything special in addition to the standard flashme procedure?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, you can install FlashMe with a Slot 1 device. Last time I did it, I used an M3 DS Simply. The only thing you should know is that the recovery code will not boot a Slot 1 device. But if you installing FlashMe to get rid of the warning and/or remove the RSA check from download play, then go for it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I'm just trying to get the rsa check removed. I have an R4, so I guess there shouldn't be any problems if you didn't have any with the M3. Thanks, chuckstudios.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But, if something 'bad' does happen, it will be much cheaper to purchased a supported Slot-2 device to recover from, then buying a new DS or 'hoping' it will go back together if you try to use the alternative methods that require you to take your DS apart.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I suggest buying a GBAMP for such a recovery tool if needed, as they are cheap and easy to find on ebay.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got close to installing flashme, but I had a few problems with my R4/sd card. The R4 firmware always gets stuck at "Loading" or "Cannot access SD card"; even when I try without the flashme file. Seems like the sd card's contacts have been worn down by the shoddy USB connector that came with the package, as there are now visible ruts down the center of each contact. I knew it was going to eventually happen, as it took a lot of coercion to get the micro sd in and out, but not so soon (I got it all about 2 days ago). 
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else experienced this? Is there anything I can do to repair the contacts of the micro sd card? (I'm not very familiar with electronics, especially such tiny ones)
<br/>
<br/>
Are the R4/sd contacts really that finnicky, or could there be some other problem? 
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Note:</span> I've already tried reformatting the card with FAT format and replacing the R4 firmware, with no success.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Note to Lynx and chuckstudios:</span> Point well taken, as well as illustrated by my situation: With all that could go wrong, I'm going to wait to get a GBAMP as a flashme backup.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
