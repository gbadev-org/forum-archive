<br/>
Would it be possible to make rumble adapter between SLOT-2 and Flash cart. Could it handle it, or should it be built in the cart instead? That adapter could be locked to one brand (to avoid combatibility issues).
<br/>

SLOT-2 microSD adapter
<br/>
The size of the DS lite's Rumble Pak is so small that it's almost not possible even to fit microSD adapter inside the case. 
<br/>
Fitting a battery like the GBA cart's use is almost impossible also (maybe there are smaller 1.5V batteries.. just maybe..). Or maybe take a risk and add small condensator (it is needed to turn power on right away after it has been turner off to be able to backup the game save to sd card from memory chip).
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if the chinese people are already trying to fit microSD adapter to the small case. We well hear that later if it comes true. I hope so. It is almost obvious that microSD car adapter can't fit inside DS (SLOT-1) case.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, nothing is impossible, but most of the ideas are not worth it.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

A capacitor should work to keep data alive during a quick power cycle. It worked for my old PDA while I was changing its AA batteries.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
