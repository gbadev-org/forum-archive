    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Will it be possible?

<br/>
And if it will be possible, can we run heretic through gbamp? or it's too big?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Mighty max says hes working on ds.gba loader for gbamp.  Heretic will never work on the gbamp v2/v1 for reasons i've already explained to you.  Heretic is simply too big to fit into 4megs of memory.  It could be possible to load in the necessary files when loading each level but that would require a lot of effort i would imagine</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK.
<br/>
Thank you for your comprehension :)
<br/>
<br/>
So files ds.gba and .nds files will be always limited in size (on gbamp)?
<br/>
But why u can put 700 MB films?O.o</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GBA Movie Player can play 700 MB movie files because it loads a few kilobytes at a time from the CF.
<br/>
<br/>
And how much RAM did the original PC that ran Doom, Heretic, and Doom II have?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Doom 1 on the Super NES ran in 256 KB of RAM and 2 MB of ROM. Did the Super FX2 chip have its own RAM?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">True, but Doom for GBA runs in 384 KB of RAM and 8 MB of ROM. Because the Nintendo DS doesn't have that much RAM, any Doom engine port along similar lines to the GBA version must run either from a cart in GBA ROM space (flash or SuperCard) or have the ability to read assets from CF on the GBA Movie Player.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Heretic only needs 4MB of ram min. Still this would need us to only load the needed parts of the wad, we would be possible to get it run eventually.
<br/>
Doesn't the GBA doom has its own wad's, instead of the pc wad?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrsnowflake.be" target="_blank">http://www.mrsnowflake.be</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Doom for gba was considerably simplified over the original with less varing sounds/textures/animations/resolution/level complexity.   Also i dont think you can really compare the transfer rate of cartridges over cf cards.  It might end up being possible but not without making some kind of sacrifice</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The overall answer is: Anything can be run from the GBA MP if it is DESIGNED to do so.  Would it be easy to port games that aren't designed, dunno.
