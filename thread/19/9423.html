    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Judging by how the device acts, it appears it should work with a GBAMP.
<br/>
It doesn't require SRAM like a PassMe2, and appears to be a NoPass device, so in theory it should work.
<br/>
<br/>
Whether anyone has actually tested it I don't know.

But if it doesn't work, then I'm screwed unless I buy a supercard or flash card or whatever I need.
<br/>
<br/>
If someone who already has a different card aswell and their GBAMP, they can test the GBAMP - and if that doesnt work they can use their other card instead.

And then you've spent $20 for an alleged NoPass and $35 for a SuperCard and some of your time writing a Max Media Launcher + SuperCard HOWTO in exchange for a boatload of PageRank for DS scene related keywords. Some SEOs wish they could get PageRank so easily.

Or, if you're into GBA homebrew too, you can try with a traditional GBA flash cart.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I'll probably just do some testing and put something on my weblog. As I have a PassMe2, I was thinking of flashing to a PassMe2 firmware and trying it with a GBAMP so that the people who have this fear that it won't work with a GBAMP can rest easy. :P<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think they really should explain themselves. This is almost criminal. Takin people's money and saying the product has been sent. It's just so dumb.

Yeah, I finally got mine today...sadly I have been unable to dump the thing. :P  It must be doing something weird as it seems to boot up the NDS content from GBA directly, rather than making you 'click' on the icon for it or whatever in the DS's menu (and loading it from FWNITRO, which it does not autoboot from, does nothing interestingly).  
<br/>
<br/>
I tried like a few different things to try and dump it...I'll have to see if I can figure out why FWNITRO's dumper no longer works for me, I have a feeling that's my best bet as it was at least able to tell me it's internal name was 'MEDIALAUNCH'...not that I didn't realize this, but it's more than the other software I tried could do.
<br/>
<br/>
*edit*
<br/>
Ok, went back to an earlier version of FWNITRO where that function works for me.  
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the info if anyone is curious (if this is against forum rules, please just delete it, though I'm hoping there's no problem as it's just information).
<br/>
<br/>
Gametitle=MEDIALAUNCH
<br/>
Gamecode=ASMA
<br/>
Makercode=01 (which is Nintendo &gt;_&gt;)
<br/>
Logo and Header CRCs are ok, but the banner is not...has no icon it seems, doesn't list any banner text either.
<br/>
<br/>
The best and most strange part is that the secure area (in NDStool) is listed as Invalid, Encrypted...which probably shouldn't be.  I assumed it was decrypted and was trying to re-encrypt it using NDStool, and it said it was unable to decrypt it...sure enough, it says the secure area is encrypted. O_o  
<br/>
<br/>
It's also like 128 mbits yet it has no filesystem that I can see.  I think someone would have to check it with a hex editor to find out what's going on.  Maybe it's using part of the secure area or some other portion of the header to store code or something.  So far it's not what I was thinking it was.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I do wonder if it's a bad dump now, as I had problems with another gamecard today with FWNITRO...it used to work fine though, so I'm not sure why this is going on (actually, I noticed something odd that might help figure out what is happening...it stopped working again, but I noticed that it started working again after I loaded some homebrew or something with my M3, cycled power, then tried to dump it again...although, the dump was invalid so something weird is going on here...maybe an issue with M3).  I couldn't dump it with anything else though...one dumper complained about it not finding the secure area, then the other refused to dump it completely.  It's strange.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First, is talking about dumping this against the forum rules?  I mean.. even though this isn't a commercial game, it is a commercial device.
<br/>
<br/>
With that said, I am not sure if it even has a secure area, as another tool (prior to dumping) indicates that it couldn't find a secure area.  But, we also have to keep in mind that I'm sure this device wasn't created using a Nintendo Liscense, so I'd guess it isn't following the "standard" rules for commercial games that current dumpers have been designed around.  I think it might need to be looked at like "Let's hack a device created by hackers".. So, no current/known rules apply.

The actual rom of the NoPass seems to be a regular 4 Mbit flash memory chip (39VF040, datasheet <a class="postlink" href="http://www.semiconductorstore.com/pdf/39VF040-70-4CWH.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>). I assume the rest of the interfacing stuff is done by the ASIC. So, what this basically means, is that it would be possible to reprogram the flash chip with some homebrew program and have yourself a real DS flashcart. Does anyone have the proper equipment to try this? It would involve desoldering the flash chip, reprogramming it with a seperate programmer and resoldering it. Or installing a chip socket to make things a bit easier.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wonder if anyone finds out how to do that... It would be very good to do that. There are a few things you can do with this:<ul>
<br/>
<li>Disable AutoStart bit to make it to not AutoStart.
<br/>
</li><li>Modify it to not display the logo before it starts, or modify other things with it as well.
<br/>
</li><li>Give a copy of a game to someone in case they don't have a adapter for CF card, then you may be able to still work on your own stuff while they are borrowing it, or to test multi-player games.
<br/>
</li><li>Fix it to download <a class="postlink" href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Software" target="_blank">software</a> from HTTP or <a href="http://FTP." target="_blank">FTP.</a>
<br/>
</li><li>Replace it with a game you made, then you could remove the sticker, replace with your own, and sell that game. (but it might be a bit expensive, I wonder if Datel will give a discount if you buy many at a time)
