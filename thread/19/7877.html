    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I installed the card with the actual linksys drivers by accident and now i can't remove them to install the ones for WiFiMe.  If i uninstall them through the device manager and then go to scan for hardware changes, it automatically installs the linksys drivers.  Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After you uninstall the Linksys drivers, go to your C:\WINDOWS\inf folder and find .inf file for the card and delete it. You can check which .inf is the correct one by opening it in Notepad.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmmm yes... That is a problem. If you find your Linksys drivers from where you got them from (on a CD or a downloaded file), they should have a inf file. Find the inf file with the same file name in the C:\WINDOWS\inf folder and delete it. Otherwise you could try doing a search for all *.inf files that contain the word Linksys.

EDIT: I just downloaded the drivers off the Linksys website, it appears to be Rt2500.inf</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I did the same thing. You can "Update" your drivers for the DS ones under the advanced tab in the device manager. Good Luck.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm just off to Hartleypool to buy some exploding trousers.
