    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I recently flashed my new white US DSLite with flashme 
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I can still change the brightness setting as normal. However, the setting is not saved. Everytime I power up the DS, it always resets to brightness level 3. I prefer to use 2, because it's usually bright enough, and it saves battery power.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure I used the latest flashme, but it's hard to tell, there were several releases that kept the same version number apparently (v7).
<br/>
I used this flashme.nds:
<br/>
md5sum: fa220267edb05f4386025d97e2168f3f
<br/>
size: 538185 bytes
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a newer one I should be using?
<br/>
<br/>
I searched, and couldn't find this issue mentioned elsewhere -- the only problem (which I don't have) I could find, was that people lost their brightness controls completely.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
