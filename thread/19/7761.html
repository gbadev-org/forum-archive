    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone  do me a quick reality check. Am I taking the correct steps to flash my DS via wifime.
<br/>
<br/>
One sliver DS about 10 months old 
<br/>
One EZ-flasH III 1 gig card
<br/>
One wifi ralink compatible pci adapter - tested with demos all works fine.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. copy flashme.nds to my gba cart
<br/>
2. As its an EZFLASH III i need to copy the addtional file from ezf3me.zip in this case loader.bin to my cart. I presuming it goes in the 256mbit area.
<br/>
3. Slot card in power ds on 
<br/>
4. Use the wifi adapter to load the flashme.nds I use the  comand "wmb -data wifime" to load it to the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Now at what point do i short the SL1 contacts before i switch it on or is there a visual cue once the wmb comammnd has been executed,
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. flashme.nds goes in the 256mbit part
<br/>
2. loader.bin goes in your ez3 application folder on your PC. not sure if you have to specify this as a loader in the software somewhere, but you do NOT put it on the 256mbit part
<br/>
3. I don't understand what you are saying here
<br/>
4. you are not using the wifi adaptor to load flashme.nds. flashme.nds is on your gba cart. you are using the wifi adaptor to launch 'wifime'. but otherwise the command is correct
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, once it boots, it tells you what to do on the screen (when to short, etc)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
