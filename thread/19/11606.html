    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought the MMD on kind of an impulse buy for running homebrew stuff and whatnot, and now I've discovered that its pretty mediocre for that, but I've read about FlashMe, and want to know if it'll work with the Max Media Dock so I can use the Media Dock to run homebrew without the use of the launcher card (the NoPass thingy, I guess). I'm using a red DS, with v4 firmware. Thanks for helping out this noob. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">...just a thought, if the MMD has support for firmware upgrades, is there just something specific with the hardware keeping it from supporting FlashMe?

Magic Key 4 can boot Magic Key 2/3 in addition to acting as a standard NoPass. Likewise, MML can boot MMD in addition to acting as a standard NoPass.

Only a NoPass card with support for FAT through MMD will boot MMD, and the MML is such a card.

I don't know whether the included MML differs from the version that is sold separately.

Yes, carterman, it is something specific with the hardware. GBAMP CF has two functional units: a NOR flash to store the GBA-mode shell and (with Chishm's NDSMP hack) to load the DS-mode shell from the CF card; and an ATA interface to read and write the CF card. The MMD, on the other hand, has only the ATA interface, relying on code stored in the MML to load the DS-mode shell from the CF card. If you try to boot it with FlashMe, it will appear as an Option Pak.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Thanks for the explanation, tepples. I'm probably going to stick with this thing for now, as I don't want to go through the return hassles, and the prices seem quite prohibitive for something I'm taking up as a curiosity. Thanks for your help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But flashme also includes support for booting Magic Key 2/3. Maybe we should petition for adding MMD support to Flashme?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If FlashMe supports more cards, manufacturers may become dependent on FlashMe. This can have bad consequences for 1. the GBA scene as manufacturers remove all compatibility with GBA homebrew from their products, 2. FlashMe developers as FlashMe runs out of space in the firmware, and 3. FlashMe users as they have to run the risk of bricking their systems (especially now that newer DS Lite units have a pickier SL1) in order to make using the card practical in some cases.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If FlashMe doesn't boot something, it's the manufacturers fault.  FlashMe should not be required to use a device, but should be compatible.  Making a device that FlashMe doesn't work with leaves their customers open to bricking their system from a trojan.  If FlashMe is currently able to boot both slot-2 and slot-1 solutions, the manufacturer should do the research to design their device so that it is compatible.
<br/>
<br/>
As the MMD is available at any BestBuy, it increases the chances of people running homebrew.  As more people are running homebrew, that increases the chances of some A-hole deciding to do something destructive.  I wounder what Datel's response will be to a wide spread bricking of their customers because they were not able to protect themselves even if they wanted to..<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wouldn't this leave the manufacturer open to accusations of having copied the Magic Key 2, which is the only SLOT-1 device supported by FlashMe (apart from DS Game Cards themselves)? It'd play out much the same way as when Datel was accused of copying the GBAMP CF into the MMD, which turned out to be just a copying of those things that all ATA controllers have in common. (CF is a variant of ATA.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

FlashMe just jumps to addresses, correct?  There is no patent on what address you start at, is there?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's not a patent issue, it's a there's-no-room-for-the-code issue. MMD has no firmware, the code is on the DS card. FlashMe would need to contain code to read the filesystem and load a .nds from it, and there's just not enough room for that, plus it would send the message to other device makers that they don't need to make an effort to be compatible because someone will just write new drivers. All FlashMe really does is jump to a spot in the device's firmware, and they handle loading the app from there. That's why you get the device's boot menu rather than _BOOT_MP.NDS on some devices, and why GBAMP needs a firmware hack.

If their device works like a real DS Card, then no firmware hacking at all should be needed to support it.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
