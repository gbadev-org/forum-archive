The sellsman at gamestop said he had a few kids come thru and it worked for them.
<br/>
<br/>
When I tried it on my DS ( and my kids tried theirs as well), we simply had each others dogs sent to us.. even though everyones DS was OFF when one of us was trying.  It was like the display DS was simply sending us our own dog back.
<br/>
<br/>
Weird.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I work at a GameStop and I tried it with my FlashMe'd firmware and it worked.  I did have some trouble with some kids that tried getting the present at the same time.  They both turned on bark mode and ended up playing with one another's dog.  I thought they should just try again one at a time, but it didn't work.  When they put their game in bark mode, the DS transmitting the gift didn't acknowledge them.  I put my DS in bark mode (with both of their DSs off), and I somehow got one of the two kids' dog.  I was very confused, but this is what I think (I make no guarantee that this is accurate):
<br/>
<br/>
The DS at the GameStop relays your dog to the next person, but gives you the virtual gift and message from Haylie Duff.  If that DS has picked up on your bark mode info, it won't respond to you again.  It will assume you already got the gift and won't keep giving you it.
<br/>
<br/>
I was able to help the kids out by giving them the gift.  I did this by using <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pat.hi-ho.ne.jp/~sata68/nds/ndseeprom07d.zip" target="_blank">Sata's NDSEEPROM</a> program.  I first made a backup of my save having the gift, entered bark mode, gave the first kid the gift, restored the original save, and then repeated the process for the next kid.
<br/>
<br/>
Those kids are lucky I keep my FlashMe'd DS around when at work and for all the great homebrew developers that allowed me to help them out.  Moral of the story though is to make sure that only one person at a time enters bark mode for the GameStop promotion.  I just wish they had told us that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">habeeb - sounds like you nailed it on the head.
<br/>
<br/>
when my kids first showed up, before I could tell them to stop, they both entered bark mode at the same time, and it failed.
<br/>
<br/>
we then tried one at a time, all 3 of us.  never could get it to work.  we even went to another gamestop, and tried one at a time.  i guess the damage was done.
<br/>
<br/>
they each got a $1.99 cleaning cloth for their systems, so it was a good day for them anyhow... :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
