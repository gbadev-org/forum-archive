<br/>
<br/>
You can't boot DS mode stuff from Slot-2 without a PassMe, NoPass, WiFiMe, FlashMe, or Slot-1 device with pass software.  You'll need to buy a SuperKey, NoPass, PassCard, or (probably the cheapest, easiest), Games n' Music slot-1 card.  I say Games n' Music (which is a flash cart) because it's cheap ($20 to $35) and available at Wal Mart, Best Buy, etc.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, if your friend has a Passme / NoPass device, then ask him/her to let you borrow it, then use it to install FlashMe on your DS.
