    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was in the process of flashing the DSwith Flashme and an Xrom 512 card. I loaded the appended NDSloader but could never get it to boot. I would insert the Xrom and would always get just a white screen, I never got any messages or the percentage indicator, nothing. Anyway after about the hundredth time loading and reloading the cart, I went to turn on the DS and got nothing. Bupkiss. I plugged in the charger and for about one second I get the orange charging light and then it goes off and the DS itself will not start up. I am assuming I have killed it but would like any second opinions offered besides the standard "U screwed it dood". Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ummm, try to remove the battery and run the DS with power-supply cable connected. Whatever the result, turn off and re-insert the battery. I don't know how could it help, but -</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you have a steady hand you can bridge it, otherwise it's a ninty repair</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
