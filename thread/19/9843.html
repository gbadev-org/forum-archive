<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i have purchased one passkey2 + m3 SD and a SD corsair 133x 1GB memory , when i first installed the game manager and transfer one rom to the memory, it has successfully loaded ( by the way very fast ) i entered on the m3 site and upgraded the firmware to the last version, 21 i guess , after this i can't use anymore the roms, and the new game manager that i have installed too doesn't work, i 'patch' the .nds file , transfer to the memory and i'm trying to run , but it show some progress bar that when it fills up the screen freezes...
<br/>
<br/>
My question is , i can 'downgrade' the firmware ? it is really the firmware version the problem ? when i research on web by this issue the people say that the 18 version is more stable, it is true ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
