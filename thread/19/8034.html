<br/>
<br/>
I own an Asmax PCI-311b wifi card in my computer and I'm having problems with connecting my NDS to this network. It finds the access point, I give him the WEP password it should use and then when the connection test is in progress the error #51300 pops out and connection can't be estabilished.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried turning off ZoneAlarm, but left the WinXP SP1 default firewall running. I presume that NDS doesn't need to connect to any open ports on the PC, so there should be no problems with that. Does anyone know what can I do to successfully estabilish the connection?
<br/>
<br/>
Regards,
