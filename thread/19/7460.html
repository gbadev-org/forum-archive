    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone from Australia or New Zealand bought a silver DS recently with the new firmware?
<br/>
Also, another question.
<br/>
If I do a get a new firmwared DS, can I downgrade to the old firmware?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks
<br/>
<br/>
OPTIONAL(if you'd like to read a nice story :P)
<br/>
I have a DS at the moment. Problem is it has a grainy screen - which is annoying.
<br/>
Soooo, since it also has dust under the top screeen I'm going to get it replaced at an EB near me.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also going to be buying another DS so I can play multiplayer games with members of my family.
<br/>
Now, I plan to buy a M3 + passkey very soon, but I'd prefer an older passme compatible firmware for them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are concerned with which is which, check this page: <a href="http://www.dspassme.com/dstrackerlist.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.dspassme.com/dstrackerlist.shtml</a> which lists serial numbers and weither people have had them work with wifime or the first passme.  If enough auzzie units are listed, you might be able to take a guess as to around where in the order of numbers the firmware switches, so you can sift through the units on the shelf to find a lower numbered unit.
<br/>
<br/>
Newer firmware units can only be modified to the flashme firmware using a passme2which will also work with older units.  There is no otherway yet to modify newer units.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have an old passme, search for information on JTAG cable in the forums, this would allow you to, I believe, alter the passme to make it a passme2.<br/>_________________<br/>Of all the things I have lost, I miss my mind the most.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There isn't a really good way via serial numbers for Australia from the tracker site.
<br/>
<br/>
NAH101 all have the new firmware, but two pink NAH100 are also listed.  
<br/>
<br/>
Newly bought silver units are also starting to have new firmware, so if they just send you a new or refurb unit, you could end up with new firmware even using a silver DS.
<br/>
<br/>
If you buy a brand new silver DS from a store that has had it sitting in stock for a while, and it has a NAH100 serial, you're probably safe, but even in the worst case, you can always buy a pasme2 or upgrade a passme1/passkey/etc... and be golden.  So if you plan on developing and also getting a DS just for playing with friends/family, you could send your current one in (which has decent odds of being replaced with a new-firmware one), and try to buy a second *silver* one that has been in a store for a while, to use as your dev DS, and the returned one will become the playing DS.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

<br/>
I guess I'll just have a few demands for my new unit and my replacement ;).
<br/>
<br/>
I'll ask them for some older stock units, each with a grid type touch screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
