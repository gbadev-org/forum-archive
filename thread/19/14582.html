    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm looking for some help using my newly acquired Supercard SD. I've patched my .nds files and I've formatted my SD card, but every time I try to use it with my DS, it says literally "not find the SD .  Please turn off the GBA"
<br/>
This problem occurs with and without the Super Key inserted.

I'm new to homebrew and am wondering if I'm doing something wrong or what my problem is? Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, lol... I cleaned off the contacts on the SD card and it seems to be working fine, it didn't look like there was anything wrong with it before though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Having problems with this again, I'm sure it's not the contacts now. My supercard won't read my SD card unless I push it in while it's loading. It seems like the spring lock in the supercard isn't adjusted right and the contacts, well aren't contacting. Is this a common problem or is there a way I can fix this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
