    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have the xg2 turbo 256 and snes ds and the e3 demos work for me.  I do have to use the bundled e3 demos with the multiloader though.  Things do take a couple seconds to load for me.  I use SlimLoader to put stuff on my cart, and just make sure it does'nt include the bootloader on the cart.   You can add multiple roms from snesDS.exe and it will have a menu to select games in the final rom.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got mine from lynx too.  I got slimloader from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.xgflash2.com/phpbb/viewthread.php?tid=1633" target="_blank">http://www.xgflash2.com/phpbb/viewthread.php?tid=1633</a>.  I used snesds.exe to add a couple roms and it spit out snesds.ds.gba.  You can either add it in slimloader and remove the bootloader it has in the list already, or run Without_Boot_Load_(Single Game).bat and it won't try to include it.  As far as the DS demos go I got them from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.akkit.org/DS/E3/" target="_blank">http://www.akkit.org/DS/E3/</a> specifically the multirom section at teh very very bottom of that page.  Just burned it to the cartridge all by itself.  I pop in my passme and after a brief delay I am set.  If you still have problems you may want to format the card real quick, there was one occasion where slimloader put some corrupt stuff on my card and that fixed it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yea I must be doing something wrong.When i burn it i remove the 6mb XGBootLoader.But when i try to test it,and then put it back in the Slim Loader III.Then XGBootLoader somehow got burned onto the card.Is that what is causing my problems.Im using USB Slim Loader V1.20 if it matters.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:Sorry didnt see the part about running the .bat.Ill try that real quick</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For that you need Darkfader's loader, available <a class="postlink" href="http://darkfader.net/ds/" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Look under Development Tools for ndsmall.bin.  Usage is thus (open DOS console for this):
<br/>
<br/>
copy /b ndsmall.bin + demo.nds demo.ds.gba
<br/>
<br/>
Basically this just copies the ndsmall.bin into the front of the NDS...then passme loads that loader which then loads the NDS code from the NDS file...heh, sounds confusing when I say it this way.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got a different problem with the xg2 512M.
<br/>
<br/>
I've got a limit of 16MB with all of the multiloaders (Darkain, snes).
<br/>
<br/>
I know Darkain said it's the same for all the xg, neoflash cards but at least the gba files use all the capacity of the card.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it's a problem with the file system that they are using.
<br/>
<br/>
If someone could find the reason it would be great.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
