    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sonic Rush isn't your typical WMB demo. It loads in two stages. First, it loads one part from the host DS using the normal WMB protocol and another part from the host DS using a protocol that only Sonic Rush uses. If you try to rip Sonic Rush's demo using the typical methods, you'll only get the first stage, which is useless without the second stage data stored on the Sonic Rush cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
In order to rip, you'd need to capture both stages and then figure out how to put the two stages back together.
<br/>
<br/>
But the good thing about 2-stage loaders is that the code loaded by the second stage doesn't necessarily need to be signed, making it theoretically possible for some smart fellow to disassemble the first stage, discover the protocols and formats used to load the second stage, and make a new homebrew booting method.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
