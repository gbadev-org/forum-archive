    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Asus WL-167G is a USB adapter, and it doesn't have the RT2560 chipset required to use the wmb.exe app.
<br/>
<br/>
There are no other drivers or applications written that will work for your adapter. The instructions on all accurate WiFiMe sources explicitly state that you need a PCI or PCMCIA adapter as they use the appropriate chipset (RT2560). The USB adapters use the RT2571 chipset.
