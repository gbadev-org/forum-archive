    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lately my DS won't recognize the R4 is in it all the time.  Sometimes I'll turn on my DS and it will go to the default DS menu.  Sometimes I'll be playing a game from my R4 and the game will just freeze.  I'm assuming this is because the DS thinks the R4 was removed from the system.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have this issue?  And if so, is there anything to make it better?  It's not a big deal I guess...but it's a bit frustrating.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Doesnt the R4 have a single screw on the back, it should open up super easy, then clean the contacts and put it back together.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

<br/>
that's what i figured.  there's no way it could be dirty contacts...i JUST got the R4 about a month ago.
<br/>
<br/>
this is making me sad because the problem is became more and more frequent.  it happened once about a week ago and then didn't happen again for a while.  but now it's happening about once a day. :/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know how I can test to see if it's my R4 or my MicroSD that is in the R4?  I don't have enough money to buy another R4 or MicroSD to test them...any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">all flash kits have this problem. usually taking it out and putting it back in makes better contact. some require you prop the board up with a small wedge of paper to force the contact. also try blowing some compressed air into your slot1. this fixed my r4 contact issue.
<br/>
<br/>
you do know the r4 is a dead kit now? the team is involved in a heavy lawsuit in japan, they stopped producing the kits over 4 months ago, and they have no plans to release any fixes or updates to the firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
perhaps you should send it back, get a refund and pick up an acekard 1.2. the ak team fixed the hardware FAT problem on the 1.2 build. my acekard rpg is the best kit i've owned (i've had 6 different flash kits so far).
<br/>
<br/>
anyways before you take it apart and macgyver it, did you try a different msd card? the one you have might be having problems. if you don't own a second its time to pick up a 2gb for 8 bucks.
