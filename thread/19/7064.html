    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Belkin F5D7000 has a star on the supported cards list: <a href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">http://ralink.rapla.net/</a>
<br/>
This means that there are other revisions of the card that have a different chipset. You need a v3 revision, but it looks like you have a different one...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
