You and your friend could both use it to flash your DS's though :D

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GBAMP is a device, not a type of game.
<br/>
<br/>
The GBAMP device does not work with PassMe2 because of the SRAM issue. Your best bet is to get an M3 or Supercard.<br/>_________________<br/>3 is not an "e", 
<br/>
7 is not a "t", 
<br/>
1 is not an "l",
