    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have flashed "flashme.nds" to my 128Mb Flash2Advance card with "Fix Data" turned off on the linker software.
<br/>
<br/>
I placed it in the "data" folder in the WiFiMe folder and load it up in WMB. It goes all the way to 100% loading on the DS and then it goes to a white screen with a garbled Nintendo logo on the top screen and it freezes.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas? I also tried appending the ndsloader to the the flashme.nds to make it a ds.gba file and tried that to no avail.

You should do that and succeed. I had to convert flashme.nds with the ndsbuild tool before I succeeded.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">Exceptions are fun</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Download the latest noflashme.nds prepend the ndsloader.bin 
<br/>
(copy /n ndsloader.bin noflashme.nds noflashme.nds.gba) to make a noflashme.nds.gba that you flash to a flashcard. 
<br/>
<br/>
Card in the gba slot 
<br/>
<br/>
Launch wmb -data wifi , 
<br/>
Boot up the DS download the wifime and launch the flashme from the flash card. 
<br/>
<br/>
You can not AFAIK boot flashme.nds via wmb unless your DS has already a noflashme firmware installed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">uhh...why are you telling him to run noflashme? thats the UNinstaller, he wants to install it (at least it seems to me).
<br/>
<br/>
Note: you put flashme on your gba cart. When you run wmb, you use the wifime data for wmb, NOT flashme for wmb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You've got the new DS firmware (you can't run from your gba card!).
<br/>
<br/>
Only way to install flashme is to buy a flashme2 from natrium42</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
but you mustn't put flashme in the data folder, but on you flashcard and then run the wifime app to boot flashme from your gba flashcart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
ok so I don't run flashme.nds from the wireless program along with having it on the card...
<br/>
<br/>
what data file do i run from the wireless program to have it load flashme.nds from the flash card? is it one of these files: arm7.bin, arm9.bin, beacons.bin, header.bin, rsa.bin? I just found these on firefly's web site.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks again for your help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

flashcard goes in the gba slot

Launch wmb -data wifime (make sure you downloaded wifime.zip and put it in the data directory of wmb) ,

Boot up the DS download the wifime tolaunch the flashme from the flash card.
