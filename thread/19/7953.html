<br/>
<br/>
would i be best off just going for an ezf2 256m, or is there a wiser choice nowadays?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">he's already got the DS, to play mario kart. it's not <span style="font-style: italic">that</span> sort of economical issue.
<br/>
<br/>
i've got a launch DS, flashed long ago with a borrowed passme, so we're going to have to get him a 2 anyway. i've had an ezf2 128m for a year and a half now, so i figured i'd sell it to him for cheap and i could get myself something new that still had roughly the same functionality.
<br/>
<br/>
while i appreciate the inventive suggestions, i'd really like for whatever i buy to <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> protrude from the DS (does that limit me to another flashcart?).
<br/>
<br/>
and we <span style="font-style: italic">would</span> be flashing his. so any elaborate routines required to get homebrew working are a nonissue, so long as they're eliminated with flashme. we don't even necessarily need something that can boot flashme (although isn't that everything but the GBAMP at this point?), because i already have the ezf2.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If the goal is that it be no bigger than an authentic DS Game Card and authentic GBA Game Pak, then you'll need to buy an old-fashioned GBA flash cart and a PassMe2 and then use the PassMe2 once to flash the DS. That would seem to work, except: <ul><li>There are unconfirmed reports of problems when sending DS Download Play programs from authentic DS Game Card in a flashed DS unit to non-flashed DS units. </li><li>Your 128 Mbit (16 MByte) card isn't going to be big enough for some of the newer homebrew stuff. Even a 256 Mbit card isn't going to be big enough for some media players and emulators *cough*ScummVM talkies*cough*. </li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i played mario kart and meteos with him from my flashed DS, before he had either game, so i might as well disregard said unconfirmed reports.
<br/>
<br/>
so both supercard variants protrude from the gba slot? damn. that really is sort of a deal-breaker for me. thanks for the help, tepples.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">With the SuperCard CF, the adapter itself doesn't protrude from the slot (unlike the GBAMP, M3, and SuperCard SD), but the CF card does.

I dunno, on the M3 at least I think it consumes a bit more battery than normal DS operation, although I still get very very good battery life so it couldn't be all that much more.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, final question:
<br/>
<br/>
does the EFA-linker (extreme flash advance) have the same battery consumption as the ez-flash 2 powerstar, and is their linker software any better? (this one might be harder to answer)
<br/>
<br/>
i think i'm going to stick with a flashcart, and the EFA is a bit cheaper everywhere i look, but i'm trying to remember if there was any reason i went with the ezf2 in the first place. they both advertise "60% less power consumption."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
