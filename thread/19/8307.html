    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there!
<br/>
<br/>
Ive been wondering what would be best for my DS storage needs. I intend to use my DS as a movie player, mp3 player, snes/nes emulator and eventually linux DS.
<br/>
<br/>
So what storage method would be good for me?
<br/>
<br/>
Also on a side note, i understand that the m3 has 32mb of extra ram in it? What advantages does this give and are there any programs that require it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think any DS apps use the extra 32MB (or even can), but it'll let you use it as a standard GBA flash cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Here's what the extra RAM does: <ul><li>Very few GBA homebrews over 200 KB will run from the GBA Movie Player, as they expect to be loaded into ROM space, which is where SuperCard and M3 RAM sit. If you want both Nintendo DS and GBA homebrew, it'd be best to get something with a 32 MB RAM. </li><li>Some DS programs such as the ports of Heretic and Hexen haven't yet been ported to use Chishm's file system code; instead, they expect to load assets from GBA ROM. </li><li>DSLinux will eventually use the extra RAM in the SuperCard and M3 as a big swap file. </li><li>Cards with RAM in GBA ROM space also tend to have GBA SRAM, which is important for booting homebrew on Nintendo DS firmware v4 or later. </li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
