    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys I have a question, I am planning on buying a ds lite and I want to be able to play homebrow games and put other programs on it, including music, movies and more. I am thinking about buying an m3 minisd adapter and a passcard 3 will I be able to run homebrow and do everything that I could have done If I flashed it with v7??? Please if you guys can post everything you know and anything that I should know would be helpful. I currently own a minisd 2GB. Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">first of all where do you live? If you live in north america you can get your flash card adapter at [a canadian store that I'm not allowed to promote on this board outside of Retailer Feedback] they have super fast shipping and the prices are resonable. I bought a mini sd supercard and it came to my hosue in 2 days! If you allready have a mini-sd I would recommend just getting the super card mini sd adapter. I have one allready and it's running really great for homebrew. I would recommend the passme2 instead of the passcard 3, however I have not done any research on the passcard 3. The passme2 works great, and there are no problems using it.

to answer your question if you flash it with v7 all of the origional features of the DS lite will remain. The only difference is that you now can play homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/>hack it till you make it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are a few US retailers that are just as good. You will need:
<br/>
<br/>
Flash adapter - M3 is the best
<br/>
Memory for the flash adapter
<br/>
Passkey2 - used for regular use or you can use it 1 time to flash your lite with the flashme firmware. After you flash the unit, you no longer need the passkey2<br/>_________________<br/>2 x Enamel Blue DS lites V5, V7 FW whatever
<br/>
2 x EZ4 lite microSD adapters
<br/>
Both are FlashMe'd</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
