    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When i try to run homebrew through dsorganize, i get the error message "you haven't patched dsorganize with any dldi file. The Chishm loader requires you to have a dldi patched dsorganize or a dldi file in your resources directory."  This makes no sense to me because i have already ran dsorganize through chishm's GnM dldi patcher, and i have extracted every file from the patcher and placed them in the resoures directory. What am i doing wrong?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
