    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am selling my old flashme'd DS and wanted to return it to original state with noflashme first.  The DS lost battery power at 77% and now I only get black screens on boot.
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried the failsafe with my G6 and although it boots and I can see noflashme.nds in the menu, the system seems to be locked up and will not respond to any button or touchscreen presses.
<br/>
<br/>
I have also tried putting noflashme on my old Flash Advance Extreme card but the software does not seem to like the file.  When I put it on, it changes the name and calls it a save file.  When I put it in the DS I get nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone give any advice on how to possibly un-brick?  I have a number of old flash cards and have listed them below:
<br/>
<br/>
-Original Passkey 1
<br/>
-Visoly Flash Advance Xtreme 512 and USB/parallel linker
<br/>
-G6 Flash and USB Link
<br/>
-DS-X
<br/>
<br/>
Right now nothing seems to do anything except for the G6 in failsafe, but it does not seem to work.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any help.
