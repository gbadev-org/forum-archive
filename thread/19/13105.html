    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A friend of mine is looking for hardware to watch videos on his DS, and before I recommend something, I want to know if different hardware has significant differences in read speed (specifically, the decision is coming down between an M3 MicroSD slot-1 'simply', and the 4-gig G6 slot-2 flash device). I know the speed of the device is going to impose a limit on the fps/quality of the video; I read a review claiming the G6 couldn't get above 15 fps for videos in moonshell, does anyone have any experience that could confirm this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">R4 (same hardware as M3 DS Simply) runs my movies just fine. But then I don't use more than 15 fps so that I can use fullscreen and keep more video on a card. The animated cartoons that my little cousin likes to watch are drawn at 12 fps anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the difference depends on the SD card. Some SD cards can read information faster than others. In theory, a SLOT-2 card with RAM (such as M3 Perfect or G6) might be <span style="font-style: italic">faster</span> than because it can copy an entire chapter of a film into a 32 MB RAM buffer on the card, but I don't think MoonShell supports this.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Moonshell's site has a new entry that appears to be a review of the read speeds of various cards - <a href="http://mdxonline.dyndns.org/archives/2007/04/dectest5.shtml" target="_blank">http://mdxonline.dyndns.org/archives/2007/04/dectest5.shtml</a>

Unfortunately, the G6 doesn't appear to be on that list.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
