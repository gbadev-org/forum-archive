    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would there be any way to modify the gba control scheme on the ds?  Possibly through modifying the firmware or just through separate gba emulation?  I ask because it is almost like the super gameboy in how certain games are just uncomfortable to play with the a/b setup, and I would rather have it as y/b, just cuz its more comfortable.
<br/>
thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No way as of yet, you could with a firmware replace though, or just by simply switching it around physically inside the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I took that into consideration, until I came to my senses and realized I'd be destroying every ds game... so I think a firmware mod would probably be the best choice... darn, how hard could it be...? *expects rational answer*</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyways, I specifically remember there being a thread with directions in here that showed how to mod your DS so you could switch the keys around.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was acctually hoping there was a way to use the X &amp; Y as L &amp; R. In some games, I really wished that you didn't have to reach the top of the DS/GBA to hit some of the buttons (Street Fighter Alpha: 3, Chain of Memories, ect.)
<br/>
<br/>
Would that be even harder to configure?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, it doesn't make much sense at all to put X and Y on a seperate register only readable from the ARM7.  The only reason I can think of is that they were added at the last moment (figuratively speaking, since the last minute for hardware major hardware revisions was still probably 9 months to a year before release).  Otherwise, putting the X,Y, and /penirq lines in the KEYS register on both processors makes a bunch more sense (and can be disabled in GBA mode by a freaking OR gate on each one pulling them high).
<br/>
<br/>
However, it *is* fully a hardware issue, the firmware doesn't have anything to do with reading the keys (or just about anything else for that matter) during a game.  It doesn't provide networking features either, so changing it will *not* make existing nifi games magically Wifi capable either.
<br/>
<br/>
The BIOS boots and validates the card, then decrypts/decompresses the firmware, which then sets up a few things, re-validates the card more exhaustively, and almost completly erases itself from memory before your NDS code ever gets running (configuration info like the touch screen calibration is the *only* thing left in memory by the time your code is run).<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And on that note, I have to say, it's pretty amusing what people think can be done by modifying the firmware... hey, I should start a rumour that someone created a PSP emulator for the DS by modifying the DS firmware... ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
