    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all, I just got my MML through the door (nearly 7 weeks after ordering and complaints!) and im now ready for the homebrew scene :D
<br/>
<br/>
I have an old Magic Card 256m whats fine for now as homebrew is small in size but I need to convert a lot of files to gba.nds, done searches and read a fair bit of the ds forums but can't seem to find any information to where I can find the converting tools.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone able to help me out? I would be greatful.
<br/>
<br/>
*edit* I found tools that I need but it seems even though I can boot moonshell and use it well I just cant run nds homebrew / games, but my old flash card will hold me untill I get spare money for a supercard.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
there are only 2 ways to launch multiple .nds files from a flash cart, that i know of:
<br/>
1. if your flashcart menu supports it
<br/>
2. use darkain's multinds loader</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
