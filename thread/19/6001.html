<br/>
<br/>
I thought I would post here and most of the threads posts I've seen on other sites are all based on speculation and contridict eachother every other post. I would simply like to know what advantage if any does the release of the NeoFlash code give us normal flashcard users?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
