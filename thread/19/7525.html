    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've bricked my DS (bloody mario kart, but that's what I get for being so eager to play and not reading the news). Of course, it's fixable, since the new flashme can stomach the new nintendo wifi stuff -- all I have to do is reinstall flashme.
<br/>
<br/>
But I wish it were that simple. It seems that when I force flashme to run stuff from the GBA cart, it only boots up that bloody GBAMP menu, not the flashme installer. It doesn't matter if I name it _BOOT_MP.nds, it still does the same thing: boot from to the gbamp menu. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now what I'm wondering is this: is it even possible to do the flashme recovery with a gbamp?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Flashme works perfectly with the GBAMP.
<br/>
<br/>
To reflash a DS with a GBAMP, first apply Chishm's newest firmware to the movie player, using a GBA if you haven't already done so.
<br/>
Then use one of the boot menus which can load nds files, then load flashme.  When I did it, it took two attemps to load flashme for some strange reason.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I know someone said the recovery works on supercard (i think it was something like make sure flashme is the only file on the cart, then boot in recovery mode, and press A to load the first file - as the screens will be turned off)
<br/>
<br/>
However, i've never heard of anyone doing flashme RECOVERY from a gbamp. It may not be possible with chishm's current gbamp firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Did you recover it or just install flashme ?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y240/Laintsurge/Sigs/Sig8.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay... it seems like that's a good way to boot firmware: first boot a bootloader from the GBAMP menu, then boot the flashme.nds with it. However, I don't know of a bootloader in .nds.gba format. :/ I know for sure that it's booting the GBAMP menu in NDS mode: the bottom screen is working, and the top screen is white-screened.
<br/>
<br/>
I just need to get the sucker to boot an *.nds, which means I need a bootloader.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#61435 - chishm - Sun Nov 20, 2005 3:34 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First, just because the bottom screen is on, it doesn't mean it is in NDS mode. The only way to know if it is in NDS mode (by looking at the screens) is if both screens have stuff on them, or one of the screens is completely filled (ie no border). Having one white screen just means the NDS program that switched the DS to GBA mode didn't turn it off first. My firmware mod should have turned it off, so that may be a bug.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, once it is in GBA mode, there is no going back. There is no way to access the NDS features from GBA mode, and therefore no way of telling it to switch.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have never tried a recovery via GBAMP, since I've never had to.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Sorry about the tone of this post, I have just re-read it and realised that it comes off a little harsh. However, the points I made are still worth considering.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

After I played the Mario Kart, I can turn on my DS, but I only got 2 black screens.  I try many ways to reboot it(i.e. press "A+B+select+start"), but nothing changes.  I felt so upset about it, the only way is to seek some help in here.

Pleaseeeeeeeeeee give me some advise.  Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Below are the steps I did today:
<br/>
1. Download the new verion from the site <a href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/" target="_blank">http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/</a>
<br/>
2. Deleted all files in the CF card and save the flashme v5 in my CF card
<br/>
3. Boot DS with/without passme and press A+B+X+Y or A+B+Select+Start.
<br/>
<br/>
