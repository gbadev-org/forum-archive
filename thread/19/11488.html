    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've had someone testing for me, and neither the io_mmcf driver from moonshell + gba_nds_fat, nor the latest libfat will work on the Max Media Player. FAT_InitFiles always returns 0.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, what's even stranger, when using the gba_nds_fat, even though FAT_Initfiles returns 0, when I read out active_interface-&gt;ul_ioType, it gives me the value for M3CF, which is the first interface listed in disc_setGbaSlotInterface.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone successfully used gba_nds_fat or libfat on a max media player? I've had 2 or 3 people ask me to add support for it, but I can't figure a way to make it work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
