Is there anyone in ontario that currently has a passme that I can borrow to flash my DS?
<br/>

I'd cover for shipping if necessarry, and I'll return immediately after I finish flashing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's at least one person from Ontario that posted there already. PM him and anyone else.
