I'm afraid you do need a GBA, so if you don't have one you are probably out of luck.  If you do have one though, you should be able to get linkers from their website.  I'd think that an NDS WMB app would be possible (at least, I know PogoShell supports it's bankswitching in some way, and the guy who wrote Littlewriter obviously knows how to write to it so I'd think there must be info somewhere).<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
