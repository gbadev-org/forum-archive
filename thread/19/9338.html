If so, is it one of them better/safer to get than the other?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nope, just casing differencies. It may be noted that natrium42 designed the first PassMe.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Natrium makes a perfect fit in the topslot

<br/>
the others are commercial clones

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The one you have linked to as "natrium's" isn't his, it's by the M3 adapter people.
<br/>
If you read the board from DSPassme you'll see the words:
<br/>
"Passme V1.5 by Natrium42" written above the DS card slot pins.
<br/>
Because they are the ones natrium designed =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it is natrium's site. He just sells the m3 adapter because it's a good working product and it saves him time making the passme's himself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#80655 - Lynx - Mon Apr 24, 2006 4:19 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yup.. all is correct.  Natrium designed the PassMe I sell (dspassme.com) and for a time, I was selling Super PassKey's from Supercard because they were easier to resell then to build my own, but after PassMe2 came out, I went back to building them by hand..  Don't really know why.  Natrium is doing the same thing, he is purchasing M3 adapters clone of his PassMe and reprogramming it.
<br/>
<br/>
So, the only real difference as mentioned is the packaging.  Both have the same "innards" but the M3 version has a nice case around it.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh.. the other main difference between the M3 and PassMe (and other direct PassMe clones for that matter) is that it wraps around and the original DS game ends up underneith the NDS, where the PassMe sticks directly out the back.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
