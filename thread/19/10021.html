    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, so I am the owner of a passkey 2 and I have some questions.
<br/>
<br/>
One, I heard the Passkey 2 can break the DS cart slot. Is this true? How does it do it?
<br/>
<br/>
Two, I put two carts into my Passkey 2 and when I took them out the gold contacts had deep black lines on them... is this normal? Are my carts damaged? Will they eventually die?
<br/>
<br/>
Three, if I flash my lite will I lose anything (features) or are there any bugs? And can someone direct me to a VERY through guide beyond that monroe/video guide?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance, the second question is most important to me by the way. If I could get some answers to that atleast, that'd be great.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I suggest not flashing your Lite, as there have been rumors of sound volume decreasing, and WMB don't finish downloading anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
I have an EZPass 2 and my Ping Pals cartridge has experienced the same. But then again it's Ping Pals, so it doesn't really matter what kind of damage it sustains.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
