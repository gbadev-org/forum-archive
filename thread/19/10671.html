    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys,
<br/>
<br/>
I do own a Supercard miniSD, and theres that application listed in the Supercard menu which is calles "minisd".....if I start it the GBA Bootup-sequence comes up, and the top screen turns yellow after that.......thats about it........
<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering what that is, and if anyone has ever heard of that "bug" ?! I checked my miniSD card in windows for any hidden folders or something, but there seems to be nothing...
<br/>
<br/>
I also tried to reformat my miniSD card, and even with the blank card in there it displays "minisd"....thats just weird. (sc firmware 1.63, that didnt help anything either)
<br/>
<br/>
help would be appreciated
<br/>
bye guys
<br/>
cube

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it's probally in there because one, its an app software and since your putting the minisd into the card that probally comes up so it makes it just to let you know or something that it's inserted or something. Personally, I don't own a minisd, this is my guess.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hm, it's probally just the minisd software that's displayed in it, try adding more apps to your minisd and see if it goes away or something</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The only time I've seen that is when I run GBA games, if you reset the DS quickly you can see the game you just had at the top of the list because it's still in RAM and if you select it it reruns the game (from the beginning) without having to load it into RAM again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
