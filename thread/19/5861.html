Nintendo has released several demos for Nintendo DS Download Play. Some of these were packet-captured by people with laptop computers and pieced together into ROM files: <ul><li><a class="postlink" href="http://www.akkit.org/DS/E3/" target="_blank">Demos released at E3 2005</a> </li><li>More coming soon </li></ul>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Playing Demos</span>
<br/>
Yes, you can play the .ds.gba version with PassMe (or FlashMe) and a compatible GBA flash card (not GBA Movie Player or SuperCard).
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you can play the individual .nds demos with <a class="postlink" href="http://users.belgacom.net/bn967347/" target="_blank">WiFiMe</a> if you have a Ralink PCI or PCMCIA card listed on <a class="postlink" href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">this page</a>. No, USB adapters don't count. No, you do not need to flash the firmware or use a GBA flash cart because the demos carry a valid digital signature from Nintendo.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you should keep your E3 demo discussions to this sticky topic, or they'll go down the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.phrekwenci.com/roadofloq.jpg" target="_blank">Road of LoQ</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Well, I think the Zelda Movie must be out there, judging by the pic on Firefly's webiste.  As for capturing them, you need a computer with the compatible wifi card of course, but for the required software you'd need to talk to FireFly.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, you can play the individual .nds demos with WiFiMe if you have a Ralink PCI or PCMCIA card listed on this page. 
<br/>
<br/>
Does this mean that with a compatible card, a DS and nothing else (i.e. I do not need a gba flash card) I can play these demos?  I just bought a compatible card and have been trying to get it to work, but so far I am unsuccesful.  I just want to know if I am trying in vain (because I do not have a gba flash card) or if it will work.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, if you have a compatible card, the drivers installed, and the DS you can play the individual demo's using Download play. You won't be able to use the 'all-in-one' loader (if there is such a thing yet) as that would be an unsigned homebrew app which can't be downloaded via Download Play.

What problem are you having?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#44386 - cuavsfan - Wed Jun 01, 2005 4:13 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks a lot for your help.  I thought that I should be able to, and hopefully I can get it to work.  Here is my exact problem:
<br/>
<br/>
If I use version 1.1 of wmb.exe it appears to work (it goes through the 10%, 20%...), except that where I think it should say "now booting Polarium" (or whatever) it just says "sending multiboot beacons".  After it finishes my DS says nintendo on the top screen then both go blank (white).  I think I may just be doing the targeting of the demo (the nds file) wrong, but I can't figure out what to do with it.
<br/>
<br/>
If I try to use version 1.3 or 1.4 the dos window pops up for a fraction of a second and immediately dissapears.  I tried setting the path in the registry (I thought that this was the problem), but I couldn't get it to work either.
<br/>
<br/>
I also tried using the wmbfront with each of these but that didn't work either.
<br/>
<br/>
I bet I am just doing something simple wrong, but I cannot figure out what it is.  Thanks again for the help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#44387 - sLax0r - Wed Jun 01, 2005 4:58 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">cuavsfan, if you're getting to the point of "%10, %20, etc." you should be doing every thing right... Let me just give the steps I go through, it kind of sounds like what you've been trying, but maybe you left something out.
<br/>
<br/>
First, open the command prompt (go to run, type "CMD"). Change directories to the one with the WMB application (using a command somehting like "cd c:\wmb"), I use version 1.4 of WMB. Once in the folder (in the command prompt) with wmb.exe, type "wmb.exe -data" leave a space at the end, drag and drop your .nds file into the command prompt window, and hit enter (so it should look something like "wmb.exe -data "C:\NDS Demos\polarium_demo_usa.nds"").  Now you should see this at the command prompt:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Nintendo DS - Wireless Multiboot Application - Version 1.4 BETA 1
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Device Description = Ralink RT2560 Device
<br/>
Device Hardware ID = PCI\VEN_1814&amp;DEV_0201&amp;SUBSYS_0B541432&amp;REV_01
<br/>
Device Location    = PCI bus 2, device 11, function 0
<br/>
Driver Version     = 1.0.0.7
<br/>
<br/>
Loading "polarium_demo_usa.nds"... ok
<br/>
<br/>
Press [x] to abort
<br/>
<br/>
Sending multiboot beacons &amp; waiting for authentication
<br/>
</span>
<br/>
At this point go into download play on your ds, you should see the demo listed. Click on the demo, hit yes when asked if you want to download it, and then on the command prompt you should see this:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Received authentication
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Received de-authentication
<br/>
</span>
<br/>
After this your game should load on your ds. If all this worked and your game still dosn't run, I'd make sure the game isn't corrupt or anything, try another demo and see if it works. I think that's all, it sounds like you already tried most of that, but maybe just try it my way one more time. Good luck.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wasn't loading the particular .nds file the right way, so that is why it didn't work.  Doing it the way you said with dragging the file works great though!

I've searched for hours but couldn't find them.

I'm pretty sure they(or Guru Guru at least) are avaiable for download at some japanese site(since it was downloadable at japanese download-stations)....so anyone can read and write japanese and start a search?

Ah, it's available.  I haven't even seen the download version yet. :)
<br/>
<br/>
*edit*
<br/>
Differences between this and the NDS card version, for those who are interested.
<br/>
<br/>
-Audio and Video (especially) are of lower quality than the NDS card version, although really not bad for the filesize.
<br/>
<br/>
-The opening screen is totally different, the Guidebook button is not there, and it doesn't say Video Trailer Volume 1 or whatever under the Twilight Princess logo...I've been told the non-beta version is the same in this respect to the NDS card version.
<br/>
<br/>
-Instead of the Nintendo Logo at the bottom screen, a "Stop" button is displayed, and the video will dump you back onto the title screen instead of looping.
<br/>
<br/>
-Also, instead of just the music, there are sound effects in a few of the parts...most noticeably when Wolf Link and the mysterious twilight creature burst out of their cage, when the little things there are chewing on Link, and when Link attacks the shadow beasts with his charging attack, and in the battle scene with the arrows (you hear the horn also).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, instead of freezing on the picture of that girl, there are some additonal scenes played after that, including Link charging to a climatic finish down a narrow stone bridge at the monster with the big horn seen earlier. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On page 3 of this thread there is a list of all official downloadplay demos we know of, that are confirmed. All but one are got.
<br/>
Breaking news, you can sign/verify files for download play with custom/private key. The software isn't yet released but is shown on a preview image on the WMB site homepage.
<br/>
Firefly apparently has some Mario Kart DS demo, as seen in a previous homepage picture.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds like that Nintendo exec was giving a flat, standard answer concerning game piracy that shouldn't pertain to the wireless demos. There is definitely not enough gamplay in the wireless demos to allow someone to have enough of a game to be happy with it. You could argue that there's much more gameplay shown than the standard PC game demo that's released publicly on the Internet, i.e. Battlefield2 or HL2 demos. I have no doubt that sharing of the wifi demos will totally help Nintendo boost sales, both through building hype and introducing more consumers to these new games.
<br/>
<br/>
The rest of what Perrin Kaplan says kind of supports the notion that wireless demo sharing is good for Nintendo:

I believe that Nintendo's anticipated use case was that only a player who has bought an authentic Nintendo DS Game Card containing a Wi-Fi demo can send the demo to other players.

AmiKai does a much better machine translation of Japanese to english.

According to the AmiKai translation, it's not a game. You're supposed to have a Pokemon GBA cart in your DS, then load the software onto your DS with Wireless multiboot. Then you close your DS, and goto the Pokemon movie. After the movie is over, you can open your DS, and Meowth should be on your DS, and I'm assuming you get the Pokemon in your game or something. It's quite clear from the translation that it isn't a game though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You should remove that demo, it was not captured by me, but rather extracted from the full version rom by some lame ass group. That same lame ass group also likes to repack the demos either captured or re-assembled by me. Maybe I should no longer release any more demos, and keep them to myself.

I believe it was thought you did it due to, according to my memory, one of your original preview images for the RSA Program had a file by that name. Or something like that.

Oh, one more question. A bit off topic:

How do you get the images like this from download play (not the icon, the whole thing): <a href="http://users.belgacom.net/bn967347/nds/pokepark_fishing_rally_ds_demo_jap.png" target="_blank">http://users.belgacom.net/bn967347/nds/pokepark_fishing_rally_ds_demo_jap.png</a>

Captured the DS itself? Through a program emulating the look? Just a bit curious.

Yes, that filename may have been used in an old screenshot to prevent linking of the shown hash to a specific demo. However, something like that does not necessarily mean that the demo actually exists. Anyone can make up filenames and maybe even DS Download Play banners.

Because I say so, and because the person who captured it does not want it to be released. Someone else will have to go there (Japan/PokePark) to capture the demo before the park closes, on 2005/09/25.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Heh, I guess what I'm saying is if a demo is going to be released somewhere it'll be released, bugging the man about it probably isn't going to change a thing.  If I were him I'd be a bit tired of people nagging me about demos.  This might not be anyone's intention, but I dunno...that's kinda how it sounds to me.

<a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=6523" target="_blank">WMB server</a> can do  almost what you need: it runs minimised and reload WMB automatically so you don't have to restart the app (run it once and let it alone). The only bad point is that you can't have two DS downloading at the same time (a WMB problem).

Back on the topic, I'm aware that the Nintendogs DL is not a demo, but is there a possibility to have the"gift" available for Nintendogs owners? there is a new event in the US at the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.nintendo.com/eventdetail?page=comingEvents&amp;eventid=b74627d6-efb9-4ad9-b058-ee7ce64ee3b9" target="_blank">Simon Mall</a>, if that "gift" has not been catched yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I would bet you're right...now that I've actually played the game, I would bet it's something akin to the game's "Bark Mode" where it searches for a signal sent out by other Nintendog games that are in Bark Mode and basically if it finds one the two player's dogs can visit, exchange a gift, and also if they recorded one a small voice message.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd bet it was something like that...a visit from Utada Hikaru's dog, with a gift and a short voice message from the singer herself.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Neither works because additional data is sent after the .srl is initialized. Specifically, the level data and the character data.

But I can bet that at least one of these "WMB stubs" isn't going to check the size and digital signature of the data it receives. As I've been saying for months, I see a hole for some sort of WiFiMe2 as soon as someone disassembles one of these WMB stubs.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Actually, with an appropriate emulator, NES Lemmings can be made touch-sensitive. See the discussion about item 6 on <a class="postlink" href="http://boards.pocketheaven.com/viewtopic.php?t=3023" target="_blank">this list</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
As for "WiFiMe2" or "ItsaMe", it wouldn't be a virtual PassMe at all; it'd be a virtual WMB. A lot of DS Download Play programs (such as single-card multiplayer games and the newer demos you're talking about) load additional data from the master; if we can buffer-overflow that additional data, we're running user code.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Check out the URL for the game list, it comes from the section of the site dealing strictly with their download kiosks.

There's the root if you needed it.

<br/>
EDIT: And reading the Gamespot article, it sounds like they are doing that expansion.  But the demos should still be downloadable.  A confirmation of this is the second option on the main menu of the site I linked.  However, you may have a point since it looks like only Mario Kart DS and the Dragon Quest slime game are shown on that page.  Still, two new demos!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Seconded. Also, if there is anyone with the domain knowledge and/or tools to help others be able to capture these demos, please point us in the right direction. Given the tools and information, I'd be happy to capture these demos if I can get to them. Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

we find out the demo's are RSA secured, and the download manager checks RSAs

No. It's much more complicated.
<br/>
<br/>
Packets are commonly missing in captured wireless transmission. Several transmissions of the same thing are usually required. Once you have everything, you need to isolate what data is the actual binary, and you need to get it back in the right order, since certian pieces may only be present in certian dumps.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And the fact that we need to assamble 2 different files makes it a bit more difficult, since unless I'm mistaken, it sends a menu, then sends the data needed (which supposedly isnt RSA signed, leaving our gap).

There were 8 demos in the vol 1. package (brain age, metroid movie, trueswing golf, tetris push, tetris normal, pokemon trozei, mario kart, meteos), so I dunno if there's a 16 demo max still, but I can confirm that only one person can download from the official station at a time.<br/>_________________<br/>-Unrequited</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

BIG Thank you to FireFly for helping me assemble these, we're working on the other two demos (Mario Kart DS &amp; Metroid Movie) right now. Hopefully they'll be up later today. The loader gets compressed versions of the demos, which the loader decompresses, and then runs. After FireFly got the decompresser isolated, it was just a matter of getting a full capture of the demo, which I had and him having to piece it together. I'm on a business trip the rest of the week, but afterwhich, if nobody's gotten the other 5 demos, then I'll be more than happy to go back to NYC or a Best Buy and get the rest for FireFly to reassemble.

Since i live in a country where we don't have official nintendo ds support, i can't even rent the games to find out how they are (or borrow). Because of you, i can try brain age now.

Hope you can get the other demos (as i doubt anybody else will).

im sure people would try to help you with this problem,
<br/>
but the ds lite was only released in japan, and this is an english speaking forum, so that lowers your chances of other people having a ds lite,
<br/>
also the ds lite's firmware has not been dumped (to my knowlege)
<br/>
*edit*(turns out it was dumped :P)
<br/>
so nobody is sure(yet) if they are the same firmware
<br/>
<br/>
so just open a new topic and maybe people with ds lite's can try to help you :P

Loopy/Olimar's had the firmware for quite awhile, so it's definitely been dumped.  As far as how similar the firmware is, I wouldn't know.  I mean, it looks pretty similar except for the ability to change the light brightness, just from looking at it booting up.

Awesome!  I just tried a couple and they worked fine, so hopefully I won't have problems with the rest... thanks for posting them here... (Tried them all - they all work)...
<br/>
<br/>
For some reason Brain Age and True Swing Golf show up as ? instead of a logo and the name is just Nintendo DS... Since the Brain Age appears to be just the same one that is on the akkit site (and that one has a logo and name) I'll just use that... Does the Golf demo show up without a logo / name for everybody else?  Not a big issue (the demo still works), just a small cosmetic one...
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Just to be clear I mean that when using WMBFront the logo does not show up in the program, or from the list of possible downloads on the DS...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here, in our european version of Brain training (as in american version I presume), we do have a Sudoku included. The manual says that somewhere in the future, we might be able to download new grids from download stations. Considering the fact that we have yet to see one standard "demo transmitter" version in France, that those stations need to be "updated" (an actual DS locked in a chest with a demo cart, we won't ever see the beta version one -download -at -a -time -please -there -is -only -one -ralink -card -in -the -box), that I'm assuming there is no station of this kind in Japan (they don't have the game anyway), and that, considering the previous bracket, we have to count only on Nintendo of Europe and Nintendo of america to develop and distribute it...
<br/>
<br/>
Do you think we will ever have new puzzles to solve in Europe?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=15328" target="_blank">working</a> on a open-source assembler to assemble WMB captures, such as demos from Nintendo Channel. Filb is giving me captures for assembly and such, to do this. However: As these captures are Filb's, it's his decision, not mine, on whether or not to release the assembled demos.
<br/>
<br/>
Why make another assembler, you might ask? Firefly left the scene, apparently, and stopped assembling captures sent to him. There was another old assembler, but it doesn't work very well. So the only thing to do was to write my own assembler.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
Filb's captures will not be publicly re-released. Most of them are Japanese, and the English demos are demos that were already released. If the Nintendo Channel Internet encryption, AES key generation and ect is broken, I'm planning on writing a Nintendo Channel client, which will allow you to download the demos from the server, to your PC or DS. This can also be used to archive the demos and re-distribute them on our on server.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by yellowstar on Tue Sep 09, 2008 11:14 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I had the time to add this, I would have added this in the previous post, but since not... It's important, so...
<br/>
<br/>
The last version of wmb_asm that was release is very outdated. Many bugs has been fixed since then, many/several(?) features were added since then, in my private version. Captures can be obtained by digging through that topic, and the topic in which Filb asked about an assembler to assemble captures. Some captures may not work with WMB/Download Play, due to invalid RSA-signature. If they don't work at all on a homebrew card, don't complain, that version is way outdated. That was fixed in my version a good while ago. If you know what you're doing, that's easily fixed. Here's the problem: Sometimes, some fields in the header needs fixed. These fields aren't changed in the second header which is sent in WMB. However, my tool had a bug. The changed checksums were put in the second header, which cause the RSA-invalidation. All that needs fixed in the output .nds, is that a tool would need to calculate the checksums for the second header, and write checksums in the second header.
<br/>
<br/>
Even with such at tool, there's still a possibility that the .nds still won't work on anything. If that happens, all you can do is wait for the next release of wmb_asm.
<br/>
<br/>

No homebrewer, AFAIK, is sharing demos Nintendo Channel demos on a server.(I mean not just a few, all/most of the demos captured)

One reason may be because just storing one years worth of demos would be ~312 MB, uncompressed .nds, estimating 3 new demos every week, 2 MB per .nds estimate. Compression wouldn't help much. No-one really wants to serve such a massive archive. Nintendo has such an archive. Though the client in-store <a class="postlink" href="http://code.google.com/p/wmb-asm/wiki/DSStation" target="_blank">DS Stations</a> are only available in UK/Japan, and breaking the protocol is difficult - it using Ethernet, not Wifi, and the card doesn't even store the DS Station client software, the firmware is the DS Station client software.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That will work, but what might work better in some cases is Hypernet. But of course Hypernet is not even invented yet!
<br/>
<br/>
One day I will invent Hypernet. Hypernet is completely encrypted and nobody
<br/>
can spy on you with it. Hypernet is completely decentralized, even more
<br/>
decentralized than Internet! Hypernet packets can be transferred by Internet
<br/>
and Tor, as well as other methods. You can store Hypernet packets on a DVD
<br/>
that contains movies or software you purchased. You can write Hypernet packets
<br/>
in barcodes inside of a book. You can do Hypernet over telephone. Radio
<br/>
stations should broadcast Hypernet packets whenever there is no shows on at
<br/>
that time of day. Computers at public places (or private), when reading a USB
<br/>
file system device containing Hypernet packets, can update its own copy and
<br/>
then put its own pending Hypernet packets on the USB. Hypernet is COMPLETELY
<br/>
UNBLOCKABLE NO MATTER WHAT. Nobody is allowed to patent Hypernet, not even
<br/>
myself. Your computers can store any hypernet files you want to, old or new
<br/>
files, any size, without necessarily knowing what it is. Hypernet
<br/>
specifications are free for any use (except patenting). Hypernet uses 2 basic
<br/>
protocols, file protocol (used to store files) and command protocol (used to
<br/>
send commands). Files can be mirrored anywhere. You can schedule interactive
<br/>
sessions over Hypernet (although the actual interactive session isn't over
<br/>
Hypernet). However, Hypernet may be slow.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
