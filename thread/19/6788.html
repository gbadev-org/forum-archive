    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, ive seen the m3u adapter and the 6G Flash Cart and I have some questions.
<br/>
<br/>
I am leaning towards the 6G Flash Cart because it doesn't stick out as much as the m3u and I'm not into buying SD cards anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
1)Are these two products alike when it comes to software? (aside from the cards that m3u uses) They both have all of the built in emulators, music and movie software, gba rom function, etc. right?
<br/>
<br/>
2)If I buy the NDS version of 6G, do I still need a PassMe to use DS's functions?(stereo sound, touch, etc.)
<br/>
<br/>
3)If I put music on my ds, is the quality comparable to your typical music player? (GBA had mono and weak bass)
<br/>
<br/>
4)Can I play GBA roms at full speed and sound like on my old flash cart?
<br/>
<br/>
5)Is the driver for the usb device easy to install? (EZFA was a pain in the @$$)
<br/>
<br/>
I guess that's it for now.. thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. I was just wondering about the answer to question 2
<br/>
I read on another site(GBATMW) that they will be releasing a firmware update on the "FULL NDS" game function of the M3 so that you can run commercial games without a Passkey(on the 20th of this month). Apparently, all you have to do is use Flashme. 
<br/>
<br/>
So If the M3 and the G6 use the same software, does that mean that the G6 can also use this update and not need a Passkey?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, he was asking if he could just use the FlashMe... and from what I've read it DOES work with a flashme</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
