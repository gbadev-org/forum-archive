    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering if I was the only one that was interested in doing this.  I tried searching on the web for information on this with Google, but I found nothing.  I know this is probably not the forum to post on for this matter, but since we are all DS passionates, I thought someone here could probably help me in my search.
<br/>
<br/>
So...  I would like to know if anyone painted his DS yet.  Or else, did anyone open the casing and removed the hardware?  Was it difficult to dissasemble and then put back together?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I actually painted my GBA Movie Player to match my DS scheme. Using a metallic silver and a glossy black for the back.
<br/>
<br/>
My father kept saying "use plastic paint! use plastic paint!" but..trust me, don't use plastic paint. It's too soft, it gauges easily on the plastic, and when it's hot out, the paint actually bonds to the CF card and/or Nintendo DS itself inside the slot. The metallic paint worked *GREAT* though, and matches perfectly with the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
When I paint my DS (I'm still looking for "Y" screw driver bits.. anyone know where to get one without having to import?) I'm planning on painting it all gold.. It'll definately be cool, but I'm having trouble taking the DS apart to even do so.
<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I'm sure there are others here who have done this.. It'd be neat if people started posting pictures of their customized DS's.. My warrenty went void as soon as my bar code "rubbed off".. I pulled the plastic protective film off the barcode and now it's a completely white lable. Oops.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Get a Torx screwdriver and take off three of the six prongs. Or just do what I do: use a standard (flat head) screwdriver.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, the standard flathead did the trick, for the few places that a triwing "Y" bit doesn't reach.  You will likely find one that works in a precision screwdriver set.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They let me trade in mine even though I did that.  They said that every DS had to be under warranty since it hadn't been a year since the release yet, so it didn't really matter if they could check your DS's specific information at this point.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I actually got my DS from EB Games, plus the year warrenty..I wonder if they'll accept it.. At any rate, maybe I can grab a new DS and paint that one..or something. I don't know. One thing's for sure, my DS warrenty is only good 'till November or December...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, let's get back on topic.
<br/>
<br/>
What colours would people customize their DS to?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
A) The paint rubbed off on one of the "corners" of my DS.
<br/>
B) A shop near my house has painted DS on display.  I may not be able to get around to it, but does anyone want pictures?  One was made to look like a cell phone.
