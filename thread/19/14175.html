Too bad.
<br/>
1) The newest FWNitro is actually 1.6c
<br/>
2) FWNitro was made before the M3 Simply came out, so it doesn't know to work with it.
<br/>
3) If you got it for the dumper, it only works on CF-Based Slot-2 Devices.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just recommend GBAMP, it's cheap, only $20 or so, and it's the most versatile (well, apart from maybe SC CF or M3CF because of RAM)  slot 2 card out there.  However, it's hard to find since production stopped.  You could also take apart your DS and another DS to reflash, or you could use PPFlash and flash your (opened case, soldered wires) DS using a parallel port, but that's also hard.  You might be able to WiFi another firmware, but I don't know if FWNitro has WiFi (I stick with normal FW).<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Using one DS to flash another, from what I hear, means opening both and swapping the socketed chips. They're only socketed on DS Lite though, on older DSes you'd need to do some soldering. Switching the mainboards may be easier.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think that works for slot-1, and anyway, if it could boot his card he could just boot it like a normal game.
<br/>
<br/>
Not that it helps, but my guess as to why it doesn't work is it uses ARM9 to load binaries from the card, not checking whether the ARM7 destination is in main RAM or not. Some cards, like ARDS, put it in the small region that only ARM7 can access.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
