Nintendo will be joining us at Download this year, hosting its own dedicated Nintendo DS tent. The tent will offer festival goers the chance to take a break from the music, play the latest and hottest Nintendo DS games, and get on stage to challenge other people with their best jokes in a comedy talent search.
<br/>
<br/>
The Nintendo DS is the innovative new touch screen handheld from Nintendo. With fantastic 3D graphics and a stack of innovative new features, the Nintendo DS offers the cutting edge in portable gaming. The sleek, stylish design of the DS with its selection of awesome new titles is sure to impress.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo DS games you can play at Download include: Ridge Racer DS (Nintendo), PacPix (Nintendo), Need for Speed Underground 2 (Electronic Arts), Goldeneye: Rogue Agent (Electronic Arts) and Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory (Ubisoft).

well, personally I fail to see why they'd be at a *download* festival without downloadable demos, especially when it's one of their major USPs. OK it's not clear from the information given but there's certainly an implication.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
FYI I wasn't attempting to be an asshole and, being honest, if you don't have anything better to do than flame people for your interpretation of their posts then don't bother.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
