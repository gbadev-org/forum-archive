It's for when a program doesn't start and you just get 2 black screens.
<br/>
It stops the RAM in the G6 from being wiped when you reboot the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
2 black screens -&gt; press and hold button -&gt; turn off ds -&gt; turn on ds -&gt; release button.
<br/>
<br/>
Homebrew can avoid the need to use this button by setting POWER_CR to turn the screens on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
