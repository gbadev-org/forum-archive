You do mean set up a connection to act as a Passme, right?

Hey, there's probably a bunch of people that would find this sort of information useful.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help so far :)
<br/>
<br/>
I'll probably get a USB thing... Don't feel like openning my computer... Too much effort to pull that cover off my case...<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Ebuyer 802.11b Wireless LAN USB is a highly efficient design mechanism to provide unbeatable performance achieving data rate up to 11Mbps for 802.11b with wide range coverage. Based on the 2.4GHz Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) technology, the product comply to the IEEE 802.11b standard and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
<br/>
<br/>
Works well between 2 pc's one upstairs and one in my cellar.
<br/>
<br/>
Should work eventually with the DS but I doubt they will work on wifime at the moment.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll test it anyway :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If it's USB it's not going to work.  If it's 802.11b, then it isn't the RT25x0 chipset.  Either way, it won't work and most likely never will with WiFiMe.
