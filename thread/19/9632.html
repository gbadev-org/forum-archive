<br/>
A mini-SD card uses less power than an SD card, but is it noticable? And is worth the price difference? mini-SD is still more expensive than SD</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes I have read that also, but my real quesiton isn't really about M3 vs Supercard, because im sure the normal SD versions, the M3 uses less.
<br/>
<br/>
But do the mini SD versions use less than there SD counterparts?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
