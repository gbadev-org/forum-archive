    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys,
<br/>
<br/>
I just got my Supercard miniSD, and theres that application listed in the Supercard menu which is calles "minisd".....if I start it the GBA Bootup-sequence comes up, and the top screen turns yellow after that.......thats about it........
<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering what in the world that is, and how to remove it from the menu?! I checked my miniSD card in windows for any hidden folders or something, but theres nothing...
<br/>
<br/>
help would be appreciated
<br/>
bye guys

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just "minisd"? Not minisd.bin? I don't have a SC miniSD, so I don't know if it's normal or not, but did you try reformatting your card?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, I actually never reformatted my card again, but I might give it a try...................but I don't think thats gonna help anything, since theres no (hidden) files on the memorystick I found.....<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">...bla?</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On FAT formatted file systems, there are no really hidden files... the "hidden" flag is just a little protection against n00bs, most programs don't really give an f*** (except for an option not to display these files or a warning on deletion). However, it could be that the filesystem is corrupted and the SC misinterprets something. Thus, reformatting.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.uglyhorst.de/blog/nerdpunk/" target="_blank">visit my blog. please.</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, I tried it. Before putting my stuff back on the minisd-card I inserted it into the supercard, and "minisd" was still there in the menu....
<br/>
<br/>
I just don't get what that is.....does anybody else have a Supercard miniSD + Sandisk 1GB miniSD card here?!
