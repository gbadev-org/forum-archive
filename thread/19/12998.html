    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I want to get into the Homebrew scene because some of the awesome stuff I've been seeing pop up (like DSLinux, DSDoom, and of course all the older GBA apps and system emulators).
<br/>
<br/>
I've been reading up on various methods on how to get homebrew stuff to work, and the thing that looks most appealing to me is NoPass since it doesn't require changing anything with your DS. I was thinking about Datel's MML at first but from the looks of it, it takes close to a full month to get things from their shop. I decided to go with Superkey since you can get it bundled with Supercards making the overall package very cheap. That leads me to using Supercard. I found that I would probably like the Supercard Lite the best since I have a DS Lite, so the cart will fit nicely in there. Also the 32MB of ram in it would be nice to speed things up a bit (I assume) and the fact that it uses Micro SD is a nice since Micro SD cards are relatively cheap and I can just use an SD expansion slot to move files from my PC onto the Micro SD card.
<br/>
<br/>
So really what I'm wondering is if anyone else uses the SuperCard Lite / SuperKey method of running homebrew, and how well it works. I know of a store that has the package for 62 dollars, so what I'm looking for is some testimonials before I order it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's a fairly good combo as long as you make sure you don't get the Rumble series that has no RAM.  The RAM itself is mostly only used for GBA compatibility, though some DS apps make use of it.  I'd go for it for the simple fact that DSLinux is about to get graphical Links working (web browser with graphics), which will require a RAM build. 
<br/>
<br/>
I personally use a Supercard miniSD with a flashed DS (was Superkey previously) and I've been happy with it.  I do have to use the Supercard patcher on some GBA homebrew before it will work, but DS homebrew works fine out of the box, though some homebrew may require DLDI patching anyway.  Aside from that, I haven't had any major issues with the card.  It works very well for both GBA and DS homebrew.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I also have a miniSD version, and can confirm everything dantheman said. If you can't get something to work, you can usually just ask in the forum for a solution. The only thing I can think of that doesn't work with SC SD solutions is hereticDS, because it uses an old fat lib and isn't updated anymore.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't have one myself to test though, so this is just based on what I've heard from others.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I really would have gone for the SC Lite if it weren't for it not being available at the time I bought my SC miniSD.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got a Supercard miniSD (amongst other things) and it works fine (although it's recently stopped reading my SD card!).

But anyway I thought I'd add that some of my testers have problems making save games with the Supercard in Quake. The files just come out corrupt and I don't know why...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For the purpose of giving the benefit of the doubt while enforcing the forum rules against discussion of piracy, I'll restrict your question to the following use case:
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>Nintendo DS Browser (aka "Opera") comes out in North America this June. </li><li>User buys the Opera Game Card and included Expansion Pak. </li><li>User wants to carry NoPass, Opera, and SuperCard instead of NoPass, Opera, SuperCard, and Expansion Pak. </li></ol>
<br/>
This isn't possible out of the box, but homebrew might make it possible. There might be a Nitro Hax code to treat the SuperCard as an Expansion Pak.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Yeah sorry, I wasn't trying to get information on any kind of piracy related stuff. I was just wondering if thats how it could work because I'm lazy and was hoping if it was an option, I would be able to just leave the supercard in slot2 forever and not have to switch components around. But cool, it sounds like homebrew could make it possible.
<br/>
<br/>
But if thats never an option, I might be more interested in slot1 passkeys like R4DS or M3 Simply. But is it true with those devices that theres a risk of stripping the slot1 eject mechanism that makes it so regular DS games don't "socket" in there anymore and just slide out?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
