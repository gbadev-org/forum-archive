    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's a _very_ slim chance you might be able to recover from it.  Try to install flashme again, but this time holding A+B+Start+Select while you turn on your DS.
<br/>
<br/>
If that doesn't help, you probably need to use ppflash.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are enough instructions around. And every FlashME tutorial says DON'T FREAK OUT and TURN YOUR DS OFF.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
