<br/>
<br/>
This afternoon I finally got my wireless network card, so I got started on flashing my firmware..
<br/>
While flashing my son came to me and smashed his little finger on the power off button.. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br/>
<br/>
The DS won't boot up anymore. I just get a black screen.
<br/>
I read on Darkfader.net that you can restore the firmware, but you have to do some soldering. Is there anybody out there with suggestions?
<br/>
<br/>
please help me. I'm at my wits' end.

<br/>
FlashMe has a failsafe included. If the first dunno how many bytes were written you can fix your FlashMe via a gba cartridge with FlashMe on it.

i think it has to be more then 1% for the failsafe settings to work.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I loaded my FlashAdvance 128M Turbo with flashme.nds and booted the NDS while holding A+B+SELECT+START. WHOA! I get a white bottom screen! That's at least something.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing it doesn't continue is because the FA 128M never really liked being in my NDS and always stalled on me (It was fine in a GBA).
<br/>
<br/>
So, what do I need now? Someone who can help me out with a good Flash card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay here's a little update.
<br/>
<br/>
Apparently yesterday very, very late.. while trying the ppflash util from Darkfader, my DS died due to a short. This morning I found out that the fuse (yes there is one) was blown out at the battery side, so first thing I did was restoring it (read: used a tiny piece of wire).
<br/>
GREAT! the DS has power again!
<br/>
<br/>
Now, on to the flashing...
<br/>
<br/>
I did everything mentioned here, but still to no avail.
<br/>
I still get a white bottom screen if I use A+B+SELECT+START while booting and a FlashAdvance card is inserted. However, I tried the original flashme.nds and the one I modified with ndsloader.bin (Let's call that one flashme_binned.nds)
<br/>
<br/>
Results:
<br/>
Original: The screen is white and slowly there are vertical colored lines appearing.
<br/>
<br/>
Binned: The screen is white and stays white.
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have a new DS and to make sure the flashme on the FA card is correct, just try it in the new one.

So I did.. And now I finally know that all my BrickDS is good for, is to throw through a window :(
