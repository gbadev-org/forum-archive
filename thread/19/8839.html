    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. I received a brand new M3 yesterday, but it doesn't work :(
<br/>
After some tests I think the cause might be a compatibility issue with the CF used (Fujitsu 128mb, don't have it here so cannot post serial number):
<br/>
<br/>
-No CF card inserted: DS boots up, select GBA game, I get the "no CF card inserted" warning, and after pressing A, it freezes (dunno if this behaviour is correct, please someone confirm if M3 menu can boot if no CF card inserted)
<br/>
<br/>
-CF card inserted: The M3 can read a firmware update and apply it. If no files present (or if I skip the update process) if freezes again.
<br/>
<br/>
-Passme works: DS Firmware V1, worked using Darkain's loader and a EZ Flash II.
<br/>
<br/>
-If i use the passme, I get the same results than without using it, except in these cases the DS freezes in the M3 safety warning ("this product is not licensed...").
<br/>
<br/>
My questions:
<br/>
<br/>
- Can I boot the M3 menu without a CF card?
<br/>
- The M3 can read the CF card, because it could update its firmware; but can still the CF be incompatible anyway? (cannot boot M3 menu)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading :)

Your CF card is probably only partially compatible, only enough for the update to work.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tepples, I tried FAT and FAT32; in both modes the firmware update was detected, but no luck with M3 menu.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I bought today a MemoryCorp (?) 1Gb CF and it works; so I guess it is possible for a card to be partially compatible, though.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help,
