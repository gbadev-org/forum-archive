    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have an unmodified DS and recently purchased a wireless network card, my goal being to play the e3 demos and such. 
<br/>
I am at the point where (I believe) the only thing i need to do is load the demos with wmb, but whenever i try to, I get the error message "could not load 'header.bin'" 
<br/>
Being completely new to this, I have no idea what this means. Would it be at all possible that this is an issue relating to my wireless card? In any case, help would be appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
fake edit: here is a image of what I am doing, and the resulting error message; perhaps I'm just being a moron and mistyping something,  I don't know. <a class="postlink" href="http://img111.imageshack.us/img111/2198/ohgod3os.jpg" target="_blank">http://img111.imageshack.us/img111/2198/ohgod3os.jpg</a> (linked for size)

<br/>
Again, I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, but I couldn't find anything to help me out anywhere else :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You would get the same error if it can't find the file.  Try without the full path, just type WMB -data electroplankton.nds (it will look in the data folder)
<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively use a frontend <a href="http://headkaze.webpal.info/" target="_blank">http://headkaze.webpal.info/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Also one of the first things you should do after installing windows, untick "hide extensions for known file types" in "my computer"/tools/folder options/view.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In your explorer window the file's called electroplankton and not electroplankton.nds. Or is it because you don't show file endings? (But it's not a recognized file with icon and something like that so there is maybe really the .nds missing)<br/>_________________<br/>The future of gaming is mobile Handheld Gaming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, I'm not sure what did it, but everything works perfectly now! I just did everything you guys mentioned. However, after I unchecked the "hide extensions for known file types" box, the nds files stopped being recognized as .nds files, so i just had to type ".nds" onto the end of the file name. i used wmb front as well. Thanks again for all your help, and i hope this thread can help anyone else with the same problem as me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
