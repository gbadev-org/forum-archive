anyway a DS flashcart would be handy for a full resolution DS movie player (theres a third version of the GBA player coming out and a patch for v2 that will have DS additions) or most emulators.

 4megs of RAM would only be a problem for a few SNES games, the GP32 seems to do ok with this much

<br/>
Actually, it's not held in very tight at all.. But, that's adjustable.  If you want a better "grip" just bend the PCI pins down more.  As for scratching the cart.. it's not any harder on the cart then the DS slot.
<br/>
<br/>
The PCI pins are shaped something like this:
<br/>
<br/>
__/^^\/
<br/>
<br/>
NoComply, that might be possible as the current PCB design contained space for parts that later were decided they weren't needed in this model.  So, if the PCB had the LEDs and space for the Xtal removed, it could be almost an inch shorter.  But, the original cart will always have to stick out the back (not enough room for a PCB and DS cart) so it could only be shortened about 1/2 inch maybe?
<br/>
<br/>
If your looking at the picture of the back, where you can clearly read the PassMe name and Metroid Cart, the cart is about 1/4 inch under the PCB.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I  didn't mean bend the pcb, just the wires connecting to the ds cart, but I guess the passme doesn't stick out as far as the length of a ds cart so the amount you would save from doing that would not really be worth it unless the cart went under the ds.  So basically pointless</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
But, for those of us that can't wait for that, I do plan on making them and selling them.. But, the current ones will be exactly like the ones in the pictures minus the LEDs (as they serve no real purpose, but were very helpfull in troubleshooting).

<br/>
I'm planning on selling them for around $20 + sh.. Not to make money, but to get as many out there as possible so people can start coding!  :D

For those that want to do it themselves, I am working on a step by step how to that I was hoping to have something available today.. but after working on it pretty much all day.. it's going to take the weekend..

It changes the code start point, which would work on any game, but it then also has to update the checksum.  It depends on whether it sets the checksum to a certain value or actually finds the new checksum and uses it.

Actually, that may not be true.  Because my POS EZF-Advance III had a simular (or this) issue, Natrium42 fixed the jump to bypass the header that it was messing up.  So, if it works with the EZF-Advance III, I'd guess it will work with pretty much any!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I suppose someone needs to get started on a DS 'launcher' type application?  Because it would make things a lot easier if it was possible to store multiple apps on a flash cart at once.  You could simply combine all of the ROMs with the launcher and write the one file to the cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, a while ago I started planning a launcher interface.  Here's what I had, in case anyone's interested:
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I haven't done any coding for it yet, all I have is this one interface image.  The rectangles on the left would contain the game title/icon (read from the game headers) and the arrows on the right would let you scroll through the list.  This would all be on the touch screen, and you would tap once to select a game, and more info from the header would appear on the top screen, and tapping again on that game would launch it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would suggest purchasing the SD Card GBA backup unit instead of any of those limited carts.
<br/>
<br/>
The biggest cart out there is 1 gigabit while this solution will let you use up to 4 gigabytes.  I have one, it works fine on my DS and I currently have 250 images on the cart along with various MP3's.

<br/>
<br/>
Though I am not sure if this would work with the passthrough because of the way it actually loads the images.  Well, doesn't matter anyway as I still own a F2A Ultra 1gigabit.
<br/>
<br/>
It's pretty nice being able to choose from 250 titles though, instead of having to flash maybe 6 at a time MAX.

That site is "bad" in other ways as well. They copied my "keyboard advance" article and published it as if it were their own (not even a link to my page). I sent numerous e-mails to them telling them to take it down. Got a few responses in the beginning, but they refused to take it down.

After a year or so I e-mailed their webhost and asked them to take it down. Fortunately they actually did.

I've been eyeing flash carts for almost three years now and haven't committed to anything, but this seems really promising and interesting.  Do the compact flash cards go into this device like SD Cards go into the Play Yan or does itplug into the top?  Does it support Pogo Shell?

If you want to "know" my pain, just do a search on google.  You will fine a LOT of forums bashing this cart.  Now, it may be because it only has Japanese documentation.  But, I fought just to get homebrew GBA stuff working on it.  But, I did finally get it figured out, and most of the headache was due to it "auto" selecting the Save Type.  Next was getting it to Multiboot.  Still haven't gotten that one fully figured out.. it's pretty much hit or miss if it will work.
<br/>
<br/>
Also..  EZF-Advance III has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EZF people!  This cart is a cheap KNOCK OFF.  The name is "stolen" to help sell the cart.  If you have a EZF cart, I hear they work very well.  Just trying to clarify.
<br/>
<br/>
Now.. as for using Movie Player or Super Card (CF devices), I doubt they will work as they have "software" to interface to the CF.  PassMe doesn't take any of this into account, and since it's looking for Arm9 code and gba is all ARM7, I don't think it could run it either.  
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I have a GBA Movie Player.  But again, because it uses a menu system, it doesn't work out of the box.  That doesn't mean that maybe someone could maybe write something for the CPLD and make it work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I second what Lynx says about the Supercard (I own one myself). It is _NOT_ a real flashcart, as it requires heavy patching of the ROMS to make them work. Plus, as it uses an SRAM chip not fast enough, some ROMS will never work at all (Yoshi's Island for instance). Finally, the HW is completely undocumented/closed.
<br/>
<br/>
The F2A/F2AUltra are perfect for homebrew development and well documented.

But, I fought just to get homebrew GBA stuff working on it.  But, I did finally get it figured out, and most of the headache was due to it "auto" selecting the Save Type.  Next was getting it to Multiboot.  Still haven't gotten that one fully figured out.. it's pretty much hit or miss if it will work.
<br/>
<br/>
Also..  EZF-Advance III has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EZF people!  This cart is a cheap KNOCK OFF.  The name is "stolen" to help sell the cart.  If you have a EZF cart, I hear they work very well.  Just trying to clarify.
<br/>
<br/>
Now.. as for using Movie Player or Super Card (CF devices), I doubt they will work as they have "software" to interface to the CF.  PassMe doesn't take any of this into account, and since it's looking for Arm9 code and gba is all ARM7, I don't think it could run it either.  
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I have a GBA Movie Player.  But again, because it uses a menu system, it doesn't work out of the box.  That doesn't mean that maybe someone could maybe write something for the CPLD and make it work.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I've just got one of these EZFA-III cards with linker.

I've not got my DS yet but I have managed to flash things to the cart without problems.

I saw it mentioned that the bundled usb cable was to blame for most problems.

I already tested it and it works. You can pull out the PassMe and use it to boot a second DS.
<br/>
You could also probably remove the GBA flash cart and insert it into the second DS since current homebrew demos run from memory.

To address Lynx's concern: The issue isn't with 6-year-old programmers but with 6-year-old play-testers (e.g. "M") who live with 10-year-old programmers (e.g. "J" once he learns C) and 24-year-old programmers (e.g. tepples).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Well, if you wait a while, you could order a kit from <a href="http://www.dspassme.com." target="_blank">www.dspassme.com.</a> It comes disassembled for only $12.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I already ordered the PCB, plus as you said it will take a while for Lynx to recieve and send the parts.. I was kind of hoping to have the PassMe really soon since I'm off school next week and I thought it would be a perfect time to write a small game.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok something is not right in the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dspassme.com/docs/html/pm_01_requirements.html" target="_blank">PassMe documentation</a>. It says you need to order a 3" PCB, when if you open up the design in Eagle it is 2". There are multiple references to 2" and 3" all through the page. Any idea why?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Right now I'm trying to order the CPLD directly from Xilinx. I talked to the local representative and he said that he might have a free sample. My only problem is I don't know exactly which chip it is. I am thinking it's the XC9572XL-7PC44C, can anyone confirm this? If that's not the one, which one is it on the lsit? Thanks.

No, this chip is in the PLCC-44 package. You need the VQFP-44 package.
<br/>
<br/>
There should be "VQ44" instead of "PC44" in the name. Also, the "7" denotes the speed grade (higher means slower). I am using a speed 10 chip which is slower than a speed 7 chip.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sure.. the passme has a touchscreen built in and wireless, so you can play multiplayer and use your GBA just like a DS..

Wow.. being the first to use a PassMe, I'm supprised I haven't had any problems.. I swapped it into my DS a LOT, and never had a problem, but I can see the potential issues it may have now that you pointed it out.  So, all my PassMe's will have a sticker on the back to cover the exposed contacts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
