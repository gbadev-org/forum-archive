    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Short question, I know PassMe and WiFiMe use the 4MB part on the NDS. However <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gameboy-advance.net/nintendo_ds/neo-flash/neoflash-review.htm" target="_blank">Neoflash</a> can use 512Mb and 1Gb. Is this due to a limitation "we" didn't find yet and they did, or is it cause you guys want to keep PassMe and WiFiMe legal for homebrew development?

Sorry if this has been answered yet, or considdered a stupid question, just wanted to know ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
4 MB is limit for binary size, that must fit in memory. If you use some file system (ie. GBFS), then you can load data from card, and release old ones.<br/>_________________<br/>[ sorry for all mistakes, but my english isn't as good as I wish it to be ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Even if you use a file system on the GBA flash card, you're still limited to 32 MB (256 Mbit). The "Golden Sun Team" releases designed specifically for NeoFlash rely on the bankswitching hardware of the XG2 Turbo card sold as part of the NeoFlash package, which can handle up to 64 MB (512 Mbit) or 128 MB (1 Gbit).
<br/>
<br/>
Another option: Once the GBA MP hack becomes more mature and/or the alleged SuperCard upgrade looks viable, it'll be possible to load up to 1 GB (8 Gbit) of assets from a CF card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Why only 1 GB? They make up to 4 GB CF cards these days (they are expensive though)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The FAT code isn't complicated very much by MBRs or FAT32. MBR just requires an offset to the partition, while FAT32 uses a different mask when reading the FAT. What complicates things is file writing.
<br/>
FAT16 can support 4GB, if you use 64KiB clusters, which is not recommended (or supported by windows 98/ME).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently talked to NeoFlash creators. They are preparing MagicKey 2. A new version of NeoFlash that will use SD/MMC and CF cards up to 4Gbytes. Now that's real space! :D
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder what method could you use for reading and writing data to it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for all the replies. But I what I was wondering was why Pass/WiFiMe use limited space while stuff as Neoflash allows us to play larger ROMs. I have a 128MB Ez-Flash cart, but I can't use all the space via a PassMe right?

Commercial games need to load data from the DS card, and they need to be patched in order to load the rest of the data from GBA ROM instead. Homebrew PassMe ROMs (*ds.gba) can already use a GBFS file in GBA ROM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
