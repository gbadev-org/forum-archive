<br/>
that is a good price if you factor in the fact that their are trustable...
<br/>
and not shady dealers like a lot of other places :P,
<br/>
and its best to buy a CF card not bundled,
<br/>
they try to rip you off with bundles :P.
<br/>
just wait for a sale in a store near by,
<br/>
and to hold you down and flash it when you get a gbamp,
<br/>
use a 32mb from a digital camera or something :P
<br/>
then when a sale is on buy something bigger :)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">
