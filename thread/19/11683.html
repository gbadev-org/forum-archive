    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i am looking into going into the homebrew world and there are so many different ways to do it, i am just downright lost.
<br/>
<br/>
i have a ds lite and some of the things i am looking for in the homebrew scene are:
<br/>
-one time use of "something me" so i don't have to use the "something me" device more than once.
<br/>
-ability to use SD card to store programs to.
<br/>
-ability to use GBA slot for possible future RAM extension?
<br/>
<br/>
any help would be greatly appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The answer is really simple, the only thing you have to decide is how much do you want to spend.
<br/>
<br/>
1. combination
<br/>
<br/>
- SuperKey
<br/>
- SuperCard SD (make sure it's not <span style="font-weight: bold">Rumble</span> version)
<br/>
<br/>
About 50$ altogether, assuming you can find a good store.
<br/>
<br/>
2. combination
<br/>
<br/>
- PassCard 3
<br/>
- M3 Perfect SD Slim (make sure it's the <span style="font-weight: bold">Perfect</span>, not <span style="font-weight: bold">Professional</span> version)
<br/>
<br/>
About 80$ altogether, blahblah
<br/>
<br/>
The differences are small. SuperCard is made of cheaper parts and has ugly menus, but they're fast and functional. M3 on the other hand has a bit more quality, however (judging from the forums), techical issues are more likely (but still very rare). They both feature extra 32 megabytes of extra RAM, which could be used in the future. Instead of the SD versions, you can also spend about $20 more and buy microSD versions, so they won't stick out of your Lite - however, they won't accept the plain-sized SD cards and microSDs are a bit more expensive. The choice is all yours, but beware - SuperCard Lite still lacks some good homebrew support.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Any SD card device except the unpopular GBAMP SD. CF is more compatible though.

M3 Perfect, Supercard or Supercard Lite, DSMEM, possibly some GBA "flash" carts.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would a SuperKey with a Super Card Lite and micro SD card work then?
<br/>
<br/>
Will any of those options allow for using a full sized SD card (inserted into DS1) with nothing in the GBA slot?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For cheapest price and best compatiblity, you should get a GBA slot device.
<br/>
<br/>
Any slot-1 (DS slot) device that takes normal SD cards is going to stick out a few inches and reduce the portability of your DS.  The NinjaDS is one of these cards but you are much better off getting a slot-2 (GBA slot) solution like Supercard or M3.
<br/>
<br/>
I think future official GBA expansions are unlikely and you wouldn't use them enough to make swapping too much of an inconvience.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You should get a Supercard SD and a Passme/Superkey. Do not get the Rumble series since they do not have the additional 32MB RAM.  Flash your DS with Flashme afterwards so your DS can read NDS programs from the GBA slot.

<br/>
<br/>
You can't insert an SD card into the DS card slot. If you're talking about DS card slot based flashcards, then there are ones available like NinjaDS and DS-Xtreme cards. These cards look exactly the same as normal NDS game cards. They allow you to read NDS/gba files from the DS slot, this means that you do not need to flash your DS anymore.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You mentioned not to use the M3 Pro versions or SC Rumble.  I thought I had read that only the .gba or whatever version wouldn't run, but the .nds one would (I probably have some terms wrong).  Don't most homebrew apps have two builds that run in whatever mode?  Or I am just making that up?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">M3 Pro and the SC Rumbles don't have additional RAM available. (Because that RAM is actually for GBA-use on the other cards, and without GBA-support, they don't need that RAM.)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

that link says that the G6 can play SNES roms. will the M3 allow me to play my old SNES games as well?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can run a SNES emulator on almost any DS homebrew device but the emulators are not perfect, so don't expect to be able to run everything and what you can run will probably not be full speed.
<br/>
<br/>
When M3/G6 or most of those Chinese companies say that it includes SNES or some other emulator support, they usually mean that their Windows software includes a copy of an emulator.  If they actually bother to include an emulator with their software, it will probably be an old version and not coded by them.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
