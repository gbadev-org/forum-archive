    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, I've been looking into Nintendo DS homebrew for some months now, but I've had no money to buy the required...Stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a normal Nintendo DS, firmware 1.0
<br/>
(At least, when I tried the remove-the-game-from-pictochat test, my result was a frozen DS.) 
<br/>
<br/>
Ok. Well my birthday is about a month away, and I've decided I'll get what I can to be able to use the DS homebrew applications using the 80$ my parents are giving me for my birthday.
<br/>
<br/>
I've fallen into a slew of problems, though.
<br/>
<br/>
First in foremost, I want to be able to use an SD card, rather then a CF card. I find SD cards a lot cheaper then CF cards. But if SD cards lack compatibility with some applications are something, It is possible for me to get a CF card.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I need to know what exactly I need to be able to run the applications.
<br/>
<br/>
And for those who are wondering: I hope to be able to play MP3s, and movie files. That's why I'm getting a 1GB card, weather it be SD or CF.
<br/>
I would like to play homebrew games made by users, not too crazy about emulators..
<br/>
I would also like to use applications, like image viewers, notepads, excetra.
<br/>
I do not care about backing up DS games.
<br/>
<br/>
Second off, whatever I'm getting shouldn't pose a threat to bricking or destroying my DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, sites like eBay, or auction.com aren't an option for me. The item can be sold on an online store, though. I also live in the USA, by the way.
<br/>
<br/>
I looked around these forums, and some other sites and buying a Supercard (SD), and a Superkey looked like a good idea. But I have a few questions:
<br/>
<br/>
1) What is the difference between Superkey and Passcard 3?
<br/>
<br/>
2) Would I be required to do the Flashme thing or whatever? Where I gotta void the DS warranty?
<br/>
<br/>
3) Let's say I got those two items, if I had them both inserted into my DS would I be able to simply click the GBA cartage option, then get into my apps? Or do I need to boot it or something each time I want to run an application?
<br/>
<br/>
4) would the Supercard stick out of my DS at all? 
<br/>
<br/>
5) I would assume I need a SD card reader / writer..right?
<br/>
<br/>
6) Is there any other requirements for this? Like a certain router or something?
<br/>
<br/>
7) If I used supercard / key, how is the interface with it? Is it all text-based?
<br/>
<br/>
8) A final not as important question, If I where to play MP3s on my DS, would I be able to close the DS, slip it into my pocket and still listen to the music from the headphones? 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch everyone, If there is a better alternative, or if my idea doesn't even work. What should I use?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1: No difference. They're both NoPass devices. Do not get a MMP if you don't plan to use FlashMe, as while it is a NoPass device, it does not support sleep mode...
<br/>
<br/>
2: Just use a NoPass device if you're worried by using FlashMe. No flashing required.
<br/>
<br/>
3: With a NoPass in slot-1 and a media adapter in slot-2 all you need to do is switch on. The media adapter automatically loads into its menu.
<br/>
<br/>
4: A SuperCard CF will stick out of a DS Phat a lot and a DS Lite even more. An SC:SD will stick out less, but still a lot. An SC: MiniSD will not stick out of a DS Phat and only sticks out a little from a DSL (I use an SC:mSD) and a SC:Lite will not fit in a DS Phat and sits flush with the DSL. Pheeew :-)
<br/>
<br/>
5: Yes. Most online stores run bundle deals (I got a 2gb mSD + USB r/w adapter for about 40 pounds a few months back...)
<br/>
<br/>
6: Nope. NoPass, media adapter and media card is all you need. Everything else is optionional.
<br/>
<br/>
7: The SC menu is primarily text-based. Just a simple little file browser is what you get. Nice and old skool :-)
<br/>
<br/>
8: Yes. This is a the big draw in getting a DSL with SC:Lite. It doubles as a mostly unobtrusive MP3 player. It's still larger than an iPod or pretty much any dedicated MP3 player, but it's very much usable in-pocket...
<br/>
<br/>
In short, I recommend: SC mSD or SC Lite, a big memory stick, a NoPass device and a nice pair of headphones :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

apparently they have released a new version that supports sleep mode, but there is no way to differentiate the two</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What you might consider is borrowing a nopass device from a friend and using it to flash the DS. (This is not as dangerous as it sounds, you just have to be carefull.) By doing this, you eliminate the need to buy a nopass device of your own. If you can wifime, you don\'t even need the nopass device from your friend, just the flashcart or the adapter.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
