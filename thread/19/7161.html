    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
Been reading these forums for a while now to whet my appetite for NDS development.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally got my GBAMP and Superpass in the post today so eagerly tried to run one of the demo tutorial files from here --&gt; <a href="http://www.double.co.nz/nintendo_ds/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.double.co.nz/nintendo_ds/index.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The problem I am having is that the NDS boots up in GBA mode and when I select the demo1.nds.gba file from the GBAMP files list, all I get is a white screen ?!?!?
<br/>
<br/>
I have searched through this forum to see if anybody else has had this problem but couldn't find a suitable answer.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know why this happens?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance, apologies for repeating this question if it has been asked before :(
<br/>

<br/>
There is your first problem.  You don't want to boot up in GBA Mode, and you need to rename the demo1.nds.gba file to _BOOT_MP.nds and put it on the ROOT of the CF card.
<br/>
<br/>
Or, get MightyMaxes multi-loader and put it on.. and use it to boot your demo1.nds.gba file.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh... now that I think about it, you should be getting two white screens.  So, it sounds like the Super PassKey isn't redirecting?  Is this a symptom of the new NDS firmware?  So, I'd start by making sure your DS cart is plugged into the Super PassKey good, and make sure the Super PassKey is plugged into the NDS good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm - I renamed the demo1.nds.gba file to _BOOT_MP.nds and the same problem happens.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me step through the scenario.
<br/>
<br/>
1. GBAMP with CF card holding demo1 is plugged into NDS.
<br/>
2. SuperPass is plugged into NDS with Metroid Demo card plugged into SuperPass.
<br/>
3. Turn on NDS
<br/>
4. Instantly boot into GBA mode
<br/>
5. Select 'Game' option from GBAMP menu screen
<br/>
6. Select game file for demo1 (now called _BOOT_MP.nds)
<br/>
7. Get white screen on top display and nothing on bottom.
<br/>
<br/>
My NDS is one of the first generation UK versions.
<br/>
I am sure it has the old firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;sniff&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
I thought this was going to be straightforward - silly me :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Random notes &amp; tips:
<br/>
<br/>
* Did you install the new GBAMP firmware that supports nds mode? (there are tutorials for this, one on <a href="http://ndshb.com" target="_blank">http://ndshb.com</a> i believe)
<br/>
<br/>
* As soon as you are in GBA mode, something has gone wrong. You need to be in NDS mode.
<br/>
<br/>
* If you have a passme/superpass in, and you boot into gba mode, that suggests there is something wrong with the superpass. At least with a passme, as long as it is plugged in, you will either get A) something running in nds mode, or B) two white screens.
<br/>
<br/>
* Also, you can NOT run .nds.gba files from gbamp (as far as i know). You need the .nds version of whatever you are trying to run.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another random tip:
<br/>
<br/>
Do you have the Automatic option activated in the DS settings?
<br/>
<br/>
Don't know if that would run before the passme, but probably not.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Josath, Lynx,
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a million both of you.
<br/>
Got the thing working now.
<br/>
To demonstrate how much of a muppet I was being - here is what was wrong:-
<br/>
<br/>
I had included _BOOT_MP.gba on the CF and also included the homebrew demo1 app.
<br/>
But stupidly, not renamed the demo1 app to _BOOT_MP.nds !!!
<br/>
<br/>
Lol - I suppose everyone starts somewhere eh?
<br/>
Unfortunately for me, I started at the bottom and tripped on the first step :)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again guys, maybe my next post will be something far more constructive.
<br/>
