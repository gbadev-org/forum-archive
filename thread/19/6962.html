    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just got my EZ-flash 2 in the mail....I plugged it in and installed the drivers then i opened EZ-Client. It has 254 M of space remaining And each rom is like 8 Mb. But it says that it can only fit 2 roms!?!?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it has something to do with the build in loader. Try throwing all you roms in a file using darkains bootloader. Think that helps.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrsnowflake.be" target="_blank">http://www.mrsnowflake.be</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The reason is that the space in your card is measured in megaBITs, and the size of the roms on your computer are measure in megaBYTES. If you use the built-in loader, you should be able to fit about 3-4 GBA roms on your card. (I have the same one) The loader itself doesn't take up a significant about of space, so you don't need to worry about disabling it unless you're trying to play nds roms. (which you need flash/wifi/pass-me for anyway)
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, Darkain's bootloader doesn't work properly with EZ-Flash I/II cards yet, regardless of which roms you're loading, size, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
