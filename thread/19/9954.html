    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Harder than you'd think. A lot of the time, manufacturers will only supply the minimum driver required to get MoonShell to work with their flash cart (eg M3SD). They don't add write support, and the device detection often produces false positives ("if they aren't using our flash cart, who cares?"). Since the EZ4 is an SD device, there is currently no example driver to modify for it (I'm working on that, using M3SD as a base).

Once I finish the new FATlib (which has a slightly different device interface), I'll write up a design document for device driver authors to follow.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
