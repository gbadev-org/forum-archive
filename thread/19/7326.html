    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've done some GBA dev work and I'm thinking of trying my hand in DS development.  I have read about things like passme and flashme and wifime and was wondering what was the quickest and easiest way to get code loaded on the DS.  I'd prefer not to flash my DS if possible.  
<br/>
<br/>
Wifime sounds like the easiest method.  It apparently only works with Windows 32 bit so I can't run that.  I run Linux64/Win64 but would be happy to port wifime over to Linux if the source was available.  
<br/>
<br/>
There are some devices that let you boot from an SD card correct?  M3 if I'm not mistaken.  Does that involve flashing or can you launch DS binaries from it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As I said in the other thread, I went with the GBAMP2/Super PassKey combo.  The GBAMP2's firmware was updated by the vendor (dspassme.com) to support direct booting of .nds files, and the Super PassKey is basically a plastic-covered "retail" version of PassMe.
<br/>
<br/>
I also flashed my DS firmware (FlashMe) so that I no longer have to plug in the PassMe in order to run homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are other solutions that might be better, depending on your needs, but for me, the GBA Movie Player was cheap, it works, and has good community support.  Also, CF cards are damned cheap these days.  I picked up some 4x 128MB cards for $9 each the other day.
<br/>
<br/>
Also note that with most of these removavable media solutions (CF, SD), that if the firmware supports it, you can simply copy your .nds or .ds.gba files from the PC onto a formated card, pop the card into the adapter/player and into the DS for execution.  There isn't any "flashing" stage, per se.
<br/>
<br/>
So far, my only real annoyance, compared to some other adapters, is that to insert/remove the CF cards from the player, you have to pull the GBAMP out of the DS.  I don't think SD solutions have this same problem.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One caveat: watch out for DS firmware incompatability.  I have an older DS, so everything worked just fine, but apparently the latest DS models have upgraded firmware that may, at the moment, may prove incompatable with your adapter of choice.  There is more about this issue in other threads.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Personally, I like the fact that the CF card is "protected" inside the GBA MP, as apposed to the SC, which has it sticking out.  Sure, it makes it easier to pull out and plug into your PC, but also leaves it hanging out to be "snapped" off.. so to speak..  But, it's not a show stopper (I ordered one anyway).. Just waiting for DSLinux to support the extra 32MB of RAM!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was a little fuzzy on the particulars, so that's good to know.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
