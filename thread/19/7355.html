    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi.
<br/>
<br/>
I recieved an M3 a number of months ago, and was one of the first to recieve one. A few weeks ago, I downgraded to E04, and then after the program I was trying to run didn't work (thinking about it now, heretic only worked on E02), I upgraded back to E06. Of course, being really stupid, I forgot to delete update.e04 off the CF card. The result? an M3 that won't leave the updating screen after 36 hours (I went away for the weekend so I left it plugged in).
<br/>
<br/>
I believe that the problem should be fixable by using a firmware flasher. I have a GBAMP with chishms hack, so I can execute .nds files, and all I need now is a repair.nds )or whatever) program, which I have emailed the m3adapter team about, without much success.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, would a program that flashes the firmware be possible? and everyone make sure you only have one update on your card
<br/>

edit: I just turned it on, and in DS mode, it now boots up to a corrupted screen, and in GBA mode, it boots up completely, but none of the browse functions work...it seems it got very close to being updated, but not quite
<br/>
<br/>
I'll try and put the latest update on it.
<br/>
<br/>
edit again:
<br/>
<br/>
The latest update now works!! for some reason, in 2 weeks my M3 has decided to work. This thread is now utterly pointless. Sorry :(<br/>_________________<br/>Yours Truly

Even that which is "pointless" sometimes has a purpose. For instance, a Weeble's bottom is completely round (thus it has no "point"), but it can't wobble without it. Likewise, your thread points out some tips for M3 owners to try in order to revive a dead adapter.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Unless you erase the flash they tend to be able to boot as long as you put an update on the card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'll try to find out if the fail-safe can be overridden and probably make a repair tool just in case it gets erased by some malware :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">and we all know what malware that is :)
<br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling the update I used was corrupted, but I tried 2 different ones, so the 2 updates on the card may of also done something...
<br/>
<br/>
It was probably a mixture of the two.

Apparently they're having bad problems with supply or something.  I actually ordered one (nice to have a device compatible with GBAMP CF using applications and every other sort of GBA or NDS homebrew thing you might want to run on your NDS, and all off of the same compact flash card no less), it looks like Divineo just shipped it so they must finally have gotten some in.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, and there is movie conversion software that supports the full res of the NDS's screen now.  I'm suprised it took them so long.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
