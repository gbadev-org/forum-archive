<br/>
he wanted to set his firmware to flashme v7
<br/>
<br/>
but he didnt realise that his DS bat. was low..
<br/>
and he couldnt make contact with SL1 (he stopped at 66% he said)
<br/>
<br/>
and.. now what he get is 2 black screens..
<br/>
<br/>
i searched everywhere how to repair it..
<br/>
<br/>
but it says with a gba flashcard... (he has a M3 CF)
<br/>

<br/>
