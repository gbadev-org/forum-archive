<br/>
<br/>
Also note that slot-2 cards contain additional RAM that DSLinux can use - without the RAM, it's rather limited.  However, there has recently been a release that uses DLDI, so it might be possible to at least boot it on a slot-1 card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's pros and cons.  On monroeworld.com I posted a comparison to the r4.  I have a dsx and r4.  I had one of the first batch dsx's that had the qkin problem.  I received my replacement not too long ago.  I will selling it since I don't need two devices.
<br/>
<br/>
For most people, something like the r4 will be a better choice than the dsx.
<br/>
<br/>
I like the dsx for development.  No fiddling with a microsd card.  My lock mech for the sd slot on the r4 broke, I need to tape the card in.  So the dsx may boot slower it is still faster for development since I just need to plug in a usb cord.  For the r4 I need to take the r4 out of the ds, take the transflash out.  Put the flash in the usb adaptor.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't found the fixed memory that bad.  I only have one microsd card for the r4 so there is essentially no difference.  I find myself putting stuff on and off of it as much as I was on the dsx.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I think none of that warrants buying it over another slot 1 device.  The only reason I could see getting the dsx now is if you have small kids that play with your ds.  Microsd is small and easy to loose.
<br/>
<br/>
I am tempted to get the ez-flash V and 3in1 slot 2 combo.  That looks like the ultimate solution.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

it looks like a ultimate solution ...

the best thing is: moonshell is the primary loader. you can start .nds, homebrew, movies, pic viewer ... all without need to start a moonshell. and it is all open source!

EZ flash 5 + trimode expansion is a very good solution but it have same problem as all TF solutions: slow downs</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

well i have max media dock and that is probably the cheapest one you can get you load almost every type of homebrew app and game except for dslinux. But maybe in the near future somebody will release a dslinux that works on it. Other than tht if you put moonshell on it then its really cool and has good sound quality+compact flash cards are alot cheaper than micro sd and the other ones except for sd those are the cheapest, so if your not going to get a MMD than get a different one tht requires sd to save money</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I will explain. DLDI is used for accessing files on the card. DS Linker is very compatible to rom backups and also to homebrew. concerning homebrew there are different types of homebrew:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>homebrew which doesnt read or write    ## working fine
<br/>
</li><li>homebrew which read some data from files (levels, textures ...)   ## working fine
<br/>
</li><li>homebrew which does also write data into files (for high scores)   ## working but without write access
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
in the moment no write access to files is possible. but in the near future this will work also without problems.
