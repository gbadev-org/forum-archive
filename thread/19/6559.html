<br/>
<br/>
We may have to <a class="postlink" href="http://sc.tri-bit.com/DS_Wi-fi_Bounty" target="_blank">crack the Wi-Fi chipset</a>, reverse the protocol that some WMB multiplayer game (such as Super Mario 64 DS) uses to load assets from the machine with the cart, and then make ItsaMe where a PC poses as a server running that game, sending the (signed) WMB stub followed by (hopefully unsigned) code and assets. Now if "code and assets" means "FlashMe" then it's cracked again.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Then again, if they were that worried about the firmware hack, they'd probably have done it already.
<br/>
<br/>
I think it's been asked elsewhere, but could Nintendo update the firmware without people realising? i.e - including the code in a regular game</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As there is a flash protection on the firmware, this would not be possible
<br/>
<br/>
So this is just in the firmware and a simple flash would sort it out if you could find a way to execute it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They can detect a change backwards in time by adding old firmware check and some secret algorithm on newer firmwares. Unlikely though.
<br/>
They could also sell them with a different flashchip or something :)
<br/>
Nothing that can't be broken though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As you can see with the iQue DS for China (because of the piracy issues there) and now with the NEW red DS, I don't feel N has a problem with developers.  But, now that all of the pirating companies have taking what the homebrew community has created, and made it available for pirating, N has started to care, and is now blocking homebrew to keep people from pirating.  Some form of homebrew has been running on DSs since, what, 2 months after it released?  N didn't care untill all of the pirates started selling (or advertising) their new products.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, normally I disagree with piracy, but if it wasn't for it, we wouldn't have GBA Flash carts to use for our homebrew.  The problem with the current piracy is that it doesn't help homebrew at all!  It ONLY HURTS IT!  Now, if a pirating company was creating a DS Flash Cart, I'd be happy.  But they aren't, they are just ruining the homebrew scene.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
