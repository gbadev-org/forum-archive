    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am having a little problem with Wifime.  I updated the firmware fine with Wifime and my GBA flash card, and it works as expected.  The only problem is, I cannot upload games/demos/apps/etc. via wireless for some reason.  I am using the latest versions of the driver and application, and I am sure that the games and demos I have are working.  All WMB does is crash, and the front does not show anything in the console output (when I run it manually, it does).
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to get started playing with my DS, but I need to know how come my setup is not working properly.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, what is the console output when it crashes?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, show me the command with parameters (if any) that you use. I wonder if maybe you're not setting your data parameter properly.
<br/>
<br/>
I forget if there's a simpler way to do this, but here's what I use:
<br/>
<br/>
C:\WiFiMe\wmb.exe -data "Test"
<br/>
<br/>
In C:\WiFiMe\data\Test\, I have a single .nds file. To broadcast multiple ROMs, you can use -data "rom1;rom2;rom3" with rom1, rom2, and rom3 each being the names of folders within the data directory, and each containing a single .nds file.
<br/>
<br/>
Try to get it working with one ROM for now though.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Otherwise, it does not crash (even if I type in exactally what the registry shows, it does not crash), but it only send out the "Wireless Multiboot PassMe" thing.

<br/>
<br/>
What do you name the .nds file in the folder?  Is it the same as the foldername?  I tried that with no luck.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I tried wmb -help, and it does nothing.  It doesn't seem to detect my command line arguments.  Help me!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
But there's still a little problem.  When I put a whole load of ROMS in the commandline (say, 20) it doesn't want to do them all.  It seems like an allocation error, because it is at a fixed character.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
