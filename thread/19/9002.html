You should really get a passme instead from lynx (dspassme.com) you don't need a paypal account to buy from him, just click pay with credit card. I did it, and I think it's way better than wifime would've been</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Who's <span style="font-style: italic">they</span>?  Is that me?  I didn't put anything in the WiFiMe Tutorial that tells you to buy this card, and this is the first I've heard that it doesn't work.  I'll be happy to post this info if it's the case that other people are having the same trouble.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I do specifically mention three cards (two PCI, one PCMCIA) in the FAQ and, as far as I know, they work fine.
