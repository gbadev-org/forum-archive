<br/>
<br/>
i bought a flashcard from <span style="font-weight: bold">[URL removed by MOD - read the rules]</span>
<br/>
<br/>
the flashcard in question is the 16Gb firelinker (Aka Express Card)
<br/>
<br/>
i was backing up a copy of the card contents to prepare for a firmware upgrade, when AVG noticed somthing very interesting...
<br/>
<br/>
the DSOrganise folder is infested with a virus! (42 Times!)
<br/>
<br/>
My system is definatly clean, so it is not from my computer 
<br/>
<br/>
