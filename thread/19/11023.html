    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Im considering a gbamp CF for homebrew software, but i would like to know if its compatible with passcard3....i assume the gbamp CF is better than the SD version for homebrew going by the problems with m3/SC sd/miniSD adaptors....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In fact, the GBAMP CF is THE best option for homebrew, although it does stick out quite a bit from your DS. The GBAMP SD is not even homebrew compatible at all. I'm almost sure it's compatible with the Passcard 3, but you might want to wait for someone who knows his stuff rather than trusting me on that one.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, i just bought a passcard3 +m3 mini sd, but for homebrew this doesnt seem to be a very good combination, although i can still run things like moonshell, scummvm (limited) but i was considering to buy the gbamp CF since its not very expensive, even if it sticks out so much on ds lite.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't know if you got your answer, but yes.. The GBA MP works great with a PassCard 3 (which is also the combo I chose for my NDS Devkits on dspassme.com).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
