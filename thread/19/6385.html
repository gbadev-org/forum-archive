<br/>
I've appeneded the Submarine Tech Demo onto the end of DF's ndsmall.bin.  It loads correctly with my 64Mbit FAW, but freezes during the intro on my 512Mbit EFA.   I've unchecked "Use Loader" but still no luck.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else willing to try this out?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using EFA Client v2.5.  My only guess is that the 64Kb Save Size is messing things up.  And when I try setting the Save Size to 0 the client crashes :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just found out that any rom made with ndsmall.bin doesn't seem to work!  The others, like DS Bongo's, load up fine.  Very very strange.  I'm going to try installing some older versions of the software and see if they somehow work.  I'd do it while posting, but it's going to take a while from EFA's servers.. so slow.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Then create one rom with all demos, or if you want only these one (put them to dir and execute bat file) - it will work fine on NDS ;)<br/>_________________<br/>[ sorry for all mistakes, but my english isn't as good as I wish it to be ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I just hate that it won't work with ndsmall.  SO many developers use it to provide their .nds.gba binaries.  Oh well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
