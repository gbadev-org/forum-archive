By "backups" do you mean copies of commercial Game Cards? We don't discuss those here. Nor do we like to read run-on sentences.
<br/>
<br/>
SLOT-1 or SLOT-2 depends on what you want to do with your card. SLOT-1 cards generally can't be used for running Game Boy Advance homebrew, for backing up the save data on DS Game Cards (e.g. your town in <span style="font-style: italic">Animal Crossing: Wild World</span>), or as extra RAM for running DSLinux (until June when Opera comes out and you can reuse the RAM pak it comes with). SLOT-2 cards can sometimes be more expensive because they need a SLOT-1 card called "NoPass" to boot them in DS mode, and this NoPass card is either bundled with the SLOT-2 card or sold separately as part of the "Action Replay DS" package.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you want compatibility with GBA software? Do you want the ability to back up DS saves? Do you want to use DSLinux before June? Is it an original DS or a DS Lite?
<br/>
<br/>
Good SLOT-2 combo for homebrew: SuperCard (SD, miniSD, or Lite) + NoPass
<br/>
Good SLOT-1 card for homebrew: R4<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Woah there, you should know by now that it doesnt matter what is legal or what is not, but backups/commercial roms/1337w4r3z are against the forums rules and will not be discussed.
<br/>
<br/>
What kind of DS does he have? (phat, lite, how recently was it purchased?)
<br/>
Does he have a price limit?
<br/>
<br/>
I dunno anything about g6 but my supercard has served me well.
<br/>

Heh, in reference to the Opera browser RAM pack and DSLinux's ability to use it in conjunction with a slot-1 card?  
<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, keep in mind that graphical Links was just added to the DSLinux source, which requires lots of RAM to prevent crashing.  If this is important to you, a slot-2 device with RAM is recommended.
<br/>
<br/>
Also note that the Supercard Rumble and M3 Pro are not recommended since they have little to no RAM usable for GBA playback or DS homebrew usage.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I second that. links -g is a definate crasher after a couple of page loads on a Slot-1+Opera pak. But for text-mode apps (like links without -g), DSLinux becomes very usable with an Opera RAM pak. Just use Opera DS itself for graphical browsing since you'd already own it. 
<br/>
<br/>
In time, I predict card manufacturers will come out with full 32MB expansion paks similar to EZ-V 3in1 (which, -for now- gives only 8MB extra RAM in DSLinux).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

With ~ 2 megs system overhead you're going to need a slot 2 device with at least 10-12 MB extra memory.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>dualscreenman wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">What about Gaim DS?
