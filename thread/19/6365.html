    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys, Sorry to post a question on my first forum post!
<br/>
<br/>
wmb.exe seems to quit the second it's started up... it closes so quickly that i can only just read that it says some thing along the lines of -data parameter request...something like that?!
<br/>
<br/>
i've followed the instructions and put the wifime files in the data folder of the multiboot app (tried both zipped and unzipped) 
<br/>
<br/>
my card is on the list, the driver is correctly installed but this has really stumped me!
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else had a simular experiance or know of someone who has had the program quit before it's even started?
<br/>
<br/>
ANY help is appreciated :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

have you installed the <a class="postlink" href="http://headkaze.webpal.info/" target="_blank">"WMBFront"</a>(WMB frontend)?
<br/>
<br/>
If not,install it or run WMB from "command" or "cmd"<br/>_________________<br/>Abusing Cube and DS with all sorts of homebrew and hacks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can try WMBFront, but I recommend trying to get it to work before you bother with that. Take your shortcut for executing wmb.exe, and place the command in a batch file (ex. broadcast.bat). Then add a pause after the command, and you will have to hit a key before the window closes. This way you can view your errors properly.
<br/>
<br/>
Sample code, change the WiFiMe directory and the data parameter.

ah, now this is what I don't understand. How do i change the data parameter, infact, what is the data parameter? Just to make sure i'm not confusing myself here!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The -data parameter is where you tell the wmb application which nds file you wish to load.
<br/>
<br/>
If your nds file is located in the \data folder of the wmb app then you only need to give the parameter the filename.
<br/>
<br/>
eg. wmb.exe -data filename.nds
<br/>
<br/>
If your nds files are located somewhere else, just give it the path and filename.
<br/>
<br/>
eg. wmb.exe -data C:\DSDev\filename.nds</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I've got to a stage where i can boot up the E3 demos by using that front end program. Fiddling about with parameters etc with the DOS window didn't really reveal why it was shutting on its self so i tried the front end and it worked first time!
<br/>
<br/>
I've also managed to get the pasme working over wifime and ran that DSpaint program which was nice :)   
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing now is that I can't seem to put a .nds file onto my flashcart. When i re-name as say file.nds.gba it seems to recognise that it's a rom of some sort and gives me a size but when it's written it to the card in the normal process it just disapears..  hmm!  any ideas as to why, or am i re-naming the file wrong?!  I notice that dspaint is a '.ds.gba' file...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
