    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since saterday I am looking to find an answer on this.
<br/>
I can buy someones NDS for 50 euro and I know a place that sell's a comatible WiFi PCI card for WiFi ME.
<br/>
But is there a good guide on how to get it working, and what it can and can't do?
<br/>
I am really looking into this.
<br/>
What can it play, what can't it play?
<br/>
What program(s) do I need on my PC?
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone point me to a good guide telling me this?
<br/>
Do I need a GBA flashcart to do anything with it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It has basically the same limitations as the GBAMP, save for certain programs, like moonshell, that use chishm's CF FAT drivers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, you need either a flashcart or a GBAMP to first use the flashing program...after this initial flash, you could use the WiFi NDS version if you wanted to, but of course you need to get it flashed to be able to download homebrew directly via WiFi so I suppose that information is kind of pointless to you at the moment. ^_^;;<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
