    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey hey,
<br/>
I have just flashed my DS(Yay ^^) and have played around with a lot of homebrew. BUT, I use a GBA EZ Flash card, and i have been restricted to 32MB -_-
<br/>
And a lot of stuff don't work with GBA Flash cards.
<br/>
<br/>
So I was wondering, what is the best to buy? I have searched the forum, but didn't get the information i want :/
<br/>
<br/>
What I'm thinking is this:
<br/>
GBA Movie Player(v.2) CF version(CF cheapest and best?)
<br/>
1GB CF Card
<br/>
CF Card reader/Write(Can mobile phone with CF support do this trought computer?)
<br/>
<br/>
Anny suggestions? Should I get M3 instead? It seems so expensive =/<br/>_________________<br/>EZ Flash III - Flashme V7 - NDS V1 xD - NDS Tunneling, anyone?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, GBAmp is a great option, since you already have a GBA FlashCard for some homebrew that doesn't work well with it (rare, though). I'd say ... go for it :)
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, maybe somewhere in the future, SuperCard will have some more use, since amadeus figured out a method how to use it's onboard RAM (there are now benefits from it for now, though).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not nearly as expensive as M3. Besides, one retailer is offering a SuperCard CF plus USB CF writer for $45, which is the same price as a GBAMP ($25) and CF writer ($20) when purchased separately.
