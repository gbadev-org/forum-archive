    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ye, don't know much about the m3, but I doubt it can do much more than the gbamp/supercard, wich are MUCH cheaper than the insane 70$ you are mentioning here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want an M3, then the ~$10/20 discount is nice.. if you don't care about the M3, there are other.. much cheaper.. options available.  I personally don't care for the SC at all, but it can be had for ~$30+$15 shipping world wide.  M3 is much nicer, but at $90 retail.. that's 3 times the price of the SC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
