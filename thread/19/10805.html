<div id="posts">
<div class="post">
    <h4>#98251 - JaJa - Mon Aug 14, 2006 10:19 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As I have made clear in <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10702&amp;start=30" target="_blank">this</a> thread, I feel that the so called 'NoPass-RWs' (iNoPass devices with onboard flash memory, like the <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.pocketheaven.com/Ultra_FlashPass" target="_blank">Ultra FlashPass</a> and the <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.pocketheaven.com/Ninjapass_DS_Flash" target="_blank">Ninjapass DS Flash</a>) are bad for the homebrew scene.
<br/>
<br/>
Most of these devices are expensive, don't support chishms libfat (although they will expect it to) and have poor homebrew compatibility.
<br/>
<br/>
To get homebrew to run on the Ultra FlashPass (and so, I imagine the Ninjapass DS Flash) requires messing with the header.
<br/>
<br/>
We already have .nds, .ds.gba and .sc.nds, will we need a .UFP.nds too? 
<br/>
<br/>
And what about the other devices like the the <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.pocketheaven.com/DSLink" target="_blank">DSLink</a>? Will that need a separate build?
<br/>
<br/>
People are going to be buying these for piracy, then finding out what cool things the homebrew community can offer, then getting frustrated that they don't work. 
<br/>
<br/>
These device, if anything are a step <span style="font-style: italic">backwards</span> towards the days of the NOR GBA Flash Carts, where we had a small area of SRAM to write to compared with the 1Gbyte or so FAT media (CF and SD) we have now. Mass adoption of these devices by people looking for homebrew could see this disappear.
<br/>
<br/>
I thank all the developers who have worked to make games and applications that are often small, yet can sometimes equal the quality (but obviously not the complexity and length) and have more originality than commercial games. I have a 16Mbyte CF card lying around, and yet can fit plenty of interesting homebrew on it.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently on this card:
<br/>
DSOrganize
<br/>
Explosive Gas
<br/>
A Touch of War
<br/>
Super Snake 
<br/>
<br/>
So in summary, I feel we should boycott (ban) 'NoPass-RW' devices because they are an expense that most developers can't afford, yet will be expected to support them by people who bought their device primarily for piracy, to make up for the manufacturers lack of homebrew compatability. We should remove this ban <span style="font-weight: bold">IF</span> the manufacturers increase homebrew support.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

It's not that I feel one-slot solutions are bad for DS homebrew--if everyone adopted a Slot-1 flashcart that, say, used MicroSD, we could eliminate a layer of confusion and make running DS homebrew as easy as running GBA homebrew.

<br/>
When somebody makes a cheap, totally homebrew compatible Slot-1 card that takes media sticks like MicroSD, that is when I'll support Slot-1 devices.  But I'll never support the UFP and clones.

<br/>
<br/>
They will help homebrew for sure. The barrier to start with homebrew atm is still very high because you need multiple devices for the easiest task. Even for a "Hello World". A one Slot solution lowers this barrier.
<br/>
<br/>
We allready fiddle with the nds header. it is totally possible to have one .nds with both devices. The created header for UFP is not incompatible with the normal homebrew loaders. It's just the next step.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think they are expensive. The UFP is less then a NoPass + GBA Flash of 512MBit. Ok, the gbamp + wifime is cheaper.
<br/>
<br/>
Homebrew support comes with the time. GBAMP's homebrew compatible was non existance on its release.
<br/>
<br/>
"was created for piracy only" Yes, but what? Does that make me a pirate if i abuse it for homebrew? And if, wouldn't gba-flashcards fall under the same rule?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm clearly against a boycot of these cards. And tbh i don't know what result you expect from the boycot?
<br/>
<br/>
Will pirates stop buying these? No
<br/>
Will the manufactures stop earning money? No
<br/>
Will ds slot solution vanish? No
<br/>
Will it stop some potentional homebrew developers to start? Yes<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The flashcarts such as the Supercard CF and the M3 made pirating so much easier. (Most pirates like to have more than one or two ROMs on their cart simultaneously.) Given the logic that we shouldn't allow stuff that make pirating easier, the DS homebrew scene should have never adopted these media card using solutions.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>dualscreenman wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">What about Gaim DS?

<br/>
<br/>
But in the beginning we has the GBAMP, the purest of homebrew devices.
<br/>
Then Nintendo forced as to need a device like the Supercard or M3 for it's SRAM. This meant many people new to homebrew also had a device capapble of piracy.
<br/>
<br/>
In boycotting these devices, I would hope to see the manufacturers change their ways and at least try and make <span style="font-style: italic">some</span> homebrew compatible.
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, MightMax it is a biased view, but frankly it's human nature to be biased. You can't be completely impartial unless you know about the subject matter. You're then going to prefer the one that matches and reinforces your own belief system.
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't realise that the modifed loader is compatible with exisiting devices,  the problem of having a third build is now non-exisitant.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not against the idea of a DS slot device, just the ones that don't and can't serve the homebrew community.  As dualscreenman said, if there was a widely adopted NoPass-RW that used something like Mirco-SD, then yes, I'd probably get one.
<br/>
<br/>
To be honest this was a bit of a rant that I needed to get off my chest as it had been frustrating me, and thought it would make an interesting poll, maybe generate a little discussion.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

The mess is already there with all the patching for diffrent GBA slot and flashcard solutions, so having another format does not really matter. As far as I can see, the NoPass-flashcarts accept clean ROMs - which is actually the only and original standard. As I described in the other thread, the "messing with the header" is already done and could easily be integrated into ndstool.

I really don't understand that piracy point. Obviously, <span style="font-weight: bold">all</span> solutions were designed for piracy, so what's the difference? All these devices are produced by the same type of shady chinese companies noone really wants to support.
<br/>
The same reasons GBA slot solutions are better for homebrew also makes them better for piracy: Huge memory, fast write speeds, etc. So, at the current state, UFP, etc are not too attractive for piracy. Just have a look at other, more piracy-centric forums and you'll find many reviews which say the UFP isn't too good for that.
<br/>
<br/>
I like UFP for development though because
<br/>
<br/>
- it is easy to use (compile, write ROM with one click and run on DS),
<br/>
- "clean ROM" is the only standard and guarantees no mess,
<br/>
- i like to have my code on a single standard-sized cart, it just feels better and is great for demonstration and giving away copies.
<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that UFP &amp; co will increase homebrew development because a single cart solutions is more attractive and simpler to use than all that whateverMe stuff. At least me found it all too confusing and just started developing when the UFP came out.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'd go even further and say that clean ROM should become the standard for homebrew and anything else should come with a description of which extra device (GBA cart with certain SRAM type, SD card, etc) it requires.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My main reason would be Amadeus' DS Mem. This device considerably expands the possbilities allowed by the DS by providing additional memory in addition to MicroSD support.

In my opinion the DS Mem is the future and should be targetted in the long run. A lot currently problematic homebrew would definitely benefit from havign extra memory to work with...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

<br/>
<br/>
It's possible to make homebrew work on them, and my guess is that if enough people buy them, libraries will be developed to make it work. But a boycott is pointless...people who are interested in homebrew, will see they are a poor choice, and not buy them. People who don't care about homebrew, won't care about a boycott either.
<br/>
<br/>
I say if anyone asks about flashcarts, we clearly say these are a poor choice, and why it's not a good idea for homebrew. That should be enough. Things like the DS-X or NinjaDS seem like the best solution, since they take micro/mini-SD cards, and NinjaDS apparently already has libfat support (even though it's not really widely available yet)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, I've seen several adverts, and e-mailed the companies basically to be told they don't care. They've then pointed me to some rom forums which have reviews praising the device.
<br/>
<br/>
The original PassMe wasn't a piracy device, it was made soley for homebrew. It just so happened that the SuperCard gang and the M3 people worked out a way to use it to run romz. When DS homebrew first started the only option was a GBA Flash cart, which I'll admit were mainly piracy based, or a GBAMP. Hell the Supercard and the M3 could be perfect homebrew devices, if they didn't update the patchers.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

these devices are well specced: they have exactly the same specs as official DS carts, you can use clean ROM and assume a standard 2M eeprom is available, no patching required. of course these specs are not too exciting, neither for homebrew nor for war3zz, "media devices" offer much more possiblities.
<br/>
but for certain applications, like demonstration and even distribution, this is just the best solution: an affordable single-ROM standalone cart that acts and looks like a normal DS cart. i think this niche is actually the only interesting market for UFP, it's more like a proof of concept ("we are the first to make a real DS flashcart") and i'm sure other, more expensive products with fancy extras will follow soon
<br/>

As for boycotting.. if your going to do it.. do it based on the manufacturer, not the device type.  Like the Ultra Flash Pass people.. they ONLY care about piracy..  So.. let's not support their devices and warn people from purchasing them.  The more devices that come out, the more questions like "I can't get xxx homebrew to work on my Ultra Flash Pass" and there will be 100 posts saying "yeah, because they don't support homebrew".
<br/>
<br/>
If a manufacturer states that the device will support homebrew, a few people get them, and it does.. then there is no reason to boycott them, just because they offer a slot-1 solution.
<br/>
<br/>
So, boycott the piracy promoters, not the device type.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Isn't it the nature of homebrew development that it is not regulated and that standards develop in a free, "evolutionary" process? If someone likes to develop for a device, he/she just sits down, starts programming until it works and shares the result. If you don't like UFP, etc, just don't buy it and don't support it, but why tell others their effort is not welcome?
<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to become independent from piracy devices, you would have to design and produce a cart that is not compatible with commercial ROMs. As far as I can see, the only solution for that would be a memoy smaller than most commercial games, anything else would get patched sooner or later.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hopefully if the Neokey 4 SD(or whatever its called) is cheap, it might be a nice alternative, since it uses SD cards and doesn't need flashme or anything.

It would be nice if developers incorperated the rumble pack or the (rumored) motion sensor into homebrew, since 1st party developers miss a lot of great oppertunities for games with these gimmicks.

Wow.. I didn't read that thread.. and I agree, that information (what I skimmed through in your quotes on the post) is over the top.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong.. I love the plug for my site.. and I love the fact that even though ndshb.com hasn't been updated as much as I would like (I have been to busy lately.. looking for a job) it it still a success in my opionion and receives a lot of hits (Daily Average hits = 67297, Daily Average visits = 2478 for the month of July)  I just wish there were more people willing to help support the site.. but that is another topic.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.. back to the topic.. First.. if you contact a manufacturer.. and their replay is PIRATE only!  that's a pretty big sign that they don't care at all about homebrew and should be avoided at ALL COST!   Specially when there are alternatives available.
<br/>
<br/>
I have never disagreed that if it wasn't for piracy, we wouldn't have many of the homebrew devices we have because there is not enough money in homebrew to support the manufacturing costs of some of these devices.  But, just because I understand that process, doesn't mean I have to agree or support it.  I mean, no matter what device you have (if it was manufactured, not hand built) it was not manufactured for homebrew!  The demand just isn't there.  If it wasn't for Chishm, we wouldn't have the GBA MP!  Now, if it was sold for "movie piracy" or not, I don't know.. but it wasn't (and still isn't) made for homebrew.  We are just lucky that there are people in the homebrew community with the skills to make things work they way we would like.
<br/>
<br/>
So, to say not to purchase any device designed for ROM/GAME pirating would mean you can purchase 2 devices.  A PassMe1 and GBA MP..  But, then your screwed because it doesn't work on new DSs..  So now what?  You are left with only one option.  Buy a device that was designed for pirating.
<br/>
<br/>
So, how do you choose which device for pirating you should buy?  Well, start with one that is at least made by a manufacturer that acknowledges HOMEBREW is out there.  One that is actually ABLE to run homebrew!  So, if we don't want to get to the point where we have a "BAN" list of devices NOT to purchase, just keep with the "SUGGESTED" devices that work and are as low cost as possible (Including shipping).
<br/>
<br/>
Like owning a gun, it's not illegal to have it (in the USA and most places), but it IS illegal to kill someone with it (in the USA and most places).
<br/>
<br/>
Just because we are forced to purchase a device that was designed for pirating, doesn't mean we have to use it for that..  As long as it has FULL homebrew capability, I'm happy.  If it doesn't, then don't support it.  We just need to try to make sure EVERYONE knows about these PIRATE ONLY devices so that they don't purchase them.. and then we get 100+ posts complaining about how they can't get homebrew to run on them because they only bought it for pirating.. oh.. but check out this cool homebrew I'd like to try...  ahh.. it doesn't work.. :(
<br/>
<br/>
If someone has a good suggestion on how a list could be made (even if a wiki) I'll be happy to post/install/whatever on ndshb.com.  Or, if someone is already working on it, give me the URL and i'll add a link so people will know.  Most people wanting to do homebrew will at least search a little bit.. so if we can make the information as wide spread as possible, it will increase the chances of them seeing it, and either A) not purchasing the device, or if they already did, B) not post a message asking for help, as they will already know homebrew won't run in it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What about the NoPass devices? I don't think they are considered piracy tools, as they can't be used on their own for much. A MaxMediaLauncher is still the same price or cheaper than passme2&amp;clones, and it is reported to work with GBAMP, even on newer DS's</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Neither do I, but the PDF in question claims that all NoPass cards are made by pirate <span style="font-style: italic">companies</span>.

Yes I do use the MAX Media Launcher + GBAMP with my cousin's DS (v4). My boeuf was solely with the anti-piracy extremist views expressed in that PDF.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

If you're going to use one Datel product (Action Replay, rebranded as GameShark in some markets), you might as well use the easiest Datel product (MAX Media Launcher). Using any Datel products won't please the purists. Besides, PassMe2 has been out for a year; if PassMe2 with pak swapping were viable, it would already have been done.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

To find registers we reverse enginneer dumps, but to dump games we need to find the correct registers.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's my point exactly.  Every commercial device was made for piracy.  M3 and SC were both made for piracy..  GBA Flash Carts were made for piracy.. and we can't really ban all devices for piracy or we wouldn't have homebrew at all.  Homebrew has always needed piracy, I've always said that.  If piracy didn't exist, we'd have 2 or 3 people that home built a GBA Flash Cart, and hopefully 1 or 2 of those people would have build the FPGA passthrough.. and the rest of us would be sitting on the side watching videos of people running homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
So, again, I don't say to "ban" the device type.. Like NoPass, just find the companies that only care about piracy and "ban" them.  And if there is a company that promotes homebrew on their devices.. aka, homebrew works and they aknowledge that, you promote that company.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as Datel is concerned.. the MML had a flaw (click-in slot) but other than that, I'd promote their devices.  Competition is the industry is tuff.. But, if you purchase their 4GB harddrive, it has links listed to homebrew sites.  Sure, it needs a LOT of help to be fully homebrew compatible, but they didn't need to have to links listed.  They could have not even mentioned Homebrew.. so the fact that their stuff is selling at major stores like Best Buy and your average joe can walk in and say, "hmm. what's this thing?".. take it home, pop it in and see a diretory that will "teach" them about homebrew.. I'm all for it.. and I think everyone else should be as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Any other commercial products that actually even mention homebrew in them?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Pretty clear cut imo.  If there's no homebrew compatibility, there won't be any homebrewers.  Just pirates.  If there are no homebrewers on a device, there's no need to reverse engineer drivers.  A boycott really wouldn't accomplish anything, since homebrewers wouldn't buy that device in the first place.

Unfortunately, homebrewers usually also look for the cheapest solutions. Currently DS-X is one of the most expensive solutions. It's not crazy expensive, but it is a bit on the steep side.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
