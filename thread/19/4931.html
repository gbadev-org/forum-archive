    <h4>#35003 - Series-8 - Sat Jan 29, 2005 7:08 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heres the concept:
<br/>
<br/>
A GBA style cartridge, fits into the Expansion bay on the DS. (aka GBA game bay)
<br/>
<br/>
It has the following properties:
<br/>
<br/>
-64MB DRAM type memory
<br/>
-64MB FLASH type memory
<br/>
-a memory controller, serial port (external on cart).
<br/>
<br/>
The DS has only 4 Megs of memory.
<br/>
simply put, its not enough for Linux to work with in an interactive/GUI style system. Its certanly enough for embedded apps, and games but doing a multi-tasking OS is going to be neigh impossible.
<br/>
Linux needs more memory and swap. For example; even surfing the web is highly impractical for such a memory constrained environment.
<br/>
<br/>
What the DS needs is more hardware addressable memory! lots of it.
<br/>
The Boot cart will be the small NDS type, and simply be a small ROM baised 'boot-loader' for the RAM/FLASH cart which contains the real OS Kernel, and filesystems.
<br/>
<br/>
It will all run off the GBA slot cart. (except for initial boot-up)
<br/>
<br/>
What I am unshure of is:
<br/>
<br/>
-What is the maximum speed the GBA slot is capible of?
<br/>
-How much bandwidth can it provide, given its limited IO?
<br/>
Is it even practical?
<br/>
<br/>
Experts please, answer as you know best.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, really, using the term "linux" in general and saying it is bloated is kinda non-specific. It can be as un-bloated as DOS if you want very little functionality. Also, firefox is made out of candy and angels and I will not tolerate any bad words about it :P
<br/>
<br/>
However, in the context, getting anything useful out of any operating system requires some space that might not be availiable ever on the DS. While it may be a bonus for many reason to develop on a known OS, I still think its totally not needed on the DS and just a good open source library is a better use of time.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, personally, I would have to have a very good reason to buy any hardware that allowed me to have more memory to run homebrew software (or linux or whatever) on the DS. I was talking a while ago about willingness to mod-chip a DS to run howebrew software and generally it was disliked, and so would be a device for extra memory. Any software that is homebrewn (a word I just invented) must be able to run on as close to the original hardware as possible for wide acceptance (and by that i mean a flash card or multiboot) or else it's just not worth it.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - as a stray opinion - I run linux on my PC, I like linux, linux is sweet, but running linux on my DS - couldn't care less.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

Shure you can run Linux with 4MB.

You can't run too many apps, or much GUI stuff with only 4MB, yeah it can be done but it would be VERY constraining.

A normal site today has CSS, a bunch of images, some javascript, and HTML 4.1 code. On top of a GUI it is very likely going to be more than 2mb. Oh, and if you haven't figured out by now, I am pissed off, but I'm not dumb enough to flame you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No one knows for sure how Linux might run on the DS yet, for one simple reason, IT ISNT POSSIBLE YET. Speculation is just that, speculation.

If you want weird comparisons, I had an old 486 with 4 megs of ram. It ran windows 3.1, trumpet winsock (just to connect to the internet), and Netscape just fine. The DS, with some workings, can probably do it. But as I said, no one knows how it will handle the load.

But even if you get uClinux running, multitasking will be a problem due to the lack of MMU. I'am guessing that X server and graphical applications will be complicated to add without the use of a MMU.

X will not be very optimal for the DS anyway, since it cannot utilize the tile capabilities of the DS properly.

Just look at the built in DS menu system and pictochat. Graphical, practical, and somewhat good looking, yet extremely memory conserving (the built in DS software is what, 32kB?). The Nintendo programmers did a good job there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I feel the need to point out one very, very important detail to all of the people who remember running X or Y on an ancient machine with Z megs of memory:
<br/>
<br/>
PC's have *virtual memory*, and a nice relatively fast hard drive to swap to.  The DS has no such tertiary store.  Win3.1 would barely even boot in 4 MB of memory with zero swap, let alone a session of X and any window manager, with some browser, etc...  You can get a linux kernel running in 4 MB no problem, but getting userland software that wasn't designed for real-time systems will be a big problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Someone suggested an option cart with extra RAM and flash, and this would be required for an even remotely useful linux install.  Ampz also pointed out that the DS doesn't have an MMU (I dunno if I agree with that assertion, since CP15 could be considered one), but it certainly doesn't have the sort of MMU that linux expects (no paging hardware for virtual memory, etc..., so you have to do all that in software, fun and slow, and you need a place to stick the pages, which as I pointed out earlier, we don't have).
<br/>
<br/>
Before someone suggests using a GBA flash cart, since, hey, they're rewritable, they are extremely slow to erase and reprogram, and can only be erased in large blocks (it varies from card to card, but I'd imagine bank size is around 256 KB, with erase times on the order of a second)
<br/>
<br/>
I don't really care either way about linux on the DS, but please consider what you want it for and do the research (and stop posting suggestions about how to make X useful, thats a long way in the future, you have to make the OS itself useful *first*).  I certainly won't be using it, but I did consider porting it, until I found out the $1000 prize wasn't real.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">-What is the maximum speed the GBA slot is capible of? 
<br/>
<br/>
On the GBA, 2/1 waits, i.e. 5.6 MHz async, 8.4 MHz sync.
<br/>
<br/>
-How much bandwidth can it provide, given its limited IO? 
<br/>
16 bit wide bus, so approx. 16 MB / sec bandwidth theoretical maximum.  
<br/>
<br/>
In practice, you have some time taken away for SDRAM refresh cycles (unless you use a sufficiently fast chip that you can do it in between the DS accesses), and any time you skip addresses you get the added async penalty while the mux bus transfers the new address.  Using the cart as added random access memory gives you a maximum 'direct' (as the CPU sees it) access window of 32 MB, while using it as a paging drive would give you a more reliable high bandwidth (since you're writing 4 KB seq at a time, or whatever).
<br/>
<br/>
These numbers are for the GBA, I dunno how the WAIT_CR reg works on the DS yet, it seems to behave differently for ARM7 and ARM9, but I haven't done any benchmarks yet.  They could have kept the number of waits constant, and thus given us a faster bus, changed the number of waits (to maintain the speeds the GBA was capable of), or added new settings (in addition to doing one of the first two options).
<br/>
<br/>
-Is it even practical? 
<br/>
Sure you can make a cart with SDRAM, a refresh controller, and an interface circuit.  It's going to cost a lot, and needs to be standardized (interface specs) unless you want people to write a driver for each such 'drive'.  You can drive the price down by making a lot, but where is the market?  The only reason GBA flash carts are so cheap is the massive quantities they're sold in (thanks to piracy, sadly).  This has a side effect of letting homebrewers get cheap hardware, but something like this, with no real potential benefit to piracy, isn't going to get picked up and mass-produced by them.
<br/>
<br/>
Homebrewers are realistically a very tiny market.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if u need "hard drive space" as such, as in memory u can load code from and write back to quickly i have an idea that may or maynot work...
<br/>
i suggested this to the DSLinux group a couple of days ago, but no reply yet, so mayb someone here might give it a try
<br/>
<br/>
would it be possible to put a PCB in the casing of a DS card or otherwise which connects to a SD or other card? SD cards and writers are much easier to get than gba flash cards and entire code up to the size of the SD card could be loaded straight to the DS instead of redirecting to the GBA slot
<br/>
<br/>
was just thinking about my gba movie player and how it uses CF cards and thought a similar idea would work well

Why would everyone want to run Linux? I know it's cool but as some pointed out, there are other OSes more suited to that kind of memory constricted environment; take eCos for instance.
<br/>
Of course, the hype about Linux is that there are tons of already running apps ...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess people have reasons for getting Linux to run on everything. It is open-source, so anyone who has the knowledge of the hardware and software (and experience, one would hope) and a lot of spare time can modify the Linux kernel to run on whatever. iPod Linux? Go figure. People want to see what they can do. I found xbox-linux to be more of a stab at Microsoft than it was to just have a functional Linux distribution running on what is basically a PC. Some people are just Linux fanatics who want to be able to use Linux wherever the hell they are in the world. 
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose another reason is that Linux somehow became the "cool" thing to run. I understand why, sure, but not on everything. Linux is a wonderful desktop OS (I generally don't use it, but I've NEVER had a problem running it), and is very well suited for server applications. I just don't get why anyone would want a highly portable (and I mean portable as in you can take it anywhere ;) Linux distribution. I bought my DS for a few reasons. One, I love handheld gaming systems. Two, I really liked the whole wireless gaming thing (and the possible tunneling applications). Finally, three, I want to get into development (I started working on GBA stuff, but work got in the way, and just never really felt like going anywhere with it). I didn't buy my DS so that I could run Linux on it. I don't feel like a geek sitting on the bus/train playing my DS, but I certainly would if I hauled it out to mess around with Linux. 
<br/>
<br/>
If I want portable Linux, I'll get a laptop. Otherwise, leave my gaming handheld be. 
<br/>
<br/>
I think I strayed a bit off topic. My point was supposed to be that Linux is the "cool" thing, and people seem to think if they can run Linux on their wristwatch (no wait, I didn't say that, don't try... please?) it makes them "1337." And because Linux is open-source, some people want to take that source code and try and port it to systems it was NEVER intended to be run on (well, maybe not NEVER, but uh, you get the idea).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My point with Linux is it then lets you take complete control of the machine you're running it on. iPod Linux adds photo browsing, extra games, extra format support, all stuff Apple doesn't officially condone.
<br/>
<br/>
It's really about choice, and anyone who just wants to be a Linux fanboy and go "OMFGWTF I have Linux on my jockstrap" can, but primarily I feel it's about getting the most use out of your machine.
<br/>
<br/>
I personally think it'd be nice to have a sub-$300 portable machine with a touch screen and Wifi capabilities.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, for the people who say this is a waste of time and Linux is for nerds: Have you forgotten what this board is for?
<br/>
<br/>
As for reinventing the wheel: Why? ?Clinux has done most of the hard work of running Linux on an ARM, there's still device drivers but with work and effort it can get done.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't confuse this with "I want Linux on my jockstrap". The worst Linux fanboyism here appears to be coming from people who use primarily Windows at home anyway.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What is the maximum speed the GBA slot is capible of? 
<br/>
<br/>
On the GBA, 2/1 waits, i.e. 5.6 MHz async, 8.4 MHz sync.
<br/>
<br/>
-How much bandwidth can it provide, given its limited IO? 
<br/>
16 bit wide bus, so approx. 16 MB / sec bandwidth theoretical maximum.  
<br/>
<br/>
In practice, you have some time taken away for SDRAM refresh cycles (unless you use a sufficiently fast chip that you can do it in between the DS accesses), and any time you skip addresses you get the added async penalty while the mux bus transfers the new address.  Using the cart as added random access memory gives you a maximum 'direct' (as the CPU sees it) access window of 32 MB, while using it as a paging drive would give you a more reliable high bandwidth (since you're writing 4 KB seq at a time, or whatever).
<br/>
<br/>
These numbers are for the GBA, I dunno how the WAIT_CR reg works on the DS yet, it seems to behave differently for ARM7 and ARM9, but I haven't done any benchmarks yet.  They could have kept the number of waits constant, and thus given us a faster bus, changed the number of waits (to maintain the speeds the GBA was capable of), or added new settings (in addition to doing one of the first two options).
<br/>
<br/>
-Is it even practical? 
<br/>
Sure you can make a cart with SDRAM, a refresh controller, and an interface circuit.  It's going to cost a lot, and needs to be standardized (interface specs) unless you want people to write a driver for each such 'drive'.  You can drive the price down by making a lot, but where is the market?  The only reason GBA flash carts are so cheap is the massive quantities they're sold in (thanks to piracy, sadly).  This has a side effect of letting homebrewers get cheap hardware, but something like this, with no real potential benefit to piracy, isn't going to get picked up and mass-produced by them.
<br/>
<br/>
Homebrewers are realistically a very tiny market.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I think the only reason I pointed out anything about the iPod Linux thing was mostly because I really don't see it having any point, other than "look at what we did." Sure, you can play some games (which would probably work better on a handheld gaming console, but thats besides the point), and a picture browser. Why would I want to look at greyscale pictures on my iPod? I'd rather use a PDA.

I don't know if you could port any Linux distro to the DS, but certainly a custom OS could be done on the DS with multitasking and a GUI.(hey, Windows 3.1 probably didn't have much more memory to work with, and old PDAs didn't have more to work with either, current cell phone still don't, and the gba carts are fairly speedy so that could help with the lack of memory a bit, even though they're not writable but if streaming works for GTA, it can work for an OS)
<br/>
<br/>
Browsing the web could certainly be a problem though, when websites and even pictures on websites can exceed 4MB.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The EZ Flash 3 includes 128MBit (16MByte) of writable RAM on it. I know very few people have it, so if you required it, it wouldn't help many people, but maybe make it optional to give your apps more memory.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as web browsing, perhaps having a proxy server of some sort that downsampled images, and stripped javascript &amp; css would make a web browser more doable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Even Commodore 64 had GEOS: a mouse driven Windows-like (or Mac-like, whichever way you wish to look at it) desktop environment - running with the massive memory amount of 64 kB! Afaik it could run a few programs simultaneously. I never actually tried it, just what I remember out of screenshots. It might have been ran out of cartridge with something extra, but certainly not 4MB.
<br/>
<br/>
DS displays total of only 256 x 384 pixels (C64: 320 x 200). Thus you don't need as much memory for the display as you need on desktop, so you have to consider that when doing comparison.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the browser, Opera might work in DS if Linux ran on it. Unfortunatenaly Opera isn't very optimized for Linux, it is much faster on Windows environment. WAP browser might work on DS the best.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But overall, having Linux running on DS has only COOL! factory in it. I don't know or can't think of any real use for it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">dont get me wrong, i LOVE modding my consoles, and have even published some articles on some seriously hardcore modding (im the first documented person to pc-casify and xbox - and all my main consoles - xbox, gamecube and dreamcast are linuxed up)...but linux...on a DS?
<br/>
<br/>
get real! even on the xbox and DS, 3d accelerated video isnt supported etc etc, so the cpu is almost always doing the work - and browsing even on the xbox, being at near pc specs is a dog. sure it works properly, but i wouldnt wanna use it as a main system...
<br/>
<br/>
and the argument about it being the only option for sub $150 SSH. well, by the time uve got the stuff to flash it, i doubt itll still be $150...and theres another option...
<br/>
<br/>
smartphones. in the UK u can get a c500 for litterely pennies - or free on an upgrade on a contract. i Myself have a M2000 (aka xdaIIs aka PDA2k) and that has wifi/bt/gprs etc, and coz its windows CE, theres a mountain of freeware/shareware apps.its a better resolution than the DS, a hella lot more power (400mhz, 128meg ram, ive got a 1gig SD in the top) and its got a slide out keyboard. yeh, sure, dslinux is great for one upmanship, be seriously, if your gonna try and justify doing it for leggit reasons, get real... you could have yourself a pda with the ability to use VNC, remote desktop, logme in etc...with out much more cost, and a lot less fecking around.
<br/>
<br/>
also, has ANYONE considered CE for the DS? i know thats not cool, but its arm from the ground up, its mostly open (MS Shared source) - its designed for touch screen etc etc - its a MUCH more sensible choice - and hell, its already running on systems that make the DS look like powerhouses, its gotta be worth a shot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, it's a good idea that they're starting with linux. The fact that it's simple and that it can easily be programmed makes it a choice canidate for the first steps into an OS on the DS.
