    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok but look at this guys:
<br/>
20.12.2005 :Shipping will close from 25th to 27th
<br/>
17.12.2005 :M3 Adapter shipping schedule
<br/>
We know that most of you have been waiting for the M3 adapter so long . The manufacturer has very limited supply of the product ( seems like hand made precious) but the demand is huge. Therefore , we can only ship out the back orders when the new shipment has arrived. We should able to receive the M3 around 24th Dec , we will advise the tracking number to you when the order has been shipped. Thanks for your patience waiting and sorry for any inconvenience caused due to the delay. frown.gif smile.gif</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If tepples has any sense he would ban joey now!
