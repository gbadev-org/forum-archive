    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The WMP54G has different versions, only one of the versions is the correct chipset.  Check if your box has a V4 after the WMP54G, if it doesn't, then you don't have the correct version.  This is explained on the ralink rt2500 devices page <a class="postlink" href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">http://ralink.rapla.net/</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Your message is a little hard to understand, but I think you're saying that dsPaint works and other programs that you've tried don't?
<br/>
<br/>
Programs will only work with the passthrough method if they've been specifically compiled to do so. A lot of the files around are just simple binaries, so they'll work on an emulator, but they won't work with this method.
<br/>
<br/>
Try some of the following; unless I'm misremembering, they should all work with the passthrough method...

<br/>
<br/>
People usually name files that will work with the passthrough ".ds.gba", and files that won't ".bin". That's not always the case, though....

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">okay i understand what you say my wifi card is right and so like i said
<br/>
ONLY DS PAINT works
<br/>
When i use f2apower writer to send files to my gba cartridge (except DS PAINT) i've got a message like this "read file 32k error game file might corrupt" (I try for example natrium's battleship or pong and some other but no way to make it work....)(some are in format file.ds.gba and other in file.bin....)
<br/>
I can't send anything else except DS PAINT..
<br/>
I format my card everytime in full format
<br/>
I've got only one file on the flashcard
<br/>
<br/>
Thank for your help</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Only file.ds.gba's will work, the .bins are for emulators.  Other then that, I don't know why dsPaint would work, and others not.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you erasing your cartridge properly?? When you attach to powerwriter, on the GBA press select + A =&gt; then press down on d-pad =&gt; then press A to erase the cartridge truly (just selecting delete in power writer does NOT work).
<br/>
<br/>
FYI I have tried all these demos using passme original (now I have firmware installed no longer need passme - THANKS TO COSTIS, LOOPY, DARKFADER + NE1 else involved!!!! - works a treat :)) - on 64meg F2A Ultra , on 128meg F2A Ultra =&gt; I have had absolutely no probs other than powerwriter crashing occasionally when burning (version 2.4 powerwriter does not like my flash carts but it's possible to get round it by reinstalling over the top of powerwriter each time I need to flash ds stuff - funnily enough works fine with old school GBA stuff - why it is weird I have no idea and don't care - so long as ultimately I have a way to work with it :)!)
