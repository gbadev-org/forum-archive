You have to load homebrew stuff with a GBA flashcard because the DS checks for a RSA encryption. Our homebrew files don't have they arn't signed with the nintendo key. Thats why it hangs on the nintendo logo. Nintendo demos can load because they HAVE been signed with the nintendo key.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree. I personally use "WiFiMe" to refer to the pass-through method to load code from the GBA cart, and "wireless multiboot" to refer to loading complete .nds roms over WiFi. It'll be hard (for noobs anyway) to keep this straight because the same wmb.exe program is used for both activities.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
