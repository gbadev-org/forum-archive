    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello!
<br/>
<br/>
I've had this problem a long time now... 
<br/>
I'm a noob so i don't know exactly what to do with it. 
<br/>
I've tried to update, installing and re-format again and again and again! 
<br/>
But nothing ever seems to work.
<br/>
<br/>
So I got the Nintendo DS lite with R4-SDHC, MicroSD 8G v1.25.
<br/>
In the beginning I transfered games into a Game folder that I created,
<br/>
It worked well!
<br/>
I also tranfered Music on to the MicroSD, 
<br/>
but not in any folder.
<br/>
So when i opend the Multimedia, the Music was there, with all the other folders: _system_ and yeah, the others.
<br/>
<br/>
The message who came up said that I couldn't listen to it cause i missed something from the Moonshell folder.
<br/>
Then I started to noticed on the screen below everytime I went to the Multimedia: 
<br/>
<br/>
''An error was detected while trying to accsess the disc or a file. Please confirm the followings:
<br/>
Did the setup end normally?
<br/>
Is the ''/moonshl'' folder moved or deleted?
<br/>
Have you enabled the resume function with a media that is not supported?
<br/>
Do you have enough free space on your media?
<br/>
Please re.format the media and try again.
<br/>
Please try with a different media from another manufacturer.''
<br/>
<br/>
On the top screen it says that It can't fint the moonshl folder, even though I know I have it cause I have installed it a thousand times...
<br/>
After I tried to install a new one, i can't even enter Multimedia. But befor I could, even with the message poppin up. The Games work fine, but not Multimedia.
<br/>
<br/>
And another thing, the Themes worked fine before i re-format the MicroSD, now it's just plain purple all over the screen and I can't even see the icons for Games, Multimedia, Boot Slot-2.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please Help!
<br/>
