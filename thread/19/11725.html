    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Flashing the DS means overwriting the existing firmware of the DS with another one. This firmware resides in a memory space that is called "flash memory" (thats where the name comes from) or more technically called nvram.
<br/>
<br/>
The new firmware that is installed this way can i.e. (see FlashMe) removes the requirement to use other PassMe methods to run homebrew ds software from the gba slot.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Please folks, stop it with all this trojans mention! It causes much turmoil about what is currently practically nothing.
<br/>
Though, yes, flashing your DS with FlashMe is very convenient and gives you a layer of protection if something goes awry. (A chunk of the firmware is protected so can only be flashed if the user says so, so Flashme's protected sector contains the right code so it can still be recovered even if everything else is broken).
<br/>
<br/>
If you are using a DS Lite, FlashMe is reported to be a tad more dangerous, but with an original NDS, it is completely safe.
<br/>
With both, it's pretty hard to screw up; just keep your wits about you.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I disagree.  Trojans should be mentioned as much as possible, and people need to know that it IS a possibility as the proof of concept showed!!!  Do you even understand what could have happened if the proof of concept was never shown?  We'd have thousands of people only using NoPass devices without FlashMe, as there would be no reason at all to have it, and a trojan released.  Think about what the effects on the homebrew scene would be then?
<br/>
<br/>
And if you think it wasn't possible, look at the internal fighting that is going on?  I'm sure it wouldn't have taken much for one pissed off dever that has a highly used homebrew project to destroy thousands of DSs in a single day, weekend or week.  The threat is real.  Install FlashMe and not worry about it.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the DS-Lite being any more dangerous?  It's not.  Just insulate your tool and your just as safe as ever.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
