    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, The WFC ID is not even tied to a DS in any way.   If you completely back up the WFC ID settings with a homebrew program, and restore it onto another DS, the WFC ID will function exactly like it.  (It will be the same).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do plan on reverse engineering the conversion of the Firmware data into the 16 digit WFC ID number. However, All of the games with the capability do not seem to work properly on no$gba for this purpose.
<br/>
<br/>
FF3 DS - Save type not emulated properly, and results in saver error at startup.
<br/>
Clubhouse games - Gets though setup, but locks up at the saving routine, so, I can't get to its multiplayer menu.
<br/>
Mario Kart DS - crashes at startup.
<br/>
<br/>
(I haven't tried all of the WFC capable games yet.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Flashing your DS preserves Wi-Fi settings. If you do not insert your <span style="font-style: italic">Animal Crossing: Wild World</span> Game Card while using FlashMe, there is no way that your town will be harmed. The worst that can happen is a new Friend Code, and even that's not likely.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
