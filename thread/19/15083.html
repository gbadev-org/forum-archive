    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can I make my own RAM cartridge out of an old gba game by formating it by running some sort of program from my r4ds. If so how much memory would I get out of an old GBA game. May sound like a really stupid question and that I may not know what i'm talking about but i'm just curious.
<br/>
<br/>
Also if I could do this what would be the functions and limitaions of a RAM card this size?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

About 32 kilobytes or so, and it wouldn't be bootable. PocketNES is known to do this for "SRAM cannibalism."
