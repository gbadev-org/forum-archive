    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just sold my PSP and got a DS lite. I was researching this homebrew stuff, and its kind of confusing. So I have some questions. If I get the SuperCard SD, 256mb SD card, and SuperKey, will I be good for homebrew? Like will it be able to run all homebrew, instead of my DS being flashed? Also, will it mess up my DS?

(I know sum1 made a post similar to mine, but I started a new one cuz Im using different materials, so plz dont go krazy over it)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, you're good to go. But I recommend that you get a Supercard Lite instead. It fits without the top portion sticking out unlike the older Supercards, which were designed for the DS. Still, you can the older ones if you want to. Also, if you're gonna use the DSL as a media player(moonshell) then get a media card w/a larger capacity.
<br/>
<br/>
And no, it's not gonna mess your DS. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Indeed. The SC: Rumble does not have the additional 32mb RAM the normal SC has. Without the additional RAM, homebrew programs will not work. And yes, the SC: Lite has the same capabilities as the normal SC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1. Very few homebrews use the additional RAM.
<br/>
2. Make sure you realize SC Lite takes different memory cards than the normal SC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GBA support on the SC isn't that bad, really. I haven't done much testing, but most stuff runs fine...
<br/>
<br/>
The extra memory is useful to have. Just because most homebrew doesn't use it, doesn't mean you should go and buy a DS-X or something yucky like that...
<br/>
<br/>
For a start, there's DSLinux. Being able to run a proper OS on the DS is a very useful thing, since it opens many doors..
<br/>
<br/>
Even if DSL isn't your thing, you never know when you want might to play about with that extra memory.<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI
