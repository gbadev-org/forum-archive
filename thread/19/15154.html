    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't seen anywhere on this site a mention of this product, but apparently it lets you play games, music, movies, etc. on your DS without the need of a pass key device or anything.

<a class="postlink" href="http://www.r4ds.com/index-en.htm" target="_blank">This</a> is the product's website and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VD8_fcCjJVk" target="_blank">this</a> is a video on YouTube showing some of its functionality (but the actual explanation doesn't start until one minute and twenty-four seconds in).

I just want to make sure that this is exactly what I want to buy before spending upwards of fifty dollars on it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Pretty much all modern flash cards don't require a passkey or anything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">not really. they range around 30 US dollars, and a micro SD, let's say 2 gig, runs around 15. that's 45 already, and that's before shipping.

<br/>
r4's just fine, it's one of the most in-demand products you can buy at the moment, and thus a bit hard to find in-stock anywhere right now.
<br/>
<br/>
if you can find an "M3 simply", it's quite literally the SAME exact thing.

As in literally the same hardware, just sold under a different name?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That plus a small change that prevents you from loading the other firmware (without modification at least).  In the first batches of both products, you could actually solder/desolder a few contact points to "transform" an R4 into an M3 Simply and vice versa.  This was corrected in later batches, but the underlying principle remains the same.
<br/>
<br/>
The N-card clones would be the ultimate in the "same card under different names" category but the R4/M3 Simply comes very close.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wouldn't recommend an N-Card though, they have horrible support.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
