(1) No, FlashMe has a check that recognizes known FW. Only when it knows the FW, will it allow to flash. It doesn't know the new FW yet.
<br/>
(2) WiFiMe doesn't work with iQue-type FW yet.
<br/>
(3) UnFlashMe has the original FWs embedded (they are the older versions). You can use my program to dump your FW after having booted with an iQue PassMe: <a href="http://www.natrium42.com/blog/?p=20" target="_blank">http://www.natrium42.com/blog/?p=20</a>
<br/>
(4) Heh.
<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if FlashMe is legal or not since it has parts of orignial FW. UnFlashMe has the entire copies of FW embedded. Since the author (Olimar/Loopy) doesn't have a DS with new FW, it's not supported since he doesn't have a dump for use in UnFlashMe.
<br/>
<br/>
Joat on the other hand is working on a complete FW replacement which is going to be more legal. Might take him a while without right tools like IDA Pro Disassembler. So please donate to him if you want to support the cause.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

also, i was thinking about getting an iQue Passme, but then i read that it will only wotk with the metriod prime demo, which i dont own, in fact, since i only recently bought a DS, all i own is Lunar.  what games does the iQue Passme actually work with?

where is joat posting progress on the new firmware replacement?  i would like to do what i can to help, although i cant donate (poor highschool student)  i will do what i can in testing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If the iQue firmware is really twice as big as J/U/E firmware, it might be because unlike in Japanese, you can't squeak by with r≈çmaji, hiragana, katakana, and a few Han characters (called "kanji" in Japanese); you have to have thousands of Han characters to render Chinese. I'm guessing that it would be easier to store glyphs for the most common Han characters in the firmware than to put them all in each DS Game Card, and iQue games freeze on J/U/E Nintendo DS systems because they can't find the Han font.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does this mean with a 'red firmware' DS like mine, you can use the current flashme/unflashme to effectively downgrade if you can boot it (eg, updated passme w/ metroid demo)? I assume it would need to be patched to bypass any checksum check...
<br/>
<br/>
The need for SRAM with passme is annoying.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been making the the same mistake, assuming the blue/red/pink DS was somehow more 'special' like the iQue more different than just a recompile of the normal firmware with range checking :)

Due to its design, which jumps into the .nds file on the cart, the new PassMe will have to be customized for each game. But it can likely be made to work with any one game if you send a copy of the game to be dumped and analyzed. Read above:

For now it works just with those two.
<br/>
<br/>
PassMe that will support more than one DS card is being worked on.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically it will have a list of games with the respective entry points needed to jump to exploited SWIs. The entry point will be chosen dynamically based on Game Code in the header. Support for many games probably won't fit into the CPLD chip, but I will try to fit in support for the popular ones.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unless Nintendo starts recompiling its games with several different sizes of dummy array in the startup code so that each title might have ten or more different ROM versions.

Or should I shut up so that Nintendo's Revenue/AntiPiracy Engineering department doesn't get any ideas?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
