You shouldn't need to actually patch the ROM you are flashing.  After he does this, upload the SRAM to your GBA flashcart that corresponds to WarioWare Touched...the easiest way for you to do this is probably to flash the gba file in this <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7301" target="_blank">thread</a>.  Pick the option corresponding to WarioWare (check the gamecard for the code needed, it should be written on there).  Then do as was said above (write your NDS homebrew to the cart), stick WarioWare into your PassMe, and if all went well  your PassMe2 should boot whatever DS homebrew you stuck on the GBA flashcart.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Heh.. I think he means "I don't know if you need to patch ROMZ for PassMe2.
<br/>
I do."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
1. Search for sram.bin file somewhere (the one for PassME2)
<br/>
<br/>
2. Load it in the X-ROM's SRAM via the FlashLinker. 
<br/>
<br/>
3. Insert PassME2 with the game in it's slot in to the NDS slot.
<br/>
<br/>
4. Insert X-ROM with HB in the NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
5. Turn on and play (I'd recommend using FlashME)!
<br/>
<br/>
That should work, I'm not sure though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
