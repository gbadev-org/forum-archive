    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've finally got hold of a wifi card (i wanted a pass me but couldn't wait any longer). Of which i have got to work with my EFA-linker with ease (the only problems being EFA-Linker doesn't like to be formated or writen to when in the DS meaning i have to take it out every write wearing out the connectors). The problem being that now i have it working i need a demo that works on it. I have so far only managed dspaint to run on it. Very good it is though. But now i need another demo with source so i can start from a place that i know that works on hardware. All the demos i've tried so far (including my own) just give me a white screen.

<br/>
I thought at first that it may be the extra loading part that is added to the beginning that i'm missing but i was under the impression this was added by the compiler.<br/>_________________<br/>Rolling a six is unlikely but how do you know if you have never picked up the dice.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've now downloaded lots of games with source. Had a look at the source and many have been very similar to my own all of which work on hardware however I still cannot get the ds.gba file that my compiler creates to run on hardware. What am i doing wrong if anyone has any surggestions or ideas about what i'm missing. But as far as i can tell everything should be working. If you want to try to compile one of the games i'm trying to get running download the source for Supa Dupa Break Out from my website (below) this works in ideas but i only get a white screen on hardware. I still think its something to do with the loading operation and capturing the arm9 processor.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
