What do you mean by "proprietary games"? Do you mean "freeware" (homebrew that does not come with source code), or do you mean games that are commercial and all-rights-reserved?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Ah, thanks! :)

That's good news, since I just bought a second Wifi card (with a correct chipset) for wifime.

With proprietary, I mean homebrewn, not-commercial or more specific: without a signature from Nintendo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

OK. I was just used to the FSF's definition of "proprietary" as "copyrighted and not licensed under terms that preserve users' freedom". The most common word to describe these programs is "unsigned", which refers to Nintendo's digital signature but coincidentally parallels the common use of "unsigned bands" to refer to musical groups that aren't in an exclusive recording contract with a record label.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
