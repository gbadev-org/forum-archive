    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought one of these little suckers for less than 20 bucks at a retail store. Comes with DS cart that supports a filing system for MP3 NDS and M3V. access is through a microSD card slot in the cart and supports up to 2 gb micro sd. Comes with a 128 mb card, a micro sd to usb adapter, and video encoding software on a mini cd. It even has about 25 homebrew games with it as well. Unfortunately, some software hasn't been made compatable with it, so it can be a hit or miss with some hombrew stuff. If original source code is available, then a recompile could work. As far as options go and price I see this one as a winner. You can't hardly beat $20 for a complete testing kit. I even bought an extra 1 gb micro SD card for it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, perhaps he doesn't know about the DLDI driver, so maybe someone should give him this link:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://dldi.drunkencoders.com/index.php?title=Datel_Games_" target="_blank">http://dldi.drunkencoders.com/index.php?title=Datel_Games_</a>'n'_Music_(microSD)
<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe he's just referring to all the homebrews released before the DLDI version of libfat or that use GBFS or PAFS or that are only available in .DS.GBA format.  There's lots of homebrews that won't work on the Games'n'Music or any other slot-1 card.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: As long as this topic is here, maybe I should use it to ask for some clarification on how usable the Games'n'Music is for homebrew.  Sometimes people ask me for recommendations on what flash card they should get and when these are people who I know really don't have any interest in piracy, it would be nice to be able to recommned the Games'n'Music instead of the R4 since it's the cheapest option and so easy to get, so they're just more likely to buy on and then they're hooked.
<br/>
<br/>
Does the GnM DLDI work with Chishm's loader, though, so that people can load homebrew through DSOrganize without having to pre-patch the files?  Because DLDI auto-patching is a really handy feature that I think a lot of people who are more casual in their homebrew consumption definitely need.  How about with DSCHannels?
<br/>
<br/>
And can either of those apps be used as a menu replacement?  I know the GnM can autoboot an NDS file in place of its regular menu if it has a certain name, but I seem to recall something about the DLDI driver not working if you don't load the homebrew from the regular GnM GUI.  Or at least not the v1 driver, does it work better with v2?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Games n' Music DLDI WILL work with the Chishm loader on DSOrganize 2.8 or 2.9.  It will not work with DSChannels though.  You can rename DSOrganize to "bootme.nds" and it will boot automatically, but since it takes a while to boot, I recommend just using the normal interface (which isn't that bad, just has your NDS icons and you double click them to run them).  The only bad parts is the slow speed (videos can lag sometimes) and poor card support (I've heard some microSD's don't work).<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dunno if recent DSO makes it so you don't have to rename to bootme.nds.  If so, it just was changed to make it so that it can handle the half assed way GnM sets up the DS prior to launching homebrew.  But, I would guess, you would still need to use the bootme.nds method for any other homebrew if you aren't launching it from DSO.
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, naming it bootme.nds bypasses the built in launcher and launches it directly.  Most homebrew work this way because the GnM built in launcher didn't screw with the hardware yet.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, DSO 2.9 works great through the main menu, but if you wish to use it instead of the GnM launcher then name it bootme.nds.

It would be good if Datel released a FW update for GnM that made it set up the hardware correctly, but I doubt that'd ever happen :(<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I'm still a bit confused.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I had things backwards and it's actually the case that most homebrew (that requires FAT access) won't work when loaded through the default GnM menu, but you can get around this by their renaming the homebrew in question BOOTME.NDS so that it loads up by default in place of the regular GUI or else by loading it through DSOrganize (which can now be loaded either as BOOTME.NDS or from the regular GnM GUI).  Is this all correct?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, in what way is DSOrganize slow to boot?  Do you mean that DSO itself boots up slowly or that homebrew booted through DSO loads slowly (which is something I've noticed about DSO on some cards)?  If it's that DSO itself boots up slowly, is it slower on the GnM than on other cards?
<br/>
<br/>
If you have a BOOTME.NDS file on your card, can you still go into the regular GnM menu at boot by holding a button or something like that?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for all the questions.  I know you guys aren't Datel Customer Support, but then Datel doesn't seem to have much customer support from what I've heard, so this is probbaly the only place I can get answers to these questions.

If you do, it starts up within a few seconds. Loading files, depending on the loader, takes between 1 and 20 seconds, rarely more than 2 though.

The Games n' Music menu seems like it sits there and thinks for a while before it boots bootme.nds, because it takes a long time for it to get from the GnM splash screen to DSOrganize's boot screen.  DSOrganize also boots slowly, but it works.
<br/>
<br/>
I prefer NOT using a bootme.nds, because most homebrew works fine from the main menu, and it loads much faster in most cases, but for those that don't boot right, you can always boot DSOrganize from the menu, then boot the app in DSO.
<br/>
<br/>
You can't go into the main menu if there's a bootme.nds, and, along the same lines, you can't use the GnM as a Passme by holding any buttons either, you have to remove the microSD card (or use a software passme that's on your card) to do Passme.
<br/>
<br/>
DSOrganize boots fairly well on my GBAMP, definitely faster than GnM, but not as fast as MoonShell.  I'm pretty sure I patched it with the GBAMP DLDI.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
