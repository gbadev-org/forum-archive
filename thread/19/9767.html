    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been researching for quite some time now and have come to some startling conclusions, I'm not much further today then I was when I started, arg. I'm getting a DS lite and what I'd like to be able to do with it is play the normal games and WiFi multiplayer online, and be able to play movies, music, photo's and dl applications, some rom's, homebrew apps, having the ability to backup my own games, etc. I really don't know how much or how deep I'll get into doing backups but would like to have that option and probably wouldn't ever create or write my own apps etc. I'm not too sure about the possiblities of "flashing or bricking" (sticking the drill bit/screwdriver/pin) it right now either. So when I first started out I thought well this GBAmp looked like this is all I'll need, but after much research it looks or appears to be limited and I first though of buying the SD version as I have many SD cards lying around, but it seems that the CF version is better as in the community has an easier time with the CF versions of most of these types of devices. So I guess I need some guidance as in what a person needs or doesn't need to do what I'd like to do. 
<br/>
<br/>
So the products I've been looking at have been: the M3 CF adapter or M3 mini SD vs the GBA mp CF, the Supercard CF or Supercard SD or Supercard SD mini, and SuperPass 2 vs PassKey 2 vs Datel's Max Media Launcher. 
<br/>
<br/>
And if possible some retailers that have descent pricing and delivery times, I've been looking at Kick, GamerSection, Jandaman's, Real Hot, Lik-Sang and Datel and it just doesn't seem at this time that' I'll be able to buy all these products from just one supplier as at this time much of these are in high demand and no one supplier seems to have them all in stock right now. Thanks for any and all help.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.mygamernews.com" target="_blank">http://www.mygamernews.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What do you mean by "some rom's"?

There are plenty of those, and most will work with any CF adapter.

"my own games" referring to games that you have developed, or to DS Game Cards that you have purchased?

This is a homebrew forum. We don't discuss backups here.

Almost all Nintendo DS homebrew will run on a GBAMP CF. Or are you planning on running GBA homebrew as well?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No probs on the backup thing, and I believe the rom's would prob fall under that as well, the cart's I'd want to backup would be my own anyway's I have quite a collection of GB games and GB color and GBA games and even before I have my DS lite yet I've already amassed a collection of those as well. I just thought it would be nice to have them all on a cart so I wouldn't have to have all those other carts with me is all I was thinking and that's why I was looking at something like a Supercard or something like that. 
<br/>
<br/>
Is there an end user difference between the M3 movie player and the GBAmp ? And also is there a difference between the CF and SD ones ? I'm starting from scratch so whatever the best one to use is fine, and I'm not that concerned with the astetics/looks either  I just want to get whichever the most community wide used is, is all.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.mygamernews.com" target="_blank">http://www.mygamernews.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unlike GBAMP v2, M3 and SuperCard can run GBA programs larger than about 200 KB and those DS programs that use appended (GBFS) data such as Heretic and Hexen. Unlike M3 SD, M3 CF and SuperCard CF are fully supported (read/write) by most homebrew. (The differences between SuperCard and M3 are minor and relate primarily to GBA support and battery life.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
