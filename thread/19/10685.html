    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This has been puzzling me for a while - why is it that when I try and manually delete .sav files from my CF card (when inserted into my PC's card reader) it will never delete the .sav files (it just hangs or crashes)?
<br/>
<br/>
Is this a PC/card reader problem or is there something 'special' about .sav files (as created with the SuperCard software)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
i suggest formating your card, so that it is fresh
<br/>
maybe then you won't have a problem?
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.
<br/>
it never happens to me<br/>_________________<br/>popcorn</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
