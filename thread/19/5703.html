    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering how large (not physically) will a commerical flashcard have to be to put about 4 comerical games? I bought a Powerstar 2 256 and was quite please that I could fit 2 large roms and maybe 4 smaller ones. Will the DS Commerical flashcards (hopefully comming out in the near future) be able to carry multiple roms? if so how many would be possible? How much will a ds rom take up when on a Ds flashcard?

I know concrete answers to this question are unavailable but I wouldnt mind any educated guesses...
