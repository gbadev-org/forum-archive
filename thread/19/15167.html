    <h4>#152215 - another world - Wed Mar 12, 2008 12:08 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can not seem to find a clear review of how the R4 Auto Patching works. I hope that some of the coders here could better explain it to me.
<br/>
<br/>
Is the R4 auto DLDI patch integrated into the firmware update? Or must I have the DLDI file in the root of my MicroSD for the firmware to auto patch it?
<br/>
<br/>
It seems like Homebrew works in either case so I'm a bit confused as to which it is. The homebrew works and while that is most important, I would like to understand why.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any help or links!

The DLDI mechanism is completely hidden from the user. Just start the DLDI enabled homebrew and it will work. The patch will be automatically applied in memory, the file itself keeps unchanged afaik.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
