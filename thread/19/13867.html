    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm thinking of buying a bigger MicroSD for my GnM, considering 128 is really small and I often corrupt it writing too much stuff on it.  Only problem is I've heard lots of cards don't work, and I'd like to buy one online, where they're cheap.
<br/>
<br/>
I've found a Kingston 2GB SDC/2GB microSD online for $21, the deal is great, but only if it's compatible.  Has anyone else tried this card, or know of any cheap 2GB microSD's that work on the GnM?<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to use a PNY 2 GB and most programs don't work with it.  Forexample, the emulators don't work, but they work in the 128mb card.  Also, that iPod looking app works on the 128mb card, but not the 2 gb.  Any suggestions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If it's just programs that don't work (as in, the menu reads it fine), use the Version 1 DLDI, on my friend's 1GB SanDisk, the V2 DLDI fails but the V1 works fine.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Where or how do I get this?  I went to chism's dldi page and there are a hundred different files.  Can you send me a direct link to it?  Would this be like the dlditool?  My "license" says version 2.  Thanks for the help.  Would I just repatch everything I want on the card?  Edit: Ack!  I went there and see nothing that says "Games n Music" and the only dlditool i see is the one I have.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
