    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Folks,
<br/>
<br/>
I have read <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.pocketheaven.com/DS_Bricker" target="_blank">http://wiki.pocketheaven.com/DS_Bricker</a>, which says that I need a "Flash Cart" with the flashme firmware on it.
<br/>
But the only thing I have is a working SuperCard (working verified on a GBA) and a PassMe v.1.5. I had flashme already running on my DS before it bricked.
<br/>
<br/>
Although I don't really know if it is really bricked. Symptoms are, that the green light goes on when I press the power button, but the screens remain blank, no backlight, green light keeps on. A+B+X+Y does not start the SuperCard menu, when powering on.
<br/>
<br/>
How to unbrick with a SuperCard?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by niemand on Thu Jan 19, 2006 8:23 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I don't really know if it is because of the firmware. Maybe it is defective hardware, I can't say. But I definitely tried a new commercial game (which ran quite well, indeed). After that one my NDS did not turn on again.
<br/>
<br/>
How can you distinguish between firmware corruption and device failure?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, it was another game, and I am using FlashMe which I installed September 2005 (So I guess &lt;verion5 ?)

Which says, that it is not possible to recover from SuperCard because of the SuperCard's menu. I guess, I need something else to flash.
<br/>
But my concern still is, if it is really just a broken firmware and not a broken device...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If the firmware itself is defective, does the DS at least turn on the screens (backlight, white color) or do the screens remain blank?
<br/>
In this case, is there even a chance to recover?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wow, the hardware is really not bricked. I got my DS running again :-D
<br/>
<br/>
I used a Flash2Advance USB Linker cable and flashed it using ucon64 (instead of the "PowerWriter" Windows software). Using ucon64 (Linux version!!! Windows version does not support USB, yet) made it possible to write the flashme.nds without any GUI in front of it.
<br/>
I used the command
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">ucon64 -xf2a -port=usb flashme.nds</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
to write the working flashme onto the Flash2Advance flash card.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys for your help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
