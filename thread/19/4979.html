    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It has been said by manufacturers that having a certain game in your GBA slot of your DS while playing a DS game may unlock special features in your game (Feel The Magic with any Sega game, Possible Unlock GBA tracks in Mario Kart DS).
<br/>
<br/>
So if I had Feel The Magic / Project Rub in my DS and I had a Sega game on my flash cart (only the game, no loader or anything), would the DS game recognise it as a Sega game and unlock the features?
<br/>
<br/>
Apologies if this is the worng place to ask this and delete if necessary!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, as I understand it, it's <span style="font-style: italic">only</span> the header that counts - it checks the first 10 letters of the game's name or something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's true.  I own Feel the Magic, and I managed to use my EZFA to spoof the actual games and unlock the bonus content.  Though gbadev doesn't condone commercial game roms since they're illegal, so you stating that you plan to upload the games to your cart doesn't bode well on these forums (not that I'm speaking on behalf of any admins, of course).
<br/>
<br/>
Therefore note that it is possible, as NMcCoy mentioned, to simply spoof the header of the game (which can be researched on any GBA fan site like PIRACY-DOT-COM, PIRACY-DOT-NET, etc).
<br/>
<br/>
In the case of Feel the Magic, it turned out this was unnecessary since you get the same content for beating Hell mode.  Other games may vary though.  Consider the Mario Golf for the GBA, which you can only unlock the bonus content by owning the Gamecube counterpart.  Otherwise you suffer.
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, as a concerned DS enthusiast I would feel irresponsible if I didn't strongly caution you against purchasing Feel the Magic.  And I'll leave it at that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I never said I planned to do it, I just wondered if it was feasible.  Again apologies if I breached any forum rules and I don't mean to cause conflict.

Or the fact that Hell mode should come with a warning "Screen protectors are strongly advised".<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
