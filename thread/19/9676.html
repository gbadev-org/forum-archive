<br/>
<br/>
I received my new DS Lite today (navy blue one) and was trying to get it to work with my M3 adapter.
<br/>
<br/>
When I insert my passkey 2 however (in either passkey 1 or passkey 2 mode) I immediately get blank screens after startup.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this a known problem and is there any way I can flash my DS Lite with the latest FlashMe without using the Passkey?
<br/>
<br/>
Any help would greatly be appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Update: I did try to put K2-HW03.gba (and version 2 and 4 as well) on my card and run it from the GBA menu - but it just won't run.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well - I can't get any of the 'K2-HW03.gba' files to actually run.
<br/>
<br/>
I can start them up, but it just freezes.
<br/>
<br/>
When I try to use the Passkey again after that, I get two blank screens as soon as the startup message appears.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
my original passme worked with the new Blue DS i was pretty happy about that, and am waiting for my Lite on the 11th of June ( already paid for baby) and am hoping it will work with that too ( even though I know it wont) 
<br/>
<br/>
by the way , is yours a US version or JP? or other, please specify<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I got it to work just now, luckily.
<br/>
<br/>
I reformated my SD card and just put in the K2-HW03.gba file.
<br/>
<br/>
Ran that and followed the instructions from this:

<br/>
<br/>
After that, used V7 of flashme.
<br/>
Although I did get the warning that my firmware wasn't recognized, I took a chance and it works perfectly now.

Perhaps some of this info, or at least that link, should be in a sticky here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
