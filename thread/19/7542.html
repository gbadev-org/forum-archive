    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I played the Mario Kart and my DS was broken.  Only 2 black screen shown when I power it on.
<br/>

I would like to seek help from the previous post, the only infomation I saw is "WARNING: Mario Kart DS broke FlashMe".  However, my DS was broken, so I don't know what should I do.  Can anyone give me a suggestion??  (I'm using a CF supercard)
<br/>
<br/>
Many many thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for your info.  However, I still don't know how to do it.  Where to download the files and how to make it happen?? I downloaded some files "GBAMP_MultiBoot.zip" and "ndsmp.zip", how to use it?  I'm sorry that I'm quite stupid about these things.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
