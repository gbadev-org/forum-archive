wrong analogy. you dont put your files on a flashcard, you put them on a microsd card. and AFAIK, CDs, DVDs and harddrives are open standards, whereas flashcards are made specifically for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
flashcards have also been ruled illegal in the netherlands, but there was 1 flashcard that was ruled as not illegal. we are not sure which card that was, but we asume its the iplayer because it doesn't allow piracy.

The problem with android is that there are so many different types of hardware that it's very difficult to write something that will perform well on every device. Can you afford 30 different phones for testing? With iPhone you only have to test on an iPhone 3G or iPod 2G and you will know it will run fine on all devices.

because they bypass nintendo security, it would be hard to ban them using the "they allow piracy" mofo, since there's lot of homebrew to justify a legal use (and some pretty good that is, I didn't played a singel comercial game for 6month, only using homebrew). In that case you could also ban computers, any numerical media and things like that...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
edit: I was wondering if i'll buy a 3DS but since nintendo reaction regarding homebrew i'll probably not get one and stick to my soon (I hope) to arrive pandora...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, the ruling applies to the UK and copyright infringement. Interestingly circumvention of ETMs on the iPhone has been ruled legal in the US, see <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/07/feds-ok-iphone-jailbreaking/" target="_blank">http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/07/feds-ok-iphone-jailbreaking/</a>

DVR systems - designed specifically for recording copyrighted media
<br/>
Person media players (ipod etc.) - designed specifically for playing copyrighted media
<br/>
and the best one - Web browsers! - in order to view a web page, it must be copied to your local computer, according to these opinionated judges, this is piracy.

<br/>
If Nintendo used their brains, they would release some sort of dev kit aimed specifically at homebrew coders the same way that Apple has for ?60 instead of ?10,000. Then there would be far less piracy as the system would not need to be hacked in order fir homebrewers to use it. It can be seen in DS homebrew history, that it was always homebrew coders who did the initial opening of the system, not the flash cart manufacturers, who just copy the methods once they have been discovered.

5.13. Als onvoldoende weersproken staat vast dat de door gedaagden verhandelde flashcards en modchips slechts een beperkt commercieel nut hebben anders dan ter omzeiling van de beschermde werking van de door Nintendo gehanteerde voorzieningen. Nintendo heeft aangevoerd dat de door gedaagden verhandelde producten vrijwel uitsluitend worden gebruikt voor het spelen van ongeautoriseerde kopie?n. Deze stelling wordt ondersteund door vele uitlatingen van fabrikanten, aanbieders en gebruikers van die producten die Nintendo heeft overgelegd en waaruit die toepassing blijkt (producties 19-24 van Nintendo). Gedaagden hebben hier slechts tegenin gebracht dat de door hen verhandelde producten ook andere toepassingen van de spelcomputers van Nintendo mogelijk maken, zoals het spelen van zogeheten homebrew spellen van derden, het afspelen van muziekbestanden, internetten, fotograferen en bellen. Zij stellen dat hun modchips en flashcards ?op grote schaal? worden gebruikt voor die alternatieve doeleinden, maar de Webwinkels en [L] hebben op vragen van de rechtbank niet kunnen specificeren hoe groot de omvang van dat gebruik is en hebben de stelling ook niet onderbouwd. Dat de producten daadwerkelijk op grote schaal voor die alternatieve doeleinden worden gebruikt, is in het licht van het voorgaande niet aannemelijk, mede gelet op het feit dat de spelcomputers van Nintendo specifiek zijn ontworpen voor het spelen van de Nintendo spellen en niet voor het - buiten het kader van een spel - afspelen van muziekbestanden, internetten, fotograferen en bellen.
<br/>
<br/>
[K]
<br/>
<br/>
5.14. Het voorgaande geldt niet voor de door [K] verhandelde producten. Als onweersproken staat vast dat op de door hem verhandelde producten geen ongeautoriseerde kopie?n van de computerspellen van Nintendo kunnen worden afgespeeld. Gelet op de strekking van artikel 29a Aw, te weten het voorkomen of beperken van handelingen ten aanzien van werken die door de maker of zijn rechtverkrijgenden niet zijn toegestaan, kan niet worden volgehouden dat de door [K] verhandelde producten daaronder vallen. Om dezelfde reden strandt het beroep van Nintendo op artikel 32a Aw (voor zover dat al van toepassing is ten aanzien van de computerspellen van Nintendo) en haar beroep op onrechtmatig handelen in algemene zin.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
it basically says that it itsn't fully proved that flashcards are mostly used for homebrew while it is mostly used for piracy, and that therefore they are illegal. it then says that it has been proven that the sold products of [K] ([K] is one of the defendants) cannot be used for playing unauthorised copies of DS games, and that they therefore cannot be seen as illegal. 
<br/>
<br/>
so it was ruled not illegal. I think.

1 problem would be that small developing teams that now has the professional devkit would then move to the homebrew devkit, causing less sells in the professional devkit.

None of which have been a problem for the Xbox 360's community games programme.  You could argue that XNA gives you greatly reduced functionality; on the other hand, it's an officially-sanctioned way for people to get their creations onto Xbox Live.  MS even give you a great dev kit for free.
<br/>

If Nintendo thought there was any value to be added to their systems by homebrew, they'd try it.  DSiWare was a great opportunity for this, but clearly homebrew doesn't even register with them as a possibility.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1 problem would be that small developing teams that now has the professional devkit would then move to the homebrew devkit, causing less sells in the professional devkit. 
<br/>
an other problem could be that the homebrew games could start competing with the professional games, which is not something that I think that the professional developers want. 
<br/>
and a third problem could be that someone can write a program that can play pirated games. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Simple -

Homebrew = DSi/Wii ware store ONLY. Included in that would be things like file size restrictions, no fmv etc.

By the same argument, I could argue that devkitARM isn't free.  First I have to buy a $200 computer, then I have to somehow get hold of a Linux distro (either by paying for phoneline rental and getting broadband, or by buying a blank DVD and convincing someone to download and burn it for me).  Then I need to get hold of devkitARM somehow, presumably by buying a blank CD and getting the same schmuck who got my OS to download the archive for me.  Then I need to buy a flash cart and an SD card.  That's what, $250 so far?  Assuming I don't get my own phoneline, that is.
<br/>
<br/>
If you've already got a Linux computer and don't want to test on real hardware, devkitARM costs you nothing.  Similarly, if you've already got a Windows computer and don't want to test on real hardware, the XNA SDK costs you nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
The $99 you pay to get onto Xbox Live is the only real difference.  If you could pay $99 for an official DS flash cartridge - made by Nintendo - that:
<br/>
<br/>
 - Didn't run pirated software
<br/>
 - Came with a complete SDK and IDE
<br/>
 - Included an online distribution system, hosted by Nintendo, accessible to anyone with the same flash cartridge and that could actually make you some money
<br/>
 - Wasn't going to disappear one day because Nintendo had managed to sue the distributors and manufacturers into oblivion
<br/>
<br/>
would you turn it down?

And look at the amazing success they had with it.  Coding for iOS devices takes away a lot of your freedom - you're limited to public APIs and suffer at the whims of Apple's latest vetting policy.  On the other hand, there are thousands of applications out there and a *massive* audience for your software.  How many DS flash cart owners actually try any homebrew?  And, moreover, how many would be willing to pay for it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ant512: Well said. We could argue all day about the semantics of what it really costs to start developing for a system. The bottom line is we assume you have a PC running Windows or a Mac running OSX already. Statistically it's more likely you're not running a Linux machine. So if we can assume all this, point-of-entry once you have an Apple or PC is zero. You only need $99 if you want to run on hardware, but the SDK is free, and with the iPhone SDK you get a wonderful emulator, source level debugger and IDE. With Windows you get a great IDE and debugger (and a wonderful language called C#). All for free.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to get on the App Store, pay the $99 and buy an iPod for testing on hardware (cost about the same as a DS+illegal cart). If you're talented you can make that money back in a few months with your great app idea on the App store.
<br/>
<br/>
Can you do that with a Nintendo DS and devkitARM? Don't get me wrong it's a great development environment. But there is no source code level debugger or decent emulator. I still have a bug in my Detective game which appears to be random and never crashed in the emulator. The best emulator (No$GBA) is no longer available because the author is MIA.
<br/>
<br/>
So when it comes down to it, it's actually a better choice to support the companies that support us. Because Nintendo clearly doesn't give a toss about us.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, you should obviously buy four DS handhelds, 4 flash carts and 4 SD cards to do 4-player DS development.  What's your point?  If you're developing for a system you'll need to spend money to buy the test units and something to develop with.

Interesting reason, but I'm not convinced.  Considering any emulators would have to ship with ROMs to be usable, which would undoubtedly infringe on someone's copyright, it's unlikely that anyone would be daft enough to write an emulator knowing that MS wouldn't allow it to be distributed.  I wonder if synthesising audio requires lower-level access to the sound hardware, which in turn represents an attack vector for breaking into the 360's security system?

That's a strange one, but if you want to use their distribution network I suppose you have to play by MS' rules.

Or it could just be that C++/CLI's handles are designed to interact with the managed .NET objects presented by XNA, which makes it obvious which objects need to be manually deleted (standard pointers) and which are garbage collected (.NET handles).  The version of C available in Xcode to Snow Leopard users features closures ('blocks').  This isn't to encourage "exclusive development"; it's to take advantage of the automated multithreading system in the OS.

The DS had to be hacked to run homebrew.  I'm pretty sure that, with all the brains at Nintendo, they can come up with one binary signing system for commercial games and one for approved homebrew.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Synthesizing audio can be done in a verifiably type-safe manner; it would look much like <a class="postlink" href="http://alleg.sourceforge.net/stabledocs/en/alleg028.html" target="_blank">Allegro's audio stream API</a>. A synthesizer object implements an interface with the method void generateSamples(sample_t out[]), which fills 'out' with samples, and the system calls that method a few dozen times a second. Microsoft just neglected to implement anything like it in the XNA library. What makes it all the more ironic is that Shawn Hargreaves, the head of the Allegro project, is also a regular on the XNA board.

Then how do I write my game such that the same physics and behavior code compiles for both those platforms that require .NET (e.g. Xbox 360 and Windows Phone 7) and those that don't have .NET (e.g. iPod Touch, Mac OS X)?
