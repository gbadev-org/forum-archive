    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, i have just bought an EZ Flash III, and it works in the Nintendo DS with the usual .gba game roms. But when i try it with my homebrew game .gba made with the HAM library, it only shows the HAM logo and then it turns the screen to black and it does nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there some way to have this working? Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Finally i've got it. It was not the HEL library. The problem was i was using the ham_VBAText function which is useful for debugging purposes in the PC but it makes the real console to crash.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
