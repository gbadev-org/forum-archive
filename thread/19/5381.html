<br/>
EZ-Flash II Power Star EZ-Cart 512Mb
<br/>
<br/>
To load a ds.gba rom I formated the card. Then from the menus verify that the card manager app won't load a multiboot loader or try to remove intros. Finally I added the ds.gba rom.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Magic Flash 256 - Was a bit tricky. I found out that the flash card was a copy of "PowerFlash" (or something like that). So it's a bit of a hack :( First you need the MagicFlash software. Remove all roms from the cart, and rebuild the menu.
<br/>
<br/>
Then get "FuzzyPro" software (the PowerFlash stuff), and write the .ds.gba rom straight to the card. This writes straight to the start of GBA memory, and overwrites the MagicFlash menu.
<br/>
<br/>
However, if you want to rewrite the card, you have to re-run the MagicFlash software and rebuild the menu (for some reason?!?). Then you can copy the .ds.gba across using FuzzyPro again.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">kwayle,
<br/>
<br/>
As with the EZ-Flash 3 1gb cart, you may find it works if you rename the current .bin for the menu (not sure the name for your software, but look in the folders for a .bin or .gba with a loader/menu type name) to .bin.bak or something simular, to keep it around.  Then, rename the ds.gba you want to write to your cart to loader.bin (or whatever you software uses) and then either write the menu (if that is an option) or try writing a small .gba file to the cart, which should in turn write the loader (which is now the ds.gba file).
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: also, you may need to pad the ds.gba file to make it over 200k (or this could be something just for the EZ-Flash 3 1gb cart)
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I agree this is a crappy way to do it, but if you know how to make .bat files, you could easily make a batch file to do all this for you.
<br/>
<br/>
But, before you give up on your Flash Cart, play with it some more.  If you can, hop on #dsdev and see if anyone else has any ideas.  Or provide me a link to someone that is selling it, or a place to download the software you use to write .gba files so I can play with it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
My old Visoly xtreme card doesn't fit in the DS, but I think it would if I took its cover off. Using the GBA as a linker for my EZF is easier than swapping a bare cart back and forth though, but a little slower than the Visoly's parallel linker, since I have to wait for the GBA to boot up every time.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
The SC does not work with the Passme, because the GBA (hence the passme) can only see code that sits in the SC internal RAM and this requires ARM code (SC firmware) to load from CF to RAM. Think of it as if the SC becomes a "flash cart" (that is visible from Passme code) when the ROM is loaded from CF to internal SC RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
To support the SC, one would require additional code with the Passme that would run the SC firmware to load the ROM into its internal RAM. Another solution would be to hack the SC to run our own firmware (see the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=5051" target="_blank">Supercard hacking thread</a> for status).

I do not know how this card works but probably the same as with mine flash2advance ultra card. I do need my gba for flashing the card as the linker is conected betwen the usb-port and the gba-linkport.

<br/>
As with the EZ-Flash 3 1gb cart, you may find it works if you rename the current .bin for the menu (not sure the name for your software, but look in the folders for a .bin or .gba with a loader/menu type name) to .bin.bak or something simular, to keep it around.  Then, rename the ds.gba you want to write to your cart to loader.bin (or whatever you software uses) and then either write the menu (if that is an option) or try writing a small .gba file to the cart, which should in turn write the loader (which is now the ds.gba file).
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: also, you may need to pad the ds.gba file to make it over 200k (or this could be something just for the EZ-Flash 3 1gb cart)
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I agree this is a crappy way to do it, but if you know how to make .bat files, you could easily make a batch file to do all this for you.
<br/>
<br/>
But, before you give up on your Flash Cart, play with it some more.  If you can, hop on #dsdev and see if anyone else has any ideas.  Or provide me a link to someone that is selling it, or a place to download the software you use to write .gba files so I can play with it.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

if you use a Slim burner to program this card  with xg2 slim burner

but i not have slim burner :(  .

With the movie files you really must have a decent spec computer to convert files as the convertor that works for the supercard is rather slow compared to newer programs designed for the GBA Movie Player.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Haven't padded a single program yet.  Using the loader available on their web site, and didn't change any settings.  Here is a quick run through on how to use the App for GBA stuff:  <a href="http://www.jzdocs.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=35" target="_blank">http://www.jzdocs.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=35</a>

As long as you are writing the .ds.gba or .nds.gba versions of the programs, it should work fine.  Bascially anything listed on <a href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">http://www.ndshb.com</a> has been tested to work on hardware.

My recommandations according to where you live :
<br/>
- If you live in Europe, get an EFA from totalgba.com.
<br/>
- If you live in Northern America, get an EZ Flash II from jandaman.com.
<br/>
- If you live in Asia, get an EZ Flash II from winsunx.com.
<br/>
- If you live in Aussie, I thing Asia choice would be good, not sure though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just purchased a flash card on ebay to use with wifime. The software does flash the card through a parallel port and gba but it insists on appending a loader to the rom. The website for the card is only available in chinese at about 2kb/s. I use the setupeng.exe on the gamebios.net page called "GBA　SPLINK".
<br/>
<br/>
I add the rom to the list and flash it is then copied to a temp directory(c:\documents and settings\majincline\local settings\temp\(some random name).gba). At this step there is no loader appended. A file(firecard.gba) then appears in the program folder(c:\splinkeng) which has the logo added in it. This is the file that is flashed to the cart. The only difference between the flashme rom and the rom with the loader is that the second byte is changed from "." to "u" in hex editor and the loader rom is appended to the end of the flashme rom.
<br/>
<br/>
Whats stoping me from removing the loader:<ul>Oviousely, the program won't let me remove it.
<br/>
I cant rename and the file during its running because it is in use.
<br/>
Resource Hacker cant do anything because the exe looks compressed.
<br/>
No other software that I have tried supports this parallel port linker.</ul>I have thought about using symbolic links to trick the program into loading a different file but dont know how that could be accomplished. I wanted to swap it by using root permisions in linux but wine won't emulate the linker.

Does anyone know how I can get a loader-free rom on this cart?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyway, I am interested in the whole "Nintendo DS Download play using a Wireless NIC" thing, however, I do not have a GBA flash cart.  I know the instructions call for one.  My question is, do you believe that one day we shall figure out how to send programs to the DS using a Wireless NIC WITHOUT the need of a GBA Flash Cart?  I know it has to be possible, we just have to figure out the right sequence of 1's and 0's.

Yes, that would work too :) In fact, all zeros should work (who cares how a real GBA will execute them).
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this will break some flashing programs though, so I don't know...
<br/>
<br/>
The only reason we have a GBA header at all is because it makes flashing programs happy.

Hold on :) You cannot insert bytes before the demo binary, because the binary is not relocated. (All absolute pointers will have invalid addresses.)

The demo should have a GBA header which is garbled by your flashing software. This is entirely OK as long as nothing is changed after the 192 bytes of this header. Adding things (i.e. menu loader) after the demo is fine.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If i bought a cheap linker like the f2a parallel port linker would that help any or is it a problem with the card its self?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Does it show white screens? Did you try a different demo?

A different linker might not work with your flash card...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by natrium42 on Wed Jun 08, 2005 5:18 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Ah, is he trying to use a linker that wasn't made for his card?

I can confirm that the USB X-ROM cable can't be used to flash an old Visoly Flash Advance no matter how much success Littlewriter has flashing it. :P<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you said that you have no problem with your EZF-Advance III 256, I don't have that luck
<br/>
<br/>
Some homebrew work, other don't
<br/>
<br/>
did you pad some programs, did you change a loader in the application directory ?
<br/>
<br/>
what program do you use with that linker ?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Haven't padded a single program yet.  Using the loader available on their web site, and didn't change any settings.  Here is a quick run through on how to use the App for GBA stuff:  <a href="http://www.jzdocs.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=35" target="_blank">http://www.jzdocs.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=35</a>

<br/>
As long as you are writing the .ds.gba or .nds.gba versions of the programs, it should work fine.  Bascially anything listed on <a href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">http://www.ndshb.com</a> has been tested to work on hardware.  Download the .ds.gba version and you should be set.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The CRC error you are receiving doesn't matter when writing NDS homebrew.  From what I can tell, it's basically doing a very poor check.  Some homebrew give this error, some don't.  From what I can tell, it's the ones that don't inlclude the encrypted nintendo logo in the gba header that give the error, but NDS homebrew doesn't need it anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
