I got the right Wificard in my PC, I already sent demos to my DS and played them. If I send Wifime to my DS it can not boot the same demos or homebrew stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by G-SAS on Sat Dec 24, 2005 4:19 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Using an M3 adapter, I did this:
<br/>
wmb -data wifime
<br/>
and all I got was a white screen after the Nintendo logo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
