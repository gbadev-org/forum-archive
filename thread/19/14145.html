    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just wondering how many people still use GBAMP for running DS homebrew. I know there are a lot of other cards on the market, both slot-1 and slot-2 but GBAMP was one of the first for DS homebrew and I was wondering if it is still popular.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

<br/>
it's front loading, so don't have to remove the cart to swap the CF. plus it's got 32MB of RAM, so you can run gba homebrew. and it's just as compatible as the GBAMP (haven't found a homebrew that wont run on it yet).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I first got GBAMP, then used supercard CF for a while - probably the 'best' I have, got a supercard rumble so i could keep some homebrew without things sticking out of my DS lite and finally got an R4 because my SCR died...

<br/>
R4 has given me the best experience to be honest, with the auto-DLDI. I have Opera ram in slot-2, no idea if any homebrew is using it, but it's there.

GBAMP was just TOO BIG. Especially for a lite!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

These were popular when GBA flash cards were the normal way of using homebrew on the DS. It's likely that TickleGirl.nds is really a SuperCard .nds, which is just a renamed ds.gba.

So the question is this: If you have a RAM pak that starts at 0x08000000 (that is, anything but the Memory Expansion Pak included with Nintendo DS Browser), can DSOrganize load a sc.nds?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tickle Girl, IIRC, is designed to run from GBA ROM space and is more than 4MB. So it would have to be loaded to the RAM cart to be run. The question is does DSO do this?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I still use my GBAMP, but I wonder how much longer it'll last. Both of the screws are missing, it's taped together. &gt;_&gt; About half the time it won't start up until I pull it out and put it back in. I want to get an M3 Perfect CF and some sort of Slot-1 card for testing purposes, but those cost money. (The Slot-1 would also replace my ARDS as my NoPass in my Lite, since for some reason FlashMe refuses to install on it. ARDS is a pain because it sticks out of the slot, so if I leave it in and put it in my pocket, it will get bumped in and out and wear out the spring. I have to put it in, boot, and take it back out again every time, it's a pain in the butt.)
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, is there an M3 Perfect CF with the 32M RAM that doesn't stick out of the Lite? (Obviously, the CF itself will stick out, but besides that...) I hate how silly it looks having a GBAMP sticking out the thing, people are always asking "what's that thing" and so on... &gt;_&gt;)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
