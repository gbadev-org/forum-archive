    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This network card is incompatible as it has the rt2561 chipset so has there been a solution yet to fix this. I just got this card on the basis that it was on the list of compatible cards for wifi me. I get the error code 10 which states "This device cannot start"

Thanks for trying...

How difficult is it going to be to update the driver?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Extremely difficult for me... I only wrote the guide.  Tim Schuerewegen (firefly) wrote the driver but I think he's abandoned the project completely.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are a number of cardswhere the manuf. did not change the part num ber but changed the chipset.  I have the following which both work:

One has the rt2500 and the other has rt2560 chipset but both work with the rt2560 driver.  My guess is that any in the rt2500 family from the rt2500 to the rt2560 will work, but I have not tried them all.  Of course most cards do not tell you what chipset they use so there is not much help there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
