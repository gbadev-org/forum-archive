    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok I got oen on teh way , but not sure if it's for Mario64 or Metroid Prime demo , how hard would it be to change that? or is it somthing that has to be changed via the actual PassMe2?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As it is PassKey2 not a traditional PassKey it should have some kind of port for reprogramming it. Does it have anything like that?<br/>_________________<br/>Regards,

I just dont know what game it was done for</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It should be you telling him for what game he should program the PassMe. Probably your PassMe will have some easy way to flash itself and you won't need any JTAG cables like I did. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Regards,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I ordered it to work with Mario64 and I asked if he could switch to the Metroid Demo , I havnt got any sort of confirmation really on which of those it was programmed for , but I'm hoping it's for teh Metroid Demo since a friend gave me his demo
<br/>
<br/>
then I can just leave teh demo in the PassMe2 all teh time and never have to worry about missing somthing</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You'll only need to use PassMe2 once - to flash your NDS firmware to FlashMeV6 as it is much more convenient to have it flashed then playing with SRAM and rebooting the console every time you want to check something out.<br/>_________________<br/>Regards,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well yea that's what I'm doin anyway , but I'd like to just keep the game and passme2 together all teh time in case I flash a friends DS or somthin
<br/>
<br/>
and it'd be easier to keep the set together if it's not a full game , since it'd be teh demo , I wouldnt be playin it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So now it's <span style="font-weight: bold">PassMe 2</span> in <span style="font-weight: bold">PassKey</span> shell, bummer. That red LED won't work anymore. <span style="font-weight: bold">PassKey</span> has it's own firmware and I don't think <span style="font-weight: bold">PassKey 2</span> is out yet (so no PassKey 2 firmware).<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well I ordered from Natrium42's site , and he said it was btter cuz it was encased... but will work just like a PassMe2 ( I guess...)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT - Just found some PassKey2 news , says that PassKey2 came out Jan 9th (or 10th?) , so I'm guessin a may want to get it upgraded to PassKey2 firmware if it's PassMe2 firmware?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I had teh perfect screw to use also , it it soem PC screw I had , but it was long enough , and actually coudl screw into the SL1 hole and make a secure short
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My cam phone sucks , but you soratget the idea... it's like a screw ya use on CD/DVD drives for PC that hold em , sorta , fine threaded , but doesnt have to be as long as mine was , but it prolly should be as long as mine , also this isnt that very basic screw ya use on PCs that can be uses to mount your HDDs , and even double to use on DVD drives I beleive (mine uses teh finer threaded ones...) but shouldnt be too hard to find , I bet a hardware store would even have em

<br/>
<br/>
EDIT - Seems to be an "M3" type screw , and floppy drives use the 1/4 inch , so I have one that is like 1/2 inch atleast
<br/>
<br/>
Also - I beleive these are teh screws I use with my PC standoffs , which if you get a M3 standoff it should work fine , and even easier to use since it wont require a screwdriver to remove</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by ReRuss on Sun Jan 15, 2006 12:03 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Would a SuperCard screw work as well? ;-)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
