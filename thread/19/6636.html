<br/>
Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
i have recently received my GBAMP and i was messing around with a multiboot system.
<br/>
<br/>
I am to the point that it actually does something on the screen after loading .nds files. Unfortunally it seems that i am missing to set some flags on my fake-bootup.
<br/>
<br/>
Some games show correct graphics and movements, some are just showing their splash screen and some dont work at all.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has a suggestion what hardware registers im missing to set or any other hints, please let me know.
<br/>
<br/>
Use <a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/GBAMP_MultiBoot.rar" target="_blank">this</a> archive to take a look yourself. I have included some common nds (unmodified) which shows a bit of the action and of course the problems. Just put them on the CF in your GBAMP.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Mighty Max on Sat Sep 17, 2005 8:17 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looks good so far. I think your problem is with the ARM7. The ARM9 appears to load properly, but the ARM7 binary seems to be the same as used in your program. If the game you are trying to load doesn't use the exact same binary, it may not work.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could try modifying Darkain's MultiNDS loader.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
the ARM7 code started but it was unable to more then some instructions. The problem is solved and the archive updated.
<br/>
<br/>
Working (and tested) .NDS so far are: 
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>Nibbles (the oneby DesktopMan)
<br/>
</li><li>Tetris (the one by DesktopMan)
<br/>
</li><li>FlashMe

</li><li>BattleShipDS (by natrium42)
<br/>
</li><li>DS Reversi
<br/>
</li><li>MUSK
<br/>
</li><li>Sponge
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
The demos compiling with the settings like Hello_World don't work yet, as they have the ARM7 code located in Shared RAM (where my ARM7 code is atm). Gonna solve that soon, but not too soon (need more sleep :p )
<br/>
<br/>
Have Fun and feel free to add to the list of working .nds
<br/>
<br/>
:edit: btw the browsing in more then 18 files in the current subdir isn't really implemented yet too, will come too, but it isnt much of a problem now i think</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Mighty Max on Sun Aug 21, 2005 3:22 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

what?
<br/>
<br/>
anyway...just gave it a try with these games:
<br/>
<br/>
Duckhunt (works but wasn't there the upper screen also supported?)
<br/>
Starfighter Skirmish (doesn't work)
<br/>
YatzDOS (doesn't work)
<br/>
yeti3D (doesn't work)
<br/>
arena (doesn't work)
<br/>
<br/>
exept duckhunt all games won't even boot but freeze at loading screen
<br/>
<br/>
good start anyway.I hope you get it improved.You are the first person who comes up with a GBAMP multiboot programm and there are many people who were waiting for one.

<br/>
<br/>
the archive is updated again, so try your luck :p
<br/>
<br/>
I will not rely on DarkRains loader tho, i guess i can do that myself.
<br/>
<br/>
Gonna look if i can give the source of the loader itself to the Moonshell devers when it is more reliable altho, the bigger the NDS it is embedded in the less place is there for relocation and load operations.
<br/>
<br/>
But don't be worried, as you can see on the text-UI i'm not focussing on that, so i can spend my time mainly on the loader itself.
<br/>
<br/>
I have fixed a problem with larger NDS files and files that got corrputed while loading them, Shared-RAM-ARM7 NDS are still not loaded properly, but i included at least the ARM9 run on them :p
<br/>
<br/>
So add
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>cassebrique
<br/>
</li><li>jumpfree
<br/>
</li><li>JWPoolDS
<br/>
</li><li>pythonpower
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
I still have some problems with
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>Duckhunt, corrupting (bg corrupt,music plays, menu shows, crash)
<br/>
</li><li>Rebonds, not running ARM7
<br/>
</li><li>Gridlock, not running ARM7
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>

Ill be away with within the week, so just leave a reply if you got any suggestion / hint / request / whatever, and ill look on it when back.

I wouldn't mind being able to choose from Moonshell or the new version of nesDS that supports the GBAMP...then if there is a version of ScummVM released supporting the GBAMP as well, there's another reason to want to have a loader in place. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I found something interesting. If I try to load nesDS directly, it crashes. However, if I go to load nesDS, press Select for abort then load _BOOT_MP.NDS (this menu) nesDS works! What is going on here?
<br/>
<br/>
Further investigation reveals that when I abort, it still says /NESDS.NES in the path, so it gets openned. This only works if the file is in the root dir. It also works for birds, which froze on me before.
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking, unless you have a good reason to, you probably shouldn't store the absolute path. I have written the file driver so that this is not needed. Instead of changing up a level using the absolute path, just FAT_CWD(".."). 
<br/>
<br/>
I would really like to see your source, so that I can help out further. Out of curiosity, which CPU does what in your code? Eg, is the directory listing done by the ARM7 or 9, and likewise with file loading? If the ARM7 loads files, how are you placing the loader outside of IWRAM?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm just back from work (had to travel a bit) and gonna go through all the posts today. 
<br/>
<br/>
First for Chism, the ARM9 does the major work:
<br/>
<br/>
It relocates itself to 0x2300000 it shows the menu and on select loads the nds into a buffer, the buffer (from 2100000 to 0x22FFFFF) for ARM9  in the case of the ARM7 code shall be located into the main ram it is directly loaded to this place. It tells the ARM7 what to do and where to load and then begins to relocate code out of the buffer to the destination address. This step however will overwrite any values stored in that area and invalidating global vars, so can only use hard coded var-locations (at the end of the buffer) for anything now. Then the arm9 is synching with the ARM7 and both jump.
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile the ARM7 is checking a flag at the end of the buffer in an endless loop for 3 different states (1,2 are for the not yet working situation with shared ram used by new nds, 3 for the running ones):
<br/>
<br/>
1. Relocate -&gt; The Arm7 copies his 32kB (loader-) code into MainRam and jumps after a synching handshake
<br/>
2. Load -&gt; The Arm7 copies the new code into shared RAM (0x3800000) and jumps again after the synch
<br/>
3. Jump directly -&gt; The Arm checks another register at the end of the buffer and jumps to that address.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Something that came to my mind while away is that some of the behaviour might come from too many and too fast reads from the cf as the NDS seems to "memorise" that don't work state for a while ... might it be that the power circuits are not producing nuff output for exzessive reads ?
<br/>
<br/>
The menu code is pretty uggly ... a 5 mins work :p ... gonna rework that for a better performance and less reads (no caching, reloading on every loop)
<br/>
<br/>
After i cleaned the code up, i gonna look that i can release it.
<br/>
<br/>
PS: The issue with the path on abort is located and will be fixed.
<br/>
<br/>
PPS: I think i know the cause of the error with the no ARM7 roms, somehow the first jump is messing up access rights ... guess i should look onto the cp15 a bit more</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Am I right in saying that only NDS files &lt; 1MB will work, due to the buffer behaviour? Would it not be better to read the binaries directly to their destination addresses. In the case of ARM7 in exclusie IWRAM, you may still need a buffer, but it would only need to be 64 KB max. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think 0x3800000 is ARM7 exclusive IWRAM. 037F:8000-037F:FFFF is shared IWRAM, and you may want to use it for both loading code and global vars, as it shouldn't be used for binaries. There are two separate 16KB banks to use, so you could use one for ARM7 and the other for ARM9 (see <a class="postlink" href="http://neimod.com/dstek/" target="_blank">http://neimod.com/dstek/</a> for details).

Sure would it be better, but it does not work :p Even when i relocate the my code to the new address it still access the data as it were still within the old range. So if i load it directly to the area i want it to be, the calls to FAT_fread &amp; co as well as consolePrintf &amp; co crash.

I plan to read the size of the _BOOT_MP.nds code segments later to recalculate the beginning of my buffer to be as early as possible to increase the limits.

Ups. that explains why i wasnt able to do the move operation from the arm9, but i solved it by letting the arm7 do the memcpy. Problem for using the 16kB blocks for global vars is that they are indeed global for both cpus. so both need read&amp;write access.

Even if you move all the required code (I assume you are doing it manually), it still thinks it is in the old location, so function calls and such will try to access the old location. I think you know that already. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, you may be able to modify the link script to compile your code for the new location. For instance, you could have the ARM9 code located mostly in shared IWRAM, with a small main function in the normal location to set up the access control register correctly and then jump.
<br/>

<br/>
Try to use as few shared global variables as possible. Locate them as near towards the end of main RAM as possible, eg at 023F:FF00.
<br/>
<br/>
If the ARM9 really is doing most of the work, you could probably put your ARM7 code in the same region as the global vars (more link script tweaking) so that it doesn't need to be moved at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
While i was cleaning the code yesterday i came accross 2 major bugs that were causing the crashes.
<br/>
<br/>
* Not saving and restoring the Player-Setting-Rammirror caused the common Touchpad code to crash (division by zero)
<br/>
* Relocating the whole arm7 code area executed the initialization again and therefor jumped twice
<br/>
<br/>
What _should_ run now:
<br/>
<br/>
* Every ARM7 in main memory NDS with less then 2.4MB ARM9 code
<br/>
* Every ARM7 in exclusive memory NDS with less then 2.4MB ram &amp; less then 32kB ARM7 code.

Do you run the GBAMP with a special version of flashed firmware or flashme?

Do you run it with a passme plugged in or wifime, or just flashme?

Something on you side need to be different somehow. Any guesses ?

The loader is already relocated even the info doesn't shows it, it just shows the &amp;main value instead of the actual r15. I changed it now. The ARM7 address is pre-relocated.
<br/>
<br/>
However i have decreased the buffer size again to the last size and place that did not report this error in hope that it solves it, Tho i don't know why this should change anything. But hey!

I should add a code cleaning up some of the memory areas just before the CPUs jump.

And i need to find out what is located in the memory that was interfering on your NDSes. Since the reducing of the buffer stopped Omalone from working again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've thought of a great idea that could help you max.  I was thinking...why not create a separate program built purely to show debugging messages.  If you accumulate all of the tutorials that access each function of the ds then maybe it might be possible to narrow down which part is screwing up.   I've had another idea (which i'll admit is rather cack handed).  in terms of amalgamating this with moonshell i believe you said that moonshell would take up too much memory to be practical, well maybe i was thinking when moonshell(or any other shell) tries to load a nds file it could simple load your multiboot nds(and therefore unload itself entirely) and pass the location of the file it wants to load then your program could load the requried file as if it was run natively.  I dont currently know enough about it so forgive me if thats v noobish of me to suggest.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Although I?m certain that you?ll get this running 100% at some point (by the way, great work so far, Mighty Max), I thought of a simpler program that would have greater compatibility, but would be less convenient.  My original idea was a GBA utility that let you change file names.  Then you could just rename the file you want to boot in DS mode.
<br/>
<br/>
My other idea was a bit more complicated.  It was a GBA utility that would change the name of the file in the firmware that was loaded in DS mode.  In other words, Chishm?s hack has the GBAMP load _MP_BOOT.NDS.  The utility would bring up a list of your .nds files, you choose which file to load, and then it changes the pointer from _MP_BOOT.NDS to the file of your choosing.
<br/>
<br/>
I would have tried making these programs myself, but I?m just beginning to learn GBA programming.  Plus, I don?t think I have enough info to implement the second idea.  I think I would need the source code to Chishm?s bootloader.  I?ll probably get there eventually, but someone else with much more knowledge could get these ideas rolling much faster than I could and are welcomed to try.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

@chishm, Moonshell magical started to run after i cleaned the area from 0x2380000 till 0x23FF000. Thats the mem where i cache the arm7 code when it is targeted to run in exclusive ram.
<br/>
<br/>
And sure i'd be interested in your next ver of the firmware  and/or driver :) guess everyone is ... hehe 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
About Moonshell, yes, got myself 0.3p1 and its working with all music and video. Thx for the info.
<br/>
<br/>
@skabibo: Yes there is a size limit. and atm it's very strict to 0x1FC000 Bytes in AMR9 code and 0x7FC00 (for main ram) or 0x8000 Bytes (exclusive RAM)  ARM7 code. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thats 1.98MB for ARM9, 511kB (32kB) for ARM7.
<br/>
<br/>
That limit should be a lot less restrictive once i included the stack relocation too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It does not seem to be any different for the FAT driver if you are using upper or lower case. The multiboot itself does caseignoring string compares so there isn't a prob either.
<br/>
<br/>
Atm the list of compatible NDS is changing from release to release due to work on the loader code itself.  Please report here in this thread if a former running NDS stopped working with a new release.

I can't get my Moonshell to work with the Multiboot.

It loads everything fine except the upper directory listing, and then jams.

<br/>
I've changed the codepage of the binary and some options and also the background bmp, is that it?
<br/>
<br/>
Going to try with the non altered one.
<br/>
<br/>
The debug code is:
<br/>
<br/>
[debug] Buffer ARM9 at 2100000 ARM7 at 2380000
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Well it works with the original ".nds" file. Going to try and find out what makes it stop working.
<br/>
<br/>
Curious thing, when I run the codepage thingie, the file size goes from 1 megabyte do 0,6 megabyte. Maybe that's it:| Going to check.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT2: Yep, its the changecode thing. Well gonna have to read my portuguese texts with some funny letters:) I run the 1250 one.

Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
im back from the weekly work and i was not too lazy.
<br/>
<br/>
* the scrolling :) yeah i know my way is very inefficient in reading the content of the CF this will be changed and it will boost scrolling a lot. I will add a continue scrolling after a short delay when the button is still pressed.
<br/>
* the touchscreen code is half implemented, i just didn't want to fool with the arm7 code yet as i am still searching for some error sources and i think it will stay out a few more versions
<br/>
* interesting thought. but this will be a tought one as the actual code of multiboot is erased just before the nds is run, so there is nothing left to return to. I will check how to reset the nds to reboot the cf, or do a comlete soft-reset. I'll post the code in this thread here when finished.
<br/>
<br/>
The new version will be up sometime tomorrow. I found a way to get DSLinux running with Multiboot, unfortunally this prevents moonshell to run, so i will need to find a way to decide howto start the nds depending if it is moonshell,dslinux or whatever. My thought is to check for .PIF like files if a special run routine is needed.
<br/>
<br/>
I changed the filelist and continue screen a bit, it is no longer so heavy  weighted. (I disliked the massive '#' as border much)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm posting again tomorrow when i got some sleep ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So you make a touch screen control and now the loader can run linux but not moonshell?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, both issues are not related. I just want to keep my arm7 code as small as possible till i got some more things working. This saves me debugging time ;)
<br/>
<br/>
The linux contra moonshell issue is a clearance of shared ram problem. When clearing , moonshell strikes, when uncleared dslinux wont run. i tried to check which section in the shared ram causes this behaviour, but it kept only running one of them.
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't find any regions in there with a special function (r13 stack, mirrored settings area, etc) im still guessing on too many points to give a clear reason why this happens.
<br/>
<br/>
:edit: Sometimes someone already made the work :p so here comes the return to multiboot code:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
void SoftReset(void) {
<br/>
    asm("swi 0") ;
<br/>
}
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Just call this function on arm7&amp;arm9. To synch both resets, i recomment using an IPC handshake (im abusing the IPC sound pointer here, so check for these obvious invalid values in your sound code):
<br/>
<br/>
The arm9 as initiator will sign the ARM7 that a reset is planned. And it should listen for the synch. After it occured both CPUs are resetted.
<br/>
<br/>
ARM9 as reset caller:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">

After reading through all the pages of chishm's firmware v2 thread i have changed the loader to use his (a lot more elegantly) method to flag the cluster to load.

I will concentrate on the .ds.gba then :p

To be honest, that is intended, it hangs in an endless loop. I had an issue i was working on just as i read chishm's thread, so i quickly included this and sealed off my other workplace :p

But anyways, the ds.gba which ran before can be run after using the pme2nds converter on them, as i was just jumping around the 512 Bytes loader yet. But this is something in change ;)

The version on Lynx's NDSHB is pretty outdated now.

- the demux now fills a fifo for the audio data,

- Added a Pause/Continue implementation

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks, that helps a lot! I am going to test DSPaint and OMalone to see if they work better. My DS is now having problems booting (even with regular DS card inserted!), once in a while, the startup screen freezes (maybe I should switch to FlashMe).
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: DSPaint still does not work (I'm using the ndshb version, .nds file). It fades in, then freezes, the freaky voice isn't played. No arrows!

Nibbles1.1 works perfectly.

It sounds like you tried the repair utility (L+R+Select). This only repairs the bootloader of the GBAMP, so you need to use the update file to fix the rest.

Do you mean the original GBA MP firmware, like the menu for playing movies, etc?  Yes you can run it just fine no matter what you have on your Compact Flash card...just select it from the GBA Button on the DS's menu when you boot up.  Chism's firmware knows if you are in GBA or NDS mode and acts accordingly.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
FileListSize=24

FileListLineHeight=7

<br/>
What is the FileListSize=?  I thought it was the number of files listed, but I set it to 24 and it's still only showing 18 at a time. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I see the FileListLineHeight= is the spacing.. is there an easy way to increase the font size?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, would it be possible to make file indicator (*) a .bmp as well?  That way, we can make it a -&gt; or something like that instead of just a *.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus, the icon and description on the top screen don't have variables?  As mine don't match up with yours, so it doesn't display properly.. :(

This is just a thought, but how about making it load _BOOT_MP.NDS every time someone cancels it? That way it'll go back to whatever multibooter (Moonshell, MightyMax's loader, etc) that you may have on there.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the mod files would probably have to be added to the NDS file binary manually.
<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, you could always release the source to Moonshell after you're done so he can include another file format in his "multimedia multiboot" MoonShell software :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's not my shell, but it is my FW hack. To jump back to the _BOOT_MP.NDS file, which is most likely the loader, call this on the ARM9:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">//***************************************************

// Use this code to start an NDS file
<br/>
IME = IME_DISABLED;   // Disable interrupts
<br/>
WAIT_CR |= (0x8080);  // ARM7 has access to GBA cart
<br/>
*((vu32*)0x027FFFFC) = 0;  // Start cluster of NDS to load, 0 = menu
<br/>
*((vu32*)0x027FFE04) = (u32)0xE59FF018;  // ldr pc, 0x027FFE24
<br/>
*((vu32*)0x027FFE24) = (u32)0x027FFE04;  // Set ARM9 Loop address
<br/>
asm volatile("swi 0x00\n");  // Reset
<br/>
//*********************************************************</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Also, make sure you place this in the ARM7 main loop or interrupt handler:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">//***************************************************

// Put this code into your ARM7 main loop or interrupt handler
<br/>
if (*((vu32*)0x027FFE24) == (u32)0x027FFE04)  // Check for ARM9 reset
<br/>
{
<br/>
   IME = IME_DISABLED;   // Disable interrupts
<br/>
   IF = IF;   // Acknowledge interrupt
<br/>
   *((vu32*)0x027FFE34) = (u32)0x08000000;   // Bootloader start address

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dang.. calm down.. text viewers are easy.. there are a few already out..
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, yes.. every .nds file returns me to the menu.  I'm going to go and see if maybe I missed a GBAMP Firmware update somewhere?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I noticed the NDS icon isn't showing on the top screen.. but it shows the Dir icon.. and I can't go into the mb_data folder (to look at the .ini files) and it shows up as:
<br/>
<br/>
FOLDER
<br/>
/MB_DATA/MB_DATA/MB_DATA
<br/>
<br/>
I then looked at what was displayed for the .nds files:
<br/>
<br/>
/MB_DATA/MB_DATA/DSLINUX-GBAMP.NDS
<br/>
<br/>
So, what could be causing that?  I'm guessing it is trying to load the NDS icon from the same type of directory, but it somehow knows the proper path for the folder and .png icons.  But, when I try to load the upper.png file, I get this:
<br/>
<br/>
loading image: "  /MB_DATA/MB_DATA/UPPER.PNG"
<br/>
png
<br/>
couln't open file
<br/>
Press B to quit.
<br/>
<br/>
So, that's my problem..
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Well, I updated the GBAMP Firmware again just to make sure, no changed.. I then put the update.e19 on, and still no change.. :(
<br/>
<br/>
Edit2: :( Well.  It still isn't working, but I figured out some of the double dir stuff..  I had to many files in the root directory.  I moved a bunch of the .nds files into a folder.. and now it's displaying the proper path for everything, but it still isn't working..  example for the .png now is:
<br/>
<br/>
loading image:  "  /UPPER.PNG"
<br/>
png
<br/>
couldn't open file
<br/>
Press B to quit
<br/>
<br/>
as well as in the description field, it looks like:
<br/>
<br/>
(no icon still)
<br/>
NINTENDODS EXECUTEABLE
<br/>
  /DSLINUX-GBAMP.NDS
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm... maybe I didn't notice this before.. but when I press A to select it,
<br/>
the continue screen says:
<br/>
<br/>
/DSLINU 1.NDS
<br/>
Do you want to continue?
<br/>
<br/>
Don't know if it matters, but it's not using long file names as well as not showing the ~..
<br/>
<br/>
I'll keep messing with it..
<br/>
<br/>
Edit3:  Another thing I just noticed..  before, I still had the _BOOT_MP.GBA file on.. and it was showing up as [_BOOT_MP.GBA] and I didn't notice.. So, I deleted it and now I'm seeing the first file show up the same way [DSLINUX-GBAMP.NDS]..  The description is still saying it's a .nds file, and it still tries to start it.. but fails and returns to the menu.  Also, I can't get into any directories.  Selecting a directory just puts the * back to the top of the list..  But then shows all the files in the discription as /NDS/[DSLINUX-GBAMP.NDS] and if I try to go into the NDS folder again, then it ends up as /NDS/NDS/[DSLINUX-GBAMP.NDS]
<br/>
<br/>
Now, if I remove this version, and put the last version back on, everything works as it should..</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Lynx on Mon Oct 10, 2005 1:59 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

It works fine if it's just called '_BOOT_MP.nds' (of course, bypassing the multiboot completely), but if I try to rename it to something else 'Scummvm.nds', for example, so that it can go along with the multiboot, it just whitescreens.

Just felt like mentionning (since it isn't blatantly obvious from the error message) that this error means that the call to FAT_fopen failed, which probably means that the loader sent my png viewer the wrong filename =( . (this makes sense, because there shouldn't be a /MB_DATA/MB_DATA folder. . .)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Where did upper.png come from? I was under the impression that BMPs were used.
<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I've prepared a new version of the png viewer, and since I might not be able to reach Mighty Max for a bit I decided I might as well release it myself, at least until it's added to the official pack. New features include zooming out as far as you'd like, and scaling the image to fit the top screen. It also fixes a crash that occurred with certain images.

Ooops..  Sorry for the confusion.. I just saved one of my upper.bmps to a .png to test the viewer.. I should have renamed the file.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait to get these issues resolved.. I already added a "GBA MP Multiloader Themes" section to the downloads on ndshb.com... I just need to convert the 3 i've made already to the new .ini and I'll upload them.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh.. yeah.. MightyMax.. one more variable (or, set of variables).
<br/>
<br/>
On the selection screen (YES(A), NO(B) screen) it shows the file that is about to be loaded..  can we get variables to control that one on screen as well?  :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think i got the blackscreen / halfbooting bug sorted out now.  At least Trez gbamp wanted to load now again. Hope that solves your problem too Lynx.

Changes:
<br/>
 * Added a Failed() handler when something unrecoverable happens it switches to text mode and leaves a message instead of 2 black screens
<br/>
 * Added the continue parameters
<br/>
 * Added parameters to change the keys

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Using this version (Nintendo DS, PassMe, Meteos), I have two problems:
<br/>
<br/>
Choosing a folder just adds that folder to the path and does not update the list of files. For instance I have a "DAK" folder at the root level of my CF card, and if I select it repeatedly, I get something like "/DAK/DAK/DAK/DAK/" on the top screen. Therefore, I can choose only files in the root directory.
<br/>
<br/>
If I choose tetris.nds (Tetris by DesktopMan) or even Hello World (of libnds examples) at the root level of my CF card, I get the "are you sure" message, but when I press A for yes, it just resets back to the main menu. I remove the multi-loader and rename the ROM to _boot_mp.nds, it works, but I'd like to carry multiple programs so that I can enjoy more than one of my creations without having to visit a PC between them.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

My first thought was that i have a problem with caching the long filenames. But that would have resulted in a debug message now. That only leaves the FAT_CWD now, which is quiet odd as i didn't change anything there.
<br/>
<br/>
And it still works just fine on most DSes.

I'm having the same problem as mentioned above, where I am unable to laod any .nds files, or navigate into any folders. Selecting any .nds file and selecting yes to loading makes two black screens appear as if its loading, then boots me back to the file selection screen right away.

I also am unable to select any folders or anything, it just reset my cursor to the top of the file listings.

Any idea on this problems cause yet? I don't have any idea where tog et odler builds to test them out, but fi anyone has any let me know, I really wanna at least get somthing working.

To sum it up for everyone with that problem. The bug is caused by not complete archives / unpaks of the archive. Since WinRAR seems to be the root of all evil here, i switched to zip as format, so check your links.

Make sure you got Version 2 of Chishm's modified firmware flashed on the gbamp.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Using latest flashmp v2 and latest mightmax's loader from respective websites as of today, I have the following problem:
<br/>
<br/>
the loader boots up fine, and shows my files. I start pressing 'Down' to move the cursor down, and after about 5 or 6 movements, a screen pops up saying "Do You Want To Continue? YES NO" which after about 2 seconds, goes to a black screen with the text "Unrecoverable error occured: Bootup without CF card" (doing that just goes into the gba mode original gbamp firmware)
<br/>
<br/>
One strange thing: _BOOT_MP.GBA is listed as the first file, but it has [] around it, like a dir? but the info on top screen says GBA EXECUTABLE.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, it seems to 'crash', when the cursor hits either the first or second nds file in the file list. (the first 4 or 5 items are dirs and text files).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, using moonshell as the nds loader seems to work fine most of the time. so the problem appears to be specific to your loader.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">MightyMax hasn't noted this on the page, but the image viewer included with the loader now does JPEG images =p.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, according to <a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/layout.html" target="_blank">this page</a>, line spacing (in the file list) is controlled by layout.ini. Isn't it of more use to have this change automatic based on the height of the font in font.ini? You could perhaps also keep an attribute in layout.ini to give additional spacing beyond what is provided in font.ini.

EDIT: Files starting with numbers (and likely other chars that come before '[') are sorted on top of directories, which I'm guessing wasn't intentional

Conspicuous by its absence is a .bmp viewer. I was rawther surprised that the .bmp files that I had loaded on the cart for viewing in GBA mode didn't work in DS mode, even though a PNG plug-in was present. Even PogoShell has a viewer for 4-bit, 8-bit, and 24-bit .bmp files. If you need .bmp, .pcx, or .tga parsers, you could rip them out of the <a class="postlink" href="http://alleg.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Allegro library</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The [..] (back) stuff ends up being listed after files which start with a number.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any chance of being able to change the appearance of the TXT viewer? Perhaps have bookmarks, as well? I like having what I am reading occupy the entire screen, but it's much easier to read black on white with a nice font like Verdana or such than white on black with a font that lacks a bunch of characters. The current viewer hurts my eyes after a little while.
<br/>
(Though this is probably because I'm just weird and had the urge to download 30 MB of famous literature onto my flash card... which I fully intend to read...)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

only minor changes, as im still having problems with the new feature. So this will take some while.

<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>Added transparent icons. The first pixel (upper left) defines the key color, which will be shown as transparent.

<br/>
I believe that this was caused by something wrong with its save function. (Assuming it autosaves on exit... which I think it does)
<br/>
<br/>
Erm... assuming that this one has a keyboard... if not, I must have gone crazy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Upon reinstalling GBAMP Multiboot, the problem app does not appear to be a part of your package. It must have sneaked aboard through something else...
<br/>
A warning, though: If you end up with a TXT Viewer with a keyboard, you may want to be careful... don't edit big files like I did, and don't open it directly. Presumably, it works as it should with small stuff.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!
