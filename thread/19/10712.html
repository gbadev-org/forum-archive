Although, I must admit, a CF card is bigger than a GBA cart.

I might be wrong, but I tought <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_card" target="_blank">card</a> is documented in wiki like also <a class="postlink" href="http://tinyurl.com/fpew7" target="_blank">carts</a>.

Thanks for the tip, I didn't know of such devices exists already. Do you know if you can run homebrew stuff on them, like MoonShell?

I'm waiting to hear more of this DSLink as it could be killer card with MoonShell.

DS-X  DS-Xtreme has that mini USB connector, but it's not very useful as you also need a cable and it's not very portable (unless there is really small USB link cables). With <a class="postlink" href="http://www3.emu-zone.org/host/ediy/emu-hw/emuhw01.htm" target="_blank">DSLink</a> you only need to have Iogear Micro SD USB reader or Non-Brand Micro SD USB reader, they are really small. You can store that reader in your DS Lite's pouch bag.
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www3.emu-zone.org/host/ediy/emu-hw/emuhw01.htm" target="_blank">DSLink</a> is better for media use (music,video,etc). Sadly they didn't integrate passme 2.

I haven't find any english reviews, but I hope that DSLink is a killer adapter. :)

I have read that someone claims that DS-Xtreme will be released August 20th. Roms have to be patched to work. It has no Nopass solution inside (you need to flash your firmware with flashme to run homebrew). I hope it writes faster to Micro SD card than M3 SD with it's slow 83ms compared to CF's 0.17ms. I'll just read the reviews first and then decide if I buy one.

It's a chinese distributor. The price of DSLink is 296 yuan, which is about 33$ (it has changed since my last visit, previously it was about 23$).

<br/>
I've ordered it from my local Moscow vendor - he'd ordered a small party of DSLink (5 pieces) from his Chinese contacts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you emailed them to request the source code to said drivers? If not, you should, especially since you are one of their customers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

NinjaDS is supported by libfat and DS-X claims it works with existing FAT lib (they got DSOrganize working without any changes).  MK2/MK3 are also supported.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about DSLink or the others.  Fortunately some of these devices are just clones of others, so some work with existing code.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In a recent release of Image Viewer ( Ver0.5 ) by Infantile Paralysiser there was a something interesting in a changelog - "Corresponded to EZ4/DSLink. I wish to express my deep gratitude to Rudolph" 
<br/>
So i've downloaded sources, found DSLink driver in a "ThirdPartyDriver" folder, and tried to integrate it into a freshly released PictoDrive 0.1.6. 
<br/>
Pictodrive has compiled just fine, without any errors. I don't have microSD reader  at my workplace, so i'll test it on a hardware as soon as I come home.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What are you waiting for then? Inform Chishm immediately!
<br/>
But I hope this isn't a case similar to the EZ4 previous drivers( read only, not complete,etc..)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm... the PicoDrive version 0.1.6 I compiled  doesn't work on a hardware... Empty directory listing and it hangs after pressing A button. But I think its because of my lack of skill (i only added 6 lines of code in 2 files, guess its'not enough :) ), not a driver's fault.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: As i thought, i had skipped one block of code (adapter type detection) in disk_io.c , that was very stupid of me :( Hope this time PicoDrive will work fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, now i can confirm : this driver suports both reading &amp; writing to microSD card. Picodrive runs perfectly - with save/load completely working.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
