Some homebrew games/apps/whatever use the SRAM of the flash cartridge (if you're using one), like for example Nibbles, snesDS or DS Paint.
<br/>
Does it work with SRAM from original GBA games too? Many games use 64KB SRAM, so you could change the cartridge after the DS loaded everything and save to it.
<br/>
<br/>
Does that work or works saving only with flash carts?<br/>_________________<br/>The future of gaming is mobile Handheld Gaming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can swap cartridges safely if the program doesn't read or execute bytes from the cartridge.
<br/>
Commercial cartridges have 32 kilobytes of SRAM, not 64.  Many cartridges use FLASH or EEPROM to save, not SRAM.

Oh, my mistake. But some games use 64KB and not only 32 (for example Mario Kart Super Circuit with FLASH_V124 (512Kbit) ) or the Pok?mon games use 128KB
<br/>
<br/>
So it's not possible to use commercial for saves for apps like DS Paint, is it?<br/>_________________<br/>The future of gaming is mobile Handheld Gaming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if the cart uses SRAM and not EPROM or flash, then you can save data to the cart easilly. however it will destroy whatever save data is on the cartridge (erase your save file.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The technique that phonymike describes, using the SRAM of an official Game Pak, is often called "SRAM cannibalism". And yes it can be made to work with homebrew Nintendo DS programs, provided that they're aware of the 32 KB SRAM on an official Game Pak, not the 64 KB SRAM that GBA flash cards have.
<br/>
<br/>
Why does it have to be SRAM and not flash? Games with 64 KB FLASH_* need different writing techniques (not just a bytecpy() to the SRAM area) that vary per manufacturer and thus aren't nearly as easy to use with SRAM cannibalism.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm just an thought about this cannibalism ...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone tried to find an buffer overrun in a save file and probably the ability to run code that way? I know it is not much place for code, but it should be 'nuff to do a "Replace card now" and call to the other cards rom.
<br/>
<br/>
Might result in another passme method.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
You will not be able to use that method with many Homebrew roms since many of us incorporate a check to make sure the cartridge is not a commercial one.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://ethos.oddigytitanium.com" target="_blank">Ethos' Homepage (Demos/NDS 3D Tutorial)</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
