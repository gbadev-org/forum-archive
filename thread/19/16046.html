    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't seem to figure out what happened to my micro sd card that I am using with my M3 Real card.
<br/>
<br/>
I opened it and added a few comics to the comicbook DS application but when I tried to get back in, the computer popped up an error message.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible I filled the card too much
<br/>
<br/>
if so, what can I do to fix this 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
it is a scan disc card if that matters</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

*hint hint*

<br/>
right click the drive letter and get the properties of your msd and see if its full or not. your msd could be corrupt... did you try to format it?
