    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">im not really sure which forum im supposed to be writing in :\
<br/>
<br/>
the beginners forum appears to be for developers and such. im really just looking to play old computer games via ScummVM on my DS.
<br/>
<br/>
ive read so many opinions that just keep varying from one choice of equipment to another.
<br/>
<br/>
can anyone recommend what hardware would best suit my [LucasArts] needs?
<br/>
<br/>
maybe a nudge in the right direction to finding some sort of guide so i dont have to ask so many dumb questions like this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On the DS front...
<br/>
<br/>
The website does not recommend using an SD card based device at present. This means if you really really really just want to play SCUMM games you'd be best off grabbing a CF card device or a FlashCart...
<br/>
<br/>
A CF card device is probably more economical, so...
<br/>
<br/>
SuperCard CF
<br/>
M3 CF
<br/>
GBAMP v2
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to do stuff other than just play SCUMM games you might want to wait until SCUMVM DS is updated again, hopefully with improve support for SD devices...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
whats the maximum amount of storage space i can hope for?
<br/>
<br/>
(namely, worried about the capatability of certain brands with my DS)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recoment gbamp v2, it runs most homebrew, commercial roms are difficult to run from it ( a plus in some peoples eyes). I use one, and things like scummvmds work fine, as do nesds, snesds, frodods etc.
<br/>
<br/>
As long as you get a no-pass device, such as max media launcher you will have no problem using it with any ds.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBAMP V2 is one of the most compatible devices around, and also the cheapest.  It runs nearly everything homebrew and is easy to use.  I can't tell you where you can buy it on this forum because the rules forbid me promoting an individual supplier.
<br/>
<br/>
The device can support any size CF card as far as I know.  People have definately used 1Gb+ cards, which should be plenty.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
