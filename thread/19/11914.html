    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, i posted here not long ago asking about various homebrew stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Now it's getting closer to the time when i'm going to get my Nintendo DS and i'm itching to homebrew, however i don't have any homebrew equiptment.
<br/>
<br/>
So basically, i've done some research and looked over some forums and websites... and i've compiled a little tiny list of things that i think i need in order to homebrew on the nintendo DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Please correct me if i'm wrong etc! :)
<br/>
<br/>
The list:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">[URL removed by MOD]</span>
<br/>
(I think this is the SuperKey for the NDS slot, the SuperCard miniSD for the GBA slot, and i think the software required on the computer)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">[URL removed by MOD]</span>
<br/>
(I think this is the kind of mini SD card i need, with an adapter that makes it fit into standard sized SD card slots for putting into the SD card reader)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">[URL removed by MOD]</span>
<br/>
(I think this is the kind of card reader i need in order to read and write from the mini SD with adapter)
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this is all i need, it already appears to cost around ?50!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unfortunately, you're not supposed to post links to retailers outside of Retailer Feedback, so your post will probably be edited at some point.
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I believe that is all you will need.  The Supercard + Superkey bundle is a good price from what I can tell.  The miniSD card is by Kingston, a good brand, and the reader should work fine.
<br/>
<br/>
However, you should also consider looking into further bundles.  According to the prices on the pages you linked to, and assuming that Google's converters are correct, you're about to pay about ?58 for the three items you linked to.  The problem is that this value does not take shipping into account.  If you order from 3 separate online shops, shipping is going to add up quickly.  The place you linked to for the Supercard has a bundle that gets you a Supercard, Superkey, 1 GB miniSD card, and a USB reader, and if you took this bundle it would cost you about $115 = ?59 plus shipping for only one shop.  This could potentially save you money.  Just check it out anyway and see if it would be a better deal to buy it all from one retailer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm very sory for those external URL's, i'm quite new here and i haven't checked out all of the rules yet. However, i'll be sure to check those out and hopefully frequent here more often when i get my Nintendo DS and homebrew equiptment sometime in the future!
<br/>
<br/>
I will try out the bundle from my first link, thank you very much for your advice!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
