    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been using an M3 Perfect SD for quite a few years now and I've decided it's about time to upgrade. this thing sticks out of my lite a full inch and lately a lot of the time I have to restart quite a few times before it'll successfully boot certain software.

what would anyone recommend for a new slot-1 device? I'm hesitant to get one that uses micro-SD cards, since then I'd have to buy a new one and I'd want at least 2GB, but by comparison the 2GB DS-Xtreme is really expensive. does anyone have any insight into which is a better value (a card with built-in memory vs. buying a new microSD) and which brand of card is the best?<br/>_________________<br/>Hardware: DS Lite &amp; Phat (both FlashMe v7), M3 Perfect SD, PassKey 1, Max Media Launcher, SanDisk 1GB SD card</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

All the slot 1 cards with built in memory have significant drawbacks. NCard is slow to write to, G6R doesn't have a DLDI driver and you can buy another DS with the money you spend on a DS-X.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDSh" target="_blank">Nintendo DS homebrew on Wikipedia</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">R4/M3 or CycloDS EVO are good bets, I think. Alas, the EVO is rather more expensive than the other two, which is the main strike against it :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">microSD cards are cheap these days, you can get a 2GB for under $20 if you look around. It's amazing...I paid less for my 2GB tiny tiny microSD card, than I did for my 128MB CF card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I hope this isn't against the forum policy for retailers, etc. But there's a site called <a href="http://dealnews.com" target="_blank">http://dealnews.com</a> that finds the best deals from major retailers (newegg, buy.com, meritline, etc.) and organizes them so you can search through them in their site. (I once got a 2GB miniSD card for 3$ after rebates and a new 'google checkout' account. It's since gone missing though...)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
