    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So...If I used a Supercard lite and a superkey, I would be able to run homebrew and roms?  Or do I need something else?  Besides a MicroSD card.  The supercard has a program to patch roms and stuff to make them compatible for it right?  Do I use that software to put the converted roms onto the MicroSD?  
<br/>
<br/>
What exactly does the GBA movie player do?  Is it just for playing movies? Or is it required to play games?  Does the supercard need it?
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br/>
I've been thinking of getting an NDS Lite, and I want to learn all I can about running homebrew and roms before I decide to get one.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I would very much appreciate it if you guys could help me.  I need to know exactly what i need to run homebrew and roms</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
By the way, just in case you didn't know, running official roms via unofficial means is widely frowned upon, and it is illegal/immoral/bad to pirate them. It is also frowned upon to run even 'legally acquired' official roms on the DS, since this makes it possible to cheat over online games which sucks and causes nobody to like said cheater.

Thanks for a well-written plea :)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You need the following to play homebrew:
<br/>
NoPass OR FlashMe AND
<br/>
(Supercard + SD card + SD card reader) OR (GBAMP CF + CF card + CF card reader)
<br/>
<br/>
GBAMP can play movies, games and apps. Supercard can play movies with Moonshell.
<br/>
<br/>
And as Mr. Picklesworth said we don't talk about ROMS here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
