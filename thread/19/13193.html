    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, I just bought the Games n Music slot 1 card by Datel, only to take it home and realize it has no DLDI driver for it.  I've searched the net and I see that many people have been waiting like 4 months now with still no word from Datel about this issue.  So I sent them an email myself using their help form located <a class="postlink" href="http://us.codejunkies.com/support_faq.asp?c=US&amp;cr=USD&amp;cs=$&amp;r=0&amp;l=1" target="_blank">HERE</a> (you all should do this too).
<br/>
<br/>
My message was the following:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Datel, I bought the Games 'n' Music card for the NDS hoping to run homebrew, but I brought it home to find that it was quite limited.  Can you PLEASE release a DLDI driver or the I/O output so that others can create a DLDI driver for this card?  There are quite a few homebrew games and apps that simply won't run without the availability of this and I don't want to have to go out and buy a different card.  Either put it on your site or send it to me and I'll post it around the internet.  I would very much appreciate it as would many other people.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been searching the net for '"Games n Music" DLDI' and I come up with many results of people looking for the last 4 months but still no word.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time and consideration!</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Also, the email address listed on the website for support contact is <a href="mailto:Support@DatelDesign.com">Support@DatelDesign.com</a> but I get a mailerdaemon error back when trying to mail them.  There is another email for canadian gamers listed at <a href="mailto:canadagamer@inteclink.com">canadagamer@inteclink.com</a> which I also emailed and that seemed to go through.  I also sent it to <a href="mailto:feedback@codejunkies.com">feedback@codejunkies.com</a> which seemed to work also.
<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, they need to understand this is in demand and give us the info we need, I'd suggest if you have the same card as I do, take a few minutes to do what I did and send them an email too.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope they respond.  I will post any word I get back from them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You do realize this thread is a month old already, right?  It had already been abandoned in favor of the other thread.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
