<br/>
<br/>
Something like that happened to me a while ago. When I was reinstalling my laptop.
<br/>
<br/>
I was sure I keep the drivers I needed (i386 XP), and removed all the others. 
<br/>
<br/>
When I was trying to get it working with the Gigabyte utiltiy (my little hack) it was showing the normal driver.
<br/>
<br/>
Then I tried it the normal way, making it completly for WMB. I got that meesage.
<br/>
<br/>
Turns out I needed to get the driver again. But I was so sure I has the right one...
<br/>
<br/>
Something has to work... As I said "WARNING: This most MAY not help".
<br/>
My stupid ideas: Remove the driver files in system32 and start from scratch (download another copy). Or not listen to me.

Thats not good....  Try the add/remove hardware dialog. If it doesn't find it, odds are your wifi card = toast :(
<br/>
<br/>
However, a last ditch effort may be to move the card to a different PCI slot. Windows might just be really really confused o.O<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fireslash.net" target="_blank">FireSlash.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you remove the card, windows DOES NOT remove the driver. But it will be hidden from you until the card is re-installed.
<br/>
<br/>
Try putting the card back in, but in a different PCI slot. This will force XP to give the device a new driver, since it can't verify that it really is the same card.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fireslash.net" target="_blank">FireSlash.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, thanks. Moving it to another slot got it working again, but I do wonder why it stopped in the first place. I hope I don't have to do that often... Windows really doesn't seem to like moving things (especially network cards) to different slots, so if I get 2 more PCI cards in the future (filling up the 2 empty slots) it could start to be quite a problem. Plus opening up my computer and shuffling them things around is a pain.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
