    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys, I just got a ds lite for christmas, and I don't really have time for programming it right now. But, I did want to ask if there is anything that I should know before using it, if I want to program it later. For instance, will downloading the newest firmware make it where I can not develop for it later? Thanks guys and Merry Christmas (Unless you don't celebrate it, then Happy 25th of Dec!)!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nintendo DS doesn't have the kinds of firmware upgrade issues that PSP has. There has been only one firmware upgrade that broke booting devices, and that was a year ago. If you use a NoPass and install FlashMe Stealth v7 (see the sticky topics in DS Flash Equipment), everything should be fine.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

And that was only because FlashMe put its code in a spot that was supposed to be reserved for NWFC configuration, so games wrote over it.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was talking about what was then called the "iQue/red DS breaking original PassMe" issue (now called "firmware v4" since TakeMeOut was discovered), which happened a couple months before the "WFC games bricking FlashMe until FlashMe v5" issue.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The DS doesn't have official downloadable firmware updates.  You only get a new firmware if you buy a new DS or maybe if you send your DS to Nintendo for repair.  Anyway, all DS versions are currently homebrew capable.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
