    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've had my G6 Lite for about a week now and at first I had some in-game freezing issues but that seemed to be fixed with firmware v4.3, but now I have an even worse problem:
<br/>
<br/>
When I turn on my DS, the top screen says "TouchPod for G6 Flash" and the bottom screen is BLACK. I've waited several minutes and tried rebooting the DS MANY times but it doesn't help. I've even tried a different DS and it still does the same thing.
<br/>
<br/>
I think I've had this problem before but I think that rebooting the DS a few times fixed it but now I am stumped.
<br/>
<br/>
The strange thing is that the G6 lite works FINE on the PC. I can read/write files and use the U-Disk manage just fine.
<br/>
<br/>
However as of now I can't use the G6 at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anybody please help me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've tried formatting it using WinXP (SP2) (as FAT16 and not FAT32)...
<br/>
<br/>
I've then run the MPTool "Maintanence Utility" program from the G6 website.
<br/>
<br/>
Still nothing... :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I read on another forum that I can hold [Select] while I press [Power] to boot into GBA mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I left my Max Media Launcher NDS Cartridge inside my DS (even though I don't need it since I used Flashme), and when I held [Select] it showed the Max Media Launcher and then booted into the G6 just fine!
<br/>
<br/>
So it looks like everything is fine now...
<br/>
<br/>
One question though, when I used the MPUtility to format my G6 Lite, apparantly I lost 1Mb to a "dummy" partition.  This seems to be a known issue, but is there any way to get back that space?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
