    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been puttering around with GB and GBA flashcarts for years on now, and now that I have a DS, I want to put flashme on it so I can ditch that godawful health warning.  (it makes me want to stab someone in the eyes, I swear.) I know I have the <span style="color: yellow">yellow</span> firmware by the Pictochat test and the compatibility list.  So I know I need a Passme2.
<br/>
<br/>
  I also have an old F2A, so I'm set on the flashcart side.  Unfortunately, I've over-researched it and no longer feel as confident that I know what the hell I'm doing a when I started, heh.  Let me see if I have it straight.
<br/>
<br/>
  Once I have my Passme2, I need to flash pepsiman's sram writer to my cart.  Boot my DS in GBA mode and select the slave DS cart that I'm going to be using.  Once the SRAM is written, turn off my DS, insert my passme2 w/ slave DS cart attached, and reboot.  Here's where I go fuzzy.  I assume, from the description, that the passme2flashme.gba will realize I'm in the 2nd stage and launch FlashMe, so all I need to do at that point is to short SL1 and not let the battery fall out.
<br/>
<br/>
  Is this correct?  Or do I need to write flashme to my cart after writing the SRAM?  I ask because the last time I tried writing flashme to my cart (just out of curiousity, I knew it wouldn't work), the DS reported it as a DS Option Pak, and my GBA refused to recognize it. (Well, aside from the messed up header image.  SURPRISE.)  I had to jump through some hoops to get it back to "normal".
<br/>
<br/>
  Are there any hitches to running with FlashMe v6 all the time?  I'm sort of confused when people grouse about the shape of various passmes, because from all that I can tell, flashme simply eliminates the need for them, and doesn't change anything else. Ok, the WFC isssue, but how much more of that can Nintendo pull?  My main goal is to get rid of that annoying-as-anything health warning, doubly so when the GBA game does it too (ferchrissakes), and to dabble a bit in the DS homebrew scene.  (If I could find a shut-lid-to-sleep aware DS book reader, I could retire my PDA and iSilo, for instance..)
<br/>
<br/>
  Sorry for the n00b question, but I haven't been able to see a straight answer in any of the FAQs I've read, and they're all starting to run together now.  Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, passme2flashme.gba will run FlashMe (currently v5) when started in NDS mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
