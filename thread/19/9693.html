    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
<br/>
I've read through various forums and various threads here, and noticed that some people in some threads know about a certain development and rescue method, and others don't.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br/>
First of all: What is a "Bricked DSL at 1%"? </span>
<br/>
With the 3rd wave of DSLs, there is a certain issue when bridging the contact for installing Flashme. That is, there is a little piece of metal to the left of the hole (when positioning the DS so that the the battery ia on top). If you touch that, your DSL will turn off. Additionally, the contact is quite hard to short in this case, so the following problem arises:
<br/>
<br/>
As long as you don't short it, it stays at 0%, so nothing happens, everything is safe. But once you short it and it moves upwards to 1%, meaning that you placed something conducting in the hole, chances are that you touch the metal on the side and turn off your DSL that way.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Possible ways to successfully flash your DS Lite</span>
<br/>
One workaround is to use something that only has exposed areas of conducting material at the bottom, like a screwdriver wrapped in sticky tape or put a paper roll in the hole and then use a toothpick wrapped in plastic. Or you have a very steady hand.
<br/>
<br/>
Another workaround is to open up your DSL and short it when it's open (taping the battery to the board for that time), since you don't run into any real danger of touching the little piece of metal then. But you need a three-wing screwdriver for that. (And don't forget the screws under the little rubber pads!)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br/>
Rescue method 1: When Flashme recovery works</span>
<br/>
For many people, even when they turned off their DSL at 1%, the standard Flashme recovery (SEL+START+A+B) still worked, in the case of supercard (and maybe other similar products) <span style="font-weight: bold">you won't see anything on the screen though</span>, so it might be best to put only the flashme rom on your card, then start the DSL with the recovery buttons pressed, press the button(s) you would when starting the only rom on your card. Then press start (just to be safe, in case Flashme doesn't recognize your firmware), XBXB. After that you should actually see the percent counter. 
<br/>
<br/>
Short the contact...repeat until you get it right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Rescue method 2: When Flashme recovery doesn't work</span>
<br/>
For some people the standard recovery did not work. Like for me. But your DSL can still be saved!
<br/>
<br/>
Get access to another (working!) DSL, one that works (Flashme or no Flashme, no matter if you have access to a superpass or similar). Open up both DSLs (three-wing-screwdriver needed, and watch those screws under the little rubber pads).
<br/>
<br/>
In the upper left you will see a socketed chip with a cable running to it. Disconnect the cable (just pull it upwards or tilt if with a screwdriver, it will unplug quite easily). Take out the chip from both DSLs. A bit of sticky rubber foam will either stay on the board or stay on the chip. No matter, just make sure you put it back afterwards.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, put the chip from the working DSL into the broken DSL and connect the cable. Tape the battery to the board (where it should connect), start the broken DSL. Start the Flashme installer (using the Superpass if the working DSL doesn't have Flashme). Take it to the point where it asks for "XBXB" to be entered.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, while leaving the unit running, take out the chip again (don't forget the cable!) and put back in the broken chip. Press "XBXB", short the contacts. Tweezers worked for me, everything else did not.
<br/>
<br/>
When you're done, put both DSLs back togehter, and you will have two happy DSLs. If you search around, you can even find some pictures which indicate which chip is the firmware chip you would be looking for. But it is really, really easy to identify.<br/>_________________<br/>"It's a fool's prerogative to utter truths that no one else will speak."</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by nexxyz on Thu May 25, 2006 9:04 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bricked my ds lite at about 9% and i have a supercard sd. I tried the first method, but it didnt seem to work so i want to try the method where i switch the chips. The problem is that i dont have another ds lite that i can use. Can i use the chip from my regular Nintendo DS? it's already been flashme'd. thanks for your help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What if someone only has 1 DSLite?
<br/>
Someone could set up shop and sell:
<br/>
Pre-FlashMeed firmware chips, just request the old one from the person who's buying it, and then you will have enough chips.
<br/>
OR
<br/>
A simple programmer built onto a piece of stripboard with a parallel connection/serial connection/USB connection(not likely?) and bundle it with some simple software to flash the chip. Or just release the schematics of such a board for people to build.
<br/>
OR
<br/>
People will just have to start buying a MAX Media Launcher and not flashing their DSs.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: @hahaha I don't think so as the old DS firmware chips aren't socketed. Maybe Nintendo know about this flashing problem and so when they refurb DSs they will just stick in a chip with the latest firmware?<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

At the moment FWNitro doesn't contain some features that people want (no, I am not talking about graphics).

The best solution is to sell a standalone flasher, because then people can put whatever they want on their chip.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

If you solder SL1 and leave it soldered, then yes your DS is more vulnerable. However, you could easily solder SL1, flash the DS, then remove the solder from SL1. It doesn't have to be permanent and it's probably the best connection you can make between the two halves of SL1. If it wasn't such a huge hassle, I bet more people would do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Eventually DS Download Play and calibration will be built-in to FWNITRO, once I find a way to do that. PictoChat probably won't be built-in to FWNITRO, but if DS Download Play works, it shouldn't be too hard to make a external program for PictoChat to put in CF card and run, and still make it compatible to the Nintendo official PictoChat software.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Hm, a good point here. Buying a pre-flashed firmware chip means you'd lose your MAC address. It'd pretty much have to be a dump-and-modify system. Maybe it could use hotswapping? You boot up with the new chip which just contains a flashing program. Switch to the original firmware chip; it copies the MAC and user config into memory, then switch back and it writes a new firmware with this info to the new chip (or just copies all of the original firmware, patches it FlashMe-style, and writes it). Again it'd require SL1 to be shorted, but from what I hear the big problem is people shorting it against the case, and when the DS is open (to install the chip) that shouldn't be a big problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Selling chips flashed with only the FlashMe recovery code is a nice idea (especially if the MAC isn't in that sector), but you'd still have to short SL1 to install the rest of FlashMe unless the entire first 64K were provided, in which case you still have 1/4 of Nintendo's firmware which is probably still illegal.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
