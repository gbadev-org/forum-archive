<ul>
<br/>
<li>Is PlayYan Micro the same than the original, just "shrinked"?
<br/>
</li><li>Can we put homebrew demos and play them? maybe the same way we put demos and emulators on the GBAMP.

I'm considering the PlayYan over the GBAMP (or M3) because it's Nintendo and it can play AAC files. I have a flash cart, so running homebrew code is not a desicional factor, but it would be nice...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think the Play-Yan can play any homebrew yet. I'd stick with the GBAMPv2, as akit if cool stuff written specifically for it is out there, like SCUMM, and Moonshell, that and the GBAMPv2 will only run you $25 on Lik-Sang, as opposed to the m3, for 80 something dollars.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1. Yes, kind of. Although it doesn't support minigames from Nintendo's website.
<br/>
2. Nope, until it's firmware is cracked (It'd be nice though.)
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: Did anyone even tried to crack it? I'd just love paying a bit extra for not having GBAmp sticking out...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
