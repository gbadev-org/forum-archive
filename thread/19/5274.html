    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm wondering if the officailly license play yan works with pass me to use the DS hard ware.
<br/>
 In other word could I use DSpaint on a Playyan though passme chip. 
<br/>
I want to get one, seen as they are officailly licensed and cheapish, from play asia.
<br/>
 Thanks in advance</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also see <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n08/playan/" target="_blank">http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n08/playan/</a> for info.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think the Play-yan allows files other than music and movies to be played...with that said, I think <a class="postlink" href="http://www.lik-sang.com/info.php?category=246&amp;products_id=3983&amp;" target="_blank">this</a> would be a more suitable choice, but Lik-Sang says homebrew software is limited to 192 kb, which is sorta crappy...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The play yan plays games available from the nintendo website, someone posted about it yesterday.
<br/>
 I'm probally going to order one anyway and a passme., mostly because I rather have the official thing but it using SD cards is a bonus.
<br/>
 When I do I post to tell you if it works with homebrew and passme/though</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You probably could use it with PassMe, if you swap cartridge. But you only want it for the SD slot?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, It's quite cheap at ?30, I already own SD cards, so don't need to spend extra money. If I want more space I game buy an SD card locally rather then order from the internet. And If anything goes wrong then theres a chance I'll be able to send it to Nintendo of Europe for repairs etc.
<br/>
 The same way I'm buying the official screen covers seen as nintendos official stance on 3rd party ones, is that If they find out you use them then they will void the warranty.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
