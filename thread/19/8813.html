    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i went to nintendo world (in new york ) to day and they have a download play
<br/>
"manager"
<br/>
(will have photos up soon)
<br/>
and it checks for RSA sig. when its first starting up
<br/>
but then when you launch the demos on the list
<br/>
it give you a precentage and never shows the nintendo logo at the top again
<br/>
<br/>
so i think it only checks for rsa when its first conecting to the download play device.
<br/>
so if we can capture the download play manager we can launch homebrew from a wifi card to ANY ds's 
<br/>
no matter the firmware version :D:D:D
<br/>
<br/>
btw...
<br/>
i talked to the manager and he "SAID" that the ds download play machine(out of sight...) is a ds that is always on with a special cartrage

the way i see it is that nintendo made this as a quick project (untill it comes out everywhere else) judging by the description the manager gave me :P

<br/>
so this would be GREAT if we could PLEASE PLEASE

steal a capture of this!

someone please try atleast :P

so how do you guys capture them anyway?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

Interestingly, there's an ethernet port on the box.

lol

also there is more then just one step to be captured...

see it first loads the download manager,

then it retrives the app list :D

then you can download the demo of choice

so it might need some extra hard ware to "watch" the ds's responses :P<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, this sounds cool and I too want to see it captured.  However: how do you know that it doesn't do authentication of the downloaded data?  The initial WMB download may contain its own code to check signatures.  Or it might have something simpler like checksums of the demos known to be on the host - the point is, you don't know what it is or is not doing in terms of verifying downloaded data until we get our hands on it.
<br/>
<br/>
I doubt Nintendo would make such a massive blunder as to RSA-sign something so flawed, opening their lovely new DS lite units wide open.  It's possible but I'm skeptical.<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC
<br/>
I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.

<br/>
<br/>
If you want to capture the "old way" download the AiroPeek demo from WildPackets.com, and the approriate drivers for your card. (It supports a bunch of cards)
<br/>
Transfer the demo to your DS, and use Airopeek to "capture" the transmission. Do this several times, (I think 5 or more) and save the packet dumps each time. (Sometimes packets will get lost and not be seen by your laptop)
<br/>
<br/>
Post the packet dumps online, and wait for someone who knows what they're doing to re-assemble them into useful data. That's the only way to get them without a special capture program.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, sure, but would Nintendo see it your way?  Not a chance.  You'd at least be out court costs if they decided to do something about it.  Legality isn't set in stone, a lot of it is precedents (including "fair use") which are the result of legal <span style="font-weight: bold">battles</span> and are subject to potentially being overturned.
<br/>
<br/>
I think even if we captured just the download client, that would be enough to get an idea of whether the thing has the security hole we're hoping it has.  (I still see no reason to <span style="font-weight: bold">assume</span> it has such a gaping security hole - but I'm with everybody else in feeling it's worth a try.)
