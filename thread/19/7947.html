    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a question for which I could not find the answer on the board or anywhere else on the internet.
<br/>
<br/>
I have the AD3P Nintendogs Labrador &amp; Friends. The dogs are well trained. Now I want to make a backup of the savegame before I let other people play with my dogs.
<br/>
<br/>
Probably I have all the equipment to do this (I have at least the Nintendo DS, EZ-PASS2 + programming cable, EZ-Flash II 512, EZ-Flash III 1Gb, Super Card SD and the chinese movieplayer) but I cannot find any software that helps.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it in anyway possible to readout the SRAM of an original Nintendo Game and write it back to a flash-cartridge so you could write it to the harddisk of your PC?????</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You'll want to use that with either your Supercard SD or your GBA movie player, as it'll generate a .sav file and save it directly to the media.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It works, now i have a $00000000_1230_222747.SAV of 256Kb, when I view it with a hex-editor I see the dognames inside.
<br/>
<br/>
I used the Super Card SD for this.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all of you!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
