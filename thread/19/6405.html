    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SolidSnake: I have a DS and a f2a 1gig ultra, and they work together no problem (same as on a gba), the gba multiboot menu that is included with powerwriter and usbwriter work fine (the bootmenu depends on the f2a hardware and not the gba side hardware, aside from the fact that it is coded to run on gba or gba emulator). 
<br/>
<br/>
Also, this cart works great for DS homebrew with either the passme and flashme, and darkains multi-loader is also working well from this cart (aside from the few things it cannot load as it stands now).
<br/>
<br/>
Since there is no link port on the DS, you will either need a GBA(or SP) with the usb linker or you will need the standalone usb writer... from your question I am assuming you already have a gba/linker and the cart, but if you decide to get rid of the gba and get a DS remember that you will still need a way to burn the cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you are using it for GBA roms, it functions the same on a DS as on a GBA.  If you are using it for DS roms with PassMe or FlashMe/WifiMe, you must disable "multiple roms" or disable "menu" function on the card.  
<br/>
<br/>
you can still use darkstar loader to load multiple nds roms onto your flash cart, but the CART's menu/multibooter must be disabled.  (darkstar is a multiboot for nds roms, but is compiled by the user into a single ds.gba file, so your cart flashing utility sees it as ONE rom)
<br/>
<br/>
hope that helps.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, I'd get the post Darkstar loader...the one not tied into Darkstar, it's more compatible, and is way slicker.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

sorry solidsnake..  you see, Darkain released something called "Darkstar", which combined a multi-loader for .nds files with a collection of nifty apps (a paint program, minesweeper, and stuff like that) with a fractal wallpaper in the background.
<br/>
<br/>
Subsequently, he has revised the release... Darkstar and the Multi-loader are now seperate components.  The multi loader is only associated with booting .nds files, and darkstar is now a seperate app.
<br/>
<br/>
hope that explains it.
