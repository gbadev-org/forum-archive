    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I heard that if you have one of those cheap EZ3in1 expansion carts, you can use GBA programs from the R4DS or any other Slot 1 solutions that way. Is this true? And if so, would it be cheaper in the long run to get these two, rather than something expensive like an M3 Lite Perfect? Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it's definitely cheaper
<br/>
<br/>
i have a m3 lite perfect, and briefly had a ezflash 3-1
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, i liked the M3 a lot better, but if I had the Ezflash first, i wouldn't have bothered with the M3
<br/>
<br/>
for me, the M3 was worth the extra cost (i keep my GBA, MP3's and DPG files all on the 2nd SD card in the M3)
<br/>
<br/>
it's just nice(imo) to have that 2nd microSD card for storage</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do they get flashed from the r4ds/slot 1? Or would I need a program from a PC?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks for the review. It's interesting to see a screenshot of copyTest in a review. :) 
<br/>
<br/>
For those looking into the 3in1, it's a great card. I recommend using GBALdr instead of copyTest though. I haven't been updating copyTest lately and we did find a few bugs that are fixed in GBALdr but not in copyTest.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#133152 - MechaBouncer - Tue Jul 03, 2007 8:54 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently started looking at moving over to a MicroSD-based adapter to fit flush with a DS Lite (whether it be Slot-1 or Slot-2). I've been through this game before already when I moved from a GBAMPv2 to a SuperCard SD adapter (and using a Datel Max Media Launcher for a NoPass). Now the SCSD is acting up and not reading my cards all the time (a little DE-OX-ID on the connector seems to help) and I want a smaller package anyway to eliminate the extra bulk sticking out. So I'm familiar with all the DLDI patching and such.
<br/>
<br/>
I've narrowed my choices down to either a M3 Perfect Lite or a Slot-1 card and an EZ-Flash 3-in-1 expansion cart, but am a bit curious about the 3-in-1 as well. The addition of rumble and extra RAM, as well as the ability to run GBA binaries is very interesting. The thing is, can the 3-in-1 be used with regular DS cards for rumble, or is it only homebrew and yarr? I seem to remember that it also doesn't work for the real Opera web browser card and instead requires a patched version to use the onboard RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
Which brings to mind another question, just how much RAM is actually on it? I keep seeing that it has 32MB of NOR flash for GBA binaries, but that review states it only has 4MB of PSRAM!? The thing is, isn't the Opera expansion pack 8MB? And even then, it's a small fraction compared to the 32MB that the M3 Perfect Lite offers. I tend to like the idea of having more RAM available because I would think that would be more likely used in homebrew than rumble.
<br/>
<br/>
And that brings us to the last concern I have over the 3-in-1: homebrew support. Is there anything out there that is compatible with the 3-in-1 (besides the obvious dedicated programs to copy data back and forth)? I would imagine that it would be less compatible with existing homebrew than the tried and trued M3 products. And beyond that, how is the homebrew to know if it is even there for use as RAM or for rumble? It would seem like it would take more work to make use of it than cards like the M3 or SC, which I assume would be rather similar and there are so many flavors of them out there that mostly behave the same.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I really want to know is if there is any reason it would be worth it to buy a Slot-1 card with the 3-in-1 over buying the M3 Perfect Lite if I can afford it? I admit, it might be cool to run apps off of the Slot-1 card and only use the 3-in-1 for special functions or GBA, but it seems like I would get more out of the M3. And I'm avoiding the SC Lite because I'd rather not deal with what I hear could be two versions of the hardware and the need to patch homebrew apps for it. The M3 Perfect Lite, when properly DLDI patched, works with everything the other Slot-2 M3 Perfects do, right? There isn't anything special about it, is there? And I know in the past, Slot-2 cards had higher homebrew compatibility, but has that changed at all since DLDI came about? Is Slot-2 still the best, or is it a moot point now?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The 3in1 has 16MB PSRAM. I don't know that it matters much, as little can use ram expansions. DSLinux can use it, I don't know what else. It's very easy to detect and support, so you should see more support in the future. There is a simple check function to detect the 3in1. If you find it, you can then enable the rumble or RAM. Easy to do from homebrew and there are examples available. 
<br/>
<br/>
Rumble and RAM for commercial DS carts will not work. You have to use <span style="font-weight: bold">[Nitro Hax. -- MOD]</span>
<br/>
<br/>
As for what to buy? I don't know. I like the M3Simply + 3in1 combo, it has the most capability. However, much of that capability is unrealized right now. The M3 Perfect is a very nice setup. Last I checked it has no rumble, but can do everything else the 3in1 can. Homebrew seems to work fine on my Simply so long as it's reasonably modern and works with DLDI. I do have an old M3 Perfect CF that I can use older stuff on, but I haven't used it in months. So if you don't mind possible problems with old homebrew, the Simply or most other Slot-1 cards will get the job done for you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Using Nitro Hax, huh? As in running a cheat code to do so? I've tried searching more information on how to do that, but can't find it. Is it documented somewhere how to do that?
<br/>
<br/>
I find myself not running a whole lot of older homebrew (at least not since DLDI came about). I suppose the Slot-1 and 3-in-1 could still work out what with it being cheaper and all. Now I guess the new question is, if I pick a Slot-1, what do I go with? I hear the R4DS and M3DSS are the same thing, right? Now what about the EZ-Flash V (because the bundle with the 3-in-1 is the cheapest)? Or is the EZ-Flash V not as well liked? I noticed the note on the DLDI page, does that mean every homebrew program needs to be patched? And does the CycloDS offer any additional benefit for the extra cost? I noticed the automatic DLDI patching. Is that it?<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL
