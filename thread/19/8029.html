    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If anyone happen to have a F5D7000 v3000tt do you have any idea
<br/>
if it is the same has v3??
<br/>
I checked on belkin's homepage: <a href="http://www.belkin.com" target="_blank">www.belkin.com</a>
<br/>
and the only version they have for F5D7000 are v2 to v5
<br/>
<br/>
I thought v3000tt would be v3...Anyone knows anything about this??
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I checked deeper and what they call version 3 is actually the v3000tt.
<br/>
<br/>
Though i still get the 'The Specified location does not contain information about your hardware' message... That definitely sucks! :'(
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone got an idea or had the same problem and managed to fix it??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
