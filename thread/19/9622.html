<br/>
today i've received my M3 Adapter.
<br/>
But it doesn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
Like it's described here -&gt; <a href="http://www.dualscene.net/viewpage.php?page_id=41" target="_blank">http://www.dualscene.net/viewpage.php?page_id=41</a> ,
<br/>
i've put the File on my MiniSD-Card.
<br/>
Then i put the M3 with the miniSD-card in it into my DSlite.
<br/>
But when i select the GBA-Game-Button in the DS-Menu, the screen keeps black after the GBA-Logo.
<br/>
<br/>

Have you tried doing a firmware update of the M3?  It's possible it will be able to do that even if it can't start now.  That could fix it if it can.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Or try the M3 adapter in a GBA SP with a .gba game if you can so you can test to ensure defective hardware. If it does the same thing, then it is probably defective hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I didn't used the Game Manager yet, because it was not necessary - the M3 even don't boot...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
