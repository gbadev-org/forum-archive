    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am looking at what SD memory I should by for either the M3 or Supercard.
<br/>
<br/>
My local retailor has this:
<br/>
OCZ 2GB 133X HI-SPEED SD Secure Digital Flash Card
<br/>
<a href="http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=18312" target="_blank">http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=18312</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I have OCZ memory in my computer and its awsome, very fast and good quality. But will it work with these DS readers?
<br/>
<br/>
And this memory is "hi speed" 133X, will the M3 or Supercard be able to match that at all? What are the max speeds they can run at?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

TBH I don't understand how memory can be 'good quality', it either works or it doesn't.  Don't get sucked in by brand names (apart from the Big N of course).  Just because they make good PC ram doesn't mean they make good SD cards.  They more than likely just buy someone elses and rebrand it.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what the odds on it not being compatible though.  Ask the retailer if it's ok to test it to see if it works.  If they complain, threaten to go someone else.  It's what I always do</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it does make a huge difference. Each bit is checked for quality, much higher quality control. Plus the Platinum OCZ has a low latency 3mx, so its faster than your regular cheap ram. Plus they have heatsinks and a lifetime warenty. 
<br/>
<br/>
So there is a fairly large difference betwen the cheapo generic ram and good quality stuff like this, if you are willing to pay extra.
<br/>
<br/>
But fas as SD memory, i don't know if there is differences, thats why I was asking. Also the OCZ SD memory is really cheap.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In regards to your speed question, Supercard can 'handle' speeds of 133x on a SD card, I have one myself. I've heard of up to 150x and I believe 160x as well working just fine with SuperCard SD.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
