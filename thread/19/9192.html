    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I have a nice, new Enamel Navy DSlite, bricked.
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to flash my lite, just as I flashed a lot of DSes in the past few months, but something went very wrong. It started up just as any other flashing, but when it reached 1% the screens turned off.
<br/>
<br/>
So now I have a $200 paperweight.
<br/>
<br/>
Is their anybody here who can fix this? I don't have an soldering skills, and I don't have the needed special screwdriver.
<br/>
<br/>
Please help!
<br/>
<br/>
PS: I live in the Netherlands, maybe there's someone around here who can help?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I believed people who were saying so, so I went away trying to flash my lite.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried the Flashme-lite BETA, btw. Got it off an Italian GBA/DS site, I believe.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it was in the fact I used an M3.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That may not have been an actual flashme.  Simply put.  Its easy for anybody to write a "flashme" bricker, that asks the user to short SL1.  Once SL1 is shorted, and the first page of the firmware has been erased,  all that it has to do, is write the power management register with the power off bit.  boom, done, ds bricked.
<br/>
<br/>
Always grab flashme from pages linked through <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~tew/" target="_blank">http://www.cs.utah.edu/~tew/</a>.

im hesitating to post it on the forum since if loopy doenst want it publicized, then it is proally wise not to. btw, there's no links to it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I hope there isn't a huge problem with flashing the DS Lite (that this doesn't turn into a really common problem I mean)....I would like to flash mine in the future once I get it.  This has me a bit worried...have any other people here flashed their Lite's successfully?<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If they're turning themselves off, it would have to be some sort of hardware issue; it's not like they can be running any code amongst FlashMe (unless perhaps they set interrupts beforehand that FlashMe doesn't disable, or use some trick to prevent it from disabling them). Maybe it's something weird like if you have it shorted too long before any writes are performed, it shuts down.
<br/>
<br/>
I think it's more likely just a bug/hardware oddity, though. I mean, such a "protection" could easily screw over developers who have a legit reason to reflash their firmware (which must be fairly common, given how easy it is).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe it was in the circumstances. I didn't have it plugged in, since the DSlite was fully loaded. And I used an M3-CF.
<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, I had the same symptoms as described earlier, but were considered an aprils' fool.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, since there is a way to de-brick a DS by hardware re-flashing it, could this be possible with a DSlite, too?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I remember someone creating such a method after the first DS malware was released.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">As I was trying to flash the DS Litem, it went off at 1% as well.
<br/>
But I was able to boot it up again (I think it was with A+B+Select+Start) though.
<br/>
<br/>
I take it that at the current moment, when you turn on the DS Lite, u get the green light(indicating that the power is on) and both the screen are not powered up, right? If that is the case. Then it would be exactly the same for me.
<br/>
<br/>
What i did was to hold down A+B+Select+Start before turning the power on and after I did the screen booted up. Do make sure that you are pressing the Select and Start button properly though. The buttos are a bit funny compared to the old DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck with the flashing. Fret not should the DS Lite turns off again while flashing. Just boot up the same way and flash it till it's done.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Still, some people haven't manged to recover and are still bricked.

I have succesfully flashed my DS lite which came from the so-called 3rd wave shipment, I used the second beta flashme and supercard to do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

DS Lite Enamel Navy (bought 11 march), passme@passme2, Metroid (demo), SuperCard SD, flashme v7 and aluminium foil instead of screwdriver. Flashed with no problems, light automatically set to second level.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, UPDATE! Probably Badbob's quote was correct! Problem is, I only have an M3 and a GBAMP. I've red on some other forum that using the M3 might be the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, when I put in the GBAMP with flashme.nds renamed to _BOOT_MP.nds, the upper screen turns on! And the familiar GBA chime sounds.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I'm guessing the fail-safe code is indeed in place, it's just not fully compatible with the GBAMP. Is it possible that a newer version of the GBAMP firmware is compatible? I'll try it out.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I know a guy with an GBA-flash card, which should enable me to fix it anyway!
<br/>
<br/>
So thanks guys, hopefully! I'll let you know if it worked!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I installed a newer version of the GBAMP bootstrap, and then succesfully installed Flashme v7!

It's now stuck at the brightest setting, but that doesn't matter, IT'S ALIVE, etc.

Thanks for the feedback!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
