Am I the only person that gets irritated by people calling flash carts 'mod chips'? 
<br/>
<br/>
Why don't people understand that mod chips and flash carts are two completely different things. It really is very simple, and mod chip has to be soldered internally to the console to bypass its security. A flash cart is, as the name suggests a cartridge with flash memory on it that is used as a regular cart without having to solder anything or modify the console at all. It is a storage device, not just a security bypass.
<br/>
<br/>
Please use the correct name when talking about DS homebrew.

The original PlayStation console had a "parallel port" on the outside. This was probably intended for expansions such as the one that would let a CD-i player play VCDs, but only "plugmods" such as Action Replay were ever made to fit into this port. Such plugmods were external, but they still acted like modchips. Sony removed the parallel port in the SCPH-9000 versions of the PlayStation.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, it's not really a Modchip, a modchip is a circuit board and goes inside the console, usually needing soldering, and voids warranty because you open your console.
<br/>
<br/>
DS cards, GBA carts, etc don't void warranty and don't go inside the console.  If the console has a port designed to put stuff in, such as the parallel, USB, or cartridge ports, it's not really a "mod" but if it goes on the board without a designated port, I'd consider it a modchip.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, tepples has a point.  The Games n' Music (like all other removable media carts) uses a 512KByte Flash chip (I think it's 512K anyways) to store its firmware (I think the GBAMP has a 512KB chip too) and a microSD port to load external software...so it's kinda like both, but it's probably hard to write to the cart's firmware chip (though a better alternative firmware for the GnM would rule, the default one has an awful media player that could be replaced with something like auto DLDI patching or dual slot booting and it would be great).<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Soldering something in or making a slide-in thing makes no difference, it's still metal contacts touching each other.
<br/>
<br/>
If a console had a few sticking out pins, and a mod chip used these pins - the mod chip could have some simple slide-on things to connect without soldering - like a motherboard jumper, where they just slide on. It wouldn't make a difference if it were a mod chip or not.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
As for PassMe being a modchip? ( I know all about building PassMe's, I built around 1,000 of them) Depends on if you want to clarify the requirements of a modchip.  I'm sure most would require it to be within the console and normally attached to the motherboard.  PassMe does not meet those two requirements.  If you make the requirements for "modchips" to loose, everything that isn't licensed by Nintendo would equal a modchip.

<br/>
The whole problem with this thread is that it is discussing terms, yet nobody defines those terms.  If anything the bypasses security checks is a modchip to someone, without defining what you are talking about, nobody will agree with each other nor learn anything.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I consider anything that uses only existing hardware with new software (not rewiring, or anything, just software) to perform any task that the system wasn't intended for (homebrew, piracy, backups, etc) a softmod.  FlashMe, WiFiMe, etc are softmods.  A flash card uses its own hardware, but is temporary and doesn't require internal console modification, therefore it's neither a mochip nor a softmod.  A modchip is a device that is attached permanently to the inside of a console, usually requiring soldering, and modifies the system's internal workings.  Modifying a console by shorting out pins or rewiring the insides, but not adding anything like a modchip, I guess I would call that a hardware mod, but I don't think there are any such mods for current systems.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
