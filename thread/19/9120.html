you require a passme (or similar) to do this though, right?
<br/>
<br/>
i own a silver uk ds + mario kart bundle (purchased dec 2005) and did a firmware test last night. the screen appeared dark green (so i assume my machine is firmware v3).
<br/>
<br/>
i also own a gbamp2 and 128mb CF card.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
until now i haven't attempted to use it for anything other than playing commercial games, movies and gba nes/sms emulators (i haven't even managed to successfully configure the wifi settings yet!). 
<br/>
<br/>
however now that i've seen the release of 'nitro tracker' i am really keen to do whatever it takes to get it running on my ds asap!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
please can someone confirm if i'll have to purchase a passme to do so?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">also do you need a bootloader to run the gba stuff
<br/>
<br/>
so what happens
<br/>
<br/>
-turn on ds, go 2 gbamp, run ndsmp.gba and then hit l+r+select and i think this flashes my card
<br/>
-then i take out cf card, put a homebrew .nds file on the card and change whatever the name of the .nds to _boot_mp.nds.  At this point on the cf card i have ndsmp.gba and _boop_mp.nds
<br/>
-i take out of computer and put into my handheld
<br/>
-from here i proceed to start wifime and run wmb.exe /data wifime
<br/>
-program starts ,and sents "multiboot passme" and i start download on nintendo ds
<br/>
-10-100 it finishes then my nintendo ds starts loading both screens white with one saying nintendo ds, and then NOW THIS IS WHAT IM CONFUSED ABOUT from the two white screens it goes into the gbamp.  From my understanding i thought it was suppose to load the .nds file that i previosly changed to _boot_mp.nds.  I may be wrong, also am i forgeting something i need on the cf card? like a boot loader, becuase all i have is a _boot_mp.nds and a ndsmp.gba</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

most people who bought the equipment intented to flash it when they ordered it(like me :P)
