    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello All,
<br/>
After reading through all the help here I still have a few questions to get my DS to run the nintendo demos. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have a JAHT WN-4054P wifi card (RALink chipset confirmed with PCItree) and have gotten the 1.0.0.8 driver installed with no problem. 
<br/>
<br/>
When running the DOS command wmb -data xxxx.nds I end up with the error "DeviceWritePacket() failed". 
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried using both ver 1.4 and ver 1.1 of the WMB software, with the same error. I have also tried both slots of my laptop but with no luck. Any suggestions, or is my card smoked?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
