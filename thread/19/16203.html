    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
<br/>
The problem I'm having is regarding the boot icon in the settings menu. I only get the option of "NO" when trying to change the boot method when the DS is first turned on, from going directly to the M3 DS Real menu, instead of the DS main menu with the Pictochat, Download Play, etc. Is anyone else having this problem/issue? Its a pain because when I want to play games using download play, I have to remove the M3 from the DS before turning it on.
<br/>
<br/>
Please, anyone how to make it work?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm pretty sure that setting is a holdover from the G6Real cartridge (they both use the same firmware), which might not auto-start (and auto-pass the health screen no matter what you have the setting set to in the DS' firmware) like the M3DSReal, and you won't be able to get the M3 to work that way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you hold select on powerup, it should go to the DS firmware menu.  You can set the DS to automatic or manual slot-1 booting.  Some cards need to be started automatically and they overide the DS setting (unless you hold select).  The button combinations can vary if you have flashme installed (should still be some combo of select and/or start).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
