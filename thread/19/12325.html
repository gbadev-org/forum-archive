    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
I got a PassCard + G6Flash card for homebrews.  However, I would like to throw in some music so I can listen to them or something.
<br/>
The box said there's a build in media player (MediaplayExtend, in the main folder it's just a .dat file that I can't open, in PC or in NDS).  Anyway, I tried to run some music in the NDS by running the MediaplayExtend and selecting files.  It doesn't recognize any playable files.
<br/>
<br/>
The MediaplayExtend.dat file originally in the NDS.

<br/>
<br/>
So I downloaded MoonShell and then discovered there is already a SHELL file in the G6Flash.  I looked up some guide and it told me I should several files inside to know that I can run musics in the NDS.  I peeked in the original file in the NDS and found none of it, so I installed MoonShell in the NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
SHELL folder that came with the G6Flash card
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
And it turns out that it still doesn't work.  In both scenarios, I checked that the file is in the G6Flash Card.  And yes, it works fine on the PC.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone has some solution to this?  Thanks in advance ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would, but .wav requires way too much space so I figured making this weird mp3 player work would be better =P
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestion though ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You only need the .wav files on your hard drive when building the GSM file; you don't put them on the G6 card. You can also get away with downsampling them to 22050 Hz mono when saving them to the "wavs" folder. At the 150 minute maximum length of a GSM Player compilation, that's only about 400 MB of temp space on your HD before it's all compressed down to 32 MB. Have you actually tried GSM Player?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm... I just tried it and converted a whole bunch of music.  One problem I am noticing is it converted them all into separate files instead of one compressed file as described in the README.
<br/>
And 2nd, I have no idea which file in the folder is the program (I have a feeling I am going to feel stupid when you explain it to me).
<br/>
Then I thought about it, I thought it would produce me a rom file so I can run it like a game (which the player is build in I assume).
<br/>
But then, why doesn't it turn into a rom Oo?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GSM Player's Go.bat performs three steps: <ol type="1"><li>Converts the .wav files into .gsm files. </li><li>Combines the .gsm files into one file gsmsongs.gbfs. </li><li>Combines the player (x.bin) and gsmsongs.gbfs into gsm.gba.</li></ol>

From README.txt:

Did Go.bat fail for some reason? If you are still on Windows 9x, you'll need to run Go-win9x.bat instead.

It is supposed to. Does Go.bat give you errors?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Anyway I tried chishm's way and it worked.
<br/>
I might try to GBA way later but as of right now I am dead tired (and I suspect I did something wrong.. but I followed the process).
<br/>
Is the quality (for the music) for the GBA way not really bad or is it horrid?
<br/>
O btw thanks to both of you guys =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's 30 kbps, but it's good enough if you're outdoors or in a moving vehicle.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
