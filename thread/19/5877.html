    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've read various posts of people saying certain XG2s will work in replacing the firmware. The problem of course is that it has the built in menu system which seems to be removable on certain version. Trying to navigate the XG2 site is not exactly a great time. 
<br/>
<br/>
SO- 
<br/>
<br/>
The XG2Turbo that does NOT have the external linker and instead uses the gameboy to program. Will that work with a WiFiMe solution to flash the firmware? 
<br/>
<br/>
It kindof seems like the worst possible card to use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">are you saying you have this card, or that you are considering buying it? I would advise against buying it, there are better/cheaper ones out there.
<br/>
<br/>
 If you already have it, I believe that cart should work. Basically you just need to remove the menu/booter, and flash the flashme.ds.gba as the first rom on the cart. If there is no menu option to remove it, there may be a .bat file you can run, or a .ini file you can edit (sorry, don't know much about it)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ask the XG guys to hand over the details :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">is there a file named something like boot.bin or loader.bin or something? can you give us a link to the software or post the files themselves? 
<br/>
is it a "XG2Turbo Plus 2004" ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it's not a PLUS
<br/>
as far as i know it looks like they've made one that has an external writer. (the plus is the model with the removable battery) The X2G Turbo writes while it's plugged into the gameboy. 
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately on their website i cannot find a version of the software that works with the cable. I am using an older one that came on the CD. i have no place to host these files to show them to anyone. but they're just an .exe and  2 .inf files for XP and 98 drivers
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: It seems the version that works under the name XG2 Turbo is the XG2 Turbo <span style="font-weight: bold">2005</span> .. which uses the external USB adapter similar to the one everyone seems to be complaining about is in the NeoFlash. 
<br/>
<br/>
and the XG2 website is VERY DOWN- but it looks like they just dropped support for the model card. So no option anywhere to drop the menu- thanks for the help anyway! 
<br/>
<br/>
any suggestions on new cards?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

also the EFA 256 works well in general, and is also one of the cheaper ones:
