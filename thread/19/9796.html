the superkey has support for sleep mode :D,
<br/>
which means it is already better then MML.
<br/>
<br/>
of course the fact that the company making it does not lie about when the product is avalible is also a big plus :)
<br/>
<br/>
i wonder how much its gonna be...
<br/>
and what it contains :D

That sounds a bit biased, MML only has sleep issues on non-homebrew and can easilly be fixed by a cart swap or flashme

They probably didn't. The guys who bought it first were all US and places, Datel is UK - I got my UK order within days.

Doubt it, the Datel one has it's legit own headers etc...

I think it will cost more than MML.  :(  I'm hoping to be able to put some more low cost devkits together using a NoPass+GBA MP..  Datel won't respond to my e-mails and SC's prices are a little higher than I'd like.  And that is before shipping/customs fees.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:  Nope.. Hopebuy.com (Super Cards retail site) is showing $19 for it..  Hopefully their builk prices will go down so that I can get it cheaper than $19 each with shipping/customs fees..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
after you said that I purposefully installed the default firmware and downloaded a copy of that trojan, the one that bricks your DS and your GBAMP.. I prooved you wrong! :D (only joking of course)
<br/>
<br/>
The reason why there's been no cases of a nopass user and a bricked DS is because at the moment there's no DS trojans going around, that doesn't mean there wont be more in the future.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The one (or two if you wanna count them seperate) was a proof of concept.  If it wasn't for that proof of concept, nobody would be aware of the danger, and a LOT of people could have been hit by a timed trojan (for example, if you start the homebrew today (6/6/06) or after, it bricks your DS).
<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind, that all unauthorized software could have such code in it.  So, just because a couple of trojans hit the scene and died quickly, doesn't mean the next awesome homebrew to release can't have something simular in it.
<br/>
<br/>
Point?  It's better to be safe than sorry.  And wish you would have installed FlashMe after you bricked your DS.
<br/>
<br/>
So, just because your home computer has never been hacked, do you NOT run a firewall?  No.. you run a firewall so it doesn't get hacked.  Use protection before, not after.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
