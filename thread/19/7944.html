    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My Equipment:
<br/>
Nintendo DS rev 3 &lt;- thats the number in the box at the end of the code at least
<br/>
Magic Key 3
<br/>
1 gig San Disk sd Card
<br/>
Mario 64 Ds game
<br/>
and a Easy Usb 256 meg GBA flash cartridge, the one that comes in a wooden box <a href="http://www.divineo.com/cgi-bin/div-us/dd-gba-scl" target="_blank">http://www.divineo.com/cgi-bin/div-us/dd-gba-scl</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Heres the full story
<br/>
<br/>
I was stupid and first bought the solo mk3
<br/>
then I realized I needed a Ds game so I bought Mario
<br/>
then I also realized that I need a gba flash cart so I bought the solo one on the Ds page at dvineo
<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I put my Mk3 in with the Ds game in it boots to a white screen
<br/>
And my Ds does not recognize my flash cart as being in when i boot without mk3
<br/>
I have put the menu loader for mk3 v0.3 on it
<br/>
<br/>
Now with my flash cart i hat a unique experience
<br/>
It booted up once as a ds addon cart or sometrhing along those lines but I could not select it this is when i had the ds game in without mk3
<br/>
<br/>
So could someone analyse my situation and give/point me in the direction of complete instructions to fix me.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry and Thanks if you can</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
