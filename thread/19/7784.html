    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just received my superpass and when I install the .nds.gba files that I patched with NDSpatcher on my xgflash1 256 card and insert both the flash card and the superpass, I just get a white screen on both screens. 
<br/>
Am I doing something wrong? Do I need to install special sram or something?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think you need Superpass2. What color is your DS and what's your serial beginning with? That's on the back of DS (eg. NEF107******* - use some stars so that noone can steal away your serial).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Its silver an australian model and its NAF 100****3, I checked this up with <a href="http://www.dspassme.com/dstrackerlist.shtml" target="_blank">www.dspassme.com/dstrackerlist.shtml</a> and my serial is listed twice there once with a passme and once with a superpass and they both say compatible. I researched it before I bought anything and now it's not working. It's really burning me.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone confirm that if you put in a superpass with the new firmware, it only shows white?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

NDS Screens Both White

This is actually good, this means that PassMe is working, you just need to figure out why it won't run DS code from your flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
   1. Try erasing your flash cart and only loading the name.ds.gba file. (Not the .bin file, those are only for emulators.)
<br/>
   2. Try a demo that is known to be working.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks, I have done what you have said but it still doesn't work. I have purchased a Supercard anyways and I will hopefully receive it tomorrow or next week.  If I put the Supercard withhout an SD card in it does it somehow show the Supercard screen as I don't have an SD card yet and I am just wondering if I can test it before I get an SD card.
<br/>

Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Serial number doesn't matter.. when did you buy it?  If you purchased it after Oct. 1st, then it probably has new firmware and your screwed.  It's still true that the PassMe is doing it's job (redirecting) but the firmware is not allowing it to redirect to the GBA slot (as it is only allowd to jump to a specific address range).  Get a PassMe2 or reprogram your current one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well yeah, I bought it with the Mario Kart DS bundle so it's pretty new. But here in Australia it is the original silver colour and the original box with a sticker of Mario Kart on the front, not an actual Mario Kart box. So it may well be an older firmware DS. But I will try with my Superpass which will definately come in on Monday. 
<br/>
Is there a way I can check if the Superpass + Supercard work without an SD card as I am yet to buy one.
<br/>
