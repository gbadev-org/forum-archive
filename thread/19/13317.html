    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I just got a brandnew R4DS, the shop guy told me, that there is a totally new delivery. I opened it and made some fotos. I think, that this might be a new R4DS revision.
<br/>
<br/>
First two pictures:
<br/>
The new R4 is on the left side. On the right side there is my "old" card from the second revision where they took out the soldering pads. With these pads it was possible to convert a R4 to an M3 and vice-versa.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But if you look at the left PCB, the soldering pads are back again. Perhaps it is possible again to switch R4/M3 and language. And the glob-topped chip was replaced by a real, normal chip.
<br/>
<br/>
The last image shows the first (right) and second (left) revision again for comparision.
<br/>
<br/>
Have a look at the serial numbers on the metal SD-card-holder. They are ascending from revision to revision...
<br/>
<br/>
So does anybody know something about this revision?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i have an earlier r4 i think i established it was one of the ones i could switch to an m3 if i was so inclined.. i have to wonder tho.. is it really that much worth it?
<br/>
<br/>
either way kind of neat you do that.. i wonder if there's a reason the m3's are more expensive than the r4's..
<br/>
<br/>
i came across a link describing how to make an english r4 into an english m3 ( i think u could make them chinese too or am i on crack?) you have a similar link handy? 
<br/>
<br/>
my wife has the r4 that came with the card reader key u have in the pic.. mines older it came with a thicker black one.. i'm sure what key it comes with doesn't determine what revision of r4 it is but who knows.<br/>_________________<br/>/ . <span style="font-weight: bold"> o 0 avid 0 o </span> . /

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hamper, the glob chip you are describing is also under the older model, it is just a thick "glob" of epoxy which hasn't been placed on the new model. Other than that I doubt that they re-enabled the firmware and language hacks.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I see. But i know that there was a lot of the older version with a chip without this glob top (which is the correct technical expression for this, i think). This chip was labelled with ATF01 0648#, and my chip has ATF01 0712# on it. So there might be a (small) difference, perhaps an improvement? But the letters on the PCB are still 0648 as you can see, so the new chip must be pin compatible.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, does anybody know what kind of chip is this? (Microcontroller or ASIC)?
<br/>
<br/>
And I didnt try if it is possible to convert this new R4 to an M3 by soldering/Shorting the solder pads. Like avid said, its not really worth it. Im just curious if this is possible again. ;)
<br/>
Ok, you will shout: Try it yourself! But currently I dont have time. And my soldering broke (no joke)...
<br/>
<br/>
Avid, here is the link how to convert an R4 to an M3 (old version):

And here a guy who put a switch in his R4 so he can switch betweem R4 and M3 ^^
