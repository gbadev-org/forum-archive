    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ds flash cards are becoming increasingly rare where I live, recently I went over to my friend's house and he happened to have a DSi. Right away I thought of dsdoom, I knew that the DSi was more powerful than my current Ds Lite (which had a bit of trouble running dsdoom) so I plopped my cassette into the DSi, fired it up and then found out that the DSi couldn't detect the cassette. Later that day, I went checked the web and found out that Nintendo had added some new anti-piracy software to prevent the use of flash cards. I also checked if there was anyway of making my GNM compatible with the DSi but didn't find anything of value. I read that there were ways of getting around it (with certain cards) but I don't know if it'd be applicable with the GNM.. In short, my question is; Is it possible to run a Datel Games 'n' Music on the DSi? If so, how would I go about doing this?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://top-car-images.com/1987-bmw-750il/" target="_blank">1987 bmw 750il</a> <a class="postlink" href="http://top-car-images.com/2003-bmw-m3-csl/" target="_blank">2003 bmw m3 csl</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
