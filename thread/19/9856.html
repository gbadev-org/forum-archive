I ended up turning it off about 3 times with foil + toothpick at 4%. i used the recovery code with an M3 and it worked fine. i settled on a twisty tie with the wire stripped and it worked without any problems.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just bought my DS lite an hour ago, and am looking to flash it after the battery has had an hour or so (I will keep it plugged in while flashing it). However, I can't seem to find a version of FlashMe v7, I believe the site is down or something?
<br/>
<br/>
I already have a copy of FlashMe v7 on my computer, but I'd really like to confirm if the one I have is the lastest version. Is there a checksum for the v7 file that somebody could tell me about? The one I have is 526kb (525 KB (538,185 bytes)).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Success!

Everything works great, and I have the adjustable levels of brightness from the main menu.
<br/>
<br/>
Flashing it was a bit frustrating, I couldn't find the proper spot for the SL1 to short, so in desperation, I took off the insulating electrical tape and it finally worked. Might have been luck, but I thought I should put it out there for anyone having trouble flashing it.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to everyone else!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is V7 flashme from the day it hit the servers.  Since this is different from the one above I bet it does NOT have lite brightness support.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dont understand why everyone is succesful flashing their dsLite. 
<br/>
I have a US DSLite, a passkey 2 dongle, mario kart ds game pak, a strange gba dongle that you put a nds game in that came with passkey and finally an M3 Perfect SD slim cart. 
<br/>
<br/>
I"ve followed the stickes, and all the threads and all I read is success. 
<br/>
<br/>
What am i doing wrong? I keep getting whiste screens after the safety warning on the original firmware. sorry for the multiple threads but I"m about to give up on this. My old DS wasnt such a pain in the ass :P
<br/>
<br/>
