    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was uninstalling flashme using noflashme.nds (my brother sold his DS on ebay, so i figured i should uninstall it). it had gotten through 74%, and then stopped, so i figured i needed to short the SL1. i unscrewed the battery case, and was reaching for my flashing tool, when the DS fell off my knee where i had put it face down, and hit the ground, and the battery popped out.
<br/>
<br/>
now I have a $130 paperweight. as far as i know, the failsafe code was removed in the 74% of noflashme that went through. when i hold down A+b+start+select while turning it on like you're supposed to, nothing happens. is there any way to recover the firmware? or will i have to buy a used DS to replace it?<br/>_________________<br/>Hardware: DS Lite &amp; Phat (both FlashMe v7), M3 Perfect SD, PassKey 1, Max Media Launcher, SanDisk 1GB SD card</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First: always plug in the power cable in case the battery pops out (never seen a flashing guide without that hint...).
<br/>
The recovery code is at the beginning of the firmware, that is the protected part. So if you didn't short SL1 it should be still there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe noflashme re-writes the firmware in reverse. So the question is what was the original firmware of the DS and did you have to short SL1 yet?<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>dualscreenman wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">What about Gaim DS?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. I did have the power cable plugged in. when the DS fell, it pulled out, and when it hit the ground, the battery popped out.
<br/>
<br/>
2. It was a launch DS, so the original firmware was the first one.
<br/>
<br/>
3. I had just gotten to the point where i needed to short SL1. progress stopped at 74%, and it happened as I was reaching for the shorting tool, so i have not overwritten any part of that. does that mean that the recovery code is still in place?<br/>_________________<br/>Hardware: DS Lite &amp; Phat (both FlashMe v7), M3 Perfect SD, PassKey 1, Max Media Launcher, SanDisk 1GB SD card</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try just having the M3SD connected and no DS card.  A+B+Start+Select is hard to hold down, it took me a few tries to boot my M3CF.  It displayed a colour pattern and then said my CF card was not formatted but I pushed Start to continue and was able to launch flashme.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Fri Jul 28, 2006 4:41 am; edited 4 times in total</span></div>
