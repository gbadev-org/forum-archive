    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can you compete with datel?
<br/>
Can you sell a homebrew nopass for less than them?
<br/>
Would yours have an offical size case?
<br/>
<br/>
Datel have done something right for once, and it's just what we need (and what many of us have wanted).
<br/>
<br/>
Unless you can think of a way to make a homebrew NoPass for less than $20, i don't think anyone will do it.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's exactly what I thought when I saw the topic.  CHEAP??  How much cheaper do you need?  $20 for a fully packaged NoPass!
<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that a homebrew device would REQUIRE the use of the click in/out mechanism if it's going to fully fit into the DS slot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was purely asking for an alternative because apparently no one has got thiers from Datel</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, obviously it's cheaper to make thousands of copies of a product than to make 50. I think you'll just have to wait for the datel's, they're pretty new.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hm, on the subject of cheap passthrough methods, I heard of a bug in Metroid Prime Hunters. I don't have it and you can't do it in the demo, but it sounds true enough. Apparently the name you enter is misused in a sprintf() call - for example, put in %d and it prints random numbers. (You can't do it online; they patch it when you connect, but I'm pretty sure the patch isn't permanent. After all, how could it be?)
<br/>
The trick here is it's pulling these random numbers off the stack. Also, you can put in something like %0256d to print a 256-digit number, potentially overflowing a buffer. See where I'm going with this? Your name can be up to 8 characters AFAIK.
<br/>
I doubt this would end up being of any use; the ARM7 has control of the GBA cart on official binaries, and if you could overwrite a return address on the stack or a function pointer, you'd be writing ASCII characters, and I don't think anything from 20xxxxxx to 7Exxxxxx is even valid. However, you might be able to put in other characters by editing your save file using someone else's DS or by building a device to access the save RAM (which I hear is pretty easy). This might even allow you to do it with the demo.
<br/>
Now if we even could get it to jump anywhere we wanted with this, what good does that do if we can't jump to the GBA cart? Well, how about jumping to the place in RAM in which incoming wifi packets are stored? A long shot, but possibly worth looking into.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW the only reason you can't do this in the demo is you can't use the % character.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It might have been helpfull if they would have released the game a year ago, and people were still trying to get homebrew on the NDS.. Seems kinda late now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I live in the USA, I paid $10 extra for express shipping. (could have only paid $5 shipping)  So even at $30 it's still cheaper than Metroid Prime and doesn't require any "hacking" or fudge factor (end user screwing stuff up) to take place.. you know it works..  So, what have others paid for shipping?  Meaning, what is the maximum price?  $20 or the MML, and $50 or shipping?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
