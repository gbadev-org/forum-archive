    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there,
<br/>
<br/>
I just confirmed that my wireless card can, indeed, use WiFiMe. (Rock!!) And I also have a GBA Flash card.. The 1Gigabit XG2 Turbo. What I'm trying to accomplish is hack my DS firmware to make it homebrew enabled.
<br/>
<br/>
I realize that I need to put Flashme.nds (or whatever it's called) on the raw Flash card, but I have no idea how to do that. The reason why? Well, with the software I'm using, I can format the card so there's literally nothing on there, which is good. But the second I try to put a rom or something on there, it rebuilds the menu, which is no good.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know how to get the XG2 Turbo card to JUST have the flashme.nds file on there, in order to hack the firmware? Do I need new software? Am I missing something completely? Hopefully someone out there has done this before, because I'm slightly confused.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your help,
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. You must disable the loader. Somehow.
<br/>
2. Put FlashME.nds and <a class="postlink" href="http://darkfader.net/ds/files/ndsmall.bin" target="_blank">ndsmall.bin</a> in the same folder (eg. C:\DS\)
<br/>
3. Use this command: copy /b ndsmall.bin + flashme.nds FlashME.ds.gba
<br/>
4. Burn the flashme.ds.gba file on a FlashCart and DISABLE the loader.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I read some stuff about how some sort of "special" DS GBA Card was just an XG2 with a different logo, so could I use that software for it? If so, where do I get it?
