    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A couple years ago I ordered a EFA linker for my DS to play GBA games, after 2 months it was longer being recognized on my computer.  After a month of posting around forum, there was no solution. Games that are on there are still on there I just can't add or remove anything.

I just recently purchased a M3 Simply and was wondering if there was a way to move files onto the card or maybe even use it for something else.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
