    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I'm getting my DS Lite in the mail soon, and I'm planning on flashing it. I am, however, fairly afraid after having read about all of the risks involved due to the Lite's updated hardware layout (mainly the piece of metal that - if touched - reboots the Lite).
<br/>
<br/>
So I was thinking. How about I just cut off 5mm of a paperclip, and with a very small piece of tape stick it onto the SL1 thingy (with some tweezers), all while the DS is turned off. Then once I turn it on, I run the flashprogram and it'll be instantly able to flash it 1% through 100%, because the connection is made instantly and - more importantly - constantly. I believe this is somewhat similar to the soldering solution I found somewhere around here. I'm not planning on doing that though, not in the least bit because I'm really not that hand steady with that thing. (I once fully grabbed onto the hot part of the solder iron, not good).
<br/>
<br/>
The above seems simple, and must therefore be too simple. I'd still like to know though, what's keeping the method described here from working? I would really prefer using a method in which I don't have to make the connection sticking stuff through that hole. I'm fairly clumsy. *Cough*
<br/>
<br/>
Also, two questions that might have been posed often, but to which I couldn't find a clear answer.
<br/>
* Suppose I start flashing it, and for some reason I really can't get the connection working. (In the paperclip-tape method the little bit of tape would still cover up most of the Sl1, I imagine, so if it doesn't take it I must be able to cancel the process entirely so I can take it off again.) Is this possible, if it never left 0%? Once you left 1% once, you've got to take it all the way, right?
<br/>
* Lastly, I'm not really familiar with "I can't recognize the firmware" failure. Is that a failure you get while running flashme, or ?fter running flashme and booting up the DS? Either way, will I just have to wait for flashme v8 to get it working then, or is there a work-around?
<br/>
<br/>
If the above seems stupid and ignorant, then that's because it ?s. I still hope you can help me with my questions though.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't find the pictures, but I ran across a better explanation of why DSLites are shutting down while flashing. Very close to SL1, on the left (the opposite side from what everyone thought was shorting) there's a tiny bit of metal hanging over SL1. (It's probably part of the GBA slot assembly.) <span style="font-style: italic">That</span> is very likely what's causing people's Lites to shut off. Don't touch it and you're golden.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
