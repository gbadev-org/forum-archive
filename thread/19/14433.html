Seems interesting for people with old SD devices. Imagine libfat-ing directly from/to your PC.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That looks amazing, although their idea of using it for photo's is a bit lame.  Surely it would be much better to use it for wireless mp3/video streaming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could just use dswifi and implement a CIFS, FTP, or HTTP client on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Or are you talking about using this to implement Wi-Fi on a SLOT-2 SD adapter plugged into a GBA, which doesn't have Wi-Fi?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sounds like it sends files over wifi that are written to the card. i don't see anything saying that you'd be able to read over wifi. given the application, a digital camera, i doubt it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh yeah, looks like it's pretty much one way traffic only.  Still, just think how tiny you could make a surveillance cam with a CCD and one of those.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, th eonly use I can see for this aside from in a camera (which I agree seems silly and pointless) might be file synchronization between your computer and some sort of handheld device.  One-way synchronization, that is.
