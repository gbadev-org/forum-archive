    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I am relatively new to the DS scene and I havn't got a DS yet, I was waiting for the Mario Kart bundle but now I hear that it has the new firmware so Im sorta confused as of what to do.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a Xgflash1 256mb card and I am wondering how to run DS demos on this, my main question is what do I need to start playing with the old DS firmware and what do I need to play with the new firmware DS?
<br/>
<br/>
I have downloaded WRG loadme and NDS patch to change the DS roms into .gba files, but thats as far as my DS hack intelligence goes.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can help me that would be great, and if anyone lives in Australia in the Sydney area that has more knowledge on this stuff than I do can they please reply, as if I could i'd rather take it to someone professional than brick the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Pitoui</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have no fear - If you use the power supply cable with battery in when Flashing your DS, there is a 99,99&amp; chance you'll make it.

<br/>
First, you'll need PassME2 and it's compatible game (MK:DS unfortunately, isn't) to flash your firmware (borrow it from someone).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks Mahe, I will buy the bundle then, is it easy to flash? (plz say yes) haha. 
<br/>
<br/>
Iv'e already got Ridgeracer DS AUS and its the same serial as the US one but on <a href="http://www.darkfader.net/ds/games/" target="_blank">www.darkfader.net/ds/games/</a>  it shows nothing in the box of PassMe CPLD or PassMe SRAM is this a problem do I need to buy or borrow a game like Mario DS? I really don't know what they mean.

FlashMEing is fairly easy, actually a piece of cake if you follow the rules CAREFULLY.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No problem, I'll buy Mario DS and the PassMe 2, and I'll Flash the DS.
<br/>
Do you have a link that shows the correct way of flashing it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
