<br/>
<br/>
I think I'm confused about the term "multiboot"; I think it means "multi-cart", but it doesn't.  What does it mean?
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to put multiple NDS files on a GBA cartridge? (Multi-CART)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"Multiboot" in GBA/DS homebrew jargon means a program that loads itself entirely into RAM. This was originally named after the GBA BIOS call that copied a program over the serial cable to up to 3 other GBA units. (The feature's official consumer name was "Single-Pak Multiplayer" on the GBA or "DS Download Play" on the Nintendo DS.) Because the files load entirely into main RAM, they have to be smaller than RAM (256 KB on GBA or 4 MB on Nintendo DS). 
<br/>
<br/>
Multiboot files usually have the extension .mb on GBA or .nds on Nintendo DS. If you see a .nds program that's bigger than 4 MB then it's either a pirated cart image (.nds with a Nitro-FAT file system appended, called .srl in some circles) or a SuperCard .nds file (what most people call ds.gba).
<br/>
<br/>
Confusing the origin of the name is multi-loaders. If you have multiple <span style="font-weight: bold">.mb</span> (<span style="font-style: italic">not</span> .gba) files, you can use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#mbmenu" target="_blank">my multiboot menu</a> to turn them all into one GBA ROM (extension .gba). Likewise, if you have multiple <span style="font-weight: bold">.nds</span> files (<span style="font-style: italic">not</span> ds.gba) then you can use Darkain's multiboot menu to turn them all into one Nintendo DS ROM (extension ds.gba). But there is currently no loader that supports multiple ds.gba ROMs or both GBA and Nintendo DS code on one flash cart.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">with the m3 you just put roms in a directory on the cf card like you would on your hard disk.  then simply select the rom you want to boot be it either nds or ds.gba</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
