    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My EZflash linker recently died (burned out?) anyway it stoped working, there are no fuses or anything to replace, and windows doesn't detect when it plugged in. anyway, i dont have it anymore, i trew it out. I still have the cart though (ezflash 128). I was wondering is there a way to flash it from the DS? perhaps loading a rom to DS ram then flashing it to the cart (after swapping it over). I was hoping to at least have flashme on it, so when (if) i get a dslite, i can flash it without haveing to get a nopass (I have passkey 1 and 2)
