Even if you did access the card, you wouldn't see friendly image formats for maps like you might be expecting, its gonna take some hardcore programming and hacking to write a level editor, and even then you could only run them from a modified ROM, which would require a backup, which is off topic to this site.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
