You don't need passme2_mb.gba, passme2buttonwait.gba or passme2flashme.gba.  They are for passme2 and not needed for passkey2.
<br/>
<br/>
Remove the passkey2.  Put sram.dat and K2-RAM0?.gba on your SD card.  Boot in GBA mode, run K2-RAM0?.gba.  Select your game from the list (this game will be needed to boot into NDS mode).
<br/>
<br/>
Plug that NDS game into the passkey2, put the switch to passkey2, plug it into the DS and if it's the correct game, you should now be able to boot in DS mode to run flashme or any .nds files.
<br/>
<br/>
If your exact game isn't in the list, you will need a version of K2-RAM0?.gba and K2-HW0?.GBA that support booting from your game.  Those game codes look strange, I don't see any of them on the list.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Tue Sep 05, 2006 8:30 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Actually, they have nothing to do with PassMe1/2.. They are SRAM writers and will work with any Passthrough that requires SRAM data to be in slot-2.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have a GBA Flash Cart, passme2flashme.gba just makes it easier to install FlashMe as you don't need multiple files on your Flash Cart, it contains both the SRAM writer and FlashMe in one file, and will boot in both GBA and NDS mode.
<br/>
<br/>
So, basically the 3 files listed replace the specific SRAM.dat and .gba file, as they both have the same purpose.  Just the ones listed above have data for most (if not all) games supporting the PassMe2 boot method and the SRAM.dat and .gba are for a specific game only.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, see if <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=61" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> helps.  Just make sure to program the PassKe2 for the game you plan to insert into it, and then follow the tutorial as if it was a pre-programmed PassMe2.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You have the old Passkey v2 software, the newest is V4.
<br/>
I never needed to use sram.dat. I just ran K2-HW04.gba (to upgrade the internal list of supported ROMs, you'll need the programmer), then K2-RAM04.gba to pick my game. Simple as that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
