    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes and no.  SL1 is only needed to be shorted for the first xx bits of firmware.  The rest can be flashed without SL1 being shorted.  It just happens that the firmware patch that Loopy made needed to touch the first xx bits of the firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
So, N could release a game that updates the firmware.  I'd hope they would give you the choice to update, and not just do it.
<br/>
<br/>
Loopy.  What would the outcome be if N decided to update our firmware without asking.  I'm guessing your patch would be calling a part of the firmware that no longer exists?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if nintendo updates our firmware without asking, they cant touch the protected parts unless SL1 is shorted (which it wont be if they dont ask). Therefore, even if it corrupts the firmware or breaks it, the recovery code will still be there in the protected region so you can recover it, then uninstall the flashme patch, then re run the nintendo upgrade if you want.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yeah, because they might likely do some tweaking, to make sure whatever they change, is one, entirely outside of the non-writable area, and two, causes the crc16 inside of the non-writable area to match.  (This can be brute forced, as if it does not match, just tweak 2-3 bytes, close together, till it does.)
<br/>
<br/>
However, this is not likely to happen.  They reserved firmware updates for new ds systems,  and one for when one possibly gets their ds system repaired, (and they do repair it.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
