    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">just a quick question about flashme and these new units, I recall reading there were problems with the new "iQue" DS and the current version of flashme, I was just curious if it will work on these other DS's as well because I want to get a Black one and sell my pre-flashed silver.
<br/>
<br/>
any help is appreciated
<br/>
thanks

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The blue one was made before the new firmware started coming out. Only the red one is known to contain the new firmware. If you can find a used blue one, you should be able to flash that.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why would a used blue one be needed, is there a chance the newer ones are not compatible with the current methods of running homebrew software?
<br/>
I'm only posting this in here because I'm going to buy a DS tomorrow and they only have the blue ones in stock.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe the iQue DS is China only, and the RED DS is Japan only.  There are no U.S. (or any other contry that I have heard yet) that have the upgraded firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
