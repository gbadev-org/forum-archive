    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
I have a new firmware DS and the passkey that came with my M3 gives me two white screens when I have Mario Kart DS inserted.
<br/>
<br/>
I decided to build a JTAG cable and re-program the passkey to get around this problem. I re-programmed the passkey using the iMPACT software as per Jakelshark's guide:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7328" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7328</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I programmed the passkey with darkfader's JED code for Mario Kart DS (U), (AMCE-0) successfully.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://darkfader.net/ds/games/" target="_blank">http://darkfader.net/ds/games/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I wrote the SRAM to the M3 before using the passkey and booted the system with the passkey attached and my original copy of Mario Kart DS. However, my attempts have been unsuccessful and I am still getting two white screens after the health warnings at boot up.
<br/>
<br/>
For your reference I have an Australian copy of Mario Kart DS and I am not sure if darkfader's US code is different to my Australian cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to know if Australian carts are the same as the US versions or should I have used code for the European version?
<br/>
<br/>
I may have to re-program the Passkey with settings for another game like Mario 64 but I'd like to know if I should be using (U) or (E) versions?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sometimes?  Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but it overwrote the SRAM EVERY time I launched a homebrew app.. I'm guessing when it's displaying "Clearing this and that"..  So if you run Pepsiman's SRAM writer each time, it should be fine.. OR, install FlashMe, and toss the PassMe2 out the window.. ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If I can get the PassMe2 to work that's the first thing I'll be doing (installing FlashMe not tossing it out the window).
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried Pepsiman's SRAM writer but unfortunately it doesn't have AMCE on it. I've been using darkfader's AMCE-0.gba SRAM writer and that appears to work but I can't tell if it's actually staying in the SRAM at bootup.

<br/>
<br/>
Everytime I launch an application on the M3 in GBA mode, for example:
<br/>
<br/>
AMCE-0.gba
<br/>
passme2mb.gba
<br/>
passme2flashme.gba
<br/>
<br/>
I get the following message the <span style="font-weight: bold">next</span> time I boot the M3 in GBA mode:
<br/>
<br/>
eg.
<br/>
<br/>
AMCE-0.gba
<br/>
<br/>
"Warning! GBA GAME SAVE in card! But CANNOT find AUTOSAVE backup file! Backup fail! Press A to continue."
<br/>
<br/>
I have the "gamesave" directory on my CF card which contains the file "bank.dat" but I always get this message at (GBA) boot up.

I tried with Mario Kart DS, Wario Ware Touched and Mario 64 DS. I noticed that when I inserted the correct cart into the DS I would get two white screens. Insert the wrong cart and it will boot up normally but not boot into NDS mode - completely bypassing the Passkey.
<br/>
<br/>
I am going to wait for the Passkey2.
<br/>
<br/>
I believe this is a problem with my Passkey as my JTAG cable works, I have tried two different CF cards and even tried my old FlashAdvance cartridge to load the SRAM. I do not think this is a problem with my SRAM as I have tried loading it on 3 different carts.
<br/>
<br/>
I emailed M3 and was told that Passkey2 "might" be available on Dec 12th. I have tried re-programming with iMPACT and playxsvf501b.exe but I always get the two white screens no matter which method I use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I had to return Mario 64 DS and Wario Ware Touched! so I have reprogrammed the Passkey for Mario Kart DS AMCE (again) as it is the only original cartridge I own at the moment.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately AMCE is not on Pepsiman's GBA file so I will have to borrow these games again this weekend to try out your method.

Thanks for your suggestion, I'm definitely going to give this one more shot. I would hate to think I built a JTAG cable for nothing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Next, head over to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.darkfader.net/ds/games/" target="_blank">DarkFaders Game site</a> and download the SAV file for the game you are using, and your PassMe2 was programmed for. Copy that file onto the CF card, and rename it sram.dat.

Now, boot up the DS in GBA Mode again, and it will copy the sram.dat file into the SRAM on the M3. You only need to do this once..
