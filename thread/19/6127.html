    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering why we can't use a passme like idea to boot from memory.
<br/>
<br/>
take this new wifime loader and append the wanted ds file and instead of telling the ds to execute code from the gba slot couldn't you tell it to execute from the end of the loader file?
<br/>
<br/>
I know there's some sort of RSA signature check but doesn't your current wifime already get around that?  Or is the trick to execute from the GBA slot just like a processor switch and not a memory jump?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure you guys have already thought of this, but I was just wondering.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Did you check with the latest version?  You've obviously lost your brain, because it <span style="font-style: italic">tells</span> you that you need to specify a file in the latest versions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I'm not talking wifi the program. 
<br/>
<br/>
I was refering to wifime, that zip file you use to tell the ds to boot off your gba card.  
<br/>
<br/>
I'm talking about a way to load homebrew wifi files without flashing your ds.  But it was just an idea I had last night.  
<br/>
If we can tell the ds (like the *mes do) to execute the code from the gba slot why can't we tell it to load from a different part of memory where our game is stored from the wifi download?  That's basically what I was asking.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is a way of booting nds files without a signature. You need to flash your ds Firmware to remove the signature check to boot nds files that don't have a signature. 
<br/>
The firmware and dokumentation how to install it is available at this site:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since everyone seems to be ignoring his question...
<br/>
<br/>
He appears to be asking if there's a way to send program data appended to an application with a proper RSA signiture, then changing the entry point to access this data, so that the signiture is still valid, yet the custom data still gets executed.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I know nothing about the RSA signiture, but I'm pretty sure if you add data to the end of a program, it's going to be checked as part of the signiture check. I guess you might be able to fit a tiny bit of code in the game icon or even the Nintendo logo, but nothing enough to be useful.
<br/>
<br/>
So you're left with tepples' Mario 64 idea. You'd be better off flashing your firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
