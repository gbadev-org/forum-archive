    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been having a great time using flashme and the community's been doing an amazing job. However I've recently had a problem involving FlashMe.
<br/>
<br/>
When playing the commercial cartridge of Sonic Rush using a grey NDS and FlashMe v 5, the game would freeze up on white screens when going to the in-game demo. I tried this several times (no GBA cart in. Other NDS carts) and found that the problem was always just going to the gameplay demonstration. I uninstalled FlashMe and it worked fine.
<br/>
I doubt anyone cares enough about the gameplay demos to avoid flashme, so I re-installed it of course. 
<br/>
<br/>
But the problem remains, part of a commercial game does not work on a DS with FlashMe v5 installed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Umm... I already addressed that.
<br/>
<br/>
I did not try the cart on other DSs. The only people I know near me with DSs are either annoying kids or people afraid of newfangled FlashMe technology. However it's a brand new DS cartridge. My DS is in good condition. Everything I have ever done with it has worked fine with the exception of Sonic Rush's gameplay demo using FlashMe v5.
<br/>
<br/>
For the two of you posting above me,
<br/>
No flash me = works.
<br/>
flashme v5 = does not work.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to make the isue as clear as possible. If I'm not being straight-forward enough please ask for more explanation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You might experiance minor flaws, but nothing that you should worry about.  Just like with MK, FlashMe was fixed before the game hit most markets.  Just remember to check for updates.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

He knows that. He's a genius.  He was asking if any homebrewn software is known to be broken, besides the one mentioned in this thread (the callfinder).
<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I have the US version of Sonic Rush, and no problem trying to send the in-game demo. So I guess I can't help isolate the problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can now back up the fact that FlashMe v5 does something that messes up DS Multiboot mode.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have access to another DS, so I've never tried Mario Kart DS multiplayer until today. While at my relatives for the holidays, I had Mario Kart with me and attempted several times to send the Single cart multiplay executable to my cousin. No matter what we tried, the download would always start on the remote DS, but it would never finish. It would either keep saying it was downloading until I stopped it on my DS, or it would display an error on the DS downloading it. We restarted both DS's several times and tried several things, then after about 20 minutes I remembered this thread and figured FlashMe must be causing it.
<br/>
<br/>
After borrowing another copy of Mario Kart to do cart to cart play, that worked fine. It has also always worked fine online. So something fishy is obviously going on related to FlashMe.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this information is helpful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You've <span style="text-decoration: underline">sent</span> the download to them? I dont have a problem receiving downloads or playing cart to cart, but not single cart from my FlashMe'd v5 DS to a non-flashed DS.
<br/>
<br/>
It's not "some other issue," I had plenty of time to cover all sanely possible situations. Also, if it helps any, I was sending from a DS purchased on launch day to a newer one, (blue) which I will assume had the newer firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: For the record, I'm using the stealth version of FlashMe that leaves the Nintendo DS intro intact, not the introless version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Indeed I did. When I was using the rom on my supercard (I'm not anymore, I have the actual game), I was unable to send the download. However, I'm using the real thing now, and I've sent to non-flashed DS units with no issues.

Right.
<br/>
<br/>
The original poster has the problem that an unflashed DS won't accept the download from a flashed DS with the actual game, not a ROM. I was posing the point that I was able to get a non-flashed DS to accept a download from a flashed DS <span style="font-style: italic">with</span> the ROM, so why it wouldn't work with the actual game is a mystery.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
