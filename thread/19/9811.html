    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In development is a DS-Lite sized flashcart that uses T-Flash memory sticks (smaller than a dime)
<br/>
<br/>
This does not extend out of the DS Lite at all
<br/>
<br/>
This flashcart is called "Neo 2 Lite" created by the makers at Neoflash. (www.neoflash.com) Check out the forums.

I'm thinking about getting one for my DS Lite.
<br/>
Its supposed to come out in a month or so for <span style="text-decoration: underline">around</span> 35 bucks

What do you think about it?<br/>_________________<br/>popcorn</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

"smaller than a dime"
<br/>
Means they are easier to lose (or swallow) and I would imagine their durability suffers as a result.

CF cards are IMO the best media card out there.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

Because the GBAMP is easy to dislodge when I jog with my DS and GBAMP v2 CF in my pocket. I would imagine that the SuperCard suffers a similar problem.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is also the EZ4 lite in development using micro SD cards. The advantage: It's made by a much better company. There will probably be similar products from M3 and SuperCard in the near future, too. So why go with a Neo product when most of their present and past products are pretty crappy?
<br/>
<br/>
About small media cards: Most mini and micro SD cards come with an SD sized adapter which makes them harder to loose and easy to use in existing card readers and devices. They are also not much more expensive than the regular sized SD cards so they are a really good alternative.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, this happens to me too. Also, CF cards use a lot of small pins that could easily be bent. SD cards are what I'd prefer to use. MiniSD and MicroSD, eh, I guess if SD was too big for something, but I have to agree that when I need a pair of tweezers and a magnifier to remove my memory card, that's going a bit far.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think the EZ team is also working on an adapter that will do just that. No idea if it will work with other lite cards but there really isn't a reason why it shouldn't. Would probably be useless for the rumble pack, though...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
