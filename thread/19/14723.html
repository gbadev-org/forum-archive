    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have read that the R4DS MicroSD slot is spring loaded. I just received my R4DS for x-mas and mine is not spring loaded. I have the newer blackcase version.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone confirm that this is how it should be? I'm curious if mine is faulty.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the input!

<br/>
While we are on the subject of R4's and M3's does anyone know what the green R on the menu does? It turns red if I press it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the red/green 'R' turns off/on (respectively) the reset feature that lets you do a software reset using a keycombo.
<br/>
I don't remember what this combo is so you'll have to look it up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
