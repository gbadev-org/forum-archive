    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, my Games n' Music's microSD card slot is slower than the stock default card that came with it, but the R4 is faster.  Either way, I bought a cheap normal old CF for my GBAMP and it runs fast enough for video streaming, and I use normal regular SD's in my PDA and they all run well enough for music, video, etc.

<br/>
I'd say that normal would be good enough.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Yes.

I bought the cheapest 1 GB microSD card that I could find at an office supply store, and it was a SanDisk card on sale. MoonShell on my R4 plays videos from this card without glitching.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Agreed. Since the DS only has 4MB RAM, and a couple of rather-slow processors, files aren't going to need to be too big for any program...<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
