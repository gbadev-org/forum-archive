    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
I just ordered a Superpass2 to flash my brand new DS Lite on 11 June. However I hadn't realised that I will need to program it in order to use it with one of the original games that I have.
<br/>
<br/>
this is a problem because I don't have a PC (hence Windows) but a Mac. So I was wondering if there's any way that I can flash this thing in a Mac (other than using Virtual PC).
<br/>
<br/>
BUT ALSO... DO I NEED A SERIAL PORT!?! Neither my mac, nor any of my friends' computers (which are modern PCs) have a serial (why would you need a serial when everything is USB nowadays)?. So, here's the question: is there any way to program the Superpass2 without a serial cable? Is there anyway to just use a USB cable?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because USB is patented and RS232 isn't, and it's cheaper not to have to license the patents.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
