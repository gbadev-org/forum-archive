    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Depends what you want really. Despite the name the R4i is merely a DS card that works on the DSi, it doesn't and probably won't allow you to run code in DSi mode.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The R4i SDHC is a nighmare... A friend of mine bought one and I still haven't found an appropriate kernel for it: keeps popping "couldn't find menu.sys" message on top screen. If I can't find a working kernel version, then I'll suggest my friend to return that crappy unit.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm disappointed by the R4i card: I had no problem at all with the R4 revolution/DS Lite pair.
<br/>
<br/>
Anybody can tell me where to get the $%? right Moonshell version for it? My patience is running out.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It depends on which R4i you got as there's a fair few companies making them - just like the original R4...
<br/>
<br/>
If you go to the r4ds forums there's a post there about this exact issue, and it includes a link to every known R4 launcher code.
<br/>
<br/>
My R4i-sdhc is good, but for the love of everything that is good in the world I will never be using it since they don't like anyone replacing the launcher with a custom one, and everything in the launcher is aimed at piracy - No wonder Nintendo are getting them banned...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I navigated to <a href="http://www.r4rts.com" target="_blank">www.r4rts.com</a> website and found the latest kernel, which has been updated lately (Feb. 5th, if I remember well). My friend and I are relieved and happy again :).
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, too bad these neat devices are used for running warez, and too bad that Nintendo doesn't support individual, or small-scale software development for the NDS. Some well-know mobile device manufacturers do it better ;-).
<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, hail to the homebrewers!
