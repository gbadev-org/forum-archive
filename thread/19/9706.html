    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know that Passcard 2 is quite different from MML in these ways
<br/>
<br/>
1. PC2 still needs SRAM so it consumes more battery
<br/>
2. PC2 is more expensive
<br/>
3. MML has sleep issues (is this true?)
<br/>
<br/>
So what will Passcard 3 be like? Will it be exactly like MML now (meaning it doesn't consume as much battery as before) without the sleep problems?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.. Don't know if MML has sleep issues.. but, it doesn't matter, as I'd suggest you only use it once (like all the other DS card based devices) to install FlashMe.. then you don't have to worry about SRAM or any extra power consumtion.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Needing GBA SRAM consumes more power because the adapters with GBA SRAM also happen to have 32 MB of battery-eating main RAM to hold a GBA game, and unless power to this main RAM can be cut entirely after the cart has booted into homebrew...<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

When running commercial roms from Supercard or M3, the DS does not go into sleep mode properly (when you close the DS while playing) without a DS game in slot 1. The same thing has been reported to happen with the MML as happens when there is no game in slot 1. (That is, the DS kicks in and out of sleep mode very quickly.)

That's what I was referring to with the empty slot 1. I tend to forget that some people still like to use hardware passthrough devices.

So, in other words.. it has NOTHING to do with SRAM.  But, devices that contain SRAM consume more power.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
