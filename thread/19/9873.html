    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't have any links or what have you handy, but I read over on scdev.org that the easiest way to recover is with a 2nd ds lite: open em both up, take the good bios (it's socketed in the lite) and put it into the bad, boot up flashme with your pass device, take out the good bios and put in the bad, start the flashme sequence.
<br/>
<br/>
Depending on if you've burnt your fuses you may need to short those.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll obvioulsy want to go root around on the scdev.org forums, register because some of the forums are not visible to unregistered people.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the answer. Yes probably a variant with the second DSL the most preferable. At me have arisen still pair questions:
<br/>
1. DSL which it was not stitched - "Japan". If the second will be  
<br/>
"American" they will understand each other?
<br/>
2. When I include DSL - burns the green indicator. It means, what safety locks by way of?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Swapping the Flash chips would be the easiest.

<br/>
2) Not sure what you mean exactly by the green light... have your tried the flashme failsafe key combo yet?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
