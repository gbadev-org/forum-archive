    <h4>#146114 - beamer30 - Thu Nov 29, 2007 1:36 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok i have a <span style="font-weight: bold">ds lite</span> i dont remeber the firmware except the screen turns majenta on the firmware test.
<br/>
<br/>
I decided to go with:
<br/>
<br/>
Changed my mind see below:
<br/>
<br/>
I want to mostly make games for the dslite, but i want the option of making gba games also... So will this setup work for what i want to do?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
Ok so after doing someresearch i relized i what items i had chosen was totaly wrong, so instead i think i might go with this:
<br/>
<br/>
R4
<br/>
&amp;
<br/>
supercard micro sd from sky2k since their cheapand trusted.
<br/>
<br/>
BUT(yes the all famous but)
<br/>
<br/>
I saw the the supercard rumble is like 20$ cheaper than the regular, is because u cant make gba hombrew run from it or what?
<br/>
<br/>
Also im very much more intersted in making ds games, so do i even need a slot-2 cartridge?
<br/>
<br/>
Almost finished, Now should i get the slot-2 cartridge anyway so i can use it for extra storage &amp; for devolping games, plus if i want to run gba homebrew i need it so i might as well buy them both.
<br/>
<br/>
Last thing(Hooray) even with the r4 Nopass i should still install flashme, that way if i accidentally brick my ds i can fix it right?
<br/>
<br/>
i know some of these qestion probably sound noobish , but im new and just trying to get startedso any advice on which way to go would be GREAT.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
that's right.  it'd require RAM to be able to load the GBA program into to emulate the slot-2.  that's were they save cash.

<br/>
that, you have to ask yourself.  if you're getting an R4, you can get the EZ FLASH 3-in-1 for $20 which has 32M of RAM and 16M of NOR flash.  You can then store games on your SD card and use a gbaldr or rudolph's 3-in-1 loader which will transfer games to the RAM(volatile, doesn't support 1M FLASH saves) or the NOR Flash(nonvolatile, will allow u to start from "GBA SLOT" in firmware).
<br/>
<br/>
Great thing about the 3-in-1 is ... it's 3 in 1!  You can use it for Linux or Opera as a RAM pack.  You can even use the rumble feature, although I've not, but it's an added bonus...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

While I agree that the EZ3in1 compliments the R4 nicely, I'll have to correct you in that it has 16MB of RAM, not 32MB.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As I see it, the NOR is for running GBA homebrew, and the RAM is only for running DS homebrew in SLOT-1 that can use extra RAM, such as Quake. It just saves you from having to buy two separate expansion cards.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The idea was to have the GBA games use NOR, and the Opera browser use the RAM, so that the EZ5 could run pirated copies of it. However, the RAM can also be used for homebrew.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is this the case? I was under the impression that it was mapped at 0x08400000 and not at 0x08000000, at least when I use Lick's RAM API. Does it need some extra unlocking commands to map it down to 0x08000000 so that I can just copy in a .gba and run it?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
From my experience with a Supercard miniSD, very compatible.  For DS homebrew at least, you've got DLDI file filesystem access, and you've got the RAM there for older homebrew programs that need to run from GBA romspace.  GBA homebrew is a bit sketchier, and there are a couple programs (not very many) that require patching with the Supercard patcher to function, but overall it works well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
