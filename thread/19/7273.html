    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I have played the final version of Mario Kart DS a few days ago.
<br/>
<br/>
With the DS that have the MK I was serving a multiplayer game and with my DS (with FlashMe) I download the multiplayer.
<br/>
<br/>
After a few races I shut off my DS and then my DS doesn't turn on again. I have to made a FlashMe Recovery (A+B+Select+Start) to fix mi DS.
<br/>
<br/>
The other day, one friend tries again and his DS was broken too.
<br/>
<br/>
Warning if you have FlashMe installed ;)<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my english &gt;&lt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can confirm what YaW says. He could try Mario Kart DS Final Version in the Nintendo Friends Showroom at Madrid. A press room for spanish media, they have demos, betas and final versions before they are released so journalists can go and try the games or take some screenshots for reviews.
<br/>
<br/>
YaW currently runs DSMagazine, while I'm the webmaster of NDSSpain, so you can trust in us.
<br/>
<br/>
Back to the topic, yes, Mario Kart DS seems to be writing some data to the original DS Firmware, so if you have FlashMe, it gets corrupted and therefore your handheld won't boot anymore.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">FlashMe is bigger than the normal firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
It's been determined that part of FlashMe is stored in an area that goes unused by the normal firmware but which in fact was reserved for storing Wi-Fi configuration information. Therefore someone's going to need to cut out the Pictochat graphics or something.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

For that, someone will need to do the following:

If i unflash my DS can anyone of the flashme team (olimar or anyone) guarantee me that my DS will be "Clean"... its just that if i lost the recovery function of the flashme and i lost my DS i wont get it back.

<br/>
So if i play with mario kart ds with a unflashed ds... later i can try to use wifime or passme to see if the firm have been upgraded or it just stored something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Friendlist is "made" when playing offline using NiFi local wireless play automatically. Nintendo said so.

So every time you play agains anothe mario karter localy over wireless play, you swap id's and get placed in eachother friendlist, so WHEN you go online you can find eachother.

True indeed, but you don't need a friends list if you don't have the game your self. And I believe I've read somewhere, a couple weeks ago, that the friends list is saved on a server... But don't if it's true. But I realy don't think the friends list will be saved on the firmware. That way if you ruin your DS, you would lose all your friends. Losing network settings isn't that bad, so they can be firmware-stored!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrsnowflake.be" target="_blank">http://www.mrsnowflake.be</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe it saves them only temporary and then syncronises them to an online friends list on the next connect.

Your a fruit loop.
<br/>
The DS won't check for hacked firmware, because it's pointless. Flashmed DS's account for less than 1% of them out there. It's probably like 0.001% of DS's. It's extra code that they won't bother with. Anyway if they did an MD5 check or something they'd be screwed when we updated. MK can't brick your DS because it doesn't write to that bit of firmware. It writes to an unused (blank) part of firmware, at least on a stock DS. Flashme code will need shuffling/trimming/mutilating to fit around this. To the outside world your DS appears normal. Nintendo like to make things easy and so will most likley just need you to set up the connection once. It will then make that information avaliable to all other games that want it. All they have to do is read the firmware where it expects it to be stored. SRAM will be full of records, ghosts, and progress. As well as possibly "local" friends to be transfered to the Ninty server.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It seems that Nintendo would save WiFi configuration settings to the firmware. But they probably wouldn't add the actual implimentation, because each game can impliment WiFi how they want, and each game would have to write this to the firmware anyway because they could never be sure if someone has bought a WiFi enabled game before. Nintendo has stressed that connecting to the WiFi service will be as easy as possible, and forcing users to input things like WEP encryption settings each time would go against this claim. So, the first game that needs WiFi settings sees you have none, you set it up, it saves it to the firmware, and the second time you put a game in needing WiFi settings, it'll already have your configuration.
<br/>
<br/>
And Nintendo knows what's supposed to be in the firmware, so they know what to write and where. There is little chance that a DS would be bricked from this. Unless, of course, someone changed their firmware with a non-official Nintendo firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">AFAIK Mario Kart DS writes the data to the DS internal firmware space which is unused. Because there can't be anything damaged there is no risk of bricking your DS; is it? (of course only if it's not flashed)
<br/>
The next online game you play uses this data. The DS firmware is not updated - why should it? If you want to configure this settings you can do it in the game because the DS can't be online without a wifi supporting game so it wouldn't make much sense to be able to configure it in DS firmware.

I highly doubt that they patch the firmware to support wifi. I think that only the connection information is stored in to the firmware while the actual code that performs wifi functionality is problably part of the Nintendo SDK and comes with each game that uses wifi.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sadly, I too have bricked my FlashMe'ed DS by playing Mario Kart. In my case, I played a single game via the download feature. When my friend turned off his DS that had the game in it, my DS reported a network error and told me to power off. Now whenever I try to power on, I get a green light, but both screens stay black.
<br/>
<br/>
I have the EZ-FlashII (PowerStar) USB writer and a 256Mbit GBA flash cart, which is what I used to install FlashMe (3?) in the first place ... but it has been a while, so I had to hunt down the software/drivers to get it going again. I installed EZ-Client 3.20, which was the latest I could find, then downloaded the new flashme.nds and the recommended loader.bin file (which I put in the sysbin folder of EZ-Client). Unfortunately, I can't seem to boot the flashme.nds file.
<br/>
<br/>
If I don't install an NDS loader, then pressing START+SELECT+A+B and Power just gives me a green light and nothing on the screens (same thing that happens when I boot without pressing anything). If I do install the NDS loader that comes with EZ-Client 3.20, then pressing START+SELECT+A+B causes the EZ Flash boot screen to display briefly, followed by all white screens on top and bottom.
<br/>
<br/>
When I load flashme.nds up in EZ-Client, its name shows as a single dot (.), which seems odd. In fact, it shows up that way on the EZ Flash loader screen too...perhaps it isn't getting loaded onto the flash cart properly?
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a different NDS loader I should use, or should I even need to? (the FlashMe 5 page seems to indicate I don't need an NDS loader, but it isn't loading without it, so I know I am doing something wrong). I am not sure if the loader.bin file I copied over is doing anything ... shouldn't I be explicitely accessing that at some point?
<br/>
<br/>
I am at my wits end. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, thank you for pointing me in the right direction.  I was able to get it to load by prepending the ndsloader.bin file -- and I was able to get the process started by shorting SL1 with a paperclip (as I did the first time I flashed it, long ago).
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, progress has now stopped at 1% :(
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried using the end of a small screwdriver, a bent staple, and the paperclip again ... but so far I can't get it to progress past 1% ... any SL1 shorting tips anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT:</span> nevermind, it finally worked ... used a small hex driver and it finally finished :) *phew*  Nice to have my DS back alive.  Thanks for all the help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello !
<br/>
Some friends of mine gave me the url of this topic because I'vs bricked my DS.
<br/>
I have a PassMe (first generation), a 128M XG-FLash (I use EZ drivers and software) and a first generation DS and I can't debrick it.
<br/>
<br/>
The first problem is I'm not sure of the way to transform the flashme.nds into flashme.ds.gba with the loader. I used Darkain's multi-boot loader. Is it right ? (Can anyone mail me the firmware prepended at cbl at krinein.com ?)
<br/>
edit : I finally used dos command "copy /b ndsloader.bin + flashme.nds flashme.nds.gba"
<br/>
<br/>
The second is about the button combinaison (START+SELECT+A+B) I must press in order to reflash it. It can't work just by making the SL1 contact ?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to be a newbie...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You need to prepend a loader. You can get the loader from the firmware site as well. Here is the <a class="postlink" href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/ndsloader.bin" target="_blank">direct link</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Put flashme.nds and ndsloader.bin in the same directory and open a command prompt. Switch to the directory and type:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">copy /b ndsloader.bin+flashme.nds flashme.nds.gba</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
This will prepend the loader to the nds file and create flashme.nds.gba
<br/>
<br/>
Flash this file to the XG-Flash. Make sure to disable the XG Loader in the option menu.
<br/>
<br/>
Put it in your DS and hold A+B+Select+Start while turning it should load flashme. You will need to short SL1 to flash the V5 firmware.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Any way to use the recovery function with a GBA MP?  When booting with Start+Select+AB, I get just a white top screen, black bottom, and the little jingle that usually sounds when the DS boots up.
<br/>
<br/>
The alternative is to try and track down a cheap f2a usb cable.  Or, if that doesn't work, something even more drastic.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Found it - needed an update to the firmware (and for me to realize the "black" screen was actually just not backlit).  Relevant thread:

I have trouble believing that you can't find a paperclip that you could suitably bend.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To restore firmware after MKDS corrupts it, you only need the Flashme installer you originally used to install in the first place: there is no special version needed. Turn off the system, insert the cart (or whatever) containing Flashme, hold START + SELECT + A + B, then turn on. I tried a few times to get this key combination correct before it finally worked; it must be the first thing checked for as the system boots, so if it doesn't flicker into life straight away, turn off and try again.
<br/>
<br/>
The restore can now be done by following the on screen instructions. No shorting is necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
Now go and install FlashMe 5. You WILL need to short for this. A small piece of low voltage wire, with the last 2mm of exposed metal bent at a right angle to increase contact area, works great. I found paperclips to be useless.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
