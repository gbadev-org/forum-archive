AFAIK legal to dump your own, though.
<br/>
Use the firmware dumper <a href="http://www.natrium42.com/blog/?p=20" target="_blank">http://www.natrium42.com/blog/?p=20</a>
<br/>
And dump your own.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Generally true. The firmware itself is Nintendo copyrighted software. Calling such behavior "illegal" is up to interpretation.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW: everyone who has downloaded FlashMe (and especially the NoFlashMe revert program) is doing what you say is "illegal". These programs contain a big chunk of Nintendo copyrighted material.
<br/>
Your interpretation of the legality and morality is up to you.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Very true. That's the safe and legal way - although can be inconvenient.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
