    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As opposed to the M3 Perfect? I ask this because while I'm interested in getting a more competent CF reader for homebrewing, but ~$70 for the M3 Perfect is a little outside of my level of interest, but the GBAMPv2 at ~$20 is more in my range. Now, there's got to be a good reason as to why the M3 Perfect is that much more, but why? What's keeping me from using FlashMe and using homebrew with the GBAMPv2 that the M3 Perfect doesn't do? Thanks a lot, everyone who responds. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SuperCard and M3 can run full-size GBA homebrew. GBAMP v2 cannot.
<br/>
<br/>
SuperCard and M3 can take SD cards if you prefer to use those, and the homebrew support for SD cards will become stronger if and when wintermute manages to push out devkitPro r20. The GBAMP v2 SD, on the other hand, has not been cracked for use by homebrew file system code.
<br/>
<br/>
M3 has more GBA-mode compatibility than SuperCard.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Without GBA-mode compatibility, you cannot play GBA homebrew. The GBAMP v2 can only run "multiboot" GBA homebrew such as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/tod/" target="_blank">LOCKJAW: The Overdose</a> and the no-music version of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/lu/" target="_blank">Luminesweeper</a>, not full-size GBA homebrew.

<br/>
It's taken all three CF cards I've thrown at it (PQI, PNY, SanDisk). If it's your first time, I wouldn't recommend using a card that's too small (smaller than 128 MB) or too large (larger than 4 GB) or too thick (Microdrive).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Correct, except for isolated cases from the early days of DS homebrew when ds.gba was all we had (e.g. TickleGirl and the ports of Heretic and Hexen) as well as for some emulators written by people who only own a traditional GBA flash card (*cough*SnezziDS*cough*).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

You can probably pick the SuperCard CF (it's getting hard to find; <a class="postlink" href="http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=supercard%20cf" target="_blank">be froogle</a>) and run GBA and DS homebrew in that.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I added libfat to Hexen a few weeks ago, so it should work on GBAMP now.  Unfortunately the DS source for Heretic wasn't released.
<br/>
<br/>
ComicbookDS is another program that won't work on GBAMP due to the appended file system.
<br/>
<br/>
I recommend a Supercard of some kind, just don't get the rumble.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Fri Nov 10, 2006 4:53 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>
