    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm beginning to get into some DS programming, and although I'm using emulators to test my stuff out, I'm currently getting problems with them, so I figure I might as well get testing on hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
What I have right now is a EZF Advance 256M, and was thinking of just getting a PassMe (I have a launch DS) so I didn't have to buy extra hardware, but I hate having to have my GBA along just to burn my projects onto the cart (because it burns via USB-to-Linkport).
<br/>
<br/>
So I'm considering just getting another flash cart with a writer or some other kind of adapter, but I'm unsure of what I want. I like my EZF Advance cart, and would like something similar to it that is very compatible with demos and such so I wouldn't have to worry that my stuff doesn't work. Hopefully something cheap too.
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
If I were you, I'd grab yourself a PassMe and a Supercard CF. It's cheap and the most-compatible device.
<br/>
<br/>
It's apparently difficult to get homebrew to be compatible with both GBA flashcarts and flash adapters like the Supercard... folks seem to dislike using GBA flashcarts for DS dev.
<br/>
<br/>
I used WMB and WifiMe to install FlashMe off my EZFA, and then I got a Supercard SD.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'd highly recommend one of these for your main dev testing: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?item=N82E16833194001" target="_blank">Foxconn WLL-3350</a>

<br/>
SO much better than flash cart/CF card swapping. I have a nice setup with MS visual studio so I just build my "build and run" project, turn on the DS, and download.
<br/>
Not to mention you should be able to use wifime with it, and it costs about the same as a passme anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
For games/apps that don't fit in RAM (or that save files, such as NitroTracker), I use a good old GBAMP V2. I'm not too knowledgable on all the other devices out there though.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A lot faster than you can "insert cf card into computer, copy data, remove cf card, insert cf card into DS, run".
<br/>
<br/>
You'd probably want to have your data on a cf card which you keep inside your ds, and only download code, if you have alot of data. That way it'll be extremely fast. I've never had any trouble with wmb download speed.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Concerning the Supercard CF and other adapter-like devices, do I need to worry about transfer rates? I know with my EZF Advance cart, transfer rates are just about what normal GBA carts are, but I know CF, SD, and other cards can vary in speeds. If they are just about what the rates are for a normal DS card, then I won't worry.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I'm barely started working on the DS, but I've had quite a bit of time with the GBA (though I haven't released anything for it). I have a couple of ideas I would like to try out, mainly one that is a space shooter, but one thing I want to make sure of is that anything I'm working with doesn't have anything restricting it as if it wasn't on correct hardware. You know what I'm saying?
<br/>
<br/>
Dunno if I'll even need a cart to work with, since I'm not sure how big any of my projects might become, but it would be nice to have it available when and if the time comes.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">WiFi card would be a GREAT solution..  At least it is still of some use after installing FlashMe on your DS, as with a PassMe, once you flashed your DS, it is a paper weight (and at a few ounces, a very poor one).
<br/>
<br/>
Plus, you could always use the WiFi card for it's intended purpose later if needed..<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. All nopass cards should work with ezf advance, but I haven't seen any hard data on it
<br/>
2. ds-xtreme is a tad expensive (costing 2-3 times as much as other solutions)
<br/>
3. transfer rates should generally never be a problem on the DS, due to the way it works. Generally, your binary is loaded into the spacious 4MB of RAM, and executed from there. You can access additional assets from the cart if you need, but I haven't seen any apps where transfer rate might be an issue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
