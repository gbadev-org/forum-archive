    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there any flash card now-a-days that come with the microSD and adapter? I can't afford another $40 for a microSD and adapter... On average, how much does the price differ for 2GB  microSD, and SD cards?($40 was the price it cost to get an adapter and 2GB SD card. That was for Wii homebrew.)
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm... According to Google, SD cards cost more. I guess I'll need to squeeze an microSD and adapter into my budget...(Hopefully $50 will be enough... But if the flash card, or if the SD/adapter, if the shipping isn't free, well, big problem, as that will most likely exceed my budget...)

EDIT:
<br/>
Well, for this one web site, I'd have to pay for the SD/adapter shipping...(The SD/adapter are in the same package)

The iTouchDS interface is terribly slow. It will make you crazy during dev cycles.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd like to get a NAND card. Yeah, it's more expensive (usually), but I'd rather have a card using internal memory than microSD.
<br/>
<br/>
According to <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_storage_devices#Second_generation" target="_blank">Wikipedia,</a>
<br/>
there's only 4 orginal flash cards that use NAND: G6DS Real, N-Card, Acekard R.P.G, and DS-X. Is that correct? Which card would be considered the best out of all of these, excluding DS-X?(I sure can't afford another DS-X, but even if I could, what if it would break again?)
<br/>
<br/>
Here's my dislikes of all of these, excluding DS-X:(I got this information from reviews, please let me know if some of this is incorrect.)
<br/>
<br/>
G6DS Real:
<br/>
The card needs inserted into the the writer device to access the FS on the computer. I'd rather use a card that just uses a USB cord from the computer, plugs directly into the card, and the FS could be accessed without the DS being turned on.(ala N-Card)
<br/>
<br/>
N-Card:
<br/>
Short USB cord, and slow transfer to/from PC. Bad interface. Must have DS turned on from PC to access FAT.
<br/>
<br/>
Acekard R.P.G:
<br/>
USB cord can't be connected to the card while the card is inserted in the DS.(The cord would only be used so the computer could access FAT, that's all.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So Acekard R.P.G is out. N-Card, isn't really an option, since the DS must be turned on and connected to the flash card. Is there a Linux compatible version of the G6DS Real's software? I'm using Windows, but I'm wondering if it's Linux compatible...

As for that link to tehsk***, don't trust a damn word that comes from brakken. Especially in regard to "bricking".

Every self-respecting microSD-based flash cartridge comes with a USB microSD reader.
