    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi everyone, 
<br/>
<br/>
my ds lite (flashme v7 installed) or my m3 (miniSD version) is either bricked or broken..  it was initially working like a charm when i first bought.. but after playing for a month, it started to hang when loading games.. be it the latest firmware, games manager or older ones.. it may sound like a common problem.. i tried all sorts of methods to revive it yet to dismay.. 
<br/>
<br/>
one clue that might explain where went wrong is when i flash the ds lite again, (meaning to run the flashme.nds) it shows 'NDS file is corrupt'.. plus a series of numbers.. i tried to download the flashme from differrent mirrors still cant work.. YET sometimes the flashme file could run and the following screen is the flashing progress with a 66% even when i havent short circuit it.. could it be due to my SD card? m3? ds lite? 
<br/>
<br/>
hope anyone of you reading this might have encountered this problem before and give some advice.. if it is really beyond repair, i'll just get a second hand..  thanks a lot for reading..</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by clash on Sun Jan 28, 2007 6:30 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So why did you run it when you knew it was corrupt? Downloading from mirrors mean you're downloading the same exact corrupt flashme file. Go to this thread:

Which games make it hang? And does it also hang when you pull out the M3 and load an authentic DS Game Card into SLOT-1?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">to biohazard_star: hmm i tried your method.. still not able to work.. thanks a lot anyway.. 
<br/>
<br/>
to tepples: almost all games hang.. even if they load, it'll hang shortly after a few screen change.. i also noticed that when i use the 'extend' function on the m3, it shows two black screens.. sometimes white.. i havent tried a original cartridge.. when i bought it it didnt came with any.. neither do my friends have..
<br/>
<br/>
and also when i boot up the ds lite with nothing inserted, the image (where it displays the time and calendar..) on the upper screen is garbled and dimmed.. 
<br/>
<br/>
i'm quite certain that the upper screen's still working.. cause i can see it perfect when games are loaded. at least a few glance before it hangs.. =(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

"Almost all games"? Which specific titles have you tried? Perhaps you just got <span style="font-style: italic">really</span> unlucky.

Go buy one. Why would you buy a DS without buying any games?

Ouch. Corrupted firmware possibly. Did you try reinstalling FlashMe?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I read there is no recovery if the firmware does not go to 100% and system turned off, would I be able to do recover?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
