    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i was testing the fail protection from FLASH ME ( A+B+START+SELECT) 
<br/>
<br/>
and i found out how to use it with Supercard!!!!! 
<br/>
<br/>
Just copy only the flashme.nds file to CF ( not tested with SD ) 
<br/>
<br/>
use the boot A+B+START+SELECT
<br/>
<br/>
You will get a black Screen, then release the buttons and press A Button... 
<br/>
<br/>
the screen will flash and Start the code on the CF !!!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
tried with some homebrews.. and worked well ... 
<br/>
<br/>
Can any one try with Supercard SD and M3 ????<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://flickr.com/photos/stuffbox" target="_blank">http://flickr.com/photos/stuffbox</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">what is your point?  From what I was aware, thats how flashme was designed, for carts that dont have PASS or whatever in the header.  You need the latest firmware for SC though, where has M3 and G6 have DS support from the start</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The bricker tries to erase the Supercard too, so you first have to fix that using a working homebrew-WMB-capable DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Finally found why it didn't work before. xD I had some directories in my SD.
<br/>
Now it works, and I'll explain how:
<br/>
Supercard kernel works, and in fact when in fail mode, we can't see anything, but in fact we are navigating around SD Supercart directories, so can execute anything if you know where is it! (down, down, A, down -&gt; it enters in the 3rd directory, and executes the first file it founds)
<br/>
That was the cause it didn't work before to me, my SD didn't have the flashme.nds alone. Now it works this way!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Gunnme on Tue Oct 25, 2005 12:19 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not too worried about the MK issue, allthough a little concerned.
<br/>
But, if there's one thing I learned, it's that usually all the good comes to those who wait - I'm fairly positive the MK issue (if it exists in the final version) will be resolved eventually.
<br/>
Until then, I guess it's a good idea people know what to do if they run into that problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At the moment I would like to see a new version of FlashME.
<br/>
<br/>
In that version, the DS firmware should have original firmware without flashme, ONLY the failsafe is added.
<br/>
<br/>
That way we can "jump" forth and back between original firmware and the flashme firmware but still doing so safely since the fail-safe is there in both versions and we dont need to short the SL1 when jumpin between the 2 vrsions.
<br/>
<br/>
Then after Mario Kart is released, a new version where flashme is moved to a place Mario kart dont overwrite with wifi-setting come we could upgrade to that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Erm....what are you going to do with the extra code?
<br/>
To insert the failsafe code the rest of the firmware was shuffled up (then a bit removed). So say MK fills up what free space was there, where would the failsafe code go?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Failsafe in in the protected area by SL1.
<br/>
<br/>
Its not like Mario Kart WiFI setup asks you to short the SL1 when it want to save the settings.  ;p
<br/>
<br/>
So until a FlashME version that works with Mario Kart is out I'd like to see a middleground.
<br/>
<br/>
I dont want to do noflashme because that removes both flashme and the failsafe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

left fome free space..

but some how FALSHME Move all boot code to Writeable area on Flashme ans put the fail-safe code on the protected area..

may be thats why there is no area for Mario Kart DS Save the Nintendo Wifi data...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://flickr.com/photos/stuffbox" target="_blank">http://flickr.com/photos/stuffbox</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh, there's room. But some of flashme need to be moved around where Mario Kart expects to save.
<br/>
If there's a lot of saved stuff Flashme will need trimming.

Oh your insightful. The write-protected area is only the first block. This is where the fail-safe code is. All the other firmware can be written to/over.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
