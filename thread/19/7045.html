    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi@all,
<br/>
<br/>
i know these questions have been asked several times but after hours of investigation i couldnt find a solution?!
<br/>
<br/>
I have WMB up and running, flashed the NDS file for FlashMe on the Cart (EZ2 PowerStar) and a Game in the NDS-Slot. Now when i start WMB with the flashme.nds and download to the NDS there is just a white screen with a crippled Nintendo Logo and the everything locks.
<br/>
<br/>
So what the heck am i doing wrong?? Do i have to use the .nds file or do i have to use a nds.gba file on the cart? Is the flashme.nds the right file for WMB? what is this loader.bin for? do i need it for flashme installation?
<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE HELP... i?m already crying... :-((<br/>_________________<br/>...It?s a good day to die...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you tried starting WMB with the wireless multiboot "passme" (wifime)?
<br/>
<br/>
Unless your DS is flashed already you need to use it to get access to the code on the flashcart.

<br/>
<br/>
Unless I'm completely mistaken that is. Never used the wifime myself, since I've got a passme. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lucky one *g like to have a passme to but its hard to get here...
<br/>
<br/>
I took a look @ the zip file (wifime) and there are a few *.bin files in there, manual says that it has to be copied into the WMB\data folder... havent done this, could this be the cause why the whole thing doesnt work?
<br/>
<br/>
I?ll try tonight, big THX for now Tosh, ill give Info if it works!<br/>_________________<br/>...It?s a good day to die...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<span style="font-weight: bold">Instead</span> get the .ds.gba version and put that on ur flash cart then run "wifime". This method should work.<br/>_________________<br/>MKDS friend code-

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, thx. I wasnt able to find a .ds.gba file so i took the loader.bin and attached the flashme.nds to it and named it nds.gba AND IT WORKED!
<br/>
<br/>
Flashing was done in a few seconds, all with no problems, but i have to patch every file to nds.gba for making it work, is there no way to run .nds files directly?
<br/>
<br/>
BTW why do some games come with an error like "could not format saver area" and so on ??

Many newer .nds files have a built-in loader that lets them work as both a .nds file (for FlashMe+WMB or for any+GBAMP) and a ds.gba file (for any+GBA flash card). This results in an invalid GBA header, but PassMe, WiFiMe, and FlashMe don't care. However, many GBA flash cards' official writing programs insist on "repairing" the GBA header, which obliterates the loader. For these, you need to prepend a stand-alone loader that doesn't rely on the first 192 bytes of the card. Or look through your program's option screen to see if you can turn off "fix header" or something like that.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
