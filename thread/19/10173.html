    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just updated my Passkey2 vith v3 firmware in order to make my M3 MiniSD adapter work on my new DS Lite. The problem is that after flashing and using  the K2-RAM03.gba file to tell the passkey to use my Castelvania cartridge nothing seems to happen! When I turn on the ds with passkey and m3 inserted it boots directly to original ds menu, without letting me access to the M3 ds menu...bah :-(
<br/>
At least gba mode works!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Did you load an SRAM image on the M3? I don't know how the passkey writer works, so I don't know if it does that for you. I used a homebrew PassMe2 so I had to handle that myself. PepsiMan's SRAM writer was very helpfull for that part.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
