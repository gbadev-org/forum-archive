<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering something and I could not find the answers on the board.  Tried searching but found nothing, so I am resorting to posting.  I am sorry if it was already mentionned.
<br/>
<br/>
I just bought a wireless card to try out wmb.exe and WiFiMe.  Now, the WiFiMe.nds boots without a FlashMe it seems, just like the demos from E3.  But when it comes to homebrewed games compiled in .nds, my DS freezes when the logo appears.  I know this is normal and I will proceed soon to FlashMe, but the question remains.  What did Firefly do of different so that is .nds file loads ok but not homebrews?  I am very puzzled by this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
WifiMe is like PassMe, it will execute whatever is in the GBA slot. RSA is still being verified on signed code but that won't be executed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was sure it was a NDS file, but it's a number of bins file...  now I look stupid...
<br/>
<br/>
Though I am still wondering, since it downloads for Download Center, how does the RSA check get passed?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure, but I think it is because modifications to launch homebrew are made in the header which is not signed. Correct me if I'm wrong, I found this in the wifime thread :

Tim's new stuff does the same thing as the PassMe card - redirects execution to code loading from a GBA card. This is possible because the headers with the start addresses are pre encryption.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
