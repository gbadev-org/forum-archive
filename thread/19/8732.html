Only if it has a Ralink chipset. Also, you need to have a flashcart to install FlashMe from.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

NES - No.

SNES - Yes, unless you want to be able to play about 2 games with a ton of glitches and no sound.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Good point. Mine was $20 but I have no idea what an average price, nor the lowest you'll likely find is. (Plus it's 7-in-1.) A lot of storebought computers already have them, though. (And hey, they're useful for other things too. Especially if you get one like mine that can be removed and plugged into another computer's USB port.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
