    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hello friends,
<br/>
im kinda new to this hardware but i want to give it a kick. I want to use the Nintendo DS as a handheld (PDA) like running a different os (maybe gba/ds wins ???) and draw pictures (dspaint ?) and save some text (txt writer ?) and run homebrew software and games. to the flash-cardridges provide save-game support ?
<br/>
is there a set where everything is included ? 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so what should i buy ? do the shops ship international ?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance...<br/>_________________<br/>mfg, arksole</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
