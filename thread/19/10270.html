the only device that is CF and has any limitations it the GBA MP, as it doesn't have any internal RAM that can be directly addressed as a GBA Flash Cart.  So, if you get a SuperCard or M3, you should be able to do ANYTHING a GBA Flash Cart can do, and a whole lot more.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Except saving in .gba or ds.gba homebrew is a bit tough, as it takes a bit of timing to get a quick power cycle.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
