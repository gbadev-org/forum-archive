Ok I'm probably asking a stupid question but how do you get this on the DS? The instructions kind of have me confused so can someone tell me how to do this <span style="text-decoration: underline">using WiFiMe</span> step by step? I think I have everything needed. Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Then you should have all the instructions you need.
<br/>
<br/>
To give you a little push, though, put the flashme.nds file in a folder called FlashMe in your data directory (C:\WiFiMe\data\FlashMe\flashme.nds). Then run wmb.exe using the following command line parameter:
<br/>
C:\WiFiMe\wmb.exe -data "FlashMe"
<br/>
<br/>
Check to make sure that says "Sending multiboot beacons &amp; waiting for authentication", open your DS (make sure battery is NOT low), and go to DS Download Play. Keep the DS near your antenna and when flashme comes up, download it.
<br/>
<br/>
Now follow the instructions right off the homepage:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Open the battery lid, remove the square white/pink sticker from the hole indicated by the arrow in the picture and make contact between the two SL1 pads by putting a solid metal object in the hole. You could use a screw or screwdriver for example.
<br/>
DO NOT SWITCH OFF OR REMOVE BATTERY UNTIL IT IS FINISHED! The process is only PAUSED when SL1 contact is lost.
<br/>
Please do not remove the battery or touch the other two holes!</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't understand any of that, check Lynx's how-to:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">FourScience described method will only work if you have your DS already flashed with the version that removes the signature verification.
<br/>
<br/>
If you flash your DS the very first time you need to put the flashme.ds.gba file onto your gba card. 
<br/>
Then you create a subdirectory for wifime in the wmb data directory and put the WifiMe Data in there.
<br/>
Then you start wmb.exe and supply the name of the directory you created to the data parameter. If you named the directory wifime then it would look like this:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">wmb -data "wifime"</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Now you need to open up the battary cover to reach SL1 put your flashcard in the DS and start it.
<br/>
Choose Download play and the wifime programm should show up. If you download it, the execution will redirect to your flashcard wich contains the bios.
<br/>
Follow the instructions and short SL1. If you lost contact on SL1 the flash process will only pause so don't panic and just short the contact again.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good, thanks for the help. I also have another question.
<br/>
I've been thinking of getting a new flash card. This X-ROM 512Mb SET (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.easybuy2000.com/store/nintendo%20accessories/x-rom512.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.easybuy2000.com/store/nintendo%20accessories/x-rom512.shtml</a>) seems like a good buy. My question is will I be able to use it with WiFiMe, snesDS, stuff like that? I want to know before I buy it, thanks again</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You should take a look at <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=5381" target="_blank">this thread</a>. It contains a list of flashcards that has been tested with passme. If they work with passme they work with wifime as well since the 2 things are basically doing the same.
<br/>
The card you mentioned is in that list as well.

<br/>
The XROM works great with the DS, as long as you flash using the command line flasher, usbcable.exe. You could use LittleWriter, but USBCable is so much faster.
<br/>
That, and the linker to flash it hooks to the GBA link cable, so you NEED a GBA to flash it. That might be something you want to keep in mind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
