I have a SC CF in my Lite, and it has served me well. What I'm looking for is a flash cart that doesn't stick out. I know the SC Lite, but I'd like something that
<br/>
<br/>
o doesn't require homebrew patching (ideally runs with existing libfat)
<br/>
o runs a predefined start binary instead of the SC launcher (DSO for example)
<br/>
o uses exchangeable flash media
<br/>
<br/>
Is there such a beast? I'm grateful for all help.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">DSFTP homepage</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
