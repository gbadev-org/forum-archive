    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone have experience with Sandisk Ultra II media, specifically whether or not it is worth the price premium in terms of improved performance? From what I've read I think it depends on whether or not ROM data is buffered by the flash cart. If it helps I plan on using the card in an EZ-Flash Lite, so I guess the jury is still out on exactly how that cart is going to handle its business. Currently it looks like a 1GB MicroSD goes for US$40 or $60 depending on whether or not it's Sandisk's Ultra II variety.

Edit: Sorry, I always end up in the wrong forum for some reason. I meant to put this in the DS Flash Equipment section.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
