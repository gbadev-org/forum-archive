    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The battery compartment screw on my lite won't come out. I can rotate it about 360 degrees and then feel a slight "click" which makes me think the thread is worn out...but I've never taken it out before.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It might be undone but the cover is a little tight. I've had this problem with my DS Phat. To get the cover off, try turning the DS Lite up the right way (so the battery compartment cover is facing towards the centre of the earth) and undo the screw.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yup, looks all the way out to me.. you can try getting a finger nail under the head of the screw and pull.  Or the good old "smack" it on your hand to see if you can knock the battery out..<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
