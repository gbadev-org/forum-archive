    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First use proper spelling and punctuation. Then install DSLinux. Retawq is a DSLinux program, not a generic DS program.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Reaper, you're probably going to get better help at the DSLinux forums.  Like we've attempted to tell you, reading the DSLinux wiki would help greatly.  It says right there that

So go to the downloads and select the GBAMP version to download.  Extract the file using a program like 7zip.  This is very important, as you cannot simply place the *.tgz file on your card.  It won't work.  Fully extract it and you should get a dslinux.nds file and a folder called "linux".  Place the "linux" folder in the root directory of your card, and place dslinux.nds wherever.  If the MMD has a specified Games folder, you might want to put it there.  Launch the MMD, load the dslinux.nds file, and then read <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dslinux.org/wiki/Using_DSLinux#Wireless_Networking" target="_blank">here</a> to find instructions for setting up your wireless network.  Only once you setup your wireless network will Retawq work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Extract that resulting file as well.  From my understanding, a .tgz is actually a .tar.gz file, and it was compressed with two different algorithms.  Therefore, you need to extract it once and then extract the resulting file.  Once you're done, go into the linux folder and make sure there is a "Home" directory.  If there isn't, then you need a different extraction program that doesn't remove empty folders.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Then perhaps the GBAMP build doesn't work.  Have you tried using the WMB build instead?  Note that the WMB build doesn't have Retawq on it, but it would be good to know if DSLinux even works at all on the MMD.  It should, but I don't think the touchscreen should go blank like that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
