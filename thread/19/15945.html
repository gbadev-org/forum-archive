    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Found a card from the recognized list, a StarTech PCI555WG. It rejects the driver when I attempt to install it via the instructions. When all is done, it load up as a "Ralink Turbo Wireless Lan Card"
<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say I am out more money attempting to get this to work. 
<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was a "sure thing" for the driver to load with this card. Can anyone help, please?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What error does it say when you try to install the WMB drivers?
<br/>
<br/>
Does it say "The Specified location does not contain information about your hardware"?
<br/>
<br/>
Try going to device manager, right click "Ralink Turbo Wireless Lan Card", select update driver and then browse for the WMB driver.
<br/>
<br/>
There is no sure thing when using unofficial drivers.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
