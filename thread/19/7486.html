    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there, I received an M3 adapter just about a week ago. I had no CF card, so I just popped it in to test it out (the PassKey and M3) and when I turned it on, it automatically went from that DS warning to the black screen that said that this product isn't endorsed by Nintendo and later on that I had no CF card inserted.
<br/>
<br/>
That DS of mine got its LCD screen cracked, so I traded it in for a serviced DS. However, this DS with the M3/PKey fades into white from the warning screen and stays that way.
<br/>
<br/>
I dread that this is the new firmware that everyone is talking about (the one that doesn't allow first generation PassMe/Key, et al.)
<br/>
<br/>
What is the course of action I need to take? I haven't even got the chance to use my M3 at all yet because I'm waiting on my CF card to come in.<br/>_________________<br/>3 is not an "e",

This is what I did tonight myself. I live in Northern NJ, and I'll be damned there is not a single older firmware DS available in the area, which makes my Superpass completely useless. Looking forward to *finally* flashing my firmware using the new Passme2 however.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, it doesn't work with GBAmp. And PassME2 only supports NDogs and SM64DS because ... I don't know. God hates us :p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
