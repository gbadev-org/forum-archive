<br/>
M3:
<br/>
Longer battery life.
<br/>
Saves stay in RAM longer before having to write to CF
<br/>
Faster RAM?
<br/>
CF card is enclosed, so it's better protected
<br/>
The M3 has a firmware failsafe, so it's harder to brick than the Supercard.
<br/>
Novelty feature: There's many BACKNDS/BACKIMG background/skins for it and it plays movies if you can be bothered converting them
<br/>
<br/>
Supercard:
<br/>
Smaller
<br/>
Cheaper
<br/>
Can insert/remove CF card without unplugging Supercard from DS</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Wed Jan 04, 2006 11:33 am; edited 4 times in total</span></div>

Yeah...I've not timed it, but the battery life using the M3 seems pretty good.  It didn't seem to be unusually bad or anything like that.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But, the fit into the GBA slot is SUPER tight!  It's a good thing you can remove the CF without removing it!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, the M3's saving system is really good and though it sounds confusing to read, once you use it, you'll see how easy it is! I don't know about the SC's.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't own a Supercard, but I know for a fact that it *does* suffer slowdowns on a variety of games. Some noticeably so, some not-so-noticeably so.<br/>_________________<br/>3 is not an "e",

On the M3 website it said something about having to push it back because they had trouble getting the parts that were needed, so I'm really not sure.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, I saw that where it had an SD option in the software now.  I also noticed the streamlined saving a bit more now...if you write a game to the card then it creates the save for you automagically so that it works with the autosave function if they don't exist.. (I guess that's what the weird sounding readme means)took me like 2 days to figure out all I had to do was name save for the DS app to match that of the *.dat file in the save directory.  &gt;_&lt;<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
