    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have an original launch DS that has been acting up.
<br/>
<br/>
I recently opened a copy of Metroid Prime: Hunters - First Hunt and inserted the empty shell inside my DS cart slot. Ever since then it's been having MAJOR troubles reading carts. Maybe every one out of fifty times.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, today, I unflashed my DS to show my friend and was notified shortly after that my DS will not read carts. At all. It read it once and then after that, none. So in my rage I felt the need to take my smallest screwdriver and stick it in the DS cart slot, against the pins.
<br/>
<br/>
I then took a Q-Tip and brushed it all over the inside of the DS cart slot (which brought out some black stuff, dust maybe?) and now it just...
<br/>
<br/>
doesn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
So I am asking if there is anyway to fix my DS or any way to flash it not using the DS slot. Could I open my DS and put the pins on the inside directly against the passme? Is there anything I can do? I'm pretty much up for doing just about anything seeing as it'd be worth it over having a fancy looking GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I used the noflashme that came on QJ.net and was with, what I believe was, Flashme v3. Is that okay?
<br/>
<br/>
It's FW V1 I believe, or at least it was before flashing it with Flashme v7.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I hope you don't expect flashing to repair the broken cartridge slot. O_o I think FlashMe uninstalls to the version you had before, so if that's V1 through V3 (use the Pictochat Test), you can use WifiMe to run FlashMe from your GBA cart. However I suggest you send it (unflashed) to Nintendo for repairs. It's cheaper than a replacement, and you don't want to miss out on some of the best DS games. (Plus you may have damaged other things.) Probably just a broken pin or something.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, I don't. I had V1 by the way, and I couldn't check if I wanted to because it doesn't read carts.
<br/>
<br/>
But I used WiFiME today and flashed it perfectly.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and about the cart slot, it really doesn't matter. I have a lite and another DS, I just wanted to have this one flashed so it's not really a brick or a nice looking GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you have the same problem as me when I had my old ds. I was useing a passme device and since I had gotton the ds lite I was testing with the ds card slot. Anyways, I found out that when useing a passme device, and turning on your ds, well nothing happened, so then I pulled the passme device out and the firmware froose and turned off the ds, so the ds would never boot again, anyways, you have the same problem and it can't be fixed. so oh-well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
