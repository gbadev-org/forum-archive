You know, I'm tempted, just to see that happen.  Too bad I have no money.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I could start the "buy darkfader a GBA movie player" fund to see some hacking action with that device.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, do you mean DS firmware?  At first I thought you were referring to the firmware of the GBA movie player.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't know which way Darkfader would prefer, but you can get the movieplayer from Lik-Sang  for 24.90 USD, shipping costs vary from $6 to $28 depending on how fast you want it.  Lik-Sang accepts PayPal, and you might be able to have them deliver it directly to his address, found on the info page of his website.

<br/>
What a sad state society is in when an honest bloke can't even give a few quid to someone to get them started on something useful in life :)
<br/>
<br/>
I don't contirbute much to the gba/ds dev community. I read the newsgroups, I download the devkits, I read the tutorials, I use the tools (like map editors), and I test on the emulators. I wouldn't be able to do any gba/ds development if people like darkfader didn't work out how it could be done and others explained it and wrote tools for it.
<br/>
<br/>
And what have I given in return? Well I might have answered a couple of basic C/C++ questions on the forums...
<br/>
<br/>
US$30 isn't that much to me. Once you convert it into British Pounds, and then into London beer tokens, you get about 4 pints of Hoegaarden.
<br/>
<br/>
I probably should have just given a donation quietly without showboating in the forum. However now I've brought attention to myself I'd like to use the opportunity to urge others to donate a couple of beer tokens to the guys doing the hard work creating hardware, wifi hacks, tutorials, emulators, devkits, etc etc. Especially anyone whose first response to tim's wifi hacking was "now write a driver for my card" - *frown*.<br/>_________________<br/>---

<br/>
Maybe.  But as a high school student with no job, I don't have much money to donate, and I think it's great to see someone (i.e. you), making a donation.  Besides, it was requested on the forums, and that's where you dealt with it.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, a homebrew firmware upgrade is the upcoming possibility that excites me most right now.  I also have a movieplayer, and want to see some DS support for it.  Anything that brings firmware/general DS support for the movieplayer closer is fine with me, even if it comes off as showboating.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I found your post saying you'd donated to be encouraging rather than show-offish.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I simply cannot believe that people are donating money to anyone for this, it is not a personal attack at darkfader - he has always done good work. As for what I have done, truthfully not a lot. I as always have several things on the go, but nothing amazing really. In particular though, absolutely none of the things I am working on can lead in any way to piracy on the DS, so nobody has paid any attention when I have mentioned them.

Some people don't live day-to-day, on minimum wage, supporting a wife, child, mortgage etc. Some people have $$$, you know those big green papery wafers of joy, so why not throw it around where it might help the dev com. ? Seems perfectly ok to me. Ok, so you don't have much money, that's a shame, but just cos you don't have any don't mean other's round here don't.
