    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i ordered my passkey 3 weeks ago and still havent received it. I would send an email to him but both the ones i have tried in the past: <a href="mailto:natrium@gmail.com">natrium@gmail.com</a> and <a href="mailto:alexei@karpenko.de">alexei@karpenko.de</a>, have yielded no responses at all. Does anyone know a way that i can actually reach natrium and get a reply because i have never been able to get a reply out of him</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
