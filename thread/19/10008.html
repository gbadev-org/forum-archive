Moonshell is alright, you just have to build using a special core file and use EXFS. DSOrganize doesn't work at all. Is there any documentation for the way EZ-Flash handles writing and reading to the media? Is it something they have to fix, or will homebrew authors need to add compatibility for it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm guessing homebrew is not the main concern for their product.<br/>_________________<br/>2 x Enamel Blue DS lites V5, V7 FW whatever
<br/>
2 x EZ4 lite microSD adapters
<br/>
Both are FlashMe'd</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Moonshell's source has the source code for its EZ SD driver, but the FAT libs in Moonshell are heavily modified so integrating that back into another FAT lib version isn't straightforward. I've tried building PicoDriveDS with EZ SD support enabled, but it hangs on boot on my EZ4 Lite microSD. So you might have to wait until one of the other FAT lib authors merges that code back in before you see it start to trickle down to the homebrew that uses it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there any other homebrew that works well? The only ones I need are moonshell and dsorganize, but it would be pretty cool if I could use some of the wifi apps like beup or ndsmail. What do you run on your card?
<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, you can run ScummVMDS if you build it for a flash cart, and you can run SNESDS, SnezziBoy, NESDS, FlashMe, and ETool as well...

Loopy's Mario Kart patch boots into GBA mode :( :(
<br/>
<br/>
OMG SNESDS even SAVES on the EZ-Flash!! *dies*
<br/>
<br/>
Awww... it only saves temporarily :( the EZ team need to let it write the sram to a sav file! At least it loads my old save...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
