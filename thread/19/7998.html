    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just out of curiosity, the tricks used to get the DS to play homebrew games, can they be used for commercial ROMs as well? (This would be usefull for checking the effectiveness of an emulator. I don't intend to actually steal ROMs or anything.) I've seen that some emus can play a few commercial games, but it would be best to compare their emulation with the actual hardware to see how effective they are.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, some homebrew loaders support loading official WMB demos and commercial games. However, to keep within the scope of this board (and not <a class="postlink" href="http://boards.pocketheaven.com/" target="_blank">that other board</a>), let's limit discussion to official WMB demos if at all.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
