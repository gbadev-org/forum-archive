    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everybody, I haven't actually bought a dock yet but my opinion is that I don't really want to buy something online when I can go to a store near me to get what I need for Homebrew on my DS. Anybody think it's possible to run homebrew on a max media dock?<br/>_________________<br/>Viva para la Guatemala!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It hasn't been driving me particularly nuts. The only problems I've experienced with mine were related to the loader, and they're easily worked around by just using a different one. I've been using the most recent release of DSChannels as an alternative loader and everything has been working fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a max media dock. The CF card died shortly afer I bought it and the manufacturer would not replace it (i bought it from the manufacturer retail web site). however, I replaced the CF card myself and have not had any problems since then. well, aside from the fact that the replacement CF card does not allow the builtin USB device to be detected by windows so I have to use a card reader. All in all it a relatively easy to use device and not too expensive. So, it is not too bad to get started in ds homebrew. however, you may end up wanting to replace it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have the Games n' Music, made by Datel (makers of the MMD).  It has the same interface as the MMD, but it's a SLOT-1 device that uses microSD.  You don't have to buy it online, I got mine at Best Buy.  It now has a DLDI so it's compatible with the major homebrew apps, but like the MMD, it doesn't have a loader, so apps like MoonShell can't boot into other apps (doesn't matter, just shut off the DS and restart it, everything works fine that way).  It costs $35 to $40 (I think it was $39.95 or so at Best Buy, don't remember, I was there to get a Wiimote/Wii Play package but I saw the GnM and bought it too).<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
