<br/>
<br/>
As for the question, I'm not sure. The MML doesn't support sleep mode, that's all I know :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A) What do you mean by 'donor card'? I haven't heard this term before.
<br/>
B) The MML has nothing to do with any kind of saving...it simply is there to boot whatever is in the GBA slot</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well i have heard to saving a commercial game when using the $PIRATETOOL you would need to use a real nds card which many call a "donor card" and i was wondering if a MML could act as a donor card but contain more than one save.
<br/>
<br/>
Does the Datel MML have any onboard memory<br/>_________________<br/>If anyone needs a dragonball online email me @ <a href="mailto:aaronthejester@hotmail.com">aaronthejester@hotmail.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
