<br/>
I probably have a new firmware but is there any way to check.

<br/>
If you have the old firmware i think it will give you two white screens.
<br/>
If you have the new firmware you should get a corrupted Mario DS Multiplayer game.

<br/>
remember: you can't use WifiMe with the new firmware, so don't buy a wifi card for that! Only try it, if you already have a compatible card (or you plan to use wmb after flashing you DS).
