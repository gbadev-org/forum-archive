    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok,
<br/>
<br/>
Like the topic says, I really want to be able to run some homebrew games/apps on my ds. I've been trolling through the forums looking for information realted to what flash equipemtn to use and various techniques like FlashMe, PassMe, NoPass, WifiMe, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is, there is so much information it was giving me a headache and i'm still left sitting here not knowing what to do, so hopefully those of you more knowledgeable than I can help me out.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are my questions:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Does anyone have experience with any slot1 solutions like the SuperCard DS(one)? This seems like a really nice option, keeping things simple, but I can't find any reviews on the product and I don't know exactly what it will let me do, ie. play homebrew ds/gba games/apps. with support for pictures, books and or videos.
<br/>
<br/>
2) Alot of these flash devices seem to be using mircoSD. Now, I have a card reader on my pc, but it doesn't have a slot for microSD. Would I need to purchase an adapter separately, or does the card come with one?
<br/>
<br/>
3) On some forums I've noticed discussion about certian games requiring "patching" and the like to work. Now, these posts seemed to be related to illegal dumps, and I have no plans to use pirated software so do I need to be worried about this, or is homebrew exempt from this hassle?
<br/>
<br/>
4) I'm also hoping to run games like nethackDS and the like, and I've heard on some forums that systems using SD cards mess up this game and some others. Is there any truth to this?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the length of the post, but essentially I just want a setup where I can just copy the stuff I want, then plug it in and go without a gigantic learning curve, without costing me a fortune. Thanks for your patience, and I hope you DS homebrew gurus can guide be on the right path :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1: Reports on Slot-1 solutions are mixed and homebrew support is not guaranteed. Some solutions, like the DS-X, have few problems, others have lots. Homebrew is written with Slot-2 in mind and hence Slot-2 will tend to be the more reliable solution with respect to compatibility...
<br/>
<br/>
2: Some microSD cards come with an adapter. Some don't. If it doesn't, an adapter is very easy to get and doesn't cost much.
<br/>
<br/>
3: Homebrew does not require patching
<br/>
<br/>
4: I've run NethackDS on my SD:miniSD with no problems. SD cards are only generally corrupted by program using old FAT library implementations. Up to date compiles of pretty much all major homebrew has no problems for the most part (Other than a few very rare once-off incidents which sometimes pop up)
<br/>
<br/>
My recommended setup is an SC:MiniSD or SC:Lite with FlashMe (You'll need a NoPass or PassMe2 (Preferably a NoPass though) in order to install FlashMe).<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

Oh, and one last thing, is there just one flashme firmware update, or is this something that I'm going to need to keep flashing every few months when a new version comes out?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

FlashMe Stealth makes no visible change; the other version skips the intro and health warning screen. If you have a SLOT-2 card that supports both DS and GBA modes (such as a GBA Movie Player with Chishm's firmware hack), you'll need to hold Select to skip FlashMe and launch the DS menu in order to go to GBA mode.

FlashMe has not been changed in months. The last major updates were v5 (support games that use Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection) and v7 (support the multiple brightness levels of the DS Lite). You can install it once and leave it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I have a dsx.  I love it.  However, as OOPman noted, most homebrew is designed for slot 2 because slot 1 devices are fairly new.  I am going to get both slot 1 and slot 2 devices so I can make my programs compatible with both.
<br/>
<br/>
You aren't going to find many reviews.  maxconsole.net has some.  I think the only slot 1 cards out there at this moment are the dsx, acekard, and ds link.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
As long as you stick with M3, supercard, or g6 you won't have too many problems.  From what I observe supercard seems to be the best overall device.  They all excel in different areas though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Slot 1 devices can not run GBA homebrew since GBA homebrew needs to run in GBA mode and GBA mode doesn't have access to slot 1.  The only hope for GBA on slot1 is with an emulator but no one has made one.
<br/>
<br/>
I recommend Supercard Lite microSD (for slot2) and a nopass device (superkey) for slot1.  Supercard is often sold in bundles that include a Superkey.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I saw before that with older firmwares it was possible to use your computer's wireless to provide the Nintendo DS with a downloadable game.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br/>
Is there absolutely no way to wirelessly transmit applications/games to a DS with a newer firmware with any wireless card (without any extra hardware)?</span>
<br/>
<br/>
It seems that the ideal situation is to develop the DS game on your computer and then just allow your DS to wireless download it without having to buy a whole bunch of extra hardware or potentially frying your DS trying to flash it.
<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone working on this? If so, could you point me in their direction? (Thanks in advance)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, it's not possible to work around it. Here's a short explanation.
<br/>
<br/>
The loading points of a program when ran with wireless multiboot exists on two places, inside the .nds and outside the .nds. Old versions use the loading address outside, which can be changed to point to the gba slot. New versions use the one inside, which can't be changed without breaking the checksum, and thus breaking the rsa sign.
