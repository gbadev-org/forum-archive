    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just a question regarding this. I see there are a few flashcards out there. A lot of them are system-specific and don't seem to work on every DS slot. I don't know much about DS programming as of now but I would like to know, if I actually wanted to distribute these games so others can play them (without the use of a flash cart or their own hardware), is there a way out there to do so?
<br/>
<br/>
In essence I'm wondering how the actual companies that publish these games do it. I posted in the GBA section and I'm wondering if there's a way to release games to the public without using this is only good for x system/firmware/etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
