    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I just installed FlashMe using the ppflash method, and a GBAMP v2.  I have a blue DS that had firmware version 4.
<br/>
<br/>
I can run homebrew apps, including Linux, and DS2Key.  DS2Key finds and connects to my AP, and I can send/receive UDP packets.  This tells me the hardware should be OK.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I cannot even enter a Pictochat room, it gives me the list of rooms, but when I click on one, it doesn't do anything.
<br/>
<br/>
When I click DS download play, I get a blank checkered screen with a Quit button.  It used to say something like looking for games to download.  The Quit button does not function.
<br/>
<br/>
Mariokart DS freezes when trying to enter multiplayer.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this something to do with Mariokart writing information to the firmware before installing FlashMe?  I read that the latest FlashMe versions should live happily with Mariokart wifi settings.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I seriously doubt a broken antenna would cause this behaviour :)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, in my post I stated that I have successful wifi communication with DS2Key (I can connect to an Access Point and tx/rx packets).  This indicates that this is not a hardware issue.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing I can think of is that the dswifi lib (<a class="postlink" href="http://akkit.org/dswifi/index.html" target="_blank">http://akkit.org/dswifi/index.html</a>) is using polling mode, and interrupt generation from the RFU is not working .. this would explain why dswifi lib works, but the nintendo code does not.  I am going to do some more research into dswifilib to see how it works....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sounds like the firmware didn't get flashed properly. Since you have FlashMe working, and apparently have a flash cart (since you're able to use these apps without WMB), I suggest you try reinstalling FlashMe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
