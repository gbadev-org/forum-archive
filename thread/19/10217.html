    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I just swapped my 1GB CF card for two 512MB ones, because starting programs from the 1GB card is very flakey -- whitescreening about 75% of the time. When they run, they run great, but they rarely do.
<br/>
<br/>
Hence the question for other SuperCard users: Was this my card's fault, or does the SuperCard have problems with large CF cards? Or phrased differently, what is the max CF size you have in use, and what make is it?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot in advance,
<br/>

i have a supercard CF,
<br/>
v1.62 firmware installed on it (i suggest you make sure you have the most current firmware version :) )
<br/>
[if you wanna check the SCCF firmware hold both triggers while turning on with supercard inserted... then press a untill it passes the other tests and displays the firmware version]
<br/>
<br/>
ok,
<br/>
now i have a SanDisk 1GB CF card...
<br/>
works fine,
<br/>
works 100% of the time...
<br/>
lol
<br/>
<br/>
i can't see why it wouldn't work for you unless your firmware is out of date,
<br/>
or your CF is not supported...
