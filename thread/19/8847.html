    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Please help! I've spent hours to figure out this but only thing i see is just
<br/>
two white screens.
<br/>
<br/>
i've tried--
<br/>
1.ndsloader.bin + flashme.nds = flashme.gba
<br/>
2.ndsmall.bin + flashme.nds = flashme.gba
<br/>
3.used "dslazy" to make flashme.ds.gba
<br/>
4.used "ndspatch", "ndstool" to make flashme.gba
<br/>
5.used "loadme"
<br/>
<br/>
i get two white screens all the time.
<br/>
<br/>
spec--
<br/>
1.us DS with firmware 1
<br/>
2.Flash2Advance ultra 1G
<br/>
3.F2A PowerWriter v2.61
<br/>
4.Passme2 from "dspassme.com" (mario64 ver.)
<br/>
5.also tested with HongKong DS white (NRHxxxxxxx3) same result
<br/>
6.also erased cart from powerwriter
<br/>
<br/>
I think it's either F2Aultra flash or passme problem.
<br/>
so.. is there anyone successful to flashme using F2AU flashcard "1G"??
<br/>
maybe my passme is broken one..
<br/>
Please help me people!!
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had the same problem as you. After some fiddling and some impetus from Pepsiman (a living NDS god ;), I finally got it to boot of my cart doing the following:
<br/>
<br/>
The flashme file is a nds file so you will need to prepend the ndsloader which I downloaded from the flashme site:
<br/>
<br/>
1) At command prompt: 
<br/>
     copy /b ndsloader.bin + flashme.nds flashme.nds.gba
<br/>
<br/>
2) Burn the newly created flashme.nds.gba file to your cart.
<br/>
<br/>
3) Chuck cart into DS. And run wifime to boot the flashme app.
<br/>
<br/>
And to add to that: Make sure you format your cart before burning and make sure the cart software will not burn its own loader. The only thing you want on your cart is the flashme.nds.gba file.
<br/>
<br/>
And this from DjoeNWork of#dsdev/efnet:
<br/>
&lt;DjoeNWorK&gt; also yo have to format the card not with the f2a ultra software but within your gba/ds itself to erase it complete (this includes the multibootloader)
<br/>
&lt;DjoeNWorK&gt; on the f2a pages somewhere is said hwhat the button combination is to go into the selftest area (from where you can complete clean your f2aultra)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">this sounds so great. i'm going to test it now.
<br/>
since i don't have wifime i should have try it with passme2 still though..
<br/>
also to me it seems like something about powerWriter (F2AU) automatically writes boot loader..
<br/>
<br/>
so my another question is..
<br/>
is there any other software than PowerWriter for Flash2AdvanceULTRA 1G? something that doesn't burn boot loader..
<br/>
<br/>
F2AU users! please help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sigh..
<br/>
<br/>
I think i have no luck with flashme :-(
<br/>
I erased my card and tried to burn FLASHME with FlashManager(3.0.0.15 which works with F2A Ultra 1G).. still white screens!
<br/>
<br/>
also tried old PowerWriter.. no luck
<br/>
<br/>
Could anyone explain me why this's happening Please??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
anyways,
<br/>
If you are F2A Ultra user and stuck with this crazy flashme thing..
<br/>
here's exact steps. i bet this works 100% if you have right flashme version for yourDS firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
1.http://www.ndshb.com/cgi-bin/cfiles/cfiles.cgi?0,0,0,0,10
<br/>
download "passme2flashme.gba"
<br/>
<br/>
2.burn "passme2flashme.gba" with PowerWriter v2.61
<br/>
make sure to burn only "passme2flashme.gba" to your F2AU.
<br/>
you don't have to worry about bootloader or anything. just burn it!
<br/>
<br/>
3.******THIS IS IMPORTANT********
<br/>
Insert F2A Ultra into GBA Slot.
<br/>
Do NOT Insert PASSME or PASSME2 YET!!!! Only F2A Ultra.
<br/>
<br/>
4."passme2flashme.gba" will load as GBA mode.
<br/>
*Match the code with your DS card (the one you'll put to passme)
<br/>
*Make sure to select exact number. Also there might be 2 same numbers.
<br/>
Just choose the top one.
<br/>
*Your DS card number's shown in front.(bottom right corner)
<br/>
<br/>
5.If you found one, click A. you will see "SRAM Written"
<br/>
<br/>
6.Power Off
<br/>
<br/>
7.Now, Insert PASSME or PASSME2 into DS slot. Make sure to put your DS card to passme.
<br/>
<br/>
8.Power On..... and no more two white screens.
<br/>
<br/>
9.http://www.dspassme.com/FlashMe.shtml
<br/>
follow the instruction and you are ready to use homebrews with F2A Ultra
<br/>
<br/>
hope this helps</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Aaaah...you weren't uploading the SRAM your PassMe2 needed.  Good deal then, I'd probably have forgotten about that as well.  :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
