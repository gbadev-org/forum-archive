    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Funny thing i hadn't even noticed this, as I'm using mostly older DS's for development. A pink European DS Lite I purchased in November 2006 doesn't accept any .nds sent from the WMB program. The older white US Lite model (July 2006, I think) works without problems as with all the DS Phat's. All DS's are flashed with FlashMe v7.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this a common problem I've just missed and is there a workaround? Perhaps the big N has changed the MAC address-space again or something?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The rumble commands don't seem to work with newer lites; I have an old blue ds phat, and the rumble works fine in homebrew.  However, on neither my black DS lite nor my brother's white DS lite does it work.  Also, I find that the GBA cart removal interrupt is... broken.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">WMB has hard-coded mac addresses in it. you need to use a hexeditor and change 001656 to 0017AB in 4 places within the exe or it will ignore your DSLite.  This is the first 3 bytes of the mac address.

I have a new DSLite with the latest wifi hardware and WMB works fine for me after these hex changes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks, it works now perfectly! Only downside is that now there's again a need for two separate WMB's - one for the older DS models and one for newer Lites.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not entirely sure but there *might* be room in those tables to add the entry, I say this cause theres entries below 0xffffff that are 0x03xxxx which might or might not have been put there expecting this to be needed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
