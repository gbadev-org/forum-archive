    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What are the differences between using a flashed firmware to load content from an SD Cart using FlashMe VS Using a passkey cart like Datel MAX Media Launcher or Passcard2?
<br/>
<br/>
Obvisouly its nice not having to have a cart in the DS slot, and seems flashme is faster loading. But are there and disadvantages of using FlashMe?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not if your DS develops a hardware defect within the first twelve months. If you want to add homebrew compatibility and the failsafe yet keep it easy to turn in your DS for warranty repair, use Stealth FlashMe.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

So I have downloaded 2 sets of files from 2 different places. 1 is from here, gbadev.org and it has 3 files, flashme, stealthflashme and noflashme. They are dated older than the file from gcdev.com and that file is dated later than the ones here. Which ones will work with my V5 DSL?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so really besides the risk of bricking, why wouldn't everyone use FlashMe? seems it has all the advantages and no disadvantages?
<br/>
<br/>
So if one were to FlashMe, I would just need to buy the cheapest PassMe2 device to complete the flashing right? so the PassKey 2 would work?
<br/>
<br/>
And what exactly is this "Stealth FlashMe"?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Stealth FlashMe means that the Health &amp; Safety warning screen is not removed. This way it's not easy to tell if you've got FlashMe installed or not. The normal version removes the thing for your convenience.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#84181 - Canadaka - Sat May 20, 2006 10:35 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ahh well i think i would like them remove, faster bootup right?
<br/>
<br/>
Why would someone want to leave them? someone could still tell if it was flashed by attempting to load the flashed menu, or by opening the back and seeing the stick removed right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I don't think Nintendo would notice or complain but tepples is right, with some bad luck it <span style="font-style: italic">might</span> be possible that it prevents you from getting your warranty repair. However, in that case you could probably just revert to the original firmware (or FM Stealth) before sending the DS in, considering it was still running. And if it wasn't, nobody would notice unusual bootup behavior anyway. :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
