Althought I have no idea how to do this :(
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone explain how to grab that demos and what tools I have to use. I would later host them on my Homepage for everyone.

Well...if you have the right hardware and that NDS card dumper, you may be able to find the wireless demo stored right on the NDS card.  I don't know that it's allowed to talk about that dumper here though (places to find it, etc), but if you do get an image of your NDS game using it, extract the files from it using the -x option and try searching for a trial.bin, or a *.srl (I've found that SRL is the more common extension, often *_sgn.srl or something like that), check the files with the -v -i command paramaters in NDStool to check and make sure it has a valid CRC and a valid WMB signature.   (one question though....why does Super Mario 64 DS show up as having a WMB signature, although an invalid one?)
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you want demos of unreleased games this is really kinda useless. lol  I suppose you have the possiblity of finding neat stuff though, like WMB stuff used for 1 Card NDS multiplayer and such.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
