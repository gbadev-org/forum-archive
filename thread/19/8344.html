    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Any body selling one for a decent price?  I bought both not too long ago for about the price that a lot of stores I see are selling just the supercard.  Where can I buy one at a decent price?  If anyone wants to upgrade to SD and sell me their CF, that can work too...  :)  Just PM me.
<br/>

I understand that this is not the place to sell, but it would seem very helpful to a lot of people if we had a sticky post where people could post the stores that are not ripping people off.  I know I've seen a post or two with a couple links, but it always takes a lot of searching to find this stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is a whole forum here for retailer feedback that you could check out for not getting ripped off. I just purchased a supercard cf from Jandaman's because I was reading the good reviews about it here and from various other sources.

<br/>
EDIT: Meaning I just recently ordered one a couple days ago and have yet to recieve it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Now back to a question for everyone: I've been looking through the stores in the store feedback forum, but I don't find anything close to the deal I got recently.  I bought a supercard CF and a superpass2 for 60 bucks shipped from a small US seller who is now out of stock.  Did I just get amazing deal or is it possible to get this price again?  Hopebuy seems to have this combination for 57 dollars, but the shipping is $29.  Thanks for your help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
