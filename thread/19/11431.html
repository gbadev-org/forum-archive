<br/>
<br/>
Do you know the white screen that flashes right before you get the Health &amp; Warning screen, the second you boot up? 
<br/>
<br/>
After flashing my Lite, I now see distorted traces of the last screen that showed right before shutting off the Lite.
<br/>
<br/>
So if I'm using pictochat, shut off my DS lite and boot it up again, I see traces of the pictochat screen right in that flash. The pattern of distortion is similar everytime it boots up, no matter what screen's traces it's showing...
<br/>
<br/>
What the hell is this?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I tried reflashing it with both the stealth and regular version, but it didn't change any of it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When I power down my Game Boy Color or Game Boy Advance, I get the same traces you speak of. It's just LCD pixels that haven't yet returned to their rest state. Perhaps the official firmware makes this less apparent by turning on the LCD before turning on the backlight, allowing the pixels to become fully white. Does it still happen if you boot without anything in the DS slot?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yep, it does.
<br/>
You seem to right too, as the pixels are white if I wait for a few minutes and th?n turn it on.
<br/>
<br/>
So: Is it damaging to my DS? 
<br/>
And also, why does it suddenly turn on the LCD later? It seems strange as no other flashed Lites seem to do it...
<br/>
<br/>
If it's harmless I can live with it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
It means I don't have to feel like a clumsy moron for doing it myself...

Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
