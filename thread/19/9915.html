    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">for some reason, somehow my mini-sd card used with my m3 has become corrupted in some way and windows won't recognise it as a disc drive at all (when i doubleclick the drive in my computer i get the Insert a disc message) I can't see the drive in disk management in the control panel either. Any suggestions what I can do? I don't mind wiping it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I experienced this when i ejected the minisd and added games during play. i have not fixed it yet. i'd like to know how too. I dismissed the problem as a cheap 30$ card (you get what you pay for).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, there may be something going on here with the M3. I had the same problem with my 2GB AiData miniSD. The data on the card has been erased 3 times. Now, it's completely unreadable by Windows, I am unable to format or even make it useable. I am exchanging it since it's still under 30 days. However, I am using a 1GB just to see if it corrupts, then it's a M3 problem, if not, it's more likely a media problem. Sucks, cuz I made some progress on WarioWare and Asphalt. :(<br/>_________________<br/>2 x Enamel Blue DS lites V5, V7 FW whatever

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I 'bricked' a SD card once (made it unreadable, and impossible to format, in any device or PC i tried it in). So it is definately possible. Now I try to be very careful, and not do anything like reformat or repartition them</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
