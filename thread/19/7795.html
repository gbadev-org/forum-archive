    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a hacked firmware to run homebrew unsigned code on the "new" DS using the build-in wifi-loader and the WMB app?
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of getting flash-cards, adaptors, etc it would be simpler to re-flash the DS bios with a firmware which allows to run unsigned code. 
<br/>
A little solder and PPFLASH seems ideal for that.
<br/>
<br/>
But, is there a "hacked" bios around ?
<br/>
<br/>
ps: i know i might brick the thing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No way to flash FlashMe bios directly with ppflash?
<br/>
I dont have a gba-flash card (!) It's kind of difficult to 
<br/>
get them here in switzerland at a decent price.

(80$ for the basic adaptor without CF-card !).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want to use only WMB to start programs on the DS, then you can't test your programs when you're away from your computer (e.g. on the bus), which defeats the entire portability aspect of the Nintendo DS. If you're going to be sitting next to your computer all the time, then you might as well just develop for SDL and OpenGL.
<br/>
<br/>
PPFlash + GBAMP <span style="font-style: italic">should</span> work for installing FlashMe if you've soldered a PS2 or Xbox modchip before, but I haven't yet read any success reports with this combination.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
