<br/>
<br/>
My question is, can you use the official Nintendo Wi-Fi USB connector to send homebrew DS apps and games to my DS?
<br/>
<br/>
If you can is there a link that explains how to do and what drivers i need or whatever.
<br/>
<br/>
If not there must be somthing i can do with the wifi adapter, i also have an ezfADVANCE gba flash card.
<br/>
<br/>
if anyone could get me started doing some cool stuff with my DS/official buffalo wifi adapter or even my flash cart it would be most appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, What are you asking Exactly? to be able to do WMB with the Official Wi-Fi USB Connector? or do Transfer Files to your cartidge with it?
<br/>
<br/>
both are possible but noone has attempted to create drivers for the device to do it, sgstair said he was thinking of working on a driver to WMB with it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,the answer is NO,at the moment the official USB is not compartible with any of the functions you want.
<br/>
<br/>
There is something that you can do with your USB and that is playing WFC games.
<br/>
<br/>
Since you already have a flash card,my opinion is just to buy a compartible Wifi card.They 're pretty cheap.
<br/>
<br/>
Then you will have 100% access to homebrew (or not).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If someone made a live CD with the right drivers (including Masscat's hacked version of the RT2570 driver) and the WMB host code itself, then yes, it'd work from a live CD.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not aware of anybody working on such a thing right now, though.  If someone wants it done they should do it.

k1n8ymbj: You waited an <span style="font-weight: bold">entire half day</span> for your answer.  And it's a question that has been asked so frequently by people who haven't taken the time to find the answer themselves that a lot of the people who have that knowledge have lost patience for answering it.  (But, hey, I was where you're at not that long ago, asking about similar things before I'd bothered to read about what went into the WiFiMe program and driver - so I can't condemn you too badly for asking or for not reading the extremely long, low signal-to-noise WiFiMe thread.  But only waiting a half-day before your passive-agressive rant about not getting any replies?  Not <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7993" target="_blank">searching</a> <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=5960" target="_blank">for</a> <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=5755" target="_blank">"USB Connector"</a> on the flash equipment forum?  Please...)<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC

I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.
<br/>
Thank you, everyone, I look forward to taking advantage of your work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
