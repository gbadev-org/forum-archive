    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
I've already e-mail the M3 people with this question, but they don't seem to be responding. They must be swamped with inquiries as it is...
<br/>
<br/>
In any event, I wish to partake of your illimitable knowledge in all things Dev... so, here goes:
<br/>
<br/>
Which SD cards do the M3 support? I'm planning on getting an A-DATA 2GB SD (150x speed), is it M3-support-worthy or not?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, does the gadget support Trancend, PQi, and other non-Sandisk brands?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance.<br/>_________________<br/>3 is not an "e",

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hold your horses! It hasn't even been released yet, so there is no way we could have tested compatibility without getting a prerelease version. From the sounds of it, that card it seems okay, but there might be restrictions on sizes that the M3 supports.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah you should hold off on that purchase if it's solely for the M3. At least wait until they send you some sort of response. Thats a chunk of change to drop on something that may not work out for ya in the end</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sure, and I'm sure they won't answer about compatibility, so wait for some feedback from users.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
