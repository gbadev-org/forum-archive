    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can anyone verify that the latest version of FlashME doesnt break anything as I am running on the original FlashME (the one that needed the hardcoded serial number in the firmware) but would like to update to the latest one that removes the health screen.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason I ask is I was wondering if the fact that the latest version no longers needs the serial might mean that everyone gets assigned the same serial number encoded into the firmware - meaning Nintendo could decide to just block that serial and lock out everyone using FlashME from being able to play legit games.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone in the know about this?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I flashed to the latest version of FlashMe (I was previously using the NeoFlash MagicKey) but it doesn't really add too much if you can already run homebrew code. The main reason I flashed was to remove the health screen, but this isn't totally accurate. It still displays a white screen (on both screens) for about as long as the health screen anyhow (but you dont have to touch it). This seems kinda pointless to remove one screen, only to replace it with 2 white screens. I think I'd rather see the official health screen with Nintendo's logo. 
<br/>
<br/>
The point being is that if the only reason you want to update is for the health screen removal (and everything else works otherwise) I would just hold off. Also, I think the newest version is the only one to all unsigned code off the wifi, so you may want that feature as well.

If your feeling brave tap the sl1 port and watch the flashing stop and start, stop and start. Its almost idiot proof as long as you dont loose power to your ds before it finishes!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Only up to the last sector in the eeprom's write protected region.  After that, the flashing will continue right to the end.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, as long as at least 2% is flashed, a power shutoff will not permenantly break the DS, as it can still be flashed using the emergency flashing bootloader present in the flashme,  and flashme forces 1% to be displayed after the very first sector in the eeprom is written.  The actual percentage flashed when the first 3 sectors (where the emergency bootloader resides) is flashed, is 0.3% in most DS systems.   For the iQue, and other DS systems using a 512Kbyte firmware eeprom, the actual percentage is 0.15%</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
