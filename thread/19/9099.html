    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok i think i have finnaly thought of something that will work :P.
<br/>
for those of you who have not followed me in what i have been trying to do,
<br/>
<br/>
i want to flash my ds...(title)
<br/>
and i have these,
<br/>
-a v4 fw ds
<br/>
-GBAMP v2
<br/>
-IBM 1GB microdrive
<br/>
-superpass 2
<br/>
-e-reader
<br/>
<br/>
and the problem i have is i need sram to run the new firmware pass through,
<br/>
which the gbamp does NOT have.
<br/>
<br/>
------------------------
<br/>
SO here is my NEW IDEA :P
<br/>
from what i understand,
<br/>
sram uses the same power and diffrent contacts (on the gba slot)
<br/>
so what if i connect the e-readers sram and power to the GBAMP's
<br/>
contacts,
<br/>
<br/>
can it use the e-readers sram,
<br/>
and use GBAMP's data?
<br/>
<br/>
if this is posible,
<br/>
then i will have finnaly found a solution to my cheap bugget :P
<br/>
<br/>
please someone dig me up a gba pinout chart :P
<br/>
and please give me your predictions on this idea :P
<br/>

But plugging an e-reader and a GBAMP into SLOT-2 simultaneously would need a T-connector that can direct SRAM reads to the e-reader and ROM reads to the GBAMP. It would be more expensive for an individual hobbyist to build such a T-connector than to buy a SuperCard.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

i have NO experince on c or any other programming laungage (besides php)
<br/>
<br/>
so if someone could Kindly make one for me,
<br/>
or show me how the sram code is created and the workings of it :P
<br/>
or just basicly give me 10 seconds to swap :P
<br/>
<br/>
this would be the solution too :P

I don't know how the wifi RSA check thing works exactly, but what happens when you upload a demo, then when you start downloading it, quickly switch to the wifi flashme thing</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
from what i understand,
<br/>
RSA goes back and forth from host to client to check file size and integrety,
<br/>
and if you say,
<br/>
sent the RSA's of another file,
<br/>
the ds would not execute the file sent.
<br/>
<br/>
and if im wrong,
<br/>
then that could be the solution :D

If its to do with filesize couldn't we fill the flashme with blank bits to fake the filesize...

it creates a RSA signiture of the file's contents and sends it to the ds,
<br/>
then the ds sends back a confirm code,
<br/>
<br/>
its well documented on a few ds hardware documention sites :D<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The idea behind RSA signing is that you take a hash of the file (MD5 or SHA1 or whatever method you want) and encrypt it using the private key. The result is included in the file's header. The DS decrypts the hash and only runs the program if it matches the file's actual hash. The idea is anybody can decrypt the hash, but this only means they can see if the file is corrupted; to do anything useful, they'd need to encrypt a new hash which can only be done with the private key, and only Nintendo has that. (I might have mixed up public/private key though. &gt;_&gt;) The only ways to get around this are:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Hack a signed demo so that it contains the FlashMe installer (or at least something that can run unsigned code), but still has the same hash as the original file. I'm not sure what hash method Nintendo uses, but unless it's something weak like CRC16, it'd be near impossible to generate any file that has the same hash, let alone one with the code you want in it.
<br/>
<br/>
2) Hack a signed demo, but only modify parts that aren't included in the hash calculation. This is what PassMe (1 and 2) and WifiMe do - the header contains the start address and isn't in the hash, so you can modify whatever you want there; it just points the start address to within the header and puts some code in an empty header field.
<br/>
<br/>
3) Find a hole in a signed demo; anywhere that it doesn't check buffer sizes or runs code without checking if it's signed. Run the demo unmodified, then send malformed packets to exploit this hole. So far nobody's found such a hole, and it's not likely because Nintendo knows people are looking for one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
