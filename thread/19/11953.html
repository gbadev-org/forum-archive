    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Check if any of the pins are bent, perhaps open the gbamp and put in the flash card?

<br/>
What happened to one of mine, I had it opened, but mustnt have put it back together properly and i beleive i may have shorted something (perhaps not pluging it into the ds correctly) and it never worked again.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I couldnt get the compact flash out to begin with. I had to give it a really nice push to get it in. I tried with pliers etc but nothing worked. Thankfully it finally came out. However whenever I try to get my compact flash card in there, its really hard, and makes a sorta clicking nosie then the ds wont even reconzie theres something in the gba slot wtf is up with this??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds like you might have actually been able to insert a CF card in upside down..  So the pins were fine, but the notches weren't.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thats possible, but the 1st few times i did it it worked, but now...it just wont work. I'm gonna look at the inside again, and maybe try inserting it in the other way, but i dont think thats it, but if it is I'm slapping myself in the face</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
