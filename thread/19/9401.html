Yeah, solder a short piece of wire across the fuse. As always, you are doing it at your own risk - a fuse is part of power protection circuitry.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
You got it.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason it works is that you are replacing the original fuse (which shorts out to protect the system) with piece of wire (which won't short out and may cause other parts to short out).
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if there is something software or hardware-wise to make it to not short out.  When Nintendo refurbishes systems, they have to be able to flash it somehow.  I wonder if there is some firmware call or a dipswitch that makes the DS to go into "low-power" flash mode, and won't pop the fuse when SL1 is shorted.  Sort like pat-your-head-and-rub-your-tummy-at-the-same-time sort of trick.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Permenently shorting out SL1 would be inadvisable, because it makes it always writable (brickers and whatever). Some people do this if they are playing around with the firmware a lot (like loopy).
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't know how to bridge two contact points with a piece of wire, are you sure you want to take a soldering iron near your DS?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, basically the fuse is too small for a lot of people to desolder and replace (i think it's about as long as this _ ), so you bridge it by a) soldering a piece of metal (wire, paperclip) over the top of the fuse, or b) you can just use solder.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm... couldn't you run a wire above the fuse, where its contacts are, while leaving the fuse intact?
<br/>
<br/>
That way, you could potentially not ever need to use a soldering iron (though you may still want to since we don't know how well it's stuck in).

Seriously, if you have to ask how to solder/what kind of wire to use, then it's highly likely that you will damage your shiny new DS while soldering.  It would be much easier/safer to get a PassMe2/NoPass instead of flashing your DS.  Then you don't have to worry at all.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I may be wrong here, but I believe a nopass is a device that runs homebrew without the use of a PassMe.
<br/>
There have been recent developments in DS homebrew equipment, allowing for passthrough devices the size of regular NDS game cards.
<br/>
<br/>
What is NoPass?:

The Max Media Launcher, for instance, is capable of this:

NeoFlash apparently has made a completely real DS homebrew card...:

PassCard2 / MML costs a bit more than a regular PassMe or PassKey, but a lot less than a new DS Lite.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

At this point, it's hard to tell since DSLite just came out.  Only Nintendo knows for certain.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Some DSLites have been flashed, other haven't.
<br/>
But hey, now that the Datel MAX Media Launcher is around, there shouldn't be a need to flash a DSLite (of course you didn't have to before, but PassMe2 seems a real PITA if you need to do a lot of testing).
<br/>
<br/>
There are a few theories as to why you can't flash them.
<br/>
From Magic firmware anti-flash protection to dodgy fuses to other contacts being shorted as well as SL1.
<br/>
<br/>
Fartz, seriously if you don't know how to solder a piece of wire (or blob solder) over the blown fuse, i doubt you will be able to do it.
<br/>
Just google some soldering tutorials and practice on some old busted stuff like answering machines (soldering and desoldering, stuff like that) before attempting something like a DS.
<br/>
<br/>
If your DSLite had started flashing before switching off, then there is likley no recovery code so you would have to PPFlash it, which involves more soldering (and the construction of a cable).
<br/>
<br/>
Try eBaying it. Many people look for easily repaired items on eBay, like this, that are up simply because the person who has them either doesn't have the skill or the time.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

Why on Earth do people ask for help then insult the people they are asking for help?  I never understand this. :)  No one is making you sell your DS Lite, you are doing that.

<br/>
You could just try flashing it.  Some people, it works fine, others have this problem of the fuse blowing.

Insulting and demanding for help hardly works. Also, writing in clear language helps - I find it taxing to read your posts because they're long and full of typos. 
<br/>
<br/>
What comes to the topic - when I'll get me a DS Lite I won't probably flash it right away, reading about all the various problems on these forums. Especially when there's still the old DS model to develop with and you can boot homebrew with PassMe2 without flashing the firmware. When DS Lite gets launched in the US (announcement on this expected to arrive on Thursday), and more people have DS Lite, there's going to be more information on this for sure.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wasn't going to say anything, but I can't resist. You need to understand something:
<br/>
<br/>
1. DSLite is very new.  It's likely very few of us have one yet.  And even more likely that we have not seen this turn-off-while-flashing problem wiht our own eyes.  I can't speak for other people, but the information I shared with you are 2nd hand information I read else where on the internet.  This is why I can not tell you exact what wire to use, which fuse to repair because I have not done the repairs myself.
<br/>
<br/>
2. I don't know what your goal is, and why you *MUST* flash your DS.  If you want to run home-brew, people have already given you other solutions without flashing/modifying your DS.  If you feel confident about your soldering skill (then you should be skillful enough to pick the right tools/solder/wire), feel free to solder away.  We were just tring to save you from ending up with a $200 brick.
<br/>
<br/>
3. If our answers aren't good enough for you, feel free to go find answers you like somewhere else.  Stop insulting the people who tried their best to help you.  This is an internet forum, people who really don't care about your questions won't even read/post in your thread.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
No, not all DS lite units are affected. You can determine if your own DS lite unit is affected by shorting SL1 in a program that does not try to write to the firmware, such as DesktopMan's Tetris 1.1 from ndshb.com.

Not many people who read forum.gbadev.org are likely to have "recently bought a DS lite" because not many people who read forum.gbadev.org live in Japan, the only market where the DS lite is sold in stores.

The solution is to use your soldering skills and bridge the fuse. Check both F1 and F2 with a multimeter, identify the blown one and bridge it.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

<br/>
You just have to shorten it the right way without touching something to the left or right of it.
<br/>
Use something with a flat tip e.g. a bit or the head of a small nail.
<br/>
Peep through the hole an Take a look at the sl1.
<br/>
Try to find something which has nearly the same diameter as the hole and a flat tip.

<br/>
<br/>
I've got a similar problem to this.  I haven't been poking around enough here, so i didnt realize there was a potential problem with flashme &amp; dslite.  I just got one yesterday, and used m3/passkey2 with it.   When i tried to use flashme, it turned itself off after it reached ~47% complete.  Now only the indicator lights will turn on, the screen stay off.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this because that fuse is blown?  Or is it because I screwed up the firmware?
<br/>
<br/>
Will it most likely turn on again if i bridge that fuse?
<br/>
<br/>
Is the firmware likely recoverable if i made it to 47%?
<br/>
<br/>
I think I can do the soldering okay, but I'd rather not open it up and make it obvious that i've violated warranty, if its not likely to be fixable this way...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I had a good solid connection initially, but then it stopped working so i was wiggling a bit. before i read this thread i had initially thought I had accidently hit the off switch. :)

<br/>
I was reading all there stuff about flashme and DS Lite and i think i got the sollution. Lets go back to electronic bases. If a fuse is broken is because there was too much current throught it. But what reduce current, a resistor. Current=Voltage/Resistor. What if we put a resistor between the SL1 contact? Or better, try to know what is the max current the fuse can take(guess its hard) and mesure the voltage between SL1 and then, put a resistor at the good Ohm value. Put a 10KOhm and try to flash the DS Lite, or use the tetris stuff just to test the SL1, if it disnt work, reduce the Ohm value until u can flash you're DS at 100%. I dont know, im proposing stuffs but i think it could work because electronic is applicable too in a DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There are multiple reports from people with new DS Lites that their Lites have shut off when attempting to flashme them - apparently they've all shut down at 1% so they're completely unrecoverable. <span style="font-weight: bold">This seems to be happening with 'third wave' Lites (Nintendo sent out a massive shipment of Lites at the end of March, here in Japan) although launch day Lites like mine don't seem to have any problems at all.</span> There are also unconfirmed reports that the ppflash procedure will NOT work with the Lites due to a different pinout - I'm not sure about this one, but I suppose it's worth mentioning.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, I got my ds lite flashed, and its working great now!  Yay!!!!
<br/>
<br/>
First of all, thanks to all of you for you suggestions and help!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I did learn two things when I finally got it to work, that I hope can be helpful to others flashing their ds lite:
<br/>
<br/>
1)  Once the recovery firmware successfully loaded onto your ds, and it gets turned off for whatever reason (probably #2),  you need to take out your pass me.  The recovery fw won't work with it (or anything probably) plugged into the ds slot.  Once I took that out and tried it, the recovery fw worked fine.
<br/>
<br/>
2)  I believe there is some component within the sl1 hole which is very easy to touch and short out in at least this version of the ds lite (I got mine around May 1, from lik sang, its navy blue).  It seems signficiantly easier to short that than it is to short sl1.  Whenever that happens the nds turns off.  I can easily understand why people are having this happen to them when they have only gotten to 1%.  I consider myself very lucky to have gotten to 47% the first time.  It literally took me 15-20 tries before I got up to 100%, just to get the correct orientation &amp; size of the tool in the hole, to get sl1 shorted, while not making the ds turn off.
<br/>
<br/>
This seems to be pretty dangerous for flashme and the dslite, although not really a problem unless you are trying to flash firmware.  Probably there is a good workaround for this.  (Perhaps putting something insulating on the right side of the whole before putting in whatever you use to short sl1?) It probably would be a big help to figure this out exactly and put a note about it in the flashme docs.

It sounded to me like he just meant to use a resistor to short SL1, so that not so much power goes through; enough to disable the protection but not enough to blow the fuse.

The fuse is not blowing because of to much current, it is going down because of people touching components that are placed near the SL1.

Therefore shorting the SL1 with a resistor or anything else will have no effect at all.
<br/>
If you want a save method using soldering techniques just solder SL1, that will work.
<br/>
But keep in mind that having SL1 shorted all the time means less security for you bios.
<br/>
Desolder it instead, after flashing.<br/>_________________<br/>Marine, we need you to head to the depths of the compound to rescue a scientist that is being held hostage by Satan and his manyfold minions.

It depends on what Nintendo considers "fixed". Perhaps Nintendo marketing considers powering off when SL1 is shorted to be "fixed" because it deters pirates, at least until NoPass becomes widely available.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it's not really a big deal if you know about it;  like fartz said, you just need to put a little roll of paper around the sides of the sl1 hole.  This really needs to be added to the flashme install walkthrough.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
