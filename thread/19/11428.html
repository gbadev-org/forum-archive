    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I'm looking to play emulators and whatnot on my DS. I also want to watch Flash Movies (like <a class="postlink" href="http://www.homestarrunner.com" target="_blank"> Homestar Runner</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://xnctoon.co.nr" target="_blank">Experiments and Crap</a>)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for a method that's cheap and minimally intrusive (won't entirely funk up my DS).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, for the Flash Movies, you'll Prob. have to convert them using a Program like Amor SWF to AVI, that's what I do, and if you have Moonshell, for whatever flashcart you are using, get a Program called Batch DPG, as for emulators, there are a bunch of sites, for homebrew stuff, and lots of emulators, Go here &gt; <a href="http://dl.qj.net/index.php?&amp;catid=221&amp;p10=4" target="_blank">http://dl.qj.net/index.php?&amp;catid=221&amp;p10=4</a> This is a good site for Homebrew Roms, and there are also emulators, and I think it tells you how to use them, too....

Cheapest NoPass card is probably MAX Media Launcher made by Datel, sold on Datel's own site (<a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9746" target="_blank">link and feedback</a>). Cheapest CF card is whatever you can find on price comparison sites or auction sites. There is only one product called GBA Movie Player v2 (CF version), made by MovieAdvance, and you can find them for $25 including shipping on a popular auction site.

NoPass looks like a DS Game Card and is inserted into the DS slot just like a DS Game Card. You don't need to open your DS battery case and jam a pair of paperclips into a hole unless you want to make the DS capable of running homebrew even when the NoPass is not inserted.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

That's the one question to which we're not allowed to give a straight answer, unfortunately. Please read <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9484" target="_blank">the rules</a>. You are expected to visit the Retailer Feedback forum and compile a list of stores that sell each product yourself. Granted, this is duplication of effort, but SimonB, the administrator of forum.gbadev.org, appears to like it that way. I can tell you that auction sites are the best to get a GBA Movie Player, and office supply stores are decent to get CompactFlash memory card and a CompactFlash (or multi-format) writer.

Once you can run homebrew, you can flash your DS with a set of precision screwdrivers, a roll of cellophane tape, and two metal paperclips.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Seriously, I got a $11 one from newegg which reads like a gazillion formats, is compatible with linux, and has an extra usb port on front. if you want to only get a single-format reader, they can be had for uber cheap.
<br/>
<br/>
also, not sure if you know how ebay works, but just because the price is $3.75 now, that doesn't mean you will get it for that much.

<br/>
Or so they claim. They like to count a single format multiple times: <ul><li>CompactFlash is often listed twice: CF I, the thinner form factor used for flash memory, and CF II, the thicker form factor used for CF hard drives. Sometimes CF II is listed as both CF II and Microdrive. </li><li>SmartMedia is listed thrice: SM 3 V, SM 5 V, and xD-Picture Card. </li><li>Secure Digital is listed at least four times: MMC, RS-MMC, SD, miniSD, and (if they're sneaky) both TransFlash and microSD. </li><li>Memory Stick can be listed four or more times: Memory Stick, Memory Stick Duo (shorter version of same), Memory Stick PRO (Memory Stick larger than 128 MB), and Memory Stick PRO Duo. </li></ul>
<br/>
Getting one that can write both CF and SD is useful if you plan on using more than one kind of adapter. Getting one that can also write SmartMedia or xD Picture Card is useful if you have an older camera that uses it. Getting one that can also write Memory Stick is useful if you have a PSP.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The CF adapter you choose will affect the price and compatibility. A GBAMP, for example, is really cheap but doesn't run big old homebrew (since it lacks ram). A SuperCard CF runs most homebrew I think, and it's probably one of the best solution if you don't care about huge things sticking out of your DS.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
People who have been on this forum for a few years should remember my GSM Player software for GBA, which played up to 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of music encoded at 30 kbps from a 256 Mbit (32 MB) GBA flash card. The 64 MB of your card is twice this. In addition, MoonShell uses the DS's additional CPU power to decode Vorbis, which is stronger at a given bitrate than the codec that GSM Player used. Bitrates down to even 40 kbps are still listenable in the noisy environments typical of handheld use.
