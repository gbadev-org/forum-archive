Another question, does CF not have any problems with anything then?  Thanks for your help.

I know your pain, though, I bought a 1GB SD card (back when they cost way more than they do now) thinking I could use it, but I was wrong. Lucky I didn't buy any SD device. Though if I can, I might buy one anyway later. :-p (And the SD card goes very nice with my camera.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Although the "prosumer" models are more likely to use CF.

I've read that Wii can also use USB drives, and I happen to have an <a class="postlink" href="http://www.xbitlabs.com/images/memory/16-cflash-roundup/san.jpg" target="_blank">adapter</a> that turns CF, SD, SmartMedia, and even Memory Stick (PSP memory cards) into a USB drive. Don't most DS developers on this forum have something like that?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A wild guess: the M3SD troutines should work with GBAMP SD, if the register addressed are changed in the same way as the M3 CF Addresses changed.
<br/>
<br/>
Someone with a gbamp-sd should create a new driver for it. (First without caring about booting)
<br/>
<br/>
The second step should be trivial, as it should just need to compile the firmware again with the sector access functions replaced.
<br/>
<br/>
After that you'd be set.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
