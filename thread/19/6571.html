    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
Sorry if this has been asked before (just scorn me and post a link) but I was wondering a couple of things.
<br/>
<br/>
1) Can I host any .nds file (under 4MB) to download via WifiMe. (That is, use it without a GBA cart).
<br/>
<br/>
2) Can some one develop a program (preferably in java) that makes a photo-gallery program for the DS. Users should be able to feed in pictures and the program should generate a .nds file for hosting. 
<br/>
(Similar to the E3 downloadable content - LOZ gallery) (Files should be able to be distributed via WifiMe)
<br/>
<br/>
3) Can some one develop a program (preferably in java) that makes a simple video player for the DS. (similar to the E3 downloadable content - LOZ trailer) (Files should be able to be distributed via WifiMe, and this means the whole .nds file needs to &lt; 4MB)
<br/>
<br/>
4) Can WifiMe host multiple files at one time?
<br/>
<br/>
The reason I ask this is that it occurs to me that you could use the DS to advertise to kids (and even kids at heart) at fairs, trade shows etc etc.
<br/>
I volunteer for a not-for-profit TV start up, and this could be a great way to reach out to younger people. I'm personally thinking of a loading up our trailers on the GBA movie advance and playing them at our next outing (Assuming I can secure it in place so no one walks away with my beloved DS).
<br/>
<br/>
It also could be great for spreading word of mouth (kids might start talking about this), as well letting people interact with content/advertisements in a manner they don?t normally get to do at fairs/trade shows. 
<br/>
<br/>
As far as who wants to do these tasks and not donate their time (I can see this taking sometime to do) I would be willing personally to throw $20 or so on a bounty to get the ball rolling. That said this could look great on a resume.
<br/>

You will need a GBA flash cart at least once.
<br/>
<br/>
WifiMe is an application that runs code from a GBA cart.  It's an alternative to buying a PassMe, you still need a GBA flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
What you are talking about is not WifiMe, it's Firefly's Wireless Multiboot application.  It will only run homebrew software if you <a class="postlink" href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware" target="_blank">patch your DS firmware</a> and you need a GBA flash cart to do that.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Sat Aug 13, 2005 3:56 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay,
<br/>
I'm confused...
<br/>
Doesn't WifiMe host a file (that works as virtual PassMe)?
<br/>
Couldn't you replace that file with another?<br/>_________________<br/>CFTV - <a href="http://www.SouthshoreBroadcastingInc.ca" target="_blank">www.SouthshoreBroadcastingInc.ca</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">WMB Application is the program used to host files.
<br/>
<br/>
WifiMe is the application that works like a passme.  WifiMe and signed official nintendo demos are the only apps that will work on a standard DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Unsigned applications will be displayed on the download play menu but they won't work without a modified firmware.  WifiMe doesn't need to be signed because you can tell the DS to load code from a GBA cart without needing a valid signature.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Sat Aug 13, 2005 6:05 pm; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay,
<br/>
So what your saying is that there is no way disptribute home brew to the mass market, (the average DS owner) (atleast at this point)
<br/>
<br/>
Now, if a browser goes main stream (the way the PSP 2.0 is about to) then I might be able to figure something out...
<br/>
<br/>
(perhaps host a html page intended for the DS)
<br/>
<br/>
Now, the other option is to mod a couple of DS's and homebrew my own 'toys' and just secure them and hope no one keys the bottom screen like you see at walmart.
<br/>
<br/>
But if i'm going that rout...
<br/>
it'd be easier to set up a kiosk with standard PC's...
<br/>
<br/>
I just think the PSP and the DS give real exiciting possibillities, but unless someone hacks the certifaction, I can't really do what I want...<br/>_________________<br/>CFTV - <a href="http://www.SouthshoreBroadcastingInc.ca" target="_blank">www.SouthshoreBroadcastingInc.ca</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">NOTE:
<br/>
these files (http://www.akkit.org/DS/E3/) can be used without moding a DS...
<br/>
However, these are Nintendos own files...<br/>_________________<br/>CFTV - <a href="http://www.SouthshoreBroadcastingInc.ca" target="_blank">www.SouthshoreBroadcastingInc.ca</a>
