    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I was considering getting a new DS. I'm currently an owner of a GBAMP and I have FlashME'd my current DS, but I'm curious - 
<br/>
Since the PassME 2 requires SRAM to work, would I be able to use my GBAMP if I FlashME'd my new DS? I have a GBA flash cart to FlashME it, but after it's flashed, could I continue to use my GBAMP to run homebrew?
<br/>
<br/>
In short, if I use a GBA flash cart to FlashME a new-firmware DS, can I then use my GBAMP on it, after it's FlashME'd?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes.  Once you have installed FlashMe it will function just like your older DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
