    <h4>#147747 - another world - Thu Dec 27, 2007 5:44 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My flash kits:
<br/>
R4 w/Kernel v1.14
<br/>
m3 lite w/updagcsd.e35
<br/>
<br/>
My DS:
<br/>
DS Lite: not Flashed
<br/>
<br/>
I read that since the 1.08 R4 Kernel you could use the menu option to boot slot 2, and then run .gba backup/homebrew. However, when I try this everything attempts to load as .nds. 
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to do one of the following.
<br/>
1) boot .gba from the R4 'boot slot2' menu option?
<br/>
2) bypass the R4 auto load, and thus use the NDS menu to boot my slot 2 as normal?
<br/>
<br/>
It's a bit annoying to have to pop out the R4 each time I boot my nds when I want to play with a slot2 app. I would love any help on this, and greatly appreciate any info or links. I'm looking to solve this issue (if possible) without flashing my DSL.
<br/>
<br/>
Also in conclusion I would like to add that I can boot my F2A 128MB GBA cart from the R4 "boot slot2" option with no issues. All the backup files load and play fine, including a build of pocketnes.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you've been able to boot slot2 cards from the R4 since it came out I think
<br/>
<br/>
it's not a recent addition
<br/>
<br/>
Definitely since 1.05 for sure
<br/>
<br/>
basically, from the R4 you hit the "boot slot2" button
<br/>
<br/>
that then will launch your M3 lite 
<br/>
it'll probably start in NDS mode
<br/>
<br/>
hit start, and it'll reload itself into GBA mode
<br/>
<br/>
and no, you can't bypass the R4 menu at all.  it's just how the r4 works</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">there's also an .nds file floating around this forum, somewhereabouts, that will pass to slot-2 in GBA mode. 
<br/>
<br/>
chances are it'll take as many button-pushes as tikker's method. either way.<br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
