    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When I make the DS sleep by closing the lid (after playing AW:DS for a while) the screen flickers. When I open it back up, it's turned off. o_o
<br/>
<br/>
I found out that it happens because there's a GBA flash cart in the DS. AW:DS looks for Advance Wars 1 and 2 (it unlocks new maps if you have them in the DS)
<br/>
<br/>
I just thought of something. Couldn't this allow for a way to run code from the GBA flash cart <span style="font-style: italic">without</span> a *Me? You could put DS code in the GBA cart (like we've been doing) but 'somehow' make AW:DS (or any other game that reads data from the GBA slot.) boot code from the cart after it reads? I doubt it, but it'd be neat.
<br/>
<br/>
This would be great. I already have a Passme, but it'd be better not to have it sticking out all the time. No, I can't use FlashMe. I've tried flashing the firmware, but it never goes past 0% :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

from what i understand, you can't 'somehow' make it boot from the gba cart because you cant 'somehow' modify the DS code, unless of course you had it go through another device, which is the whole point of the passme</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not to sound mean or anything, but that's most likely your fault. You just have to find something the right shape &amp; size to fit in the little hole.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I doubt the check that is done is much different from the check used in the DS firmware to determine whether a DS rumble or option pack is inserted in the GBA slot, so it's just as secure against attack in that way as the DS firmware is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
