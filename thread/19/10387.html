    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, sorry if this has been asked before, I couldn't find a thread that actually compared these two though.
<br/>
<br/>
I have an (Australian) DS lite, and an M3 Mini SD.
<br/>
Now I'd love to get some homebrew working, but I need some passthingy device to do that. I've read some people saying Flashing the DS is the best option, but I wonder: is it still really that much better?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've read reviews on both the Max Media Launcher as the Passcard 3 on maxconsole.net, and in neither reviews a negative issue can be raised. Not even the "shortened battery life" one. Is that still an issue with these new generation cards? 
<br/>
<br/>
So, my questions:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Which should I buy, the MML or the Passcard 3? The only difference I know off, is that the MML supposedly doesn't support sleep mode. It's a lot cheaper though, and I can get it in a few days, unlike the Passcard 3 which I'd have to import. Any other significant differences?
<br/>
<br/>
2. And: Is flashing it still better? Is battery life shortened by hours, or mere minutes, with the new gen passthingy devices? Any other downsides to using passthingy devices instead of flashing it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sleep Mode is only broken on commerical games/official demos.
<br/>
<br/>
Man Media Launcher is cheaper, I'd go for that.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>dualscreenman wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">What about Gaim DS?

Thanks for your reply.
<br/>
<br/>
Can I, however, derive from your answer that between a flashed DS, and a non-flashed DS with a nopass device, the latter uses more power?
<br/>
<br/>
If I can, are we talking hours or minutes here? The M3 mini SD sucks up quite a bit of energy by itself, so If I snoop off another hour using a nopass device, it might actually be worth it to flash the DS</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
What I mean in my reply though, is that a flashed DS doesn't normally use a gamecard or anything. So if a gamecard and a nopass card don't differ in energy-use, how do these two compare to not using a DS cartridge at all.
<br/>
<br/>
So is:
<br/>
<br/>
[DS Lite + M3 Mini SD + Nopass/gamecard] using more energy than 
<br/>
[Flashed DS Lite + M3 Mini SD]
<br/>
<br/>
And if so, a LOT more, or just an insignificant amount more?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i know on supercard you can eject the pass device after it had booted into the menu, and i seems that it consumes less electricity than a pass1 or 2
<br/>
<br/>
also, MML can be fixed so it also works in sleepmode by connecting pin 1 and pin 7</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
How do I connect pin 1 and 7 though?
<br/>
Technically, I mean? I can't connect it using paperclips or whatever, it wouldn't fit in the slot anymore...
<br/>
<br/>
Or am I totally off here...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
