    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Recently I have bought a Max media Dock. I inserted a Segate 4.0GB microdrive . I plug it to my USB port and it sees teh drive and when i try to access it , my computer says " insert disk" . However when i plug it to my NDS it works ok accept for it being slow . I open it up and did a litle investigation and realise that when connected to the USB connect the power supply to the CF is only 3.3 v and it only supply 200mA of current to the CF . This is fine for Flash CF card but definitely no enough for micordrive who need 300mA for read and write. So i figure that if I could route a 5V tp the CF power pin i could generate a 300mA current which should get teh mircordrive to work . I will do some experiment on how it could be done . If sucessful i will post it in the forum.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A conforming CF device always works with 3.3 V and 5.0 V, but some devices may need more current (generally 50% more) at the lower voltage. For instance, if 5.0 V and 0.300 A works, then 3.3 V and 0.450 A should also work, as either way gives 1.5 W.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have check the spec of most micoirdirve it seems that it require 300mA to read and write . but only 200mA to when in idle mode . The datel unfortuantely only produce 200mA. But thwne connected to the NDS the NDS provide the 300mA that the allows the mircodrive function fine .</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Any HDD other than the one included with the Max Media Player cannot have files copied to it from the computer through the Max Media Dock. You have to use a different piece of hardware to write the files to the HDD and then run it on the MMD as you normally would. I found this out when I tested it with my Ipod mini HDD. I just had to copy the files to the disk using the Ipod and then plug it into the Max Media Dock.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
