    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I searched a lot through this forum, but I can't find the solution. :-(
<br/>
<br/>
I have a NDS lite unflashed, a Superkey and a Supercard miniSD. Now I want to start homebrew made for NDS. To do this I need to start the nds.gba file from the Supercard menu in DS mode (with a Supercard screen on the lower screen and a file menu on the upper screen).
<br/>
I've seen this (by chance). So I hope my Superkey is working properly...
<br/>
<br/>
The Supercard firmware is 1.83 (newest).
<br/>
<br/>
Which button combo do I have to press at which state to get into the DS mode menu?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you have the Superkey in you shouldn't have to do anything. :/ It should boot straight to DS mode (no pause at health warning--I can't even get the firmware menu).
<br/>
<br/>
Oddly I have a Passcard 3 that refuses to pass the boot screen. It locks up midway, as if you yanked the card, so apparently duds are not unheard of... Was very frustrating.
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes even my Superkey fails on a power cycle, and I get the GBA menu. Otherwise it works fine. Sure makes me consider flashing, though. x_o</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Pop the superkey in and out a few times.  Check the contacts on the card for marks.  This will at least let you know if the card is making good contact.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I believe you need to rename them to .nds otherwise doesn't it try to boot into GBA mode?  I thought that was the reason for .sc.nds, which is just a .ds.gba renamed .sc.nds because supercards want's .ds.gba format, but boots into .gba mode when you select a file with a .gba ending.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right, if the file ends in .gba it will try to boot it in GBA mode even if it's a DS binary.  Rename the files to end in .nds, and like Cydrak said, the Superkey should automatically boot it into DS mode a second after you power on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The problem appears to be a problem with the wires. If I place a small sheet of paper at the back of the card it works as it should. :-/
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!
