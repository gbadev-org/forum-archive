How are you sure, and what are you sure about (your card? all cards?)? It's clear that some SurecomEP-9321-g cards DO NOT have the RT2560 chipset.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's a couple. One easy way is to grab either a) the driver on the CD that came with it, or b) the installed driver that works with it installed as a network card. Copy the rt2560.inf file and send its contents to me by PM or email and I will check it.
<br/>
<br/>
Another way is to install PciTree, run it, find the listing for your network card, and tell me what it says for VID and DID. If it doesn't look something like this:
<br/>
VID: x1814 Ralink Technology Crop
<br/>
DID: x0201
<br/>
...then it's probably not RT2560. The numbers are the important part.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's easy too except when the cards have a metal plate or sticker covering the actual chipset.

Looking back at your original post, I think you're problem might be that the hacked driver might not be getting installed because WinXP LOVES to just install what it thinks is better (rather than what you tell it to install). Between that, and the fact that you can SEE rt2560 on the physical card, makes me think that THIS is the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
After you attempt to install the hacked driver, what does your Device Manager show? If there is no Nintendo DS - 802.11 entry, then you've found your real problem.
<br/>
<br/>
If that's the case, to make sure that you install your driver of choice, follow the instructions from my <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=23&amp;Itemid=31" target="_blank">WiFi Guide</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try the other PCI slots. If that still doesn't work, remove any unnecessary PCI cards temporarilly. Error code 31 is said to happen when a device is dependent on another device to work.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Did you try MOVING it to other PCI slots? That most frequently fixes problems like this.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, once you get it to show under Nintendo DS - 802.11, DO NOT update it. It sounds like Windows installed the manufacturer driver again if it is showing as rt2500 pci lan card under network adapters. When you do Update Driver, you need to make sure you are selecting Have Disk and pointing to folder that contains only the 1.0.0.8 driver. Once the device shows up under the Nintendo DS - 802.11 subtree, leave the driver as it is and see how it works. Also, take a screenshot of it if there's any problem and post a link or send it to me.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
