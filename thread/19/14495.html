    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am looking for a new card that has microSDHC support, a clean menu and os, autoloading (like r4), and perhaps cheat support.
<br/>
<br/>
I currently have an M3S, but would really like to have microSDHC support. I don't want to give up any of the great features I currently have, and also don't want to spend too much on a new card. I am open as well to the option of a slot-2 device with pass/flash-me.
<br/>
Any good ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The only devices I know of with SDHC support are the CycloDS Evolution, Supercard DS, and DS Link.  It's possible that the R4 and M3 Simply will get SDHC support in a firmware update, but it's also possible that it will require new hardware.  The DS Link added support in a firmware update while the Supercard DS came out with new hardware to support it, so it could go either way with the R4/M3 Simply.

<br/>
No slot-2 device has SDHC support though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm pretty sure Acekard supports it too. IIRC their website says the max card size is 2GB, which would require SDHC.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, 2GB is the largest that non SDHC can go.  In terms of homebrew, I'd recommend Cyclods Evo as their DLDI is more robust than that of many other manufacturers.  They actually support and update it.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

Seriously guys, how hard is it to simply TRY something yourself?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hmmm....
<br/>
I've looked around some more and it looks like the two best options are the M3DS Real and the CycloDS Evolution...
<br/>
The main thing I don't like about the cyclods evo is that it doesn't support the autoloading that the r4 and m3 simply have. Does anyone know if the M3DS Real does that?<br/>_________________<br/>:/ what're you lookin' at?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
i  recently shelled out for a normal 2GB microsd even though i have a SDHC compatible cart, because the 4GBs i've seen are too expensive.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hrm. i see. the microsdhc 4GB cards i saw were about $50....
<br/>
although... that doesn't seem that more expensive than current flash drives...
<br/>
on the other topic, i thought that there were slot-2 microsdhc devices. i remember reading somewhere about a device that had a firmware update to support sdhc :/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
