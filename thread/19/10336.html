    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all, I would like to say hello to everyone on these forums.  I've been watching this site for some time now and finally I have the need to post.
<br/>
<br/>
I have an X-Rom 512mbit that I've had for well over a year now.  I've been using it with my DS which is the first revision (bought it the week it came out).
<br/>
<br/>
I want to flash my DS because I just recently switched from GBA developement to DS development.  If I buy a Max Media Launcher and use that to run the flashme program on the X-Rom card, can I flash my DS like that.  Then afterwards will I be able to run homebrew programs from the X-Rom card.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, I just want to be sure to not waste my money.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, once you flash your DS with the flashme file, you wont need to use the max media launcher for homebrew. After that you could probally just sell it to someone.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's no point into buying the MML if theres a cheaper nopass device. If there's a cheaper one, buy it. It's the same thing with the passme or if you need the passme2</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah I just looked more into the original PassMe and I think I'm going to get that instead.  I guess its only the PassMe2 that you have to choose the game and all that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, if you can, you should opt for the first PassMe. When I first got into homebrew, we didn't know how we could firmware version our DS's, so I ended up getting a PassMe2. The PassMe2 wasn't really that complicated, it was my piece of crap GBA flashcart software.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>dualscreenman wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">What about Gaim DS?
