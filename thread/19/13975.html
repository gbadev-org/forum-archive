    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, i finally got around to doing the FlashMe on my DS Lite, so i no longer need the passthrough card.
<br/>
<br/>
However, It now loads, and about half a second after turning on the Top screen goes very dim and starts to flicker.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried undoing the flash. same results. different version. same again.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it the firmware? or a fuse that is semi broken?
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
If need be, i can make a video and pop it up.
<br/>
<br/>
(Bottom screen is fine.)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well it sounds like it was purely co-incidence that it happened when you flashed your DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
As you've put back the original firmware it make's little sense that it's flashme's fault. Purhaps try and get it replaced by Warrenty, if it's still valid?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If they open it, its got a few scratches on the flash points.
<br/>
<br/>
i doubt EB's return policy would work, and anywhere else would probably check.
<br/>
<br/>
ahh well. ill try doing the fuses and hope one of them is on the way out.

Well, then I bid you good luck. Nothing else you can do to help really. 
<br/>
<br/>
Purhaps you could check the ribbons aren't getting loose, on my old DS phat the touch screen ribbon used to always come out randomly..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If by "about a year" you mean "less than 12 months," I'd recommend returning it to Nintendo.
<br/>
<br/>
It's incredibly unlikely that they would check to see if there's scratches on the SL1 contact--or that they'd refuse to replace it even if they did.  I mean, *MAYBE* if the system was bricked, but with a defective backlight?  Why would they even check?
<br/>
<br/>
People have actually returned bricked DSes or FlashMe'd DSes that had other defects and gotten replacements with no problems.  I think you have nothing to worry about.
