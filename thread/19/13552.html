    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering about the G6 Slot-2 for a Slot-2 device.
<br/>
1) It says no patching is required for GBA, is that true?
<br/>
2) Can I use it as RAM for DSLinux?
<br/>
3) Is it any good in general?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd stay way from it.  I've had to format it so many times to get away from the error screens it isn't even funny.. I've tried updating the firmware using the "old" method but it doesn't seem to want to take.  It's more trouble then it is worth, that is for sure.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1) I think so.
<br/>
2) Sure
<br/>
3) It makes its job without big problems but for some peoples 512Mo of flash is not enough.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the responses.  I'm ok with multiple formatting, I do it regularly with my M3 Simply.  512MB will be more than enough for me, I just have some GBA stuff and would like to run emulators on my GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
