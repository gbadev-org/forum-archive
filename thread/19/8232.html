<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded the Gigabyte GN-WPKG driver and utility pack for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition from the official site and installed it. But I can't switch into AP mode, I am only able to use the "normal" configuration to connect to an Access Point, but not to act as one.
<br/>
<br/>
Someone knows why the x64 version doesn't support acting as Access Point? And maybe a solution for that?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Ilomoga<br/>_________________<br/>The future of gaming is mobile Handheld Gaming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
