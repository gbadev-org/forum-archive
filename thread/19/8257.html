    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys; I have a DS I got a couple months ago, from a guy that never used it. I'm pretty sure it's the first release (US, if that means anything). I know there is a way to tell what firmware it has installed, but I couldn't find a sticky or any threads that actually explain all of the possibilites. All I know is that I go into pictochat and pull the DS cartridge, which in my case just freezes the system without changing to any kind of color.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I've been looking at the wireless devices <a class="postlink" href="http://ralink.rapla.net" target="_blank">list</a>, and I'm not certain which one to pick up. I'd prefer USB, but PCMCIA would work fine as well, since I have a laptop. None of the cards listed in these catagories are immediately recognizable to me; I don't have a lot of income (I'm surviving off student loan disbursements while I'm in college), so I'd like to avoid any unnecessary mistakes in deciding what to buy. Any suggestions on which of these to pick up would be greatly appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'll probably need a flash cart of some sort. I've used an EZFlash one before, on a GBA SP, so I'm somewhat familiar with using them, but that was a long time ago and I don't know much about the new stuff. I'm primarily interested in a high capacity solution, so I don't have to worry as much about what room I have to work in (I'm a .NET programmer, after all :D). I plan on doing quite a bit of coding on this thing (In C, most likely, since .NET isn't feasable here...yet). Oh, and I'd prefer if it wasn't bulky or stuck out; I only have so much room in my backpack :).
<br/>
<br/>
As for software, I grabbed DevKitPro and the rest of the stuff listed <a class="postlink" href="http://www.double.co.nz/nintendo_ds/nds_develop1.html" target="_blank">here</a>, which includes WifiMe (a bunch of bin files?), rt2560 driver 1.008, and the Nintendo DS rt2560 WMB 1.4 beta 1 stuff, which I also don't know how to use. Guess I get to do some reading about that once I get the proper wireless card.
<br/>
<br/>
So, for the lazy readers:
<br/>
<br/>
1. I Have an Old DS.
<br/>
2. Need to know how to check firmware version.
<br/>
3. Need a USB or PCMCIA wireless card.
<br/>
4. Need a flash cart of some sort for media and coding.
<br/>
5. I have DevKitPro/WifiMe/rt2560 driver set.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. Yes.
<br/>
2. You've already performed the Pictochat test. DS freezing means you've FW1 installed.
<br/>
3. USB won't work - take a PCMCIA card. There are plenty of cheap ones out there. Print the list on a paper and go to the nearest PC store.
<br/>
4. For developers &amp; media, GBAmp is PERFECT (you're only limited by your CF capacity). It costs about 25$ (dirt cheap). If you want some integrated RAM (not very useful yet), go for M3 Adapter (but it's very expensive - 99$).
<br/>
5. PA_Lib is useful for NDS homebrew or C/C++ begginers (if you are one). Download the newest version at <a href="http://www.palib.com" target="_blank">www.palib.com</a> .</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You need some way to run homebrew on your DS; whether you want to flash is up to you but I highly suggest it. Any pass device or compatible wifi card can do the job, once you've flashed the GBAMP. Both flashes retain all original functionality and are pretty hard to screw up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<a class="postlink" href="http://www.dspassme.com/FlashMe.shtml" target="_blank">FlashMe</a> for your DS

<br/>
<br/>
FlashMe allows you to run hombrew on your DS without inserting the PassMe or being tied to your computer using WiFiMe.
<br/>
<br/>
Chishm's firmware update is requred for the GBA MP to be bootable by PassMe/WiFiMe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Speaking of the GBAmp, any preference on where I should look to get it? The product's website is terrible; they don't even link to carriers. I've found it on Ebay, should I just pick one up there? Also, aside from size, is there any difference between version 1 and 2 of the GBAmp?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I know Lik-Sang has it for like 30 to 40 bucks...I believe Lynx has it in a pack with a PassMe, not sure how much it's going for there.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, get the version 2 GBAMP...if you are unsure as to what it looks like go to Lik Sang and look for the picture on there.  Apparently homebrew code that access the compact flash doesn't work on the first GBAMP version.  It could be true for the firmware hack of it too, I'm not sure.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
GBAmp V2
<br/>
SanDisk Ultra II 1GB Compact Flash Card

EDIT: I don't understand how to get wifime working. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> that everyone seems to be flaunting says to just double click wmb and it starts wifime. Well, having wifi'd meteos, I know that's not how it works. I can stream game demos to my DS just fine via the command line with the -data parameter, but I don't want that. I want to boot WifiMe. 
<br/>
<br/>
There's a .zip on the same site called 'wifime.zip' that comes with a bunch of bin files in it. I assume that I am supposed to somehow use these bin files in conjunction with wmb, but...how the hell? I can't find any stickies or documentation that mentions wifime being seperate from wmb. Maybe I'm just confused...Can someone clear this up?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
