    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I've been getting sick and tired of the no battery backed up sram in the SCSD. So, it definitely would be possible to take a battery out of a GBA cart then soldering it on the SRAM chip? If this is possible, can anybody give me a schematics sheet? Help would be highly appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It depends. Is it an actual SRAM, or is it a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random_access_memory#Pseudostatic_RAM_.28PSRAM.29" target="_blank">PSRAM</a> (a DRAM with a built-in memory controller chip)? Would a battery small enough to fit inside the SC last very long while pumping out enough current to refresh a PSRAM?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

edit: It's DRAM.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Firon, all have SRAM, but not all have <span style="font-style: italic">battery-backed</span> SRAM.  For instance, the QPC saving method relies on users of the regular Supercard SD to quickly power off and power on their DS systems before the data in the SRAM is lost.  Users of the SC miniSD don't have to rush to turn it back on because it's battery-backed.  gm112 bought his SC SD at the same store that I bought my SC miniSD at, and I have no reason to believe that either are fakes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It only applies to GBA homebrew which saves, and a small amount of DS homebrew which uses SRAM instead of fatlib for saving. It's possible they never ran across a need to do it. And the same thing applies to the Supercard CF as well (which I have).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
