    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to use a passme and a ez-flash II 128Mb.  When the DS first comes up, it shows the top screen(non touch screen) with a piece of graphics on it.  looks kinda like a nintendo symbol.  Then when I touch the touchscreen to continue, both screens turn white.  What am I doing wrong?  I've tried a number of setting in the software and several different demos, but I always get the same response.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
