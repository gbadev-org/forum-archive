<br/>
I'm having trouble with making my edimax 7128g able to work as a download point. This card is on the rapla.ralink.net. I did some "research" using google and I determined that it SHOULD have the rt2500 chipset, but when I looked at the card it has a 2561 :(. Is this card able to work as a DS download point. I tried to do it on windows xp (without any sp) and to be honest i've installed it only for this purpose :D, and now I was trying to do it on linux, but the rt2500 dirver doesn't work, only the rt61 works but iwconfig ra0 commands doesn't seem to work. My question is, is it possible to do a download service on linux using this card ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm pretty sure 2561 works as well. I use a similar card right now; think it's a 7128g, but I'm not sure, because Windows doesn't feel like loading the driver right now. &gt;_&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
