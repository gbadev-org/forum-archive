go into device manager and right-click the device and select update driver.  when asked, choose to select the driver from a list and choose view all devices.  click have disk and choose the driver.  it should let you do it that way, and if not you have to uninstall the driver reboot and install it that way again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you have to choose the drivers manually, if you dont, the old ones will keep automatically reinstall the current driver, thats why i said to do it the first way.  if you had chosen the update driver and select driver from a list, <span style="font-weight: bold">dont</span> have it search automatically, it will either show a list of devices, or bring you right to a driver select screen.  if it brought you to a list of devices, select choose all devices, that list should have nothing you want...obviously...so select have disk *note this is where you should pick up if it brought you past the hardware list*  from select disk, navigate to the driver and select it.  install it.  it should work, if it doesnt work im going to assume that your hardware is incompatible with the driver, and thats why its not working.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
