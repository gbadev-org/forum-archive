    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For the last month, my Neo Flash has been broken. The conclusion between me and a few helpful unaffiliated volunteers at the Neo Flash forums is that my Slim Loader III broke. I tried everything including reformatting my Windows to try to get the driver to work. You can't get a driver to work for broken hardware though.
<br/>
<br/>
The developers have been reading the forums yet have consistently ignored my pleas for help. Right now, there is little or no chance of me getting a refund or a replacement Slim Loader. So far I have been given nothing but a terrible impression of the company.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by TheChuckster on Thu Sep 01, 2005 11:53 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Given that the NeoFlash cart is just a rebadged XG2 Turbo (<span style="font-style: italic">not</span> the newer XG2 2005) bundled with a surprisingly well-built PassMe clone, you might be able to find cart writing hardware for the XG2 Turbo, and it should work. It appears that the most common cart writing hardware for the XG2 Turbo is a GBA link cable, but I have seen some sellers that offer it with the slim-loader.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

What gives you that impression? <a class="postlink" href="http://xgflash2.com/" target="_blank">xgflash2.com</a> has a picture of an XG2 Turbo cart with a removable battery holder.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">just a thought, but doesnt littlewriter also support xg turbo carts (of course you wont be able to use the slim3 with littlewriter but... perhaps some sort of link cable or xboo cable?)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
