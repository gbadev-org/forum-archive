<br/>
wmb.exe -data "romname.nds"

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well that is IF he patched the firmware, he can run homebrew .nds files using wmb.exe.
<br/>
<br/>
.ds.gba is for GBA flash carts.
<br/>
.nds is for DS Download Play using wmb.exe. The commercial demos will run without the firmware patch, but the homebrew demos require the firmware patches, as they remove the check for the RSA signature.
<br/>
<br/>
Read the other threads for more info on wmb.exe and how .ds.gba ROMs can be built from .nds ROMs.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
