<br/>
<br/>
Reading in this forum I know that the driver to send "files" to NDS works only with a specific chipset.
<br/>
Well, my question is: in the future will be developed drivers that work for ALL (or almost) the network cards? I mean by that guys that have create previous drivers, not OFFICIAL drivers by Nintendo.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thank you, very nice form and sorry for my ugly english :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No. All chipset cannot be low-level accessed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You mean that to create drivers that support all network cards needs a big budget to be developed?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your answer ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No I mean. You cannot do it because you have to access level 3 in OSI networking model. That cannot be done for every piece of hardware out there. To my knowledge, FireFly / Tim had the hardest time finding 1 bloody piece of hardware for doing that. That piece of hardware is the Ralink card.
<br/>
Please go buy a Ralink card, they are dirt cheap. ?20/$20. Even $10 if you have a MIR.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok ok, I understand :)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, in this case I'll wait some official stuff, you know, I've already 3 wi-fi card (1 usb, 1 pcmcia, 1 pci [not for ds but for other reason]) plus a wireless router; so buy ANOTHER card, although it's cheap, it's TOO MUCH for me :)
<br/>
<br/>
I hope that Nintendo will develop some stuff compatible with my hardware ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for attenction and congratulation to Tim for his job :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
