that's right and useful. but this reboot lib from lick can do a defined end of program (quit/exit) from a menu or similar.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is quite a nice idea. Just like NitroHax, this new patcher could hook the VBlank handler to check for ABXYLR (or any other combo you define) and patch the homebrew device's (one you choose) reset code.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So how does the SCDS1 compare to the R4/M3DSS? I had ordered an R4, but they were out of stock and they just refunded me. So I'm wondering if I should find a R4 elsewhere or go with a SCDS1. Most people I'm seeing are recommending the R4/M3DSS. Are there any known problems with the SCDS1? They both have DLDI drivers, so is there really a difference? And is compatibility the same with the EZ 3-in-1 pack on the SCDS1 as the R4? I just got one of those and want to make sure I can still use it (it was in the order with the R4, so they sent what they had in stock). And while on the subject, what about other Slot-1 cards like the CycloDS? Other than typically being more expensive, how does it compare? Thanks.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Probably... most slot-1 flash carts have a soft-reset function. R4 for example used A+B+X+Y+R+L.
<br/>
<br/>
Would it not work (for ALL slot-1 cards) just to re-load the card like nitro-hax/action replay?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

Where is this new firmware? I have updatet my card with this 1.01 flash update and with this 2.00 SP3 from the SC homepage. I don't see such a new feature??
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: 
<br/>
<br/>
ok I have found it at DS-Scene
<br/>
<br/>
Edit2: 
<br/>
<br/>
it is cool this new homebrew reset feature. it works fine for dsdoom but not for DLDI tester. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also very cool is the new slot2 copy mode. like at EZ-V you can move GBA games to supercard slot 2 and start it. and you can activate rumble on SC.
<br/>
<br/>
DLDI driver now will be auto patched. but it has this align4 problem, so new DLDI Test will fail and wolf3d don't run (same as with DS Linker/MK-5/N-Card).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
