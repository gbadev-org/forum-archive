    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to DS dev and wonder if you can help.
<br/>
<br/>
I have been offered a brand new EZFLASH SLOT 1 Solution for the DS, its ?40.
<br/>
<br/>
Is that a good price and is it a good one to buy for DS dev (do I need it?), and what exactly does it do (although I have an idea from reading the beginners guides).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
<br/>

I suggest either a R4 for $44: <span style="font-weight: bold">[URL REMOVED BY MOD[/URL]</span>
<br/>
or a [PIRATECARD] EX 16G for GBP44.90: [WEBSHOP]
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[PIRATECARD] has 16 GBit (2GB) flash inside and need nothing else.
<br/>
<br/>
R4 has no memory itself and need a micro SD (TF) card additionaly. works fine with any 1GB or 2Gb TF card.

It also has "good" homebrew support and allows both reading and writing tot he SD card from homebrew, correct?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
yes of course, because there is a free io-driver for libfat you can read and write from and into TF card filesystem (like DSdoom does).
<br/>
<br/>
"good" is relative: cause R4 is a very new card on market, most homebrew doesn't run in moment. but many homebrew developer implement DLDI so in future every supported card will run fine in future.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

DS only. Most GBA homebrew has not yet been ported to the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

-- You know, the human.
