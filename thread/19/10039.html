    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, so I just traded my old DS in for a lovely new white DS lite, and I'm struggling to get PassMe2 to work with it.
<br/>
<br/>
On my old DS, I was able to run ScummVM DS using my Supercard SD and a copy of Nintendogs inserted in my PassMe2, but I don't seem to be able to get ScummVM running this way on my lite.
<br/>
<br/>
With the passme2_mb.gba file loaded on to my supercard, I boot my lite up in GBA mode and select the Nintendogs Labrador EUR game code from the list. I receive the message 'SRAM written'. I insert PassMe2 and my Nintendogs cart into my lite, and quickly switch the console off and on, hoping it will boot in NDS mode. But invariably I'm greeted with two white screens.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think this happened with my old DS, unless there's something I'm forgetting to do.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know how to get my DSlite to boot in NDS mode using PassMe2 and my SupercardSD?
<br/>
<br/>
Much appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
However, if you don't know how to solder, I'm sure you'll find somebody who does. When you figure it out, the JTAG cable should be easy to build.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When you update the passme, you'll need to 'tune' it to a specific game.  Passme would work with any game, Passme2 needs to be set to a specific game first.
<br/>
<br/>
Have a look at the tutorials <a class="postlink" href="http://scdev.org/index.php?cat=info&amp;tutorial=flashme_passme2" target="_blank">Here</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=29" target="_blank"> here</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Note:  I've not done mine yet, but I believe this is the correct way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First, do you have a PassMe2 or not?  You indicate in your post that you already have a PassMe2.  If this is the case, you do not need to update it.  When you purchased the PassMe2, did you order it for Nintendogs?  If so, then it has to be the SRAM that is the issue, not the PassMe2.  Unfortunatly, troubleshooting SRAM on the Super Card isn't as easy as with other devices.
