<br/>
If so, can you say me what equipment you have used and how well it works?
<br/>

Thinking it through, wouldn't using the same idea as a telephone modem work? There's a microphone port..
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Using the microphone port, some program could send data by audio - while a homebrew program translates it into useable code.
<br/>
<br/>
Downloading off the DS would also work the same way, through the headphones port.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This was briefly discussed over on DSLinux forum (although it was about DS - DS networking ala Spectrum) and we decided it would be too slow.
<br/>
When they used something similar to dump the iPod firmware it took about 3 hours.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE
