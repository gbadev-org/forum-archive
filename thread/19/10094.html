    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I need convincing. The MML seems adequate enough, but I know there's benefits to flashing that outweigh the NoPass solution. I'm not overly concerned about bricking, so you can leave the warnings out. I'm just looking for the straight up "pro"s of flashing vs. NoPass.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I flashed mine today. Yes, I was considering it for a long while, but I've done it in the end. It scarier than a rollecoaster, but true. 
<br/>
Though using a mirror and a toothpick with some tin foil is actually very easy (my hands were shaking like hell, I almost pushed the foil in the wrong hole &gt;.&lt;) - well, just make sure you're relaxed and everything will be fine. And be patient - I wiggled the toothpick for several minutes until I got contact ... :)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I should read your post carefully first ... Well, the pros and cons:
<br/>
<br/>
NoPass:
<br/>
<br/>
+ no need to flash
<br/>
+ additional EEPROM, if you'll need some (maybe when DSLinux supports it :P)
<br/>
- could easily get lost
<br/>
- consumes some extra power
<br/>
<br/>
FlashME:
<br/>
<br/>
+ malicious code protection (strongly recommended - even a bug in some badly written HB application could jump to FW and mess something up, though that's pretty unlikely)
<br/>
+ get rid of the Health Warning Screen (I kept mine, though)
<br/>
+ no RSA check in WMB!
<br/>
- the whole danger of the flashing process<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I used a nail with ground down tip and tape around it except for the tip.  I was being real careful and got it done.  The only problem was that I found the SL1 to be harder to short than the normal DS and it took me about 20 min instead of 20 sec.  I couldn't keep it shorted.  But they time I was finished I had stuck the nail in so many times and moved it around I found it to be pretty much impossible to turn the thing off.  Just my 2 cents though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's why you get your homebrew from a reliable source and let several people test it and report back first before using it. Really, the risk of bricking while flashing is <span style="font-weight: bold">much</span> greater than some phantom trojan. How many people got hit by that bricker anyway, like 5? Really, people are being paranoid over nothing. The nopass devices are much better than flashing. Again, IMO there is absolutely no reason to flash anymore.

I hope you are right.. but then.. Norton, Symantec, etc..  make a lot of money from people being 'paranoid'.  :)
<br/>
<br/>
Think if it like insurance... You pay money so that when something bad does happen, you have help.  But..  You don't really want something bad to happen.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Forgot to respond to this.

1) No, I'm not saying you should have flashme to test homebrew. I'm just saying let a bunch of people test it first and report back before you give it a go, whether you have flashme installed or not. I followed this practice with my regular flashed DS as well.
<br/>
<br/>
2) People still got hit by it.
<br/>
<br/>
3) This isn't like going on porn and warez sites with no antivirus. Just get your homebrew from a reputable site and let a bunch of people test it first and the risk is next to nothing. Again, this is a smart practice whether you have flashme installed or not.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're at all worried that you may brick it.. I can assure you, that you'd have to make some major mistake (like poking the flashing tool into the other hole) to mess up. I have had no experience what so ever with electronics and shorting and all that and I just flashme'd three US polar white DS Lites. Very quick very easy.

This is the guide I followed:

I had a friend look at the screen and tell me if it stopped or if its moving while I had the back facing me so I could jiggle to tool around.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I decided to go ahead and flash. In the end it seemed like there was really no reason not to (aside from the bricking, of course).
<br/>
<br/>
I used a 5/64" Allen key wrapped in electrical tape and everything went perfectly. I used a small mirror to watch the screen and barely had to readjust the tool at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the input and information guys.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
