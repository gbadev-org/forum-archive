    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, I've been browsing around forums, sites, ebay, and the like. I'm debating between getting the Max Media Launcher card or Passcard 3. Either way, I'm pretty sure I'd like to get a No Pass, since that seems the easiest and cheapest way to go. I'm currently leaning more towards the Passcard 3, because of sleep support, but I'm still unsure. Eventually, I plan on FlashMe'ing my Lite, and I want to know if it will be capable of sleeping based on which card I use.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, which GBA cards would you recommend for using before/after? Which ones perform the fastest, most consistently, hold the most, and/or are the cheapest. I'd like to end up tossing some .mp3's on there for outings and whatnot, in conjunction to some homebrew games. How much storage space is recommended for 2-4 hours of music+ a few homebrews, and what cards will run both of these fastest?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I plan on doing this with my DS Dark first, so if I mess up and brick it, it won't matter as much.
<br/>
<br/>
Sooooo... suggestions? I don't want to spend too much, and would like to keep it under $80, but I'll listen to any suggestions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GBAMP v2 can run only the smaller "multiboot" programs that fit entirely into the GBA's internal RAM. These generally have the file name suffix ".mb.gba". Most homebrew designed to run in Game Boy Advance mode is designed to run from GBA ROM address space, which the M3 provides but the GBAMP v2 does not. Or are you talking about newer M3 firmware versions that incorrectly load homebrew .gba files?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
