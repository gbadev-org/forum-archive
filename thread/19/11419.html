    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">anyone tried one of those things in a supercard and does it work?
<br/>
<br/>
I do already have a compact flash card, but I hear SD is cheaper and my CF card casing actually split and I had to superglue it back together, its also bent a bit.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm considering SD because my laptop has an slot for SD, and it's just easier than carrying around my CF usb thing everywhere.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Many laptops also have a slot for CF if you plug it into a PCMCIA CF adapter. Those are real cheap because it's just a pin-to-pin adapter.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It doesn't seem to have PCMCIA, it has some other weird card thing, I was a bit disapointed i couldn't fit my clik drive in when I got it.
<br/>
<br/>
Seeming as it's a CF-to-SD converter, would the software need to know the SD specifics, doesn't it emulate a normal CF?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If it's new, it likely has ExpressCard.
