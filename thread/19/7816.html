    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have just bought an SD card for my supercard sd that will arrive on Monday.
<br/>
<br/>
After I looked closely at it after I bought it on ebay it says thats its read rate is only 5MB/s.
<br/>
<br/>
Is that good enough for the supercard to work without slowdown? The card is a 1GB Kingsgton.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
well lets do the math
<br/>
<br/>
5 divided by 1000 is 200 so it takes a bout 3.33 minutes to transfer a whole gig</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok cheers, now can you answer the question? Will the card be slow on the supercard when playing a game on the ds?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't care how long it will take to transer data to the card from the pc, but if the actual sd card is fast enough so that when playing games on the ds it won't slow down.
<br/>
<br/>
And yes I know it's already monday but there was a problem with paying for the card so I'll hopefully receive it by thursday or friday.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm pretty sure the limiting factor won't be the SD card itself, more like the GBA device's card reader.  Windows is able to read off a compactflash card much faster than a GBAMP is, so I bet supercard would be the same way.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
