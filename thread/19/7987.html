    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I had one silver DS for one year.... I used Wifime to boot Flashme and never had any problem booting any application using my humble 128mbits EZ-Flash...
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I sold it and I?ll buy this week that new Red DS with the Mario Kart bundle. I?m sure it?ll have that new evil firmware, right?
<br/>
<br/>
I was reading that the only working method to boot something in it is using Passme 2, right?
<br/>
<br/>
I checked out Natrium?s site and two things called my attention...
<br/>
<br/>
1st - When I?m going to buy the device, it ask me to choose a game. It means that the passme will come programmed to work exclusively with that game to boot?
<br/>
<br/>
2nd - I saw that I needed a flash card with SRAM. Alrighty. What for? I mean... If I?m going to boot up Flashme for example, I?ll have to use a specific sram save in the flash card, right? What if it differs from the rom ram space? I mean, each game has it?s defined space in the RAM of the flash card, right? And, if I?m going to boot up a software that uses the ram, ScummVM for example? How am I going to put it?s save back in the cart if I?m going to have to use another?
<br/>
<br/>
I believe it?s that for now.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Don't ask any questions till you get the DS, and try that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I?ll try that as soon as I get it!
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just sold my old one because its shell was slightly scratched and its touch screen was really scratched.
<br/>
<br/>
And because the red one is much prettier than the silver.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You're only going to use the passme2 once - to install FlashMe.
<br/>
Then you don't need to worry about writing the SRAM ever again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
