<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if someone who ad a nopass(preferably a max media launcher) laying around that they would be willing to sell to me  for a very low price. I assume some people some people will, because after you've flashed your DS, you don't really have a need for it. 
<br/>
<br/>
'tis just a minor request. PM me if you will do this. 
<br/>
<br/>
p.s please don't flame me if I said some thing wrong :-P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah, even i could afford it ^^.  I think it's pretty useful to keep it after flashing, so I can use it on a DS lite if i get one</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, + shipping.. which could make it $30+.. So, if someone has one laying around that they don't need/want, he's just letting them know he's looking for it.. no harm.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, i would buy it for $20 off of ebay, but there they're only in hong kong, which brings the shipping to here in the us up to $30, plus the price of the MML which is 20, so thats a total of 50 (gah!) for 1 nopass device.
<br/>
<br/>
And, I would buy off of codejunkies, but people say they take over a month to ship sometimes, and I'm not a patient waiter for packages :-P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
