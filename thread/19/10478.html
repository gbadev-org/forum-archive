I'm not too sure how compatible the MMD is with current homebrew, but it doesn't sound as compatible at all as the supercard.. If I were you I would've kept the supercard

The MMD goes in the NDS slot right? Not GBA. So therefore it wont run GBA code.. (or atleast i wouldn't expect it to)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are two version of the Max Meida Dock.
<br/>
<br/>
One for the NDS Slot and one for the GBA Slot of the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
The NDS Slot version won't be able to run .GBA as those are run directly from GBA-ROMSpace, which is not present if only a nds card is inserted.
<br/>
<br/>
The Max Media Dock for the GBA Slot (4GB Hdd) should be able to start 256kB GBA homebrew like the GBAMP does. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you are using the nds slot version, i'd like to hear a small review *g*<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I thought there was just the Max Media Launcher, which is simply a "NoPass" device (replaces function of passme), and doesn't actually store any code in it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

"Cannot see" as in "There is no Game Pak inserted" in the GBA field if you boot while holding Start? Or as in "option pak"?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I want to udnerstand more about the NDS works . Also I travel often too so i would love to backup my stuff instead of bring the catridge around esp NDS catridge as they are easy to loose . As for the GBA i want to also run my GBA homebew from the datel .

I don't think you'll get the answer on these boards, we're not meant to talk about that kind of feature at all. I don't think you're going to be able to get it to work as a GBA flashcard, unless you do have the one that plugs into the GBA slot.

Although, if a GBA emulator was made for DS homebrew, it would solve this and be able to play GBA games via the net on wifi (and ad-hoc mode whenever whoever makes that work). But then it would also increase GBA piracy, which is bad for Nintendo - and in turn, us.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A GBA emulator on the PC would have no problem making a stable link by using the TGB Dual method, which involves emulating both GBAs on each system and only trades controller data over the network. Forgotten refused to implement this in order to deter pirates. But the DS, the PSP, and the GP2X may not be able to use the TGB Dual method due to lack of CPU power.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
