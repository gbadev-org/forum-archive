    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody.
<br/>
<br/>
due to interest to dslinux project and homebrew in general i bought ds, supercardSD and superpassme to do some playing around. Maybe even start developing something fun.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course my ds was one with new firmware, so i had to modify the superpassme to passme2. duh. after that i was able to start flashme and other homebrew. Flashing went ok. used the V5. Got rid of the annoying health nag screen, but still i cannot run any homebrew without passme2. Just 2 blank white screens. with sram + passme2 everything works ok. what am i doing wrong here?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Doing so will boot me to supercard in NDS mode, but homebrew still whitescreens. Sorry forgot to mention it at original text.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i tried ndsloader.bin and ndsmall.bin loaders, but yet again i get white screens. tried several different homebrews with loaders or without loaders but they do not work. 
<br/>
<br/>
copy /b ndsloader.bin + homebrew.nds homebrew2.nds
<br/>
<br/>
should this be the right syntax to do it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes.
<br/>
<br/>
Are you using the supercard software to put .nds files on the supercard?
<br/>
<br/>
Homebrew should be copied to the CF card with explorer, not the supercard software.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, taken from my post on [url=http://www.ndshb.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=60&amp;mode=&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0]

Ok.. but what about the other .nds files? Let's check them out.. Here are the results of the few homebrew .nds files I tested, using the PassMe2 and SRAM data:
<br/>
<br/>
drummers.nds = two white screens
<br/>
drummers.ds.gba = reboots into GBA mode :(
<br/>
dummers.ds.gba renamed to .ds.nds = Launches fine.. :( So, none of the standard (or OLD) .nds files work.. They need to have the header prepended, but still need to be called .nds otherwise it reboots into GBA mode.. but, all in all.. it does work with PassMe2.
<br/>
<br/>
So, why does the FlashMe.nds file work, but the Drummer.nds file not? Well, the current version of DevkitARM now builds the .nds file in a format that doesn't require the ndsmall.bin to be prepended.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
no. normal explorer. Also playing with file names is useless.
<br/>
if i name homebrew to *.gba it just goes to gba mode and crashes, and all .nds ends up in white screens. with passme2, everything works flawlessly.
<br/>
<br/>
the supercard has latest firmware also installed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

yes i know that, and my passme2 works quite ok, i have no problems with that.
<br/>
But using flashme should get rid of passme2? i have no passme2 installed anymore, just original nintendogs. without it no homebrew works.
<br/>
<br/>
why do i need the nintendogs with flashme?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
So, your telling me that nibbles.ds.gba renamed to nibbles.nds on your Super Card will not work unless you have Nintendogs inserted?
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm.. for some reason, I find that hard to believe..  
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not as naive as I used to be..
