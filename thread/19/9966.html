    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As of 2Q 2006, <span style="font-weight: bold">NoPass</span> is the newest method to boot homebrew on the Nintendo DS. It comes in the form of a card shaped like a DS Game Card, and it works by emulating the encryption of an authentic DS Game Card to get into DS mode, but then jumping to DS code on the GBA card.
<br/>
<br/>
Like PassMe original, NoPass works with GBA Movie Player v2 CF. (PassMe2 doesn't, as it needs GBA SRAM.) Like PassMe2, it works on newer versions of Nintendo DS firmware. (PassMe original needs old firmware.) Unlike PassMe original and PassMe2, it does not require an original DS game and can be shrunk to fit in the same size as a DS Game Card.
<br/>
<br/>
NoPass devices include MAX Media Launcher, SuperKey, PassCard 3, and MK4-mini. Check <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewforum.php?f=13" target="_blank">Retailer Feedback</a> for stores near you.
<br/>
<br/>
Compatible GBA cards: <ul><li>GBA Movie Player v2 CF with Chishm's NDSMP </li><li>GBA Movie Player v2 SD with latest firmware </li><li>SuperCard (all versions) </li><li>M3 (GBA Movie Player v3) (all versions) </li><li>SuperCard SD </li><li>Flash2Advance Classic </li></ul>
<br/>
Instructions: <ol type="1"><li>Insert the NoPass device in SLOT-1. </li><li>Insert the GBA card in SLOT-2. </li><li>Power on the DS. </li></ol>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What about PassMe2?</span>
<br/>
If you are buying DS homebrew equipment for the first time, we recommend buying a NoPass. If you have already bought a PassMe2, see this topic:

<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Where can I learn about other boot methods?</span>
<br/>
I maintain a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/pass/" target="_blank">page about various DS homebrew boot methods</a>, giving their history and a bit of speculation.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Do I need a NoPass or PassMe or FlashMe to use GBA homebrew on my DS?</span>
<br/>
No. If you don't use a DS boot method, the DS acts like a GBA without a Game Link port.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I must admit that this is all quite confusing for someone only just getting into homebrew on the NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
I've ordered a G6 4G/Passcard3 combo from one of the resellers mentioned in the other forum. I'll post feedback there after I receive my order and test a homebrew rom.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd still suggest you install FlashMe even if you do purchase a NoPass device that makes it easier to run homebrew.  it's better to be safe than sorry.  For the money, if you can use a PassMe1, I'd still suggest it as it's cheaper than all of the NoPasses currently available and you should only need it once anyway (to install FlashMe).  If you have a new firmware DS, than a NoPass is a must.. I wouldn't even bother playing with a PassMe2 anymore.  Here's a link to a simular post on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=142" target="_blank">ndshb.com</a> where I put $$ with them.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have the Datel Games n' Music.  It works as a decent card as-is, and runs most homebrew off of the microSD and has DLDI support, but it also functions as a NoPass when the microSD is removed, so I can use it to boot my GBAMPv2 CF to run some things that are incompatible with the GnM, or things that require a slot-2.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
