    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just a note to self (and maybe other noobs) that the Dell Wireless 1350 mini-pci card built-in to my Dell 600m laptop is not based on the RT2500 chipset as shown in entry #51 of the ndiswrapper list (though I haven't tried it out):

At the time of my visiting that link, here was the info for it:
<br/>
<br/>
"Card: Dell Wireless 1350 WLAN MiniPCI Card - Dell INSPIRON 2200
<br/>
    * Chipset: Broadcom Corporation BCM4318 [AirForce One 54g] 802.11g Wireless LAN Controller (rev 02)..."

Just for completeness' sake, one of the noob stickies links to the list of WMB-compatible wireless cards:

A search for "dell wireless rt2500" currently returns over 12 pages of threads, half of which are entitled "wifime help," which is really crappy. People tell noobs to search forum posts, but the threads with answers in them were made by people who use crappy, uninformative titles. It's not clear which of 50+ threads has your answer and it'll be a pain to go through them all, which means someone is going to ask the easy question anyways.
<br/>
<br/>
Doing forum searches in general returns a list of questions. This is an attempt to have a search return an actual answer, like any other reasonable search engine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
