Also, when you use a <b style="color:#FFA34F">Microdrive</b> in the <b style="color:#FFA34F">GBAMP</b>, how much battery power does it consume? And, is it really hard to put the <b style="color:#FFA34F">microdrive</b> into the <b style="color:#FFA34F">GBAMP</b>?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by quadomatic on Fri Apr 07, 2006 11:56 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

take it from someone who did it with out even thinking about checking to see if others did it :P
<br/>
<br/>
it is VERY simple to do,
<br/>
get an exato blade and cut the parts you need too.
<br/>
Super simple :P
<br/>
.....
<br/>
<br/>
and as for power consuption,
<br/>
i don't really see and signifigent change :P
<br/>
the <b style="color:#FFA34F">microdrive</b> does not need power continuasly,
<br/>
so once a game is loaded in ram,
<br/>
it will not use any extra power :D(not sure if flash CF does the same :P)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

Actually, the drive is constantly powered by the DS (otherwise you would have to init it everytime it is used), so it will be drawing some current. However, when not accessing data it should spin down, both to save power and protect the drive.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

Chishm, do you think you can release a locked to ds download server rom loader,
<br/>
for <b style="color:#FFA34F">gbamp</b>?,
<br/>
it would greatly help to give more demos to more people :)...,
<br/>
you could always make people have to request one to be made,
<br/>
and it will be locked to the <b style="color:#FFA34F">gbamp</b> and ds that they requested with :)
<br/>
i don't even want to run commerical games,
<br/>
i just want to let my friends play with the cool demos that nintendo put into the download server :D
