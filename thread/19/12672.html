This website was advertised in the latest PopSci to be able to turn a DS into a 'Pod imposter. From reading the other forums, I can tell that theres alot more to offer. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anway, my question is simple and kinda n00by. 
<br/>
<br/>
Will reprograming my DS affect how it plays regular games? Will it inibit from playing regular DS games, or its WiFi connections?
<br/>
<br/>
If the answer is no for the above question, then could you please tell me where i can find this code, and any instructions pertaining to how I can implement it.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance, and sorry if this is in the wrong forum. = )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Darn right. See <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_homebrew" target="_blank">wiki wiki wiki</a>.

No. DS Game Cards will work on a homebrew-enabled DS.

No. You can still use Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and homebrew on the same DS. Nintendo doesn't ban DS homebrewers from Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection the way Microsoft bans Xbox homebrewers from Xbox Live.

Do you want a list of DS homebrew programs, or do you want to know how to write your own? Either way, first you'll need a memory card to store the player software and the MP3s. Do you want just DS homebrew, or do you want both DS and Game Boy Advance homebrew?
