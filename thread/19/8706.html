    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just bought a supercard and I have it working well with FlashMe.  
<br/>
I have a couple questions though about using it with homebrews:
<br/>
  -Do all apps and games have to be converted from .nds to .nds.gba/.dsi/.dsq/etc?
<br/>
  -If so, where's the best place to grab the prog to convert to .nds.gba?
<br/>
  -Is moonshell just a media player/e-book reader or can it be used to load games as well instead of the standard onboard Supercard loader?
<br/>
<br/>
I know those are probably newbie question but I appreciate it.
<br/>
TIA!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You cant run nds files with moonshell and a supercard. For roms you have to convert them with the supercard software.
<br/>
<br/>
With homebrew you have to attach ndsloader.bin to any homebrew you have unless its already ds.gba.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So you do have to convert the games then for supercard.  Ok I guess there wasn't a workaround.
<br/>
<br/>
When you say attach ndsloader.bin, do you mean just have that it has to be on the CF/SD card as well or something else?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you have a .ds.gba file, the loader.bin has already been "attached".  After that all you need to do is rename the (homebrew) whatever.ds.gba file to whatever.nds
<br/>
<br/>
Then you're all set!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
