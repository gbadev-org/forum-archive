    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought a GBAMP (CF version) when they first came out and have been too stingy to buy anything newer. But my friend just got a M3 Perfect, so I thought I'd flash my DS to get more out of my GBAMP.
<br/>
I read somewhere that it was better to load the new firmware from the GBA slot instead of the DS slot, but neither of us knows how to get the M3 perfect software to load content from the GBA slot, and I don't know if the GBAMP is too old to support it anyways. So is it possible to flash from the GBAMP and if so how do I do it? And is it even better than just flashing from the M3?
<br/>
<br/>
Second, no one seems to talk about the GBAMP anymore, are there any places with info on what emulators/roms/etc it can support and run on a flashed DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not sure if there's another fix.  You could try removing all files from your card save update.e19 and see if that works.
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't want to buy another GBA MP, you might be able to ship it off to another member here on GBAdev.  I'm in FL (USA), I'd be happy to fix it for you if you'd like.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I do remember I fixed it via the e19 update file though (I think there's a button combo to press)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Stick update.e19 (or .e20) onto the root of your compact flash card. The recovery option basically completely erases the GBAMP firmware, then writes the original 32KiB of boot loader, which has the ability to bootstrap the update onto the card. This way, your card's firmware can be put back to a factory state. You can thank DarkFader for this.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
