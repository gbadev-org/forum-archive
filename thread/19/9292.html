    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">FlashMe stealth won't have any visible effect apart from removing the RSA check from DS Download Play and allowing you to boot from the GBA card in DS mode.
<br/>
<br/>
On a regular DS, bricking won't happen as long as you keep SL1 shorted to at least 5% or so and don't drop the battery. But I wouldn't recommend it on a DS lite just yet because of 1. the bricking problem and 2. the lack of brightness control in the public version of FlashMe.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you use FlashMe the health and safety screen is gone (as is the startup chime).
<br/>
Also it will auto boot the GBA slot device if it has the "PASS" header.
<br/>
It's on the website.

<br/>
The button combination A+B+X+Y, gamecode "PASS" or title "DSBooter" on the GBA cartridge automatically starts program from GBA cartridge (starting from offset 0xC0).
<br/>
Backlight fades in at startup.
<br/>
<br/>
Effectively removes the health screen, making it less annoying to boot.
<br/>
<br/>
Remove RSA signature check for Wireless MultiBooting (WMB) homebrew NDS files.

You don't really need to worry as all homebrew comes with PASS already in the header, as ndstool puts it there.
<br/>
<br/>
Layout of the header (technical) if you are interested is located here:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The public version of flashme (V7 updated) DOES now support variable backlight for DS Lite.
<br/>
<br/>
The stealth version of flashme DOES contain the health warning screen. It is the non-stealth version in which it is removed. Its "Stealth" as in most undetectable by future nintendo/online protections, i.e. closest to original firmware as it still has the health screen in place.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can uninstall to restore it to normal but you would only do that if you had to return it and even then it's not necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
Stealth is more to hide from human eyes.  Flashme stealth is just asl easy to detect with software but it doesn't look like nintendo are going to do that.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Thu Apr 20, 2006 6:24 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
