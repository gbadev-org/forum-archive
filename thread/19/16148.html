    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone, my first post here.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to get started in DS development and was looking at R4 cards on amazon.co.uk, but there seems to be different cards: <span style="font-weight: bold">[Retailer link removed]</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Which one is the best for DS dev?
<br/>
<br/>
btw, I have a ds lite.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recommend an M3Real. Because I've had a very good time with it and it runs some programs, that other cards don't (I am a developer). :^)

<br/>
It's also reasonably priced. ;^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think SuperCard CF is good, it can run homebrew GBA software as well. If you have DS Lite it will stick out a bit because of the SLOT-2 in DS Lite. But you also need PassMe or NoPass or custom firmware. If you have DS action replay, that counts as NoPass also, so it will work.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The pricing depends pretty much on the region you live in. But it's just like 35 / 40 ? (excluding any ?SD card) for a great developer card.

<br/>
I wouldn't personally recommend any slot 2 solution, if you're only interested in NDS homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm part of a small DS homebrew team (3 members) and I handle the technical issues of the project. Shopping for a flash cart has been tougher than expected, but here's a link that might help:
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.techsick.com/articles-ds-flash-cartridge-comparison.shtml#r4ds" target="_blank">http://www.techsick.com/articles-ds-flash-cartridge-comparison.shtml#r4ds</a>
<br/>
<br/>
All cards seem to offer the same features and they seem to target the pirate gamers (yuck!) more than DS homebrewers. That makes a judicious decision difficult to take.
<br/>
<br/>
I own a DSone SuperCard and an R4 Revolution (DSLite, slot-1 devices), both equipped with 2gb microSD flash memories. The R4 is easier to use than the DSone: the latter having terrible, Engrish messages. Both work well with homebrews, though.
<br/>
<br/>
I consider trying the Acekard RPG, for its open-source firmware, and built-in USB port to open a new dimension in DS connectivity.
<br/>
<br/>
Happy brewing!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Be aware that no one has used the USB connection on the AK's for anything apart from acting as a mass storage driver and that is only whilst the device is removed from the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
If it's gdb over a USB connection you want you may be better off getting a DSerial.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">
