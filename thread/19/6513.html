    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm wanting to get into all this Homebrew stuff, but I'm mostly waiting for the RSA code to be cracked, so's I can just get it all working with my wi-fi, plain and simple.

I've not really been looking into the scene for a while, and I'm just interested to know what stage we're up to, with the cracking of the codes..
<br/>
<br/>
Will we be seeing it any time soon, or are we still a way off, yet?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://AGameAWeek.com" target="_blank">A Game A Week.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You don't have to wait for RSA to be cracked (highly unlikely) or for the <span style="font-style: italic">SM64DS</span> protocol to be cracked (much more likely) to run code over Wi-Fi. Just get a PCI Wi-Fi card with a Ralink chipset and a ?39.95 EFA-LINKER flash card from totalgba.com, put FlashMe on it, and use WiFiMe to boot it. Now you can send <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> .nds file with WMB, and you can put the flash card away to use with your GBA projects.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
