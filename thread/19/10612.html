If you hex edit the WMB 1.4 Beta 1 executable and replace "09 BF" with "16 56" at following offsets then it should work with a DS Lite (but no longer with a DS Phat).

<br/>
Yes. I was not aware that Nintendo gave the DS Lite a non 00-09-BF-xx-xx-xx mac address. First thing wmb.exe does if it receives a packet is check if it's coming from 00-09-BF-xx-xx-xx and that obviously prevented it from talking to a DS Lite.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

EDIT : I've read that you want to do a version for Lite and Phat, but why not simply ( for right now at least ) make available a modify version of WMB for lite.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, for one: Linux WMB doesn't work with Windows.
<br/>
<br/>
Good news Firefly! I hope you can find the source... Having one executable for both the old DS and the Lite would be optimal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if you have a hex editor. Then in the program you should find the address mark, go into that, then you'll find decimal and hexadecimal, click on the hexadecimal circle or something that's close to it. you'll see a $ sign. after you see that, go next to the $ sign and type the codes that firefly listed as above. (ex.) In all of these lines, you'll find 09BF, now that you found em, change em by clicking on the box that contains the number09 and change it to 16, now the box highlighted should go to then next box, and type 56. When you finished all of the offsets no. that were supposed to be changed, save it, quit and try it out. A recommeded hex editor is XVI32. Click <a class="postlink" href="http://www.chmaas.handshake.de/delphi/freeware/xvi32/xvi32.htm" target="_blank">Here</a> for the XVI32 program. This is only if you don't have one.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, I changed all the code in hex, so now I changed the WMB in my folder, run WIFiMe, then I started my lite. First thing was done it did recognise firefly   program, but then when I make it download WiFiMe so it acces my GBAMP it do this :
<br/>
<br/>
- on my pc it load till 100%
<br/>
- When done my lite start with the Nintendo logo ( the black one )
<br/>
- Then a Mario Kart Loading thing appear
<br/>
- Some secondes after, the ds tell me the connection failed and couldnt connect
<br/>
<br/>
Do I need to put a certain game in my ds, or did I forgot to do something ? Usely I do the same thing with the Phat ds and it work perfecty...

A new version would have to intercept the SM64DS loading process at a different point in order to be effective on the DS Lite. If you are not willing to take the effort of reverse engineering this process to create such a new version, you will have to spend about 30 USD for a NoPass card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actully that might work because then if its youyr mac address, then the RSA check would go with it I'm guessing. These are also one of the following questions that I would like to ask.
<br/>
<br/>
Is the RSA, Arm7, Arm9, beacons and the header file the same, if not, then what is the same as the reg. ds and what's not. I'm thinking that the beacons and the header file are diff. But since Nintendo Also improved the RSA check, then I'm guessing that the RSA is diff. as well so if it is. Then we would have to get the ds lites firmware hex edit it so the RSA check is then the DS phats RSA check or even maybe just change the RSA off. Also, is the default begining of the DSL 00, if so, then change the 09 to 00.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
