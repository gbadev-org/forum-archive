this flashing problem happening randomley makes no sense. Can any one tell  us if this problem has been around ever sense day one????. My theroy is Nintendo has just started making ds lites with updated firmware that blocks flashme by turning off your ds durring the process of flashing and thats y all the sudden people are having this problem. or can some one prove me rong plz?<br/>_________________<br/>I go to pet store and fart on puppys and kittys        ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think it's a firmware thing, the firmware isn't active when you run homebrew (flashme) (It's no bios or os). It could be a hardware problem. So to confirm this, you could run any homebrew you want (or perhaps a ds game or pictochat) and shorten SL1. If it turns your DS off, theres a hardwareproblem (but it doesn't brick your DS, because your not writing to the firmware _unless_ it burns your fuse. In that case, the DS can be repaired be bypassing the fuse (and can be flashed doing that too)).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A firmware update couldn't do this. When the DS is hijacked by the passme, all control is given to the flashing program. The firmware no longer has control, and so can't do anything to turn off the power. However, the act of flashing, in combination with the brighter screen, compact flash card and memory expansion (in a super card or M3) may be too much power drain. This could be the cause of the poweroffs. Alternatively, people my be accidentally shorting something else, along with SL1, while trying to flash the DS.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <h4>#79317 - HyperHacker - Wed Apr 12, 2006 10:16 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I bet that's it. You short the half of SL1 that has power to some random other component, and it panics and shuts off. Anyone who's had this happen, what exactly did you use to short SL1? (With the original DS, a certain size screw fits in tightly, eliminating the need to hold anything (except the battery) in place, jiggle things, etc. Not sure if the hole on the Lite is the same size, but it's probably worth looking for such a screw.)
<br/>
<br/>
A power issue is also likely; the power circuit can't handle all the energy required to run the system, lights, whatever flash card, and writing to the firmware (I think some Flash ROM/EEPROM chips draw more power when writing) for very long. Could even be some sort of hardware flaw. IIRC writing to the firmware and turning the system off are both done via the SPI, so if that were to have some weird bug in it that randomly sent data to the wrong device, then this sort of thing could happen.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as software doing it, it could be possible; the firmware or BIOS might set some interrupts that FlashMe doesn't/can't disable. Could also be a bug in FlashMe.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, keep in mind that Nintendo could very well rewrite the firmware from within a game, just not the first 64K. Any code that doesn't reside in this protected area could be rewritten. I doubt they'd actually do this, since newer models protect almost everything, but you never know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Won't happen though. There are 3 crcs and 5 addresses that need to match up.  It is likely that parts 1&amp;2 are inside the 64K area.  Since the addresses/crcs that need to be modified are in the first 128 bytes,  Nintendo will not be changing the firmware at all.

Well, when I shorted this other thing, I was using something bigger than the bit of wire I normally use for flashing my older DS.  I think that's why...it was big enough to hit SL1 and this other thing.  I suspect it's something on the left side of the hole SL1 resides in but I'm not sure as it's fairly difficult to see in there.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
That's easy to test (and I would do it, if I had a lite): just run a homebrew with a PassMe and a Supercard/M3 what ever and shorten SL1. 
<br/>
Why so much hardware? Because of the power needed (some people guessed that could be a problem).
<br/>
<br/>
Now you can check, what happens if you short it, does it turn off? Does it only turn of, if you loost the contact to SL1 for a secound? Does it happen all the time? Then try it with a DS game, if it doesn't happen, it could be a power problem. Or try to variing the screen brightness...  
<br/>
If you don't run flashme, you shouldn't brick your DS and can test this a few times until you find the problem, why the DS turns off.
<br/>
<br/>
any suggestions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

without inserting any cartridge, this guy tries to short SL1 with a screwdriver and it turned off.
<br/>
<br/>
seems like aside from the power consumption theory, another possible scenerio is that a unproperly shorted SL1 results to a shutdown. meaning that if you turn on the DS Lite, short SL1 inconsistantly, it shuts off because of that.
<br/>
<br/>
a way to disprove it would be solder the joint beforehand (while the unit is off...of course), or if you dont want to solder, you have to be sure that you have secure the shorting before turning on the DS lite it self.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You should be able to just continue installing FlashMe with it if you do start flashing and it shuts off.  FWNITRO I think probably has this capability as well, though I'd not recommend it yet for the Lite until it either detects a DS Lite somehow or there is a DS Lite specific build (for toggling the backlight).<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It may not be a fuse but a breaker that resets itself whenever you turn the power back on. In that case, practice bridging SL1 and not bridging anything else using <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=3" target="_blank">DesktopMan's Tetris</a> instead of FlashMe. If you can get it to reliably stay on, then you'll have a better chance of getting FlashMe past 5%, where the failsafe (A+B+Select+Start+power on) begins to work.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I figured probably...I'm suspecting it had the problem before flashing anyway, since it does it so randomly (I can't seem to cause it happen, but when it is happening I can fix it sometimes, strangely when I press on the volume control slightly).
<br/>
<br/>
So maddening...I have this beautiful DS Lite yet don't want to use it as the One Screen randomly goes nuts. &gt;_&lt;  Especially since sometimes I can use it for an hour or more, or leave it on for a long time and it will never do it, not even once, then other times it won't stop doing it.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't fancy risking my shiny new lite if I'm going to destroy it in the process.

Personally, I don't think this is an attempt to stop piracy by Nintendo, as they have made SL1 much easier to get to (the hole isn't as deep), and not covered it with a sticker like on the original DS.

 Agent G you gotta not just stick the metal thing into the hole where the SL1 circuit is you aculey got to touch the SL1 circuit and apply presure to it with the metal thing your using to see if you have the problem or not if it dousent turn off when your apply pressure to the SL1 circuit then it should be 100% safe to flash. ^_^ also note Flashme V7 suports flashme now so you dont need the beta<br/>_________________<br/>I go to pet store and fart on puppys and kittys        ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Aculey you are in luck nintendo is the coolest when it comes to waranty. First of all nintendo has no Warnty realey. They will replace any broken nintendo system that they curently sell. All you gotta do is call nintendo on the phone and tell them your system is broken and isent turning on or somthing about it not working. Then they ask you your credit card number and your house address and your email: optional then thats it. after that they send a new nintendo ds in a box to your house. then you have to send them the broken one in the box the new one came in back to nintendo or they charge your credit card . Its compleatly free  to replace a ds system tho^_^ ive done this 3 times and my first ds was imported so you shouldent have a problem with your lite. the onley thing you gotta do now tho is wait till they start making them in amarica or where ever you live untill you ask for a repacement. note" i  lied to them when i called then requesting a replacment ds. I told them the system refused to turn on but the onley real problem with it was realy the touch screen was scratched up. The system worked fine tho but they still replaced it and never called me or emaild me back asking what was realey rong with it after i lied. I know for a fact they wont replace it if you tell them flashme isent working on it so just tell them its broken and wont turn on or theres a dead pixl or somthin even if its not broken and they will replace it free of charge even if its imported. oooo yea if you dont like lieing you can always just break the 2 battary prongs in the back this will break the system. it will make it not able to work any more i did that the secont time i had to get a replacement and it worked like a charm they sent me a free ds ^_^ and i just sent the broken one back. if any one is wondering for the third time my ds just blow a fuse but still after 2 replacements they still replaced my ds for the 3erd time.

lol Anyway, yeah, they are pretty cool about replacing stuff.  I didn't know they would take import stuff though (of course, once it is released in the US).  I would probably have to find a way to break it further as I FlasheMe'd it, but not with the stealth version, and I kinda can't get the battery cover off again to reflash it to either the stock firmware or FlashMe Stealth.  :P  Which is just making me even more annoyed at my messed up DS Lite.  I rather wish I could just get the battery cover off, then I wouldn't have to do anything shady to send it back to them.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I havent looked closely at the board on these, are there any other PCB traces between or really near to the SL1 contacts that with a tiny scratch could be shorted to?
<br/>
<br/>
That said, could flashme not be modified to shut down/low power all hardware that draws power other than what is essential to give a status display and actually flash the firmware? (I am betting it already does this though - so its back to OOT fuses imho)

My dear people...
<br/>
<br/>
I wrote that because that is what I did. And nothing else. The chips are socketed.
<br/>
<br/>
I was unlucky enough to import a 3rd wave Lite (navy), so when I tried to Flashme it  did the famous "turn off at 1%" trick. When turning it on, all I would get would be the power light. No rescue method worked.
<br/>
<br/>
So I ordered a new one.
<br/>
<br/>
Then I read in the SuperCard forums, that romman posted that you could switch the BIOS chips. Disbelief. First confirmations came in.
<br/>
<br/>
I opened my DSL, indeed, in the upper left quarter of the board there's a socketed chip. Just socketed and sticked to the floor with sticky foam and connected via a easily disconnectable cable. I practiced plugging and unplugging it.
<br/>
<br/>
My second DS Lite (white) came in. Excitement and fear. Open that one up, too. Unplug the bios. Put it into the broken DSL. Attach the battery via sticky tape. Shivers. Turn it on. WOW!!! 
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, SuperPass procedure, start the firmware installer. Unplug the BIOS, put in the broken one. WOW!!! Still displaying something.
<br/>
<br/>
Enter XBXB...WOW!!! Working!!! Find something to short....tin foil...nope....screwdriver....nope....coat hanger...nope. Tweezers finally worked. 100%. Great!!! Put together the two DSLs..
<br/>

Hmm...if you already have some way to get your games onto the DS (Supercard, Flashcarts) then why would you bother buying a chip, opening your DS up and changing the firmware chip?
<br/>
<br/>
You could just open it up and short the contacts safely that way, since the metal thingy is not in the way any more.

FlashMe is a derivative work of the official firmware, and selling copies on firmware chips is likely an infringement of Nintendo's copyright. Xbox modchips are sold with the Cromwell BIOS, which is free software; the DS counterpart would be FWNITRO.

Why do you guys want to solder? You can just open your DS up, short the S1 with something made of metal. Just beware those screws below the rubber feet. I wouldn't solder the fuse in case it's there for a reason and I would not solder the S1 since as far as my belief goes it allows any malware to access the critical areas of your firmware as well, not sure about that, though. But if FlashMe can use that bridge, then so can anyone else, I guess...<br/>_________________<br/>"It's a fool's prerogative to utter truths that no one else will speak."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The method I used to fix my bricked Lite has been tried by another person who had the same problem (i.e: the lite turning off after 1% of flashing) and he further confirmed its plausibility. If anyone has bricked their lites please try this out and let us know if it works!
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, all you need to do is get hold of an M3, first and foremost.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: red">NB:</span> I used the smaller SD version - not mini - it shouldn't make any difference but just to be on the safe side, that proved successful in my case. One thing is certain though - it does NOT work with the F2A Ultra! (Supercard or any others are yet untested)
<br/>
<br/>
Format the memory card and place JUST the flashing tool you used into it. Insert the M3 WITHOUT THE PASSKEY, and boot up while pressing A+B+Start+Select. it should automatically load the flashing tool and allow you to try again. I did this multiple times on the same flashing, so don't worry about turning it off again accidentally.
<br/>
<br/>
Please follow the instructions to the letter, as it's exactly what I did to fix mine. If people can try to further prove or disprove this method's plausibility it would do us all a favour!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I can't say for sure if this will work for everyone, but I revived it from a bricked state by putting in my slim SD (not mini) M3 reader in without the passkey, with JUST the flashing software (no other files but the flashing rom) in the SD card, then turning it on with A+B+start+select.
<br/>
<br/>
My Lite blacked out after 1% the first time, blacked out again at 2%, then flashed all the way. I think the "accidentally touching something you shouldn't" is the best theory, as both of the first two times I flashed it i was really poking around randomly inside the thing. The third time I paid extra attention to how i was touching the jumper inside, and it worked ok.

Confirmed (and thanks for the advice!). I added flashme.nds (V7) as the only file on my M3 (mini SD version) and booted while holding A, B, Select and Start. Flashme resumed and I managed to complete the firmware installation - though not before resetting it two more times!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The method of trying to flash it again and again until it succeeds is still very risky, because if the flashme recovery code (the code that is triggered by A+B+START+SELECT and causes the DS to directly boot from the GBA slot) is not written before your DS turns off unexpectedly, you have a brick. Fortunately, it is the first thing that is written to the firmware, so it still works even if only the first few kb were written, but if your DS turns off before the recovery code is written, you won't be able to rescue your DS lite again!
<br/>
<br/>
I too have a DS Lite, but I won't try to flash it until the cause of the turning-off thing is 100% isolated and there is a secure workaround method. And I wouldn't recommmend trying to flash the Lite at all. At least at the moment.[/u]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So far we've seen that the problem with flashing the lite is that it turns off when SL1 is shorted. The 1% is practically always loaded into it before it can be turned off seeing how you have to short SL1 before it can turn off. This is my theory, however I could be wrong, which is why I encourage all those who have failed a flash to try it out to see if there are any exceptions.
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing worth mentioning is that I flashed my Lite's firmware a second time to enable the bootscreen again (as opposed to directly going to the game selection menu) - and shorting SL1 did nothing to it. I think this shows that the cause of these Lites turning off is likely more software than hardware based. Again, it's just a theory.
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, those who failed to flash their DS Lites without access to another Lite they can open (to use the chip switching method to fix it) don't have much alternative right now, I believe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

following the images... when the right of SL1 and the F1-1 make contact a blackout will occur . Apparently the same thing will happen if the metalic thing making the short in the SL1 touches that metallic thing under the screw (the golden one).
<br/>
<br/>
Seems that this metallic thing is connected with the VR, so basically if you short the SL1 with that thing, the VR will be short too. 
<br/>
<br/>
The author of these articles says that is the reason why (as supposedly has been proven MANY times by some people he mentions) using the erased method is the only method proven to work 100% of the times without any risk of blackouts.
<br/>
<br/>
WOOOHOOOO!!! I think we found a way of safely flashing the DS Lite!!!! Now I'm waiting patiently for my DS Lite to arrive and do this carefully :) At least now we know why the blackout occurs and people can be careful about it.
<br/>

BTW... how the hell do I attach an image to my post??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

From what I understand it is putting an erased around the metal thing you're going to use to short the SL1, leaving only the tip that makes the contact open. This is done to prevent a short with the VR.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That might because the metal is on the casing, not the board. If you look at the "upper" (= removable) part of the cover, you'll see the metal around the GBA slot there. That's what makes the DSL turn off, as far as I've tested it. Or it might be because you either gave a 1st or 2nd wave unit.

Actually, everything is held in the firmware. The BIOS is not writable. The reason you had to reenter everything but the language is due to the way the firmware works. The RTC (real time clock) in the DS is powered by the battery. When you took out the battery to open your DS, the RTC lost the time. Also, there is a bit in the RTC's memory that got cleared. That tells the DS that the RTC time will no longer be correct, so the firmware goes through the whole initialisation again. It skips the language because of the way the init code is written.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, rather than soldering SL1, people may want to use a conductive-ink pen instead. These should be available at electronics stores.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
