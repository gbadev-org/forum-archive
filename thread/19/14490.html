    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay I have a good flashcart for myself (Spent like $120 total), but I have fixed a broken DS and hope to buy two more cards.  Nothing flashy or great.  I'm looking at N-Card 1Gbyte for $29.90.  Is this the cheapest?  Am I missing any of the cons of this card?  Such as EEPROM emulation sucking, etc...  I'm really not familiar with the older/cheaper stuff.  Everything seems to use Micro SD cards now and I really don't care to mess with them and knowing which ones are fast/slow etc etc...  I'd be fine with just 512MB really...
<br/>
btw, before any flames... i've searched, i've read... i'm not a noob.  i am simply starting a discussion.  k?  tks! :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">of course.  looks like the card for me.  new firmwares do autopatching, wut!  using the DS with the linker to emulate a controller/mouse seems like a neat novelty as well.  =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't get the N-Card. I repeat, DON'T. I got the 16gbit (2GBytes) version and I was pleased with it for about 2 months. Instead of complaining like a lil pansy instead I'll make a list of cons:
<br/>
-Homebrew support is not very good (Things like Wolfenstein and WabbitDS dont work)
<br/>
-Very slow (It is USB2.0 but feels like 1.1 and using it on a USB1.1 PC takes about 30 seconds to copy a 500kb file over)
<br/>
-The slot-2 USB cart gets annoying and feels flimsy and doesnt add any good features
<br/>
-Firmware updates are rare
<br/>
-Support for the device isnt very good and if you do get help its some japanese guy you can hardly understand
<br/>
-The whole software for it seems hacked together
<br/>
-The GUI can be skinned, but only the backgrounds and scrollbar color
<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend getting a R4. I do not own one but its the #1 choice of most people I know. Micro SD cards are getting very cheap so your total price is gonna be $55 at the most. FYI I am going to buy one very soon because my ncard is pissing me off.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

However, I do know that even if you use a USB 2.0 compatible device on a USB 1.1 port, you will get USB 1.1 speeds.  That's all there is to it.  If you want it to be faster, use a USB 2.0 port.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

However, it's a possibility (however, I have no basis for this) that the manufacturer may have used <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_1.1#USB_signaling" target="_blank">low speed data rates</a> to cut costs. Perhaps that, coupled with a complex copying technique (USB to GBA slot to DS slot), could cause those kinds of speeds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's reason enough right there. I'm glad I asked. Wonder why that is though?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
