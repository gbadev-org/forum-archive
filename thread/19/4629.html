    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm a big-time n00b here - so forgive me if this has already been answered. I couldn't find the answer earlier when I looked for it.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to get started in making homebrew games, and play some that have already been posted here.  However, I only have a DS and a Mac.  What hardware/flash carts can I get that would work with this setup?
<br/>
<br/>
Are there any Mac guys here that have been able to run their games on their DS?  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">developing on the DS is still probably a few months away, but you can use a standard GBA flash cart to get started. As for mac, I am pretty sure one of the compilers is available for mac, though you may have trouble with some of the other tools.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.landofbob.com" target="_blank">www.landofbob.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Er, if you're looking for GBA flashcarts that can run GBA games on the DS, I believe there's a thread that recommends one or two specific models.  If you want to write DS games, you will have to wait a while.  Timescale is in months, I'd guess.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's what I'm looking for - a GBA flashcart that can run GBA games on the DS.  I've been wanting to try and get into developing my own games for a while, but I didn't buy a GBA because the DS was coming.  Figured I could same some cash that way.  I figure it'll be so long before I can even get GBA games going that I'm not even going to worry about DS games for a while.  I just would like to know which ones I should be looking at, and if my Mac can handle them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you have a Nintendo DS and don't have a GBA, and you want to develop GBA programs to run on your DS, the flash cart you want is EFA Extreme Flash Advance, which kicktrading.ca has. But make sure you can get "Hello World" to show up in <a class="postlink" href="http://emulation.net/gba/" target="_blank">VisualBoyAdvance for Mac</a> before you run out and buy a flash cart.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The flash cart packaging is almost identical to that of commercial games paks, but until I get a DS I can't be sure about compatibility.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
