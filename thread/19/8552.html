    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've had a NDS flashed through the passme device for four months now and it's been working great until last night.
<br/>
<br/>
I purchased Animal Crossing (yes, purchased, not downloaded) and played it for a couple of hours last night. I saved the game, powered down the DS and went to bed. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now this evening when I went to play it after work the DS will not completely power on. I get a little pop from teh speakers, the power light comes on but the displays don't initialize nor does any other sound come out of the unit.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried different cartridge combiniations, pulled the battery and shorted the  connections, then put the battery back in and fully charged it. I also powered it on and tried hitting start+select+a+b a few times to see if that would kick it into gear but no luck.
<br/>
<br/>
I do have a replacement plan on the unit so I can just exchange it, but if I get a newer DS will I need to purchase a newer PassMe (I have a v1.5), and will I possibly suffer from the same problem?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just wondering if Nintendo is stepping up and starting to crack down on modded units with their wifi enabled games. I was about to purchase Mario Kart next chance I get as well, but now I'm not so sure I want to. :(
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else heard of problems like this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, you should be able to restore your DS with the failsafe restore method,  provided you have some means of putting flashme onto a compatible flash cart, that doesn't involve use of your bricked DS.  Start + Select + A + B are the failsafe restore keys.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you mean, my DS will have a FW update to V4 or higher, when i connect tot WFC?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, I don't think that's even possible due to the write protection. The problem is that the games store WFC settings in the firmware. The place the settings get stored in was thought to be unused, and so some of FlashMe's code was put there. The game overwrites the code with the WFC settings, so it won't boot anymore. All you have to do is use the recovery code to run the V5/6 installer and you'll be fine. (You have to short SL1 again though.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm going to bring it into the store today and exchange it under my replacement plan. Hopefully I can get another blue DS and get it flashed again. ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We know that your DS is bricked because of running a wifi game on flashme v4 or below. We know that flashme has recovery code built in to allow you to restore flashme if your DS is bricked. I believe that it would be very easy for you (With a flash card) to recover your DS.

Being 'bricked' after running a WFC game with old flashme should be 100% recoverable, if you follow the instructions. (both on the flashme site, and given by previous posters in this thread)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yup. I followed all the instructions on the flashme sites without any success. I tried adding the loader and every different combination I could without any success. There wasn't any response from the unit in any way.
<br/>
<br/>
I grabbed a new one just a few minutes ago. It was in the very back of Best Buy's lockup and pretty dusty. The guy kinda looked at me funny when I asked for that one. I haven't tried flashing it yet, but if I have to buy a new Passme I'm not going to cry, they're pretty inexpensive.

My bricked DS had a couple of scratches in the touchscreen anyways. ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

More recent version of flashme, maybe?<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC

I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.

Thank you, everyone, I look forward to taking advantage of your work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Popping a game in either slot doesn't cause any reaction within Pictochat, is that a good thing? :D
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to flash it again, but can't remember exactly how I got it to work last time. I cleared my Ezflash 2, burned just the flash.nds to it and it's just giving me dual white screens. I tried burning the NDS loader on as well, but that didn't help matters much.  
<br/>
<br/>
I also burned a DS game to the flashcart with the loader and get the same problem, is this an indication that I need a new passme?
<br/>
<br/>
*edit: Just read tepples' sig and it flashed yellow, so off to the passme store i go. :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
By "no reaction" do you mean it freezes? If it freezes you have "old" firmware. If the screens turn blue or gree, you have "old" firmware. If the screens turn yellow or magenta, you have "new" firmware and need a PassMe2. If nothing at all happens, make sure that you inserted the card <span style="font-style: italic">before</span> you turned on the power. (To get to Pictochat if you have a game inserted and your DS is set on automatic startup, hold Select+Start while you turn on the power.)

Make sure to disable header patching and disable the loader or menu or multi-ROM. Also, when you burn the .nds loader together with a .nds file, don't add them as two separate ROMs. (If you do, the flashing software will probably add a loader that is designed to work in GBA mode.) Instead, do

Tepples should add magenta to his sig along with yellow, as yellow is NDS-V4 and magenta is NDS-V5, both of which require a 2-series Pass device.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
