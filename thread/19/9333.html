    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there anyway to use ScummVM Ds on the M3 SD, Me and My friend Purchased the SD version since we have tons of SD cards lying around. When I boot Scumm It tells me CF Driver not found. Im assumming it is dude to Scumm Being compiled with the Movie Player driver which can only handle CF.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If the file system driver doesn't support your card, then you need to build ScummVM as if you were building for a traditional (NOR) flash cart, and you won't be able to play talkies or anything else over 30 MB.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
