    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi folks,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just getting into a bit of NDS homebrew (having never owned a GB/GBA), and I thought I'd post my setup for posterity as I found it somewhat troublesome getting it going.  I bought an ezpass2 and a SuperCard CF adapter and there didn't seem to be much info about using these two devices.  Most of the advice was for the passme2 with supercard or M3, and the ezpass web site isn't that great.
<br/>
<br/>
The main problem I had was that I was using Project Rub (E) as my original cart, and pepsiman's SRAM writer didn't seem to have the Project Rub (E) code on it (which is APRP).  However, the ezpass2 list <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ezflash.cn/pass2/list.html" target="_blank">here</a> has both a JED file and a SAV file.  I finally stumbled across <a class="postlink" href="http://scdev.org/index.php?cat=info&amp;tutorial=flashme_passme2" target="_blank">these</a> instructions, which contain a link to an SRAM writer (IQSRAM).  I used it to write my SAV file to the SRAM of my SuperCard, and wrote the JED file to my ezpass2 following the instructions <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ezflash.cn/pass2/step.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Then I put my ezpass2 into the DS slot and quickly switched the NDS off and then on again, and the SuperCard's menu came up and I was able to play .gba.nds files (renamed .ds.gba files)!
<br/>
<br/>
In hindsight, it wasn't all that complicated, but after I received my ezpass2 &amp; supercard it just felt like there was a lot of magic going on and I didn't really know what was happening!
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this will be useful to someone else..
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if the "saver" menu option in the SuperCard's menu is supposed to write to the SRAM?  I tried it a couple of times but it didn't seem to do anything useful (although it did say it was writing the .SAV file).
<br/>
<br/>
cheers
