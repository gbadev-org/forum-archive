    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am able to establish a complete connection with both dsftp and combox servers with wep disabled, (I can connect to the AP with 128 wep, but for some reason can't get any clients to hit the server afterwards) and can save large files to my pc with both servers with no problems at all. The problems start when I try sending anything larger than a 256k file to my ds. After the file transfers, the server quacks, and upon restarting the server and reconnecting, the only thing saved to the sd is a 0 byte file. Now because both servers behave so similarly regarding this situation, I suspect the dldi driver is at fault, but I wanted to hear some others experiences with ftp and the m3 sd's before I try to contact their support.
