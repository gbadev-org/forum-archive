    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I know that some people have succesfully flashed their FW5 DSes with Flashme v6, but I'm still reluctant to do it because Flashme doesn't recognize the FW and tells me that it may not be possible to restore the original firmware...
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any ongoing work to add FW5 support to Flashme? Would it be useful? Can I do something to help? (I've got a SuperCard SD and SuperPassme 2)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">im guessing that the reason flashme says that is because V5 of DS firmware was only recently discovered, and Flashme v6 was made before that time. I'd say that you MIGHT want to wait, im not sure. Ask the person who made flashme for details on this (loopy, i think)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have now run it and it saved a 256kB file on my SD. I'll try to contact Loopy and see if he has any use for it...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Has Loopy looked in that FW5 yeat to add support in <a class="postlink" href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/" target="_blank">FlashMe</a>?
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any big differences between FW5 and FW4?<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Excellent! I have just flashed my fw5 DS (it was a bit hard to make the SL1 contact, but otherwise all went fine)... It's such a pleasure not to have to use the superpassme 2 anymore :). (That, and getting rid of the health screen.)

<br/>
Thanks a lot!

(haven't tried unflashme, though... I wasn't sure if there was a confirmation request, and didn't want to reflash my DS)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's the same XBXB confirmation as FlashMe. noflashme.nds flashes the unprotected portion first, then the protected portion. (Reverse of FlashMe.) You don't short for noflashme until about 70% or so.
<br/>
<br/>
If you run noflashme and stop/poweroff when it stops for you to short, you can still recover to flashme with the A+B+Select+Start emergency recovery code. (I had to do this once when I was messing around with noflashme, preparing it and flashme for flashing and possibly unflashing a couple friends' DSes. I mistakenly hit XBXB and bricked my DS. Because of this, I discovered that the emergency recovery code with a SupercardSD and latest SC firmware can actually boot to the SC menu.)<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Welcome to the Bricker proof DS club.  The last 8 pages of your firmware chip should be the only ones writable in that case.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
