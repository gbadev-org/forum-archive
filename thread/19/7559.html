    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think I roasted it.  Entirely.  I'll start from the start.  I have a grey DS with the older flashme loaded.  I got it on there via wifime and my gbamp with the older version of that firmware.  So fast forward to today.  I'm overjoyed to plop in mario kart and see if it recognizes my router and bam!  It froze trying to test the connection.  So far so good right?  I have a brick with a green power light.  So I try the recovery hotkeys, no good.  Try them again, A + B + Start + Select.  Try all kinds of keys.  Finally I took Mario Kart out of the cartridge slot and viola!  I have life, er maybe half-life.  It boots into GBA mode with static/snow looking crap around the boarder ring.  So I'm thinking all is good.  I look up various boards and see that I should upgrade to the latest GBAMP firmware (v2).  So I do it (I think).  Problem was that it kept booting into the GBAMP menu and ignoring _BOOT_MP.NDS.  Oh well, at least I had SOMETHING.  But then I got tricky and reran the GBAMP flashing program and this time opted to repair instead of flash.  So it did it and looked successful then I rebooted BOOM!  Instant brick, no longer will the DS respond to the recovery keys or anything really.  Still get green lights.  No backlights.  Nothing on the screens.  Just a brick.  
<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, when I updated the GBAMP firware, it rebooted with a white screen and backlight on top and no backlight on the bottom but on the bottom the screen was showing the GBAMP menu.  
<br/>
<br/>
So guys, any solution to this brick?  Isn't it a bit of an impossiblity?  Impossible to brick a NDS by:
<br/>
<br/>
A: simply trying to update a GBAMP
<br/>
B: NOT shorting S1
<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't the recovery code live in the part of the firmware protected by S1?  I've been messing with this for several hours and I am now quite frusterated.  Yes it has plenty of a charge on the battery.  Any help would be great.[u][/u]</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by geordy on Thu Dec 01, 2005 9:00 pm; edited 4 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Your NDS is probably fine, since you CAN'T delete data on the write-protected recovery code part, but that's still weird.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you somehow physically damaged it, but don't have a clue how could it happen. You should *try* to use your warranty ...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know why you were trying to do all that..  All you should have needed to do was put FlashMe.nds on your CF as _BOOT_MP.nds, put the GBA MP (with any firmware upgrade), and hold the recovery keys.
<br/>
<br/>
Because you had not shorted SL1 at any time, I'd guess your DS is still fine.  But, if you messed up your GBA MP, the only way I know to fix the firmware is to use another GBA MP, but you might want to put the latest update (e19) onto the root of the CF, and boot into GBA Mode.  When it asks if you want to apply the upgrade, select "yes" (A I belive) and let it update.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, reboot into GBA Mode and see if the GBA MP boots as it normally would.  If it does, put Chishm's current firmware update on it, and run that again.  This should put the GBA MP back to a usable state for NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, copy FlashMe.nds to the CF and rename it _BOOT_MP.nds.  Again, boot the DS holding the recovery buttons.
<br/>
<br/>
You will need to short SL1 for this to work, as the current version has moved the FlashMe code to a new location.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

geordy,
<br/>
<br/>
   I have the same exact situation. I had FlashMe on my DS and V2 of flashmp on my GBAMP. I started playing MarioKart on my DS and while connecting, it froze. I turned it off and when I tried to turn it back on, only the green power light came on. When I insert my GBAMP in my DS and hold the recovery keys (A + B + START + SELECT) it boots up with the top screen with full backlight but pure white screen and the lower screen with no backlight but complete picture. I also did the repair function and used my GBA SP to reflash my GBAMP. The problem is just as you said: It won't boot anything except the GBAMP. it will NOT load with anything plugged into the DS port (including PassMe) I have found out that if you insert the GBAMP and use the recovery keys, wait for the GameBoy logo to display, then pull out the GBAMP and insert another GBA game it will then start the GBA game. I also discovered I can plug my GBAMP into my GBA/DS Max Drive and start my DS with the recovery keys. I'm running out of ideas. is there anyway to fool the GBA/DS Max Drive? I mean it does have onboard memory for DS saves and GBA codes afterall.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Guard your gameboys guys!  I'm on a roll of destruction.  Looks like I bricked my GBAMP now too.  Perhaps I'm jumping to conclusions but I attempted to downgrade the firmware.  It appeared to go sucessfully but now it doesn't boot the menu.  It boots the gameboy logo screen and then it blackscreens.  Now if I remove the CF card, I get the warning screen but that does me little good.  I have included the _BOOT_MP.gba file on the cf card, I defragged it.  No go.  I even tried renaming the flashme to _BOOT_MP.nds (and defragging of course) and that would not boot either (obviously).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, having fun talking to myself here.  I have unbricked my GBAMP now by putting Update.e19 on the card and renaming the flash_mp.gba _boot_mp.gba.  But now I'm back to the latest version of the GBAMP firmware again which my ds doesn't seem to like.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to downgrade my firmware to v1 and see if my DS recognizes it again?  Am I just fooked?  No one else is having problems with a bricked NDS not reconizing an updated GBAMP?  IF so, speak up.  I don't want to be alone with this problem.
<br/>
<br/>
To clarify, right now I have a working GBA, a GBAMP functioning with the latest chisholm v2 firmware and a bricked DS not responding to the A + B + Start + Select.  It stopped responding when I updated the GBAMP firmware.

   I'm still having the same problem as you. just as a test, start your DS with the GBAMP inserted and press A+B+START+SELECT and when you start to see the GameBoy logo quickly remove the GBAMP and insert a regular GBA game and see if the game starts (with no backlighting though). As far as I can tell we're having identical issues.

<br/>
One issue I should mention that you've probably heard in the latest hack.  The upper screen is white with backlight and the lower has the data with no backlight.  Very strange since my default screen IS the upper one for GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
So Chishm (if you are still listening) I need to ask something.  Even though both screens are in different modes of activity, it's still in arm7 mode, right?  In other words, whatever controls the backlights and which screen has info displayed is controlled by something else, right?  I'm kind of curious if this is a bug in your mp firmware or if it's a bug of your mp firmware's interaction with the bricked ds firmware.  Your v1 hacked mp firmware displayed properly on the correct screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Can you think of any reasons that the v2 firmware would not load a _BOOT_MP.NDS file on my bricked DS?  It just loads up as if the file is not there.  Not a pause, not a hicup.  It's as if it doesn't even stop to check if there is a _BOOT_MP.NDS file present.  
<br/>
<br/>
If there was a corrupted/bad file named _BOOT_MP.NDS, would your loader ignore it and continue to load the GBAMP firmware or would it crash?  Doesn't your loader blindly load whatever is in that file without any error checking function?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The screens shouldn't be going like that. On my DS, they work either way, with the GBA set to top or bottom. The screens are determined before switching to GBA mode. If the DS is starting the cart in GBA mode without switching the screens, then this would explain both problems (not starting the boot file and incorrect display)

<br/>
What would be your recommended way for me to backdate the firmware to v1?  The screens don't seem to go funny in v1.
<br/>
<br/>
What I did last time was:
<br/>
<br/>
-run update.e17
<br/>
-run ndsmp.gba (selecting bootstrap not repair)
<br/>

Would e17 be the ideal base for v1 or does it really matter?  I want to try to backdate and do all caps on the _BOOT_MP.NDS.  It seems like I tried it before but I'm not sure.
<br/>
<br/>
One more strange occurance I need to mention.  When I backdated to v1 last time, it did NOT seem that I required _BOOT_MP.gba to enter the menu.  I tried it with only a _BOOT_MP.nds file on the card and it still booted.   I wonder if v2 overwrote something in v1 that does not get rewritten by v1.  (I hope all that makes sense still)  Thanks for being a sport.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just backdated to v1 (by first applying e17 and then running flashmp_mb.gba) and have confirmed that I'm not needing _BOOT_MP.gba to run the GBAMP menu.  I can put in a blank CF card and it runs fine.  Something seems fishy.  I know this firmware was not necessarily designed to be downgraded but...  Somehow in the midst of all of my upgrades and downgrades I think I've lost the ability to run _BOOT_MP.GBA OR _BOOT_MP.NDS.  
<br/>
<br/>
I'm back to running on the proper screen now however.   That problem travels exclusively with the Chishm hack.  When I load v2 the screens get messed up.  Then I can run through e13-e19 and the screens are still screwed up.  Then when I load v1, the screen returns to normal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The _BOOT_MP.GBA file was a workaround for the crappy way v1 would run in GBA mode. Basically, it would search the directory until it got to the end, or until it found a boot file. If you had a large root directory and no boot file, it would lock up (this is due to the CPLD protecting the GBAMP firmware from pirating). You should still be able to rename another multiboot GBA ROM as _BOOT_MP.GBA and have it boot up.

<br/>
No I don't have any other flashcarts. As they say, necessity is the mother of all invention (or something like that), so I created the hack to run NDS code.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

   I would only brick your DS if you have a flash cart. It seems that because the GBAMP will only boot to the main menu, that it's almost impossible to run .nds extensions as far as I know anyway. Do you own a GBA/DS Max Drive by any chance? is does have USB access and it has onboard memory. and firmware updates. I wonder if it would be possible to boot a DS with just the GBA/DS Max Drive? Maybe it's just wishful thinking on my part.

   I downgraded to the Version 1 GBAMP Flash hack and I have the same as you: Fully lit upper screen (default GBA screen on my DS) as well as the "snow" around the upper border but nothing on the lower screen of course. I still have my PassMe and I'm trying anything and everything to unbrick my DS.

<br/>
1. buy a flash cart

2. manually flash the firmware (involves opening DS, soldering, and connecting a cable to your PC's parallel port) - instructions here: <a href="http://darkfader.net/ds/files/ppflash.zip" target="_blank">http://darkfader.net/ds/files/ppflash.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
If you buy a flash cart, i suggest getting the smallest &amp; cheapest one you can find.
<br/>
These guys have one for $55: <a href="http://www.kicktrading.ca/product_info.php?cPath=21&amp;products_id=28" target="_blank">http://www.kicktrading.ca/product_info.php?cPath=21&amp;products_id=28</a>
<br/>
But it is 256mbit...you may be able to find an older 64mbit cart for cheaper. Also they only ship to north america i believe, so you'll need to find somewhere else if you are in europe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My DS is currently in pieces awaiting successful ppflashing, since I don't have a flash cart. Ohhh, the irony, if I had known this when I choose a GBAMP over a Flashcart... It's at least comforting to know that my DS isn't bricked beyond help, and if ppflash doesn't work, I can get a flashcart. I hope someone looks into a solution for this.

Chism, you should ask olimar what the recovery process is actually doing, ask for code and see if you can see why it doesn't work with the GBAMP.

   I got my EZ-Flash II Powerstar USB 128Mbit Dev Kit today and after doing some thinking I was able to get DS working with FlashMe V5 installed. I'm currently trying to intentionally "brick" my DS again to try again with GBAMP. But what I did with this flash cart is:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Installed drivers
<br/>
2. Charged flashcart for 10 hours (they only require 8 but I was out for most of the day anyway).
<br/>
3. Put flashme.nds and ndsloader.bin in "c:\flash" 
<br/>
4. Click Start-&gt;Run and type "cmd" if you are using Windows 2000 or XP, or type "command" if you are using Windows 95, 98 or ME 
<br/>
In the box that opens type "cd c:\flash" 
<br/>
5. Type "copy /b ndsloader.bin + flashme.nds flashme.nds.gba" 
<br/>
6. Flash flashme.nds.gba to your flash cart, by itself, without any other loaders.
<br/>
7. Inserted PassMe and Flash Cart into my DS and pressed "A + B + START + SELECT" then Power and it booted to the FlashMe screen.
<br/>
8. Shorted the SL1 pads with the blunt end of a 7/64 drill bit.
<br/>
9. Brought my DS back to life.
<br/>

Insert GBAMP only, _NO_ PassMe. It doesn't seem to matter what you have on the cf card. Hold A + B + Start + Select and turn it on (yes, it's hard to do with only 2 hands, but it's possible). You should be greeted with the GBA intro animation on the bottom screen without backlight and some jittering, and a white backlit top screen.

That's good to know. Sorry about the delay, but I was kind of distracted by other projects. It was a simple fix, I just needed to wait for the CF card to initialise before trying to read it. This wasn't a problem in the normal startup mode because the DS is delayed while initialising everything. This gives the card enough time to initialise. However, in recovery mode it jumps straight to the GBA MP firmware, and the CF card doesn't have enough time to initialise. That's why I have added a wait loop.
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this will also fix some CF cards that didn't work before (they may have taken longer to startup).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, it doesn't work, here's what I did.
<br/>
<br/>
I flashed the gbamp with the new update, repair thing. I couldn't make it work with the DS. It gives me a black screen in the gba if I run it with card, and the "please insert card" message if ran without card, but it hangs on that screen, and I cannot continue.
<br/>
<br/>
I used my xboo to flash it with the non-repair thing, and it's all the same. Black screen.
<br/>
<br/>
My observations on the DS with the recovery code might not be entirely accurate, as the DS currently is in a soon-to-be-ppflashed stage, meaning I have to hold in the battery, s wire into a hole to short a connection, and A+B+Start+Select. Not an easy task.
<br/>
<br/>
The gba on the other hand is completely functioning, and it's the same in a working DS's gba mode.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
<br/>
After further investigations, I've found out some new stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Installing e19 on the gbamp and then the latest chishm driver solved the not-working-in-gba problem. It boots flashme in the working DS, but not in the broken one. I'm pretty sure I'm holding everything that should be held in in, but all I get is 2 black screens.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Meh, the flash card will allow you to use ds.gba things, something the GBAMP won't allow you to do. So, that's the added benefit of having a flash card.

<br/>
Thoop, here's a very stupid question but, are you booting with a passme? or no? I didn't see anything that said you were or not. It's possible I missed it.
<br/>
<br/>
There's one thing you should keep in mind while trying to run DS code with flashme installed, or by using a passme.
<br/>
<br/>
The GBAMP will NOT boot any NDS file unless there is a _BOOT_MP.NDS file in the root directory of the CF. It will only boot in GBA mode.. However, it's possible the GBAMP in GBA mode will not boot (past the GBA bios logo) unless you have _BOOT_MP.GBA in the main root directory as well. (is this correct chishm?)
<br/>
<br/>
So when trying to recover, keep those things in mind.
<br/>
<br/>
If all else fails, you're probably going to have to figure out ppflash, as that's going to be the only method you could use to recover your DS.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

A program for the GBAMP can be much larger than a .ds.gba program, given that 1. there aren't Free drivers for all the GBA ROMs' bank switching and 2. a SuperCard adapter ($50) and a cheap 2 Gbit CF card ($20) cost the same as a 256 Mbit NOR card ($70).

It used to be true until chishm started releasing early versions of firmware hack version 2.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well tssf and tepples covered most of what was asked, but I still have somethings to add. Not booting into NDS mode means it is still not initialising the compact flash card. Then black screens in GBA mode means it has locked the GBAMP's firmware, due to the many CF reads performed while waiting for it to become ready. This is an unfortunate side effect of the delay, but shouldn't occur when everything is working normally.
<br/>
<br/>
I suggest you try another CF card (but don't bother buying one). Also, if you can, try compiling the source yourself. You'll need DevKitPro r17 and the source in the file. You can increase the delay by increasing the number on line 454, (i &lt; 1000000). Try adding an extra 0 to increase the wait to about 10 seconds. If that doesn't work, then something else is wrong that I haven't figured out yet.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
