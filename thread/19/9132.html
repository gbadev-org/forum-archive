    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">im planning on getting a dslite most-likely may 7th when its rumored to come out or atleast when it does 
<br/>
because importing it is to expensive although i might get tired of waiting and do it anyway
<br/>
anyway some people say it cant use flashme others say it can  so can it?
<br/>
how hard is it to get to the lite's sl1?
<br/>
i also heard that the flashme firmware disables the selectable brightnesss of the screen will the flashme firmware be updated with this? 
<br/>
is it planned? and/or being worked on?
<br/>
also i hear you messup with flash me and void the warrenty and it bricked well cant you exchange it to say like ebgames or something would they notice
<br/>
<br/>
thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Please use punctutation and capital letters.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS Lite can use flashme although there have been a couple of reports that the DS has switched itself off and bricked itself.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS Lites SL1 is just as easy to get to as a DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Flashme doesn't have a way of changing the brightness and it is 'stuck' at the last selected brightness level.
<br/>
<br/>
EBgames tend not to notice, but I imagine this is kinda fraud and so illegal.
<br/>
Even if you don't mess up with flashme you void your warrenty.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

If no one can read or understant your post, then no one will bother to reply to your post.  I think I gave up reading your first post after the 4th or 5th line.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you look on the MoonShell website, there's a special DS Lite version of MoonShell that has the added function of toggling the different brightness levels of the DS Lite's...er...Lite.  I *think* MoonLight may have released a seperate example NDS with source code for this also.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I'll let anyone know should my DS Lite brick itself.  I managed to snag one for a non-ridicoulous price, though I've not recieved it quite yet.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
