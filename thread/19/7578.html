<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be a prob with download play using a FlashMe'd DS and a Non-FlashMe'd DS, as discribed here:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.m3-forum.com/viewtopic.php?t=261" target="_blank">http://www.m3-forum.com/viewtopic.php?t=261</a>
<br/>
(It's not only MKDS specific, other titles are affected as well)
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder, if it's the removed RSA signature check for WMB used in FlashMe, causing this trouble !?
<br/>
Or is it just M3-specific ? Anyone having probs using another flash-cards ?
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Loopy can help about this and release an optional FlashMe-Version with RSA-WMB still intact ?
<br/>
<br/>
Best greetings from good old Germany
<br/>

Downloading a ROM that has been patched to run from the GBA slot doesn't work, as the signature is wrong.
<br/>
If you want to use download play, buy the game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
