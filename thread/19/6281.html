    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering how easy it is to get the EZFlash III 1 GB to work with DS homebrew software, and also if it means 1 gigabyte of space, or 1 gigabit?
<br/>
<br/>
I assume it's gigabyte since it's capitals, but I just want to be sure before I buy it because 1 gigabit is much different than 1 gigabyte.

Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
