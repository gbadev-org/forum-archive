    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Magic Key 2/3 is equivelent to PassMe1
<br/>
<br/>
PassMe1 will NOT work on newer DS models, and this includes ALL DSLites.
<br/>
You need either a 'PassMe2' or a 'NoPass'.
<br/>
PassMe1 can be upgraded to PassMe2, but I don't know if anyone has tried it with a MagicKey (probably since they suck :P )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
