I'm guessing you're suggesting that someone should hack a USB port into the DS.  To me, it seems like this wouldn't be very helpful, since it would take quite a hack, and even then would only work for people who were willing to perform surgery on their DS.  It might be useful as a debugging tool, but I don't see much else.  It would be better to figure out the wireless interface and use that if you want a direct PC&lt;-&gt;DS connection, since it's already built in.  Hopefully someone will make progress with that soon...

What did you have in mind for an NDS USB port?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
