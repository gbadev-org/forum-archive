    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, I am using an xrom/little writer along with my superpass. I have downloaded the flashme.nds file but when i try to flash it to my xrom card in little writer it tells me there is an error and no game ect. What do i need to do to get this corrected? Also should I wait to install flash me until a version comes out that doesnt conflict with the upcoming wifi games?
