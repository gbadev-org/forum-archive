    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a DS that I bought on release day, a GIGABYTE Wireless card, and an M3. I wish to install the new DS Firmware, and play some homebrew games. But all this stuff with PassMe2's and SRAM writes and game codes scares me. Can anyone give an explanation in plain, simple (American) English? Since I got my DS so early, does it concern me?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, does the Pictochat Menu/ Download play menu show up after you flash your firmware?
<br/>
<br/>
What can't I do after I flash my firmware?
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyway to flash back to your original nintendo firmware?
<br/>
<br/>
What can and can't I do with the M3?
<br/>
<br/>
My real hope is to run SNES games on my DS. Which SNES emulator is furthest along? What do I have to do to run it?
<br/>
<br/>
Moonshell?
<br/>
<br/>
When I remember looking at the two types of M3's (CF and SD), the SD's were sold out, but the CF's were still there. Are the SD versions superior in any way?
<br/>
<br/>
Does v5 FlashMe work with Animal Crossing(wifi connection)?
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can still use the DS as normal after installing FlashMe v5.  You don't lose any features, you only gain some (iQue DS will lose ability to run iQue games but that won't effect most people).
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't used it but I think this is the latest Snes emulator: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~tew/snesDS/" target="_blank">snesDS</a>.  From what i've heard, it is very limited.
<br/>
<br/>
Animal Crossing will work fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Moonshell is mostly for playing MP3s but it can view text files and certain video formats aswell.
<br/>
<br/>
M3 SD is slightly smaller than M3 CF and uses SD cards but I don't think it has any other advantage.  M3 SD is newer, so it's not as compatible with homebrew since most people don't have one or know how to support it yet but eventually it will should be just as compatible as the CF version.
<br/>
<br/>
divineo.cn has both M3 versions in stock but if you have a new DS, you may need a PassMe2 and the PassKey1 won't be much use to you unless you have a jtag cable to convert it to PassKey2.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello there. I've been reading this forum for couple of weeks, so I want to check some things, in case I've understoond everything correctly. 
<br/>
<br/>
I bought my silver DS at late 11/05 with Mario Kart Ds bundle.  Then I checked my serial no. at: </span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">http://www.dspassme.com/dstrackerlist.shtml</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
and it seems I have the oldest firmware (it starts with NEF107***** and I live in southern Europe). Now the questions:
<br/>
<br/>
I've already played mario kart with wifi option in my ds. Can I install the FlashMe v5 without any bricking problems? Mario Kart doesn't auto update firmware right? It just writes some wifi options.
<br/>
<br/>
Can I install FlashMe v5 with a wireless pci card having Ralink 2500 chipset? (no superpass, but a cartridge)
<br/>
<br/>
A FlashMe'd DS with a cartridge (eg. m3) will be always able to be restored in case of a malware rom? And that's because to write in the protected area it is necessary to make contact SL1 (which can't be done by any rom)?
<br/>
<br/>
I hope the answer to all those is yes. Please correct me. Thanx</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, flashme v5 works fine with the current online games.  They don't update the firmware, just store wifi options.

If you have a DS with old firmware then you can send WifiMe using WMB to the DS and it will try to run code from a GBA cart.  I don't think it will work with M3 though, I couldn't get it working in the short time I tested, so I just used the PassKey that came with it.

Once the failsafe is installed, it is always possible to restore but it may not work with the M3.   I think because the menu it loads might not work with most of your firmware missing, so there is no way to select flashme.nds.  On a normal flash cart, flashme can just be launched on boot, so it works fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
