    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If all you have is a GBAMP v2, then you'll need a pass through method of some kind. The current tech is SLOT-1 flash cards, which can be used to start a SLOT-2 card in NDS mode or used on their own to run homebrew from.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So there's no way to do it without a slot-1 card then? No firmware hacks or anything?
<br/>
<br/>
And if not then will a Datel Games 'n Music DS work as a slot-1 card, as that is the most readily available to me (via walmart XD)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You need a SLOT-1 card to hack the firmware, so yes, you need a SLOT-1 card. The GnM will work as a pass through and can also be used for running homebrew. I don't have one, so you may need to wait for someone who does to post to see what it's like.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, thanks for the help chishm, kind of disappointed I can't run NDS homebrew yet lol. Oh well will have to just go buy a slot-1 card XD
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah if someone reads this and can tell me what the Games n Music DS is like, that'd be great.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Games n' Music DS adapter fits in SLOT-1 and has a slot for the microSD card. The adapter comes packaged with a 128 MB SD card, an SD writer, and a CD full of DS homebrew. If you boot the GnM in a DS without the microSD card installed, it'll start your GBA Movie Player or other SLOT-2 card in DS mode. If you boot the GnM in the DS with the microSD card inserted, it'll go into a primitive file browser that can play .mp3 and .nds files straight from the microSD card.

A big box store is still selling them for $20. Lately, I've been telling other shoppers that the card turns a DS into a computer and showing them DSOrganize to prove it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
