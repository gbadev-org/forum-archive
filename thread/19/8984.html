    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I recently got myself an M3 CF and a wifime compatible NIC.
<br/>
My DS have the the V2 Firmware, but I'm not getting Flashme to work through WMB.
<br/>
<br/>
I placed the wifime.zip file in the data folder of the WMB app, and I'm starting it by entering wmb.exe -data wifime and it starts without any errors. The flashme.nds file is copied to the CF card. The app is showing, but after the downloading process the Nintendo logo is shown and then both of the screens turns white. I've tried it with two different CF cards, same result. I do not own a passme or similar and I wouldn't like to spend more money than I already have on this. Does anybody know how to solve this?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as I know the M3 menu/firmware isn't compatible with wifime.  You can ask M3 to fix it but they won't do it anytime soon and i'm not sure if it's actually possible.  You could learn to make your own firmware but that's no easy task.  You could try finding someone in your area that will flash your DS for free but that's too much hassle for most people.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Doesn't an M3 CF new in box come with a passkey2?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
