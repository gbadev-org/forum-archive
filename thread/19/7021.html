    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I looked at this <a class="postlink" href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">list</a> and pikced up the Zonet ZEW1601 since it was the cheapest on the list I could find. Now I am having troubles trying to install the custom drivers. Windows XP will automatically detect the adaptor and install the drivers all on its own and doesn't give me a chance to specify what drivers I want to install. Can anyone help me to install the custom drivers manually wihtout WinXP automatically doing it? Hopefully when I have the done I can start transmitting these demos I really want to try out.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">open the start menu and right click on "My Computer", now click properties. Go to the "Hardware" tab and click the device manager button. If the default drivers for the card were installed, they will be under "Network adapters" on that list, right click on the card and choose "Update Driver", then use these options on the wizerd:
<br/>
<br/>
No, not this time
<br/>
Install from a list or specific location
<br/>
Search for the best driver in these locations
<br/>
Uncheck search removable media
<br/>
Check include this location in the search
<br/>
Click browse and navigate to where you have the drivers saved and click ok
<br/>
<br/>
