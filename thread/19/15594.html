It looks like ncard is "lite"-only (bleh) and has poor homebrew support, and at the *only* place I seem to be able to find AceKard RPG it's over $90 after shipping (not that I'd want to spend money on a MicroSD-supporting device anyway).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh wait, looks like the ncard *does* sometimes come in a normal-DS-compatible version.
<br/>
<br/>
But I've been seeing somewhat conflicting reports on homebrew compatibility for it. Anyone have any comments on that? And anyone recommend a retailer where I can *know* that I'll get the non-"lite" version?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.

Maybe I should contact the N-Card people and see what they think.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's an N-Card clone called the F-Card that comes with a USB writer instead of the slot-2 cartridge, so that would be compatible with an original DS for sure.  It's also faster.  Dealextreme sells that as well as a few different versions of the N-Card and Firelink.  One version (the one that says "with rumble") has a standard GBA sized slot-2 cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Early on, the N-Card DLDI driver only supported reading, not writing, but there's been new drivwers released since then that support both and also unaligned, I think.  I don't know of any other homebrew problems with N-Card clones.
<br/>
<br/>
Another slot-1 card with fixed memory that hasn't been mentioned yet is the G6 DS Real.  It has some nice features like support for MediaPlayExtend and probably for the upcoming Sakura GUI.  I think it's more expensive the N-Cards, though.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I found something called the "K6" that looks like an N-Card clone. Any reason to avoid this one? The pictures I found of it look like the linker is a non-"lite" one. Anyone know whether or not a "lite"-only version of the K6 was ever made?
<br/>
<br/>
(I was wondering because if there isn't a "lite"-only version of K6, I could order that instead of the N-Card and not risk getting a linker that'd be useless to me.)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.
