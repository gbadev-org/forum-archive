    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ran searches for Max Media Dock but the results were pretty slim.
<br/>
<br/>
Is using the media launcher with the media dock both from Datel a common combination?
<br/>
<br/>
Seems as if most folks are combining the media launcher with another device for the GBA slot.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm mainly interested in running the homebrew email application and ScummV, and I read in a few places that the media dock allows for "select homebrew apps" to run.
<br/>
<br/>
From what I've been able to learn so far, the device which goes in the DS slot passes control to the GBA slot while keeping the DS-related components turned on (the extra processor, for example). The device in the GBA slot is simply the storage device which holds the code you wish to run.
<br/>
<br/>
The Max Media Dock takes a CF card. Are there any limitations to using CF-based devices or the Max Media Dock in general?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any assistance / input.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No RAM and it isn't as compatible with current homebrew as a Supercard or M3.  I also recommend a Passcard 3 instead of Max Media Launcher, although if you are going to install flashme, just get whatever is cheaper after postage.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why the passcard 3? More robust than the Media Launcher?
<br/>
Installing flashme negates either after it's done though? Once you flash the DS you no longer need either?

I don't have a passcard 3 or MML.  MML is usually around $5 cheaper but that's before postage.  It also has an updatable firmware but that hasn't been used for anything yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Apparently MML has these minor negatives that Passcard3 doesn't have:
<br/>
<br/>
- If you close the lid without turning off, the NDS will not sleep, the speakers click and the screen blinks on and off.  If you remove the MML and connect a DS game then sleep mode should work.
<br/>
<br/>
- The MML splash screen is unnecessary and just increases boot time by a second or two.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Any preference as to the supercard VS M3?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
