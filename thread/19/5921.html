I had this line several times already....don't know exactly why though but I guess it had something to do with the CF-card.
<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate your work. Can't wait for it.

Once you have a first built posted, would you mind when I mention it at the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.lik-sang.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=22" target="_blank">"Lik Sang GBA Movie Player"-forum</a>? I would just make a thread linking to this one......knowing the guys over there ,i can say they will go nuts of happyness. ^_^

Do you have a supercard to mess about with.
<br/>
<br/>
Aparently the GBAMP is a ripoff of the SC
<br/>
<br/>
Some guy broke apart his SC and it has 3 chips rather than the 2 on the GBAMP. Might mean there is more potential for stuff and things
<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping someone would start hacking these CF things as SC wont currently work with passme or wifime :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

AFAIK, its the other way round. GBAMP came out before the SC.
<br/>
<br/>
And on a side note, Will a GBAMPv2 be needed for your custom code Darkfader? Or can I just keep my GBAMPv1 and order a passME?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks either way! Buying a GBAMPv2 beats the hell out of paying a load for a flashcart.<br/>_________________<br/>"All Your Megadrive Are Belong to Us"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, that's what I learned as well.. The SC only has the additional "ram" to allow it to load GBA games over 256k and play them, which is the limitation of the GBAMP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've tested SMT DS ROM Dumper 1.0 with GBA MP v1, and it worked just fine. Two  differences between these two versions are requirement of inserted GBA cart in v1(in case of DS it isn't needed) and  different sizes of GBAMPs, nothing more. So I think Darkfader's code wil run ok on v1.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If its just the extra ram chip then shouldnt darkfaders thingy work on the SC too?
