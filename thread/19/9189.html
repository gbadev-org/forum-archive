    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">jep, the GBAMP is fine for homebrew and cheep.
<br/>
but if you have an (unflashed) DS with a newer firmware, a GBAMP won't work. plus, if size does matter, look at the supercard sd (yes, M3 SD is even smaller, but more expansive!).
<br/>
If you're only interested in homebrew, it's a matter of size and $.
<br/>
Here is the "stick out chart" <a href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/ndslite_sticking_out.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.samipupu.com/upload/ndslite_sticking_out.jpg</a>
<br/>
Note, that a GBAMP is the same size as a M3 CF.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
That's a DS-Lite in that pic, yes? So it will stick out less than in that screen on my normal DS. From price of the Supercards/M3s, I'm leaning towards the Supercard SD, since I have a 1 GBit SD-Card here. Any objections?
<br/>
<br/>
Where could I order a Supercard SD without much shipping-cost? I'm living in Europe, Austria, and I also have a shipping-adress in Germany.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you want to see an M3 in a regular DS (pretty much the same size as a GBAMP) then check this comparision NDS/DS Lite pic I made for a friend. :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Eh, that's quite big... Compared to the Supercard, I mean. And the SC is cheaper too... Well, I think I know what I want now, I only need a place to order now.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Hey, there's a rather small version of the M3 it seems:

Where could I get that?

<br/>
EDIT: Uhrg, no I rather not get that, too expensive.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
