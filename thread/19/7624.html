    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi,
<br/>
<br/>
im gonna purchase a new ds mario kart bundle tomorrow (monday 28th)and wondered if the modified firmware would work on it?
<br/>
<br/>
also if there was anyone near the midlands uk that could sort it out for me, i dont mind paying a small charge for there time and knowledge.
<br/>
<br/>
what else would i need to purchase to play homebrew if the firmware was modded?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, Flashme(ie modified firmware) wil work on the mario kart bundle DS, as well as every other DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
To run homebrew after your firmware has been flashed with Flashme, you will need a cart like the Supercard, or M3.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First buy a CompactFlash memory card and a <a class="postlink" href="http://darkfader.net/ds/games/" target="_blank">PassMe2 compatible game</a>. Notice that some titles may be compatible in one region but not compatible in another. Make sure that both work when used in their intended manner. Then get a PassMe2 (loaded with the appropriate game-specific firmware) and either an M3 or a SuperCard.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Is M3 or Supercard aboslutely nessesary. I have an EZF Advance 256MB. Will that work or is it _only_ M3 Supercard with PassMe2 and Blue DS Nintendogs?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you already have GBA flash equipment, you can use it instead of an M3 or a SuperCard for programs that are 32 megabytes or smaller. I recommended the M3 or SC because for so many people, the DS is their first Nintendo handheld.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
