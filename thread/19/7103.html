    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've come to an idea:
<br/>
<br/>
An utility, that would run from GBA slot via FlashME or WiFiME and would erase all the data on NDS slot and writing new, multiboot firmware on it.
<br/>
We could actually use the Metroid demo or some crappy game we bought and don't like it. :P
<br/>
<br/>
At least possible in theory?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I saw that games on the NDS Cartridges are read-only... Oh, well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Perhaps I should try? :)  Oh wait. I'd need an official dev card.
<br/>
I'd get a MK2/3 (for now). Oh wait. That still needs a GBA cart, right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I also have an idea, let's take AOL CDs and make them rewriteable. I am sure if you are good enough you can unlock them somehow... like a floppy disk or a flash drive. Free, easy-to-find CD-RWs in masses :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The DS ROM's are write once <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span>.
<br/>
They are mask ROM and once factory written they are unchangeable.

<br/>
Flash memories can easily rewrite data electrically on board. In contrast, mask ROMs can not rewrite data because the data is written with a mask pattern in the manufacturing process
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Also there's not enough room to just swap out the mask rom

A DS Cart is 4mm thick 39mm long and 32mm wide.
<br/>
That gives you approx 1248mm of surface area per side.
<br/>
Components and traces can't go to the edge of the board so assume a 2mm border.
<br/>
That gives 1110mm usable area. In that the flash chips, controller, SRAM chip and SRAM battery must fit.
<br/>
The casing is 1mm thick and it's two sides so 2mm of casing.
<br/>
That leaves 0.5mm per side for components assuming a 1mm PCB.
<br/>
Looking at a cart it seems to be one sided. So you need to find chips and a battery that are less than 1mm thick
<br/>
IMO an internal Ds flash cart is nearly impossible, and if possible it will be far too much money. 
<br/>
<br/>
Note: I know little about electronics but i assume you will need flash EEPROMs to store the data, a SRAM chip for saves, a SRAM battery to keep the saves alive, and some kind of controller for the EEPROMS. Correct me if i'm wrong.

<br/>
now this is the beginning thought process of pure genious.  A save file that once loaded on a DS game that acts like a Passme.
<br/>
<br/>
Awesome.

Make this happen, Serpentor commands it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
