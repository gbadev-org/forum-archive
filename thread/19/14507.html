ALL SUPERCARD SLOT2 series

1.Fixed IDS/IDSL homebrew cannot be used by touching the touch screen
<br/>
2.Copy the dldi.scp file to root directory of TF/SD card then it could be patched with DLDI.

dldi.scp is just the old Supercard DLDI, barni's <a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/barni/2007/08/28/7/" target="_blank">new Supercard DLDI</a> renamed to dldi.scp works better.
<br/>
<br/>
No more patching, yay. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had issues using the autopatching with LMP-ng, problems that did not appear when it was patched with the regular SCSD.dldi file.  Furthermore, the dldi.scp file is a different size and checksum than either SCSD.dldi or SCSD_moon.dldi, so I'm inclined to believe they made a new one that can't handle unaligned reads/writes for some reason.  I'm assuming it's the unaligned reads/writes because of a similar incident with the Supercard DS that Barni's SCDS DLDI file fixed.

I haven't tried Barni's slot-2 DLDI file yet, though I'll do that at some point.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
