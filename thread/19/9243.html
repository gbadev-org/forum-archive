<br/>
<br/>
I live in the UK too
<br/>
<br/>
These cards are not hard to come by, infact mine was one of the first ones i looked at
<br/>
<br/>
Go to PCWorld and get the Belkin F5D7000 ver3000uk
<br/>
<br/>
I think it cost about ?20
<br/>
<br/>
I also picket up the belkin high speed mode wireles router with ADSL modem for ?65
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://downtou.ne1.net/" target="_blank">http://downtou.ne1.net/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The PCworld next door had them for ?30. A 30 second walk saved me a tenner.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are talking about the card from the edfenergyshop.com then you are going to be disappointed as that appears to be a Ethernet card. Not sure why it is coming up in the froogle search.
<br/>
It seems about ?20 is the cheapest you can get the card for. Nice thing about getting it from a walkin shop is that you can pick up the box and check it is the correct version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#79591 - masscat - Fri Apr 14, 2006 12:57 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Again make sure it is the correct version. From the ralink list:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">http://ralink.rapla.net/</a>
<br/>
the pcmcia version must be F5D7010 v2/3000au/3001 (PCWorld and Staples also sell the pcmcia versions for about ?20). From the aria's website I could not see the version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Scan have the MSI pci card in stock, for ?13. Note that Scan has a delivery charge too, but has all sorts of other goodies.  I think it's ?7, so you're still looking at ?20 total.  But you don't have to find a shop.

<br/>
I bought one, works great with my NDS with both the windows WMB and linux NiFi (cheers, masscat!).
<br/>
<br/>
(edit: Note that the MSI card has no issues with different chipsets, which is nice)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
