    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The E3 demos (from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.akkit.org/DS/E3/" target="_blank">here</a>) look really cool, but I don't have a wireless card that works with wi-fi me.
<br/>
<br/>
It probably sounds a really n00b-ish question, but the site that linked me to the page mention wi-fi me, but not Pass me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Isn't the 15mb file (Polarium , 5 E3 roms, 3 Japanese) too much? Someone said, that if the filesize was too big, it wouldn't run (He said you need a rom under 4mb, because the DS has 4mb ram.) Is that true, so I can't run these demos with a Passme?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">running the demos with the so called "wifime" method actually works pretty well
<br/>
(at least if you have the correct nds files)
<br/>
each one of the demos works perfectly with latest driver and utility.
<br/>
<br/>
so go the easy way :
<br/>
launch the demos one by one.<br/>_________________<br/>///et oui, c'est surprise sur prise !!///</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

no, the ds.gba contains all the nds files and allows you to select them individually on the DS</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know now for sure that it will work with passme. Just flash the file to a GBA cart, fire the passme and voila. Actually I had troubles figuring out that there was a menu on top of DarkStar, but that ended up well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The limitation around 4meg is/was because the whole prog was being loaded into RAM.  So, the DarkStar in that .ds.gba file loads into ram, and then loads the demo you select into ram, not the whole 14megs or whatever.  But, you could easily write a prog or game to do the same thing, just load the parts of the game you need and then dump it and load the next part, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
