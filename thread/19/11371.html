Im new to the scene. Ive just ordered a Micro SD (obviously) equipped M3 Lite. Im going to use flash-me but Ive got a few questions. First, Ive heard you can brick your DS. How do you avoid this and is there a fail-safe to guard against this? Whats more, Ive heard if you flash-me you can never play multiplayer in some capacities; obviously a disadvantage. Is this the case? Finally, Im buying this product

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi BloodBrother,
<br/>
<br/>
To answer your questions:
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, as far as I think you can restore your DS's Firmware if Flashme has already reached 7 or more %.
<br/>
<br/>
But normally you should not have to worry about bricking your DS if:
<br/>
<br/>
- you have a Power Source plugged into your DS
<br/>
<br/>
- you not turn the DS off at 1 to 6 %
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing you could do if you bricked your DS would be to use the Parallel Port Flash Method Darkfader has on his Site.
<br/>
<br/>
For the Cards, I think they *should* work, since even a SD can work in a CF Slot if using the right Adapter.
<br/>
<br/>
I Hope I could help:
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. From what I understand, as long as your flashme reaches to 2%, you can recover from bricking. 
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is if you are at 1% and your DS turns off. In that case, if you have another DSLite, you can swap the firmware chips to repair it. (the firmware chips are in a socket apparently, and can be popped out.). Otherwise you need to use ppflash, which involves soldering a cable to the inside of your DS and connecting it to the parallel port on your PC. But bricking almost never happens if you are careful. Apparently the problem on DSLite, is if you accidently short the wrong thing on the inside of the DS, it can cause the DS to shut off.
<br/>
<br/>
2. flashme does not interfere with wireless multiplayer at all. (a very old version had a problem with online games, but this is no longer a problem).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How to do it if you are paranoid (or even if you are not paranoid, you should still do these things to prevent from breaking your NDS):
<br/>
<br/>
1. Download FlashMe from multiple sites and compare. (If using FWNITRO, examine source-code and recompile.)
<br/>
<br/>
2. Turn on, plug in to power, run FlashMe, and hold steady the stick in the SL1 hole until it says 100% and that you can turn it off, then turn it off. (But do NOT turn off until it is finish!)
<br/>
<br/>
3. Do not permanently short SL1, if you do permanently short SL1, then any program could ruin your NDS unit.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by zzo38computer on Mon Oct 09, 2006 5:21 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I was just wondering though, does the latest version of flashme still allow you to change the brightness settings? The last time I checked it installed the old DS firmware so you could only switch the backlight on and off.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, i learned the hard way that there are two v7's out there, too.
<br/>
I used this one for my old and my roomies' Lite. It supports the brightness settings:

That must have been a guess, because if you remove the battery cover from your DS lite, you can see the "walls" that seperate the SL1 connection from the rest of the main board.  No matter how hard I tried, I was not able to reach any other components.  But, I was able to make my DS shut off while using a nail that was not insulated, but it did not (and could not) have touched anything besides SL1 and the case.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

the gist of this message is, if anyone has the perfect, all encompassing guide or something similar, Id like to see it. Anything else that would prevent me from bricking the DS lite? Thanks.<br/>_________________<br/>Just an amateur DS homebrewer</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you don't want to, you don't have to flash your DS, you can run homebrews simply using the M3 and the NoPass. Flashing your DS just means you don't have to carry your NoPass around with you and you don't have to worry about trojans.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
