    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">PassMe's shipping from dspassme.com do have a sticker back, and do contain the latest CPLD code from DarkFader (they would be useless without it, as the /boot/main.cpp file has changed to work with it).
<br/>
<br/>
The current code also bypasses bootloaders on the GBA as the EZF-Advance III doesn't appear to have a way to turn it off.. 
<br/>
<br/>
So, as long as you are using the current template setup from Joat (including the new /boot/main.cpp), you just write your program, build it, and write it to the GBA Flash cart.  Pop your DS game into PassMe, insert it into your DS and go.  I will probably add more info to the tutorial on dspassme.com about using PassMe so that these questions don't keep coming up.
<br/>
<br/>
As for them selling for X times more on ebay, I hope not.  If my 100, Natrium42's 50 and Kraln's 300 (or however many) isn't enough, I will build some more.  Let's just see how demand is in  a week or so..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The biggest difference is that Lynx is actually shipping units.
<br/>
<br/>
Natrium42 is still pre-ordering units, but has not yet begun shipping as far as I understand.  Depending on the look of the cut-down GBA connector, it may look nicer, but I haven't seen a picture of what the assembled board will look like.

Makes no difference. The point of adding the .gba or .bin extension to the end is so the GBA flash card writer will see the file immediately, without having to go change the file type drop-down to *.* first.
<br/>
<br/>
My EZF client has an even more irritating habit though. It insists on turning 'multi-ROM' on every time I turn the GBA on, so I have to go turn it back off for each test.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

Yes, the new code on the CPLD from DarkFader does that.  The NDSTech wiki also says only 6 people have built a passthrough.. So, it's a little out of date (already).

This is because the DS Cart isn't being recognized.  If you bought a complete, check the PCI Pins contact with the cart.  Even without a GBA Flash cart inserted, you should get the DS splash screen, and then two white screens.

However the DS needs some code that will copy the arm7 and arm9 code to a specific place in memory in the DS. The files that are named x.ds.gba are compiled with the boot code so it will be able to run on the actual hardware, using PassMe. It takes the arm7 and arm7 binaries and places them in the correct memory location for the PassMe to be able to read them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, the ds.gba is the ARM7.bin and ARM9.bin wrapped in a bootloader.
<br/>
<br/>
Arm7 is what interfaces with the touchscreen, etc.  Emulators have the arm7.bin  "Hardcoded" into the emu right now.

<br/>
I am wondering though, is it possible to append data to the end of the .ds.gba file and access that information straight from the cart after it has been loaded? This would allow homebrew demos to exceed the 4MB limit, while still keeping the PassMe from being a pirates' dream.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've been meaning to try that myself, but haven't had time to play around with DS code at home. I think it will work, provided that your ARM9/ARM7 binaries know where the data starts. 
<br/>
Maybe make a special .section in the bootloader ROM for the data files, that starts at a specific address, with a table of addresses of each of the files. Would require some linker script fiddling, but it's mostly just copy/paste.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
