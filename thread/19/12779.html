    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's my favourite flash card - although it lacks the niceties of the fancier cards (such as a DS-specific menu) it's perfect for development.
<br/>
<br/>
Also using CF cards is SO much better than playing with SD/miniSD/microSD as they can get real fiddly. CF is big and sturdy. Again, ideal for development.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

However, it's certainly better than SD's push-to-eject mechanism seen in some readers, which is easy to break.

I have a GBAMP, and the only thing I don't like about it is the lack of RAM for GBA mode. I don't mind it sticking out so much, I don't have a Lite though. However, the hardware isn't the most durable. I had to open mine up and stick a piece of cardboard under the circuit to push it up and make good contact with the slot.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are GBA MP's no longer being manufactured?  I love mine and have had it for a very long time without issues.. even swapping it between three different DSs frequently.  I also like the fact the the firmware is almost indestructible as long as you have an alternative boot method to write it back.  Back when I used to sell them pre-flashed with Chishms firmware hack, I had flashed 5 or 6 of them before I realized they didn't have update.e19 on them.. and rendered them all useless..  But, I just had to pop in my trusty GBA MP, and swap each one and put update.e19 on them and I was back in business.

<br/>
But, the fact that it does stick out a mile on a DS lite sucks.. but, what do you want for $25?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nope, the card wouldn't boot in either mode.  It was right before, or right after Chishm switched to C and was borrowing dupicate parts of the firmware.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
