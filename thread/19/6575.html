I've got an SD card, that's fine, but I was wondering if this would be fine for flashing my DS firmware. I know most flashers require specific software; how would I go about putting the information onto my SD card and make it readable by the DS?<br/>_________________<br/>Rohaq</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In this case, FlashMe is the "specific software". You'll need the ability to run .nds or .nds.gba programs on the SuperCard in order to be able to run FlashMe.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Apparently it should work with the DS, so the description says. I've sent the seller an eBay question though to check.

Any reason why it wouldn't be able to run .nds or .nds.gba programs?<br/>_________________<br/>Rohaq</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, and my main question was 'How do I put files on an SD card?' I've got an SD reader, but it always appears as a removable drive. I would have thought that there would be more than simply throwing the nds/nds.gba file onto the card. Maybe I'm wrong.<br/>_________________<br/>Rohaq</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"Works with the DS" could just mean compatible with the GBA compatibility mode of the Nintendo DS. Some unlicensed products are not.
<br/>
<br/>
In general, in order to run .nds or .nds.gba programs, you'll have to have a *Me boot method and firmware capable of running in DS mode. For example, the GBA MP firmware is not capable of running in DS mode, but the hacked firmware is.
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, you just toss the files on the SD card. The firmware apparently has enough file system code to be able to read and write the card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The <a class="postlink" href="http://www.supercard.cn/eng/download.htm" target="_blank">supercard firmware update</a> is out, so you should be able to use it and wifime to update your NDS firmware but I don't know for sure.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can confirm SC SD working with passme and flashme using the new 1.50 DS "aware" kernel, and others have updated their firmware on the DS using supercard and wifime. Essentially it will only work with *.ds.gba files renamed to *.nds
<br/>
<br/>
As well, I am unable to find any NDS homebrew (any that is less than 256mbit at any rate) that will not load on SC SD with flashme, given you have a correct game in the DS slot.
<br/>
<br/>
I personally would avoid getting this on EBay (such products are against ebays policy) and it has been proven that there is a fairly high rate of defectives out there when it comes to the supercard, so you may need to exchange it. (I got mine from kicktrading.ca , they were extremely helpful and my product was thankfully not defective)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I also encountered this card, looks like a cheap solution to run homebrew wihtout investing in expensive flash cards (I only have a 64M card right now). Plus, it plays video &amp; mp3. This guy is not only selling on eBay but also here:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.ioffer.com/shops/game888toy" target="_blank">http://www.ioffer.com/shops/game888toy</a>

Price is $50 including shipping to Europe. I seriously considering bying this card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
