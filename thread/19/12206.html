    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Shouldn't something like this be possible?
<br/>
<br/>
Since there's a loader to boot NDS files from the GBA slot, wouldn't a loader to boot GBA files from the DS slot be a vaguely similar thing?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know much about the basic hardware functions of the DS, so maybe the one is possible and the other isn't for some specific reason, but I just thought I'd ask.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's the only way they can do it (apart from virtualizing it...), and to be honest, it wouldn't be that bad. You boot into the DS menu, load the ROM, and it just reboots into GBA mode and automatically loads whatever was copied. Would take a few more seconds at best. I mean, even the slot-2 devices had to copy the ROM to PSRAM every single time they booted.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Except multiboots. GBA Movie Player could load a multiboot into the GBA's 256 KiB RAM and start executing it. But the DS-to-GBA mode switch call in the BIOS doesn't allow this, as it erases the GBA RAM before doing anything.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Don't forget the old style GBA flashcarts which actually contained a big block of flashrom inside them. In order to boot a specific game, all that was needed was to toggle a couple bankswitching registers and then a softreset.
<br/>
<br/>
But that's just an aside. The main point is, there's no way to boot GBA games without having something in slot-2. At which point, why not just stick with a slot-2 only device in the first place?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The obvious answer is that there's no real reason to buy a slot-1 card, just get a slot-2 cart unless you have absolutely no interest in GBA stuff, which would be a shame, but I suppose some people might not.

<br/>
As for booting GBA files from slot-1, I guess it's not possible then.  Just thought I'd ask.

Ok, but what makes you think a manufacturer is going to want to provide this "special" GBA cart to copy the data to?
<br/>
<br/>
And if you have a Slot-1 device and the program requires a device in slot-2 to copy the data to, and then reboot, the cost of both devices is going to be MORE then just the Slot-1 device.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For pirates (the majority of their sales), it'll work with Opera warez, work with GBA warez, and have the prestige of a Slot-1 device.
<br/>
<br/>
For homebrewers / developers (their supposed customers), it allows the memory-heavy builds of DSLinux to run, it can act as a cache (it'd be quite useful for Quake or SCUMMVM) and it's another interesting device to play with.
<br/>
<br/>
32MiB of RAM on a cart shouldn't be too expensive to design and produce.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
