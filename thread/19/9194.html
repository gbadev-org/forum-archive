    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">what I mean is, is there a good chance that the broken mp3 player will have a working microdrive, even though it doesn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
Like a Creative Zen Micro, is there a good chance that the microdrive still works?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">there is a good chance the drive is salvagable, but i can tell you from first-hand experience that later models are designed to discourage removal of the microdrive.  Earlier creative muvo2 4GB had a standard microdrive, but at one point it was much cheaper to buy the muvo2 than to buy a Hitachi 4GB microdrive.  hitachi was supplying them at a discounted rate to creative, and people were buying the muvo and taking the drive out.  Hitachi then entered into an agreement with creative to try and discourage this (because it was theoretically hurting hitachi microdrive sales, but i doubt it had a huge impact).
<br/>
<br/>
So the later models (including one I had) don't have a normal microdrive pinout, but the microdrive is hard wired to the mainboard.  I would assume the zen micro suffered the same fate, as it came out around the same time as the muvo2 5GB</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The main reason such devices are broken is usually due to the microdrive being damaged so I wouldn't bother if your main intention is to salvage that part.
<br/>
<br/>
Creative Zen especially - I had to replace the microdrive in my girlfriend's Zen Micro recently<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i found that it's not a good idea to try this. The person over at lik-sang that, I believe, discovered microdrives work in gbamp, found that microdrives use 3 times the normal battery power when using something like moonshell. That doesn't fit my needs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I didn't really check that.. My DS is hooked to the AC adapter quite often and  I usually leave it at home.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
