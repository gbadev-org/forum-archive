    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, im looking to get a DS shortly after X-mas, and had a few questions. Ive been running a modded xbox for some time now for emulation and homebrew purposes, and since the DS mod scene seems a little more complex than installing a modchip and software i was wondering if someoen could supply me with info on what all id need to run emulated roms, homebrew, and what id need to dump cart info to a pc to mess with.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance for any help i get.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all, you'll need a GBA card, which is either a CF adapter with 32 MB of RAM (M3 or SuperCard) or a NOR flash card (such as F2A, EFA, or XG). Make sure that it can run GBA homebrew before going further.
<br/>
<br/>
Then you can install FlashMe, the modified DS firmware, using one of the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/pass/#gen2" target="_blank">second generation modding methods</a>. Doing the ppflash method is reportedly as hard as soldering on a modchip, but using the PassMe2 adapter is much easier.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
