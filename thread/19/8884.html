    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's all my fault! I and an e-friend were trying to get the Mario kart hack to work.
<br/>
<br/>
He had a GBAMP, but it wasn't flashed yet.  He bought a PassMe, (I confirmed it was the correct one for his firmware) and  either my instructions were bad or he misinterpreted them, and he bricked his GBAMP.  I need to know how ot unbrick it. (If possible.)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for the help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you sure he didn't put it into recovery mode? If he put it on recovery mode, you need to put update.e19 on the root of the CF card and allow the GBA MP to update with that by turinging on the GBA and following the onscreen instructions. Then he needs to flash the firmware of the GBA MP again with chishm's hack. Try that, and if that doesn't work, I think the GBA MP is dead.<br/>_________________<br/>Back.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm. This sounds like a multi-layered problem. I'll probably need to get more info on what my friend did to brick it.
<br/>
<br/>
He really wanted to be a MKDS hacker.  I tried to teach him how to run homebrew on the GBA MP without ever doing it myself. :(. He hates me, too. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just have him put update.e19 (from the GBA MP site) on the root of the card, and when the GBA MP starts, the update will want to install. After he installs that, delete update.e19, and run's chism's hack again (reading the instructions on screen this time). Would you happen to have his AIM/MSN so I could assist?<br/>_________________<br/>Back.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i completly broke my gbamp once :P
<br/>
<br/>
the firmware was bad because i clicked the "recover old firmware" or something
<br/>
and it didn't work... it bricked it...
<br/>
(beyond updating with .eXX anything... )
<br/>
<br/>
so i used another flashed DS with gbamp that worked
<br/>
went into the firmware flashing (gbamp flasher that is, and the .nds flasher...)
<br/>
and hot swapped...
<br/>
IT WORKED and i saved my ass :P<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

I still need to hear from him. But in the meanwhile, where would he get update.e19?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And worste case, he can always recover with another GBA MP using the swap before flashing method.  Then sell the second GBA MP to you! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
