    <h4>#53366 - ensign - Wed Sep 07, 2005 10:20 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all.  I am a recent owner of a Supercard SD with a SuperPassMe... I've had success running 256Mbit games.  I was wondering:  will the supercard ALWAYS be limited to 256Mbit, or should this change with new firmware updates?  I'm worried I made the wrong purchase choice if 256 is the limit on the Supercard.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!

<br/>
btw, is it just me, or is this forum a little quick to jump the piracy-gun?  I can understand if someone blatantly asks about where to download commercial roms, how to run commercial roms, etc etc.  But asking a technical question about a piece of flash software is NOT necessarily asking about piracy. so get off your f'ing high horses and don't always assume the worst.  i doubt i'll be back here b\c of the immediate display of attitude, not that any of you care.
<br/>
<br/>
so... PLUR to all, 'cept sneef: shove it.

It's much easier to dump ScummVM "ROMs" from the original discs sold by Lucasarts than to dump, say, NES or even GBA ROMs.

"PLUR" == peace, love, unity, respect.
<br/>
"Shove it" == insert something into the exit of one's digestive system.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, for most of the ScummVM talkie games, adding support for recompression of the audio will likely prove helpful, even if only to reduce the amount of time spent blocking on data transfers from the CF card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

If you are wondering about direct file reading, like on the GBAMP, it would take more than a firmware update to be compatible with the current driver. SD is used differently to CF, and would require a change to the hardware level routines to use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

ethos, my point about the forumites being "haughty" was regarding how quick everyone was to judge/jump down my throat about piracy as soon as I asked a technical question regarding the limitations of the Supercard.  Regarding "PLUR": when you don't know what something means, it would behoove you to type it into Google.  Otherwise, you just end up looking like a moron, and especially when you try using your lack-of-knowledge-regarding-a-term in a flame.  
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I am a sarcastic @sshole, and apparently you didn't read into the irony of my previous post.  And regarding the quote about "@ssholes on this ship": have you never watched spaceballs?  Sad little man if not.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually it was GBA (so 512 Mbit doesn't apply), but it was in the same ballpark. The pirates release a lot of the commercial games size-stripped (that is, with up to several hundred kilobytes of trailing 0x00 or 0xFF data truncated off), so they're not necessarily a power of 2 bytes in size.
<br/>
<br/>
As the homebrew community begins to develop collaborative games that allow for multiple users to skin the game or to add levels, homebrew original releases in excess of 4 MB may become more common.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Hello all. I am a recent owner of a Supercard SD with a SuperPassMe <span style="color: red">(I bought the cheapest thing available that will let me play warez) </span>... I've had success running 256Mbit <span style="color: red">(warez)</span> games. I was wondering: will the supercard ALWAYS be limited to 256Mbit, or should this change with new firmware updates? I'm worried I made the wrong purchase choice if 256 is the limit on the Supercard <span style="color: red">(as new DS warez are over this limit)</span>. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now, we can discuss this all day lang, but when the day is over, the above is clear.  So, you basically agreed that you never released in the 64/128/etc sizes..  and I don't really care if pirates truncate the extra space.. the point is, we are talking about 256Mbit games...  Hmmm..  and that's what it says.. gameS, meaning multiples of them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

holy shnikees, you are a total genius!  I never would have guessed someone might have suspected my post to have any wrongdoing associated with it.  No seriously, I think you are the 1st one here to read it both so clearly and honestly!  Kudos, because that must have taken years of training to cut through all the BS!

<br/>
<br/>
I am intensely curious about the technical capabilities and limitations of some of these devices out on the market now - the GBA MP and the Supercard in particular.  I've only just started learning about DS development (and extraordinarily pleased to learn that the GBA flash cart I bought so long ago will be so useful toward that goal) the allure of off-the-shelf flash carts being used to store GBA and DS programs (and GBA-MP-specific programs, like ScummVM, having direct filesystem access) just staggers me.
<br/>
<br/>
So let's get on with it.  The supercart.  How does it work?  I suppose in normal (GBA) operation, it has a GBA program that acts as the shell, and then when you run a program from the SD card it's copied into the cartridge's RAM or something and run from there?  (Hence the 256mbit limit, I suppose?)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing the GBA-MP does something similar - but with a smaller buffer maybe?  I haven't seen any information that gives me a clear idea of the exact capabilities and limitations of these products.  <span style="font-weight: bold">(EDIT)</span>: Did a bit more digging and I guess it works by loading code and data into the GBA's link-boot memory...  that makes sense.
<br/>
<br/>
As a side question - I understand the principle on which the Passme and similar tools work, bypassing the firmware's security measures and then feeding altered program code to make the execution jump to the GBA cartridge ROM space.  I'm not so clear on how the Flashme code operates in conjunction with devices like the supercart.  Mainly, at what point is a decision made on whether the cartridge should be treated as GBA or DS software?  Does DS software run from the GBA slot have to start up in GBA mode and then bootstrap itself into DS mode somehow?<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC
<br/>
I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.
<br/>
Thank you, everyone, I look forward to taking advantage of your work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Every GBA program has a four-character code in its header. For example this might be A6BE for <span style="font-style: italic">Mega Man Battle Network 3 White</span> (U). All licensed games' codes will end in J (for Japan), E (for North America), or P (for Europe). But programs such as gbafix (included with devkitARM) let you set a ROM's four-character code to anything.
<br/>
<br/>
FlashMe's formula is roughly as follows: If A+B+X+Y are held down, run the GBA game in DS mode. If the game's four-character code is PASS, run the GBA game in DS mode. Otherwise run the GBA game in GBA mode.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

You missed one - If the game's internal name is DSBooter (not sure on the capitalization), run the GBA game in DS mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
