    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just picked up Band Brothers and I was looking around for the songs that were offered from the DS Download Service. I'm assuming if someone had the files, that I could just use a WiFiMe to DL them to my DS.
<br/>
<br/>
These songs:
<br/>
<br/>
    * Toko toko Yoshi (Catch! Touch! Yoshi!)
<br/>
    * DK: Jungle Beat
<br/>
    * Slider (Super Mario 64 DS)
<br/>
    * Ashley (WarioWare: Touched!)
<br/>
    * Parthena no Kagami: A Set
<br/>
    * Parthena no Kagami: B Set
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey thanks, I didn't know about the 2nd link. I've given up trying to find the kiosk songs as I don't think anyone has them. Oh well. I won a bid for a Action Replay DUO on ebay that should be coming soon enough.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've also been looking for those downloads.  I don't think they were captured as such.  However, if anyone who did download them from the kiosks and saved to their card, either <a class="postlink" href="http://www.zigg.com/code/dbbsed/" target="_blank">my save editor</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.maid.gr.jp/jubai/bandbrothers/" target="_blank">BBME</a> could extract it and it could be shared.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not holding out hope for this as it seems to be all I can do to inform the   community that our file formats are compatible.  Which is why I began to just go ahead and enter the songs directly.  Of course, that doesn't get me the Kid Icarus songs...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
