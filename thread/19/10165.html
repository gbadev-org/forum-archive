    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm expecting my newly ordered Supercard CF and Superkey tomorrow but the CF card (and reader/writer) won't be with me for a few days. Is there anything at all that I can do with the Supercard and Superkey (short of plugging them in!)?

Daft question maybe, but if you don't ask ............. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<span style="font-style: italic">Take that!</span> My joined date is 2005, and my first handheld was a Game Boy Color. (Technically, it was Lights Out, but whatcha gonna do? :) ) I used the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.flashlinker-shop.com/images/ezfa-256.jpg" target="_blank">flashcart</a> I used for my GBA dev on my DS for all kinds of DS homebrew, including installing FlashMe.
