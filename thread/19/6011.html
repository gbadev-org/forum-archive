As I understand, it's the encryption code... but it's not so long that someone could be stumped for this length of time.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

look for hackds, darkfader made up some funky hardware a while back to hook to the pc, the code on that blog is for using that hardware to dump stuff off the carts.

And though I'm sure the day will be long in coming (if at all), I eagerly await the arrival of a DS Flash Card!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The commercial ROMs put on the GBA flash card are patched to load assets from the GBA ROM rather than the DS card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Almost nobody on this forum would do something that can only be used for playing infringing copies of Nintendo's proprietary software.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Hopefully they'll release an article on the technology so that that can happen more quickly.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I think they're more concerned with making money than releasing possibly helpful tech documents.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
