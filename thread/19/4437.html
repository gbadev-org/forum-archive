    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just tried out my F2A 256Mb GBA cartridge on the DS and it works fine, for those interested...  I tried out my little Project Hazuki game and it works, but I'm finding the buttons on the DS are too close together compared to the GBA SP!  We'll have to see how that affects future DS games, although I hope more games make use of the touch screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Can wireless USB adapters send signals as well as receive them? Because my university has only a few WiFi hotspots and I want to play wirelessly in my dorm room.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
