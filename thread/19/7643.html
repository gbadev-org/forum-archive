    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Anyone here try using the NDS Menu Icon Media yet? If so did you have to enter a password? I never had one and now it is asking me for one. The GBA Media player is not asking for password, don't know where it came from. I have used the Maintenance tool and it did not help. I even uninstalled and used the 1.5 to Maintenance the card, no go. Any help would be get.
<br/>
Thanks

I was able to reset the password only by using the disk that came with the card. I installed and used the 1.32 and used the tools that came with it. the card stayed at 1.34 but the password are gone.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
