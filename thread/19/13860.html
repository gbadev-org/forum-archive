    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For $30 you can get a Datel Games n' Music in local retailers like Wal Mart or Best Buy.  Homebrew support of devices with removable flash memory is much better than built-in, and it is easier to swap out cards than use proprietary built-in media.  And, with microSD cards, no extra adapters or things need to stick out of the DS, since the microSD slot is small enough to incorporate into a DS cartridge sized device.  The Games n' Music comes with everything you need to get started, the GnM device, a USB microSD reader/writer, and a 128MB (you can get up to 2GB) microSD card.

<br/>
With DLDI most everything works on it, except DSOrganize requires the bootme method (?) or maybe there's a way to use it without, but I haven't found it yet.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

R4 is also roughly six times faster than GnM, which is important for anything that streams lots of data from the card, such as a video player. (I'll be able to cite this assertion sometime tomorrow.)

I agree that ROMS (no matter what you let it stand for) should not affect your decision on a card, but yeah, the GnM's SD speed is a disappointment, but it only really shows in DPG playback (and Quake DS loading models), so I use my GBAMP for videos.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
