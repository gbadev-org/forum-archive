    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everyone, I am using Datel Max Media Player and Dock + Sandisk 1gb compactflash card.
<br/>
<br/>
I got DSAIM, Wifichat, and Sylphirc to work because I configured my Nitendo USB dongle to be a softap. Everything was fine and I sat in chat for a while. Then I tried connecting again later and suddenly everything doesn't work anymore and I freeze at launch for each program. Any reason for this?
<br/>
<br/>
-I allready checked and disabled the WEP.
<br/>
-I allready disabled and reenabled the network
<br/>
-I allready reconfigured through metroid hunters
<br/>
-Wifi games work on commercial games
<br/>
-I allready filled my battery
<br/>
-I allready put everything in the root folder
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything else I could do? Could a CF card go slower if more stuff is on it? I currently have like 400-500 megs on it.
<br/>
<br/>
PS: I allready looked through the troubleshooting post on the top...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do those DS apps still freeze if the USB wi-fi device is not even connected?  If they do then it's not a wi-fi problem.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
