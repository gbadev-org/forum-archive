    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Im trying to use palibs file system (cant get fat working yet) to load an external level for my game. the file system can give me a pointer to my .txt file wich contanes my level map. Can someone tell me how to copy the map to an array? I'm quite new to C and I know little to nothing about pointers.
<br/>
<br/>
the pointer I would use is PA_PAFSFile(0) and I would like to get info from her to my map array levelloaded[].

Don't take offence in what he's saying. Think of it in this way, it would be pointless in having 1000 different forums each duplicating information that already exists. Go to the beginners FAQ, it should have some good cpp tutorials to look at. If anything I would guess that you might be directed to a place like this ( <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/" target="_blank">http://www.cplusplus.com/</a> )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To answer questions that are not covered by the book.  The C/C++ forum assumes that you have at least basic, if not advanced, C/C++ programming ability.  It also assumes that you are comfortable with the GBA hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
The beginners forum only assumes programming ability.

All posters are basically expected to have given a best effort attempt before posting.  When you post, tell us what you did, what you expected to happen, and what didn't happen.  We'll help.  We won't do your work for you.
<br/>

I, for one, also expect people to put effort into spelling and grammar.

Give it a shot on your own.  Try a few things even if you expect them all to fail.  You might be able to figure it out on your own.  If not, tell us what you did, what you expected to happen, and what did or didn't happen.  We'll help.
<br/>
<br/>
The comp.lang.c FAQ might be able to help you.  It assumes basic C programming ability.  I learned C from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pcp3/" target="_blank">Practical C Programming</a>, by Steve Oualline.  There are probably better books out there.

Working with pointers is essential for a C/C++ programmer. Before you can goon, 
<br/>
read and understand the things shown in a good tutorial! Otherwise the community can't help you.

<br/>
How do I copy the srting that my pointer is pointing at, to an array.

myarray[100]=mypointer only makes myarray[100] a copy of the string (or just another pointer to it?) how can i make myarray[0] to the first value in the string, eg. 'A' then myarray[1] to the second etc.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry, I'm quite busy preparing for a session tomorrow so I'm just throwing in nuggets where I think you can fill in the blanks. But in short I thought [from what you said] that you wanted to copy text from a string starting from a particular character, say the 100th. By starting the pointer at the 100th element you can then copy until the termination and be able to copy the substring.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure exactly what problem you are experiencing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have a look at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/ref/cstring/strncpy.html" target="_blank">strncpy</a>. If I understood your question correctly, you want something like:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">strncpy (myarray, mypointer, 100);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
This will copy up to 100 characters from the location mypointer points at to the location myarray points at. If there are less than 100 characters in the string mypointer, myarray will only contain that many characters and the rest of the space in myarray will have whatever was in there before. Keep in mind that if mypointer has 100 or more characters, myarray won't be null terminated. 
<br/>
To be on the safe side, you should do it similar to this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">/* It's better to use constants rather than magic numbers */
<br/>
#define MYARRAY_LENGTH 100
<br/>
char myarray [MYARRAY_LENGTH];
<br/>
/* Copy the string, reserving one char for the null terminator */
<br/>
strncpy (myarray, mypointer, MYARRAY_LENGTH - 1); 
<br/>
/* Set the last character of myarray to null, to make sure the string is always terminated correctly. Notice how MYARRAY_LENGTH - 1 is used instead of MYARRAY_LENGTH. This is because arrays are indexed starting from 0, so the 100th character of myarray is at myarray[99] */
<br/>
myarray [MYARRAY_LENGTH - 1] = '\0'; </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
