<br/>
<br/>
In some commercial roms, there i have seen that there is space that is filled with FF to make the size of the rom be a multiple of 4mb ...
<br/>
<br/>
A way to reduce the size is to remove those FF.
<br/>
<br/>
How to know the exact size of a rom without those fill blocks ? Is there somewhere in the rom where it is put the size of it ? Is a Gba rom always finishing the same blocks ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thx</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
