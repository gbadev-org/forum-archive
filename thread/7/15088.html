    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't know if this has been asked before but can a GBA game access the DS Wi-Fi and microphone? I remember Zelda:Oracle of ages I think had some extra features when run it on a GBA, so is it possible with a GBA game on DS?<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not possible as far as I know.  In GBA mode, the DS provides no access to any of the DS-specific features.  The only (possible) exception is the ability to add a border around the GBA screen before booting it in GBA mode, but that's all you can do with that extra resolution.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's a few things a GBA game gets when it runs on a DS:
<br/>
* An optional border
<br/>
* It knows its on a DS
<br/>
* It can display out-of-bounds tiles in BG modes, these tiles are purely color 0 (transparent), as opposed to glitchy stripes on a GBA.
<br/>
* Where's the link port?<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think it can detect that there is no link port, since there is still the hardware, but just no external port. (i think)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">keep in mind that most gameboy/gameboy color packaged after the Super Gameboy (or whatever was the name of that GB-&gt;SNES accessory) had special data to look better in the SNES (and likely on GBC/GBA) such as a special border and hints on how to color the greys during the game (for old GB roms)
<br/>
<br/>
Any "fancy additions" of the GBA mode of the DS is up to the DS firmware itself, afaik.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/p/sprite-editor.html" target="_blank"> SEDS: Sprite Edition on DS</a> :: <a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/search/label/modplayer" target="_blank">modplayer</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also the DS has two CPU's (ARM 9, ARM 7) and when running in GBA mode the ARM 9 is disabled and the additional memory.  When running in DS mode both CPU's are working with data passed using shared memory.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
