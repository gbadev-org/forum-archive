    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, tepples, probably because in C++, structs have constructors and default operators *too*.  That's what happens when you never make it through chapter 1 of the C++ book: you make it painfully obvious how clueless you are every time you speak.
<br/>
<br/>
Another example is that structs and classes aren't, in fact, the same; that's why there's something called class which isn't the same as struct.  (Y'see, C and C++ don't just up and duplicate keywords blindly, that being an idiotic thing to do, and all.)
<br/>
<br/>
The reason classes exist is because when Bjarne started extending OO tools into the language, structs were the natural place to do so.  However, one of the more important facets of the Smalltalk approach to OO, which is where C++ got its approach, is the idea of information hiding, which sometimes gets called information publicity, and which some people think is called encapsulation, though they're dead wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
In the Smalltalk approach to OO, the interface of the UDT should be minimal, and there should be no exposure of data members, nor of internal functions; the outside world should only have access to what's considered the 'external interface.'  As such, <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">it is critically important that the default publicity of members be private, not public</span></span>.  However, if that change was made to structs, huge swaths of existing legacy C code would break.  As such, a second thing, otherwise identical to a struct, called a class, was created, which had appropriate default publicity.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, in traditional Tepples style, I'm sure you're going to pretend you knew all that already.  However, it's obvious that you didn't, because if you knew that classes had to be created to deal with limitations in the application of OO mechanisms (such as constructors,) you'd know that structs had those mechanisms.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, either that, or you knew structs and classes were very similar, and you were so amazingly stupid that based on that C didn't have constructors in structs, you thought C++ wouldn't either, and as such thus for classes either.  Which, surprisingly, seems to be the case:

It's not possible to inline a constructor, you numbskull.  Besides, inlining has nothing to do with anything; an object needs those methods in case they're called externally.  The object doesn't even have to have an instance to inline in the first place.  READ A BOOK.

Liar.  If you knew they had access privilege differences, you'd know why, and if you knew why they had access privilege differences, you wouldn't be surprised that structs had constructors.  You're just lying to get out of caught being wrong, like usual.

Yeah, you can cast any address to a pointer to any type, and dereference it at your peril.  ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, doing this with care can be very handy.  Containers like std::vector own buffers large enough to hold multiple objects, then use placement new to construct directly into them.

When you take manual control over the task of calling constructors, destructors, and assignment operators, there are a lot of ways to screw up, but it's sometimes a viable road to efficient behavior.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To clarify for whoever was asking about compiler-generated constructors and destructors:
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't provide a constructor, the compiler provides one for you.  It's generally inlined (though inlining is never required by the standard), and it simply calls the constructor of every data member in the order that it was declared.
<br/>
<br/>
For compiler-generated constructors that are trivial (in the sense tepples described), this all optimizes away and generates 0 instructions, on any sane compiler.
<br/>
<br/>
The same can be said for compiler-generated destructors.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Business first:
<br/>
I've had similar questions about the differences between classes and structs.  The main difference that I see between the two is the default publicity: either public or private.  Now, I haven't played with messing with access specifiers in structs, but by tepples's example I would guess that they can be used somewhat interchangeably.  (As a side note, I'd like to see a "sizeof()" be placed into that code for both the class and the struct, just to make sure they are the same size (which they probably are).)
<br/>
<br/>
Tepples is correct in saying that it is good programming practice to begin class declarations with access specifiers.  I have yet to see class code in any book that does not follow this practice.  This makies tepples's so-called "constructed case" the "normal case".  With this programming practice, the "class" and the "struct" can be used as the same thing.  
<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, classes and structs are almost exactly the same thing because the access specifiers can essentially be used to change from a class to a struct (and vice versa).
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Now to address people...
<br/>
Thank you, tepples, for staying polite throughout this whole thing.
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, okay, I'm gonna try to remain polite whilst saying this, and if I'm not, I apologize.
<br/>
<br/>
StoneCypher, while some of the things you say are indeed correct, your tone could use some adjustment.  For example, most of your messages consist of something along the lines of "You're stupid," "Go read a book," or a right out insult.  If you don't believe me, have a look:</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>StoneCypher wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">...

and you were so amazingly stupid

the depth of braindeadedness and inability to grapple with fundamental, basic language precepts as these is just mind blowing.

Stop trying to pretend to be a programmer, and go get a paper hat with a hamburger on the side. You're dragging the people with potential down by reciting your superstitions developed by years of not reading books and not listening to your betters.

Some of the responses in this thread were very disrespectful- it is shocking.  Instead of insulting people, offer constructive criticism and <span style="font-weight: bold">suggest something</span>!  I just finished this book, and it was quite informative:
<br/>
<br/>
C++: The Core Language
<br/>
By Gregory Satir and Doug Brown.
<br/>
Published by O'Reilly.
<br/>
ISBN: 1-56592-116-X
<br/>
Preface:  "This book is for C programmers who want to learn C++."
<br/>
<br/>
The comp.lang.c++ faq is also fantastic reading material.  If anyone else has any suggestions, by all means bring them up.

Sutter's Guru of the Week is a good read too, covering much of the material in the books.
