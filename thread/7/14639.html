    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to develop a database application for the DS. Which is the best C++ package to use? When I was last involved with programming, Microsoft and another development company that I cant even remember now had the top two products. My current research has made me realize that there are even free compilers available for download from the net.
<br/>
<br/>
But which would be the best one to use? Which one would have the strongest tools, libraries, etc for writing code for the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For the DS (as you point out in your post), there's really only two options; devkitARM and ARM RealView. The first one is free, and produce satisfactory code, while the last one is expensive and produce great code. I would say that for most people, devkitPro would suffice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
