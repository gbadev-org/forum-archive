Anybody know what I do to fix it? I think it is one of those environment variable things, but I don't know where i am supposed to tell it to go.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The "Thumbs.db" file is an invisible file that Windows creates when you view a folder as thumbnails. To fix it, first turn off thumbnail view in your project folder. Then open a command prompt, cd into the folder containing your project, then <span style="font-weight: bold">del /s /a thumbs.db</span><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks, that worked and the program ran. As usual though, I ran into another problem, and I really hope that this one is as easy to fix as that last one. So, I ran it and it displayed its pic... and then I tried to insert my own bitmap file. Well, I put the thing into the data folder, and changed beerguy_bmp or whatever to smiley_bmp and ran it. I had just whipped up a yellow smiley face on a blue background in paint... and the whole screen turned blue... no smiley face!!! It is a sad thing that my DS cant smile, and I am wondering how to remedy this problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you know how many bits per pixel (1, 4, 8, or 24) are in each of the bitmaps you mentioned?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From my limited experience with GBA programming, it probably is a problem.  Try opening it up in the free IrFanView program and changing the depth with the appropriate option in the Image menu.  Don't use dithering unless you want the effect.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Relatively small download, but it seems to be available only in installer packages, despite the fact that it can run uninstalled (from a USB thumb drive for instance).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
