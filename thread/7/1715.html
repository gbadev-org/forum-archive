    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was reading Tepples' post about having to implement 'write' for the sake of ie. pure virtual functions (<a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=1222" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=1222</a>). I did exactly how described, but it still said <span style="font-weight: bold">undefined reference to 'write'</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
Now my question; Did anyone succesfully implement the function write? Is there anything special you have to do to get this working?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
