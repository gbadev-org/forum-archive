    <h4>#1712 - np_soft - Tue Jan 21, 2003 10:05 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, i'm programming a game in C++ for GBA that uses both 16x16 sprites and 8x8 sprites. 
<br/>
The problem is, when I define an 8x8 sprite, it's drawn as 16x16,
<br/>
I also tested this with 32x32 and 64x64 and the 32x23 is drawn as 64x64?
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can help me with this problem please reply.. thanks
<br/>
<br/>
This is what I defined as my sizes so far.
<br/>
#define SIZE_8			0x0		
<br/>
#define SIZE_16			0x4000
<br/>
#define SIZE_32			0x8000
<br/>
#define SIZE_64			0xC000
<br/>
and size is being defied in attribute1 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help!
<br/>
Greatly appreciated!
<br/>
I was adding more junk to attrib1 that screwed everything up.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,
