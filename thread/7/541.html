    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi , I'm having some problems using a library in my link process.
<br/>
<br/>
I have built the library with:
<br/>
arm-agb-elf-ar rcs myLib.a foo.o bar.o etc.
<br/>
<br/>
(I have also tried:
<br/>
arm-agb-elf-ar rc myLib.a foo.o bar.o etc.
<br/>
arm-agb-elf-ranlib myLib.a)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I try to link to it with devkitadv (windows):
<br/>
-L pathToMyLib     or     -lmyLib.a
<br/>
It dosn't work work.
<br/>
I am including headers for the individual .o files that make up the library.
<br/>
The headers are being accessed in the compile process, it's just linking that's messed up.
<br/>
(I have a feeling that it might be a cygwin issue as when i use -lmyLib.a, gcc can never find it!)
<br/>
<br/>
any suggestions ?
<br/>
<br/>
cheers
