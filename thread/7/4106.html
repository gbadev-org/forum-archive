    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone - this is my first post.
<br/>
<br/>
I have some sprite data:
<br/>
<br/>
const u16 SpriteData[] = { ... };
<br/>
<br/>
I have stored this data inside of a C++ file
<br/>
I then compiled the source into a .o file using this:
<br/>
<br/>
gcc  -c -o Splash.o Splash.cpp
<br/>
<br/>
Next I made it into a .a library using archive:
<br/>
<br/>
ar rvs Splash.a Splash.o
<br/>
<br/>
...ok anyway...now I want to access this data from an app that the .a file is linked to. How do I do this?
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking that I could just declare "extern" variables and access the data this way but it is not working.

I removed the "const" from the original declaration and now it works!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I remember having a similar problem a long time ago. As I recall, C++ seems to have a funny way of dealing with extern const data. If you have const data in a cpp file and you want to access it somewhere else you need to ad extern declarations in both the other file <span style="font-style: italic">and</span> the data file:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
// in foodata.cpp
<br/>
extern const u16 data[];
<br/>
<br/>
const u16 data[]={...};
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
// code.cpp
<br/>
extern const u16 data[];
<br/>
// use as normal
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
This isn't necessary in C, but it apparently is in C++. Try this instead of removing const, which as DiscoStew said would place it into IWRAM which is not a good place to store a splash image.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I didn't realize until recently that const in C++ means something different than const in C.  (Just when you thought you understood C++!)  I guess const definitions are almost like #defines, unless you take their address or declare them extern, which turns them into regular memory objects.
<br/>
<br/>
Anybody have a more complete explanation of the differences?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That is the difference. ;)
<br/>
In C++, anything defined as const is by default only generated if there is a requirement for it to be generated (used in scope, extern, or address taken).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
