<br/>
<br/>
I am very stumped at making my game.  It is just a snake remake.  I know the process and everything, but as coding goes I don't know how really.  I have everything setup with the menus, and all that, but I don't know how to draw the background, make the food, and make/update the snake. 
<br/>
<br/>
Any input is appreciated and if someone could give me some help in starting it all up, then that would be great.  Thanks in advance.
<br/>
