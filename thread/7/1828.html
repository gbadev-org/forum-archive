    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have you tried using the GBA Project Appwizard? It's in the Tools&gt;Misc from the main page. Install it, choose your headers/links, and compile with the Build option. I usually use the Pern PRoject stuff. You'll have to go through the MAK file to change the DevKitAdv folder directory, since for some reason (with me), it never sets the right directory I give it at the starting prompt. Give it a try.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
