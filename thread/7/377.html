    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm how about 50 programmers, musicians, artists and designers? :P

Nah joking. The answer really is that you have to be able to program, use a compiler and linker (Devkit Advance), have experience with embedded environments (GBA hardware), draw excellent computer graphics (Photoshop, PaintShopPro etc), create beautiful scores of music (Instruments), and be creative enough to develop a great storyline. Oh and a couple of decades to do something that took teams of professionals a long time to do. :P<br/>_________________<br/>microkernel advance</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
