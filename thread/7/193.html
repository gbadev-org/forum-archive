    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just started using the HAM environment/libraries last night.  I did a quick test just to see if it was working.  I had it print a small message, a hello world just for testing.  When I ran

everything compiled well,  but if I tried to run the ROM in BoycottAdv,   it would not work.  If I ran

make vba

of course it would come up in VBA emulator just fine.  My question is how do I compile a rom that would work outside of the HAM environment?  Probably something easy, but hey  I am a beginner :)

I'll try to distinguish HAM-specific binary formats from BA incompatibility of the HAM library.
<br/>
<br/>
What happens if you open VBA 1.3.1 and then open the ROM from VBA's Open... dialog box?  If it doesn't work, then HAM must be using a custom binary format.
<br/>
<br/>
Another possibility is that the ROM is actually not a plain ROM but rather an ELF file.  What happens when you do this?
<br/>
<br/>
$(ARMOBJ) -O binary your-rom.elf real-rom.gba
<br/>
<br/>
What happens if you copy the ROM onto a flash cart?  If it works from flash but not from BA, then ditch BA.  At least from my most basic tests, BA is known to have several problems such as de-synchronization between GB channels and PCM channels.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all
<br/>
<br/>
this is not a HAM problem, but a BoycottAdvance problem. The HAM examples run on any VBA, and on real hardware as well. If it does not work with BA, its a BA incompatibility , not a HAM incompatibility.

I believe it is actually a ream rom.  It creates the .elf file and does the -O binary in the make file.  I don't have a flash setup yet so I cannot test that.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem is with BA.   Some sort of compatibility issue.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
