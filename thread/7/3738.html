    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have not heard of DevC++, but that could very well be because when I looked for a compiler, I found DevKitAdvance right away and there is nothing better as far as I am concerned.
<br/>
<br/>
So may I ask what is wrong with using just the DevKitAdvance?  It already comes with a C++ compiler (I am assuming that DevC++ is a compiler) and is easy to use.
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, to compile a basic ROM you can use these simple commands in a BAT (batch) file:
<br/>
<br/>
set path=C:\devkitadv\bin;%path%
<br/>
gcc -o hello.elf hello.c -lm
<br/>
objcopy -O binary hello.elf hello.gba
<br/>
<br/>
(replace "hello" with the name of your C file containing your main loop)
<br/>
<br/>
I've found this works in almost every case I've had, except where I wanted to use the AAS (Apex Audio System), in which case I used the Makefile included with it, then just ran the DevKitAdvance (Windows 2000 command is "C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\CMD.EXE /k cmd-rc.bat", make sure you run from same directory as the cmd-rc.bat file), changed dirs to my project where the Makefile is, and typed "make".  Away it goes, and life is good.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if any of this will help, but it's a nickel's worth of free advice in any case.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
and look at 'BuildGBA v1.1' by 	JointJunkie.
<br/>
<br/>
I've not tried it, but I think it might be what you're looking for ?
<br/>
<br/>
cheers

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, thanx, that worked very well, for the people that doesn?t know Dec C++ is not a compiler,  is a one of the best IDEs to program in C/C++ and its free. Its come with th Mingw compiler but is compatible with GCC.
