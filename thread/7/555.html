OK, first my setup. I'm trying to use GBFS to provide script and graphics data for a generic GBA RPG engine. I'm using HAM as a development library, and VisualHAM for my IDE.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to include gbfs.h and libgbfs.c in my main program, but when I try and build I get a load of errors like:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">In file included from main.cpp:5:
<br/>
libgbfs.c: In function `const void* gbfs_get_obj(const GBFS_FILE*, const char*, u32*)':
<br/>
libgbfs.c:108: cannot convert `void*' to `GBFS_ENTRY*' in assignment
<br/>
libgbfs.c:102: warning: `GBFS_ENTRY*here' might be used uninitialized in this function </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I've never tried to code in C or C++ before (I've had a Java background) so excuse me being an utter newbie but I think my problem stems from GBFS being C code, and me trying to code in C++ (I'm trying to keep my project object oriented). gcc will compile both C and C++ right? If so, can I use C libraries like GBFS in a C++ program? Am I on completely the wrong track and there's an obvious answer? If this is impossible are there any plans to port GBFS to a C++ codebase, or any alternative packages in C++ that perform a similar function?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for all the questions, and thanks for your time ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I have not tested GBFS with HAM, only with Devkit Advance.

<br/>
<br/>
Do NOT #include one .c file from another .c file or from a .cpp file.
<br/>
It's a bad habit that seems most widespread among beginners who
<br/>
don't know how to use the linker properly.  Instead, add libgbfs.c to
<br/>
your project's list of source files and put this in main.cpp:
<br/>
extern "C" {
<br/>
  #include "gbfs.h"
<br/>
}
<br/>
The extern "C" part is there to mark the function prototypes in
<br/>
libgbfs.h as using C calling conventions.

<br/>
<br/>
Object orientation can be done in C; just look at GNOME.

<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but you'll have to compile them in separate compilation units.
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing you'll have to watch out for when using GBFS with C++:
<br/>
GBFS returns pointers to objects as (const void *).  C automatically
<br/>
casts between generic pointers (void *) and specific pointers
<br/>
(GBFS_ENTRY *), but C++ doesn't.  You'll have to put some casts
<br/>
in your code.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
