    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know that for normal sizes you would have it set to SQUARE, and then SIZE_16 or however big it is for sprites, but how would you use one thats 16x17? RECTANGLE, I've seen used before, but I haven't found a good tutorial on irregular sizes for say, 20 width by 10 height.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Basically the gba can handle numbers of the power of two (think binary)
<br/>
You can have anything like 16x32 32x64 etc just use WIDE and/or LONG (I think) but you cannot have have sizes like 20x20 or 20x21 etc. If you want that then go one size higher and just make everything else clear.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think yaustar gave the answer you were needed to the question: if you have graphic that is actually 16x17 just use one of 16x32, you?ll waste some space around the edges, but might be your only answer. However, if you just need a block graphic that is exactly 16x17, say a solid color or something, just to fit exactly into a space ? don?t forget about the sprite scaling options. Just scale the y a bit until your 16x16 sprite fills a 16x17 area.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
