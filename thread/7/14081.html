I would suggest learning <a class="postlink" href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/win95upg/tool_s/1.0/w95/en-us/olddos.exe" target="_blank">QBasic</a>; it's so easy to get started with the concept of programming. When I got my first PC and had nothing else to use I got to grips with programming using QBASIC. The commands are simple, and since I knew the concept of basic this wasn't hard at all. Mind you I had been through lots of books on BASIC that were written for young children, so I was already accustomed to it, in fact you should be able to find a handful of books on BASIC in the children's section of the library!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Eckels book is good as are many others but if you haven't done any programming and you want to learn C++, THE introductory book is
<br/>
Accelerated C++ <a class="postlink" href="http://www.acceleratedcpp.com/" target="_blank">http://www.acceleratedcpp.com/</a>
<br/>
(Edit: It's not free, but considering the huge investment of time involved in learning C++, it would be crazy to refuse the best texts for the sake of a few quid...) 
<br/>
<br/>
One thing to remember though is that modern C++ programming and gameboy C++ programming are not the same...
<br/>
<br/>
probably best to learn the basics using Accelerated C++, then get a good book on C so you can understand the low level techniques that are often used in console C++ programming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can think of a couple things that might make C++ less attractive for GBA development:
<br/>
<br/>
You need to know the true semantics of each language feature. Because C++ is both newer and larger than C, a lot of C++ books get this wrong. After you learn the basics, follow up with <span style="font-style: italic">Effective C++ CD</span> by Scott Meyers so that you can begin to unlearn any misconceptions you may have learned.
<br/>
<br/>
You need to be aware of how much space and time overhead each feature adds. But one of the first things they teach you in C++ (#include &lt;iostream&gt;) has a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/rant/#cbloatbloat" target="_blank">huge space overhead</a> if you try it with GNU libstdc++ on a small embedded system such as the Game Boy Advance.
<br/>
<br/>
But once you overcome these, you should have little problem with C++.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I'm not sure your assumptions differ from my experience, but they do !
<br/>
<br/>
I find my C++ code to be readable even on larger projects, more so than if I had had to use plain C. It doesn't have any 'overhead' either compared to equivalent C code...
<br/>
<br/>
@the OP
<br/>
I would suggest that diving straight into GBA coding as a means to learning C++ is a mistake. Coding C++ for a platform like GBA requires so much 'extra' knowledge and so many deviations from 'best' practice that it might be counterproductive....
<br/>
<br/>
Learn the basics of modern C++ on a PC using Accellerated C++ that will teach you how to use the important features of the STL, and other stuff that you probably wont use on GBA but would be expected to use elsewhere....
<br/>
Then when you have that down, learn the C style coding that is required for Some parts of GBA development; learn how to switch off and do without some of the features like Exceptions and RTTI; learn how to avoid using dynamic allocation; learn how to write your own custom memory allocators; how to control the Linker....
<br/>
...and a whole bunch of other stuff that you need to understand for GBA dev but will get in the way if you are a beginner to programming....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
