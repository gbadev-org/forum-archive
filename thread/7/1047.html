    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to change sprite priorities by changing attribute 2 of my sprites. When ever I write to attribute2 bit 11 the graphics get messed up.
<br/>
<br/>
Started like this:
<br/>
sprites[num].attribute2 |= (prio&lt;&lt;10);
<br/>
<br/>
but this doesn't even work:
<br/>
<br/>
sprites[num].attribute2 |= BIT11;
<br/>
<br/>
Any sugestions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a feeling people might be able to help you more if you were a bit more descriptive in what's going wrong. You say "the graphics get messed up." What does that mean? Are you entirely sure that the sprite isn't just appearing where it should, for example, under a map or something? Have you tried running it in an emulator and checking out that specific sprite to make sure that it's loaded and looking correct on its own?
