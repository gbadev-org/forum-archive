    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, here it is. This is a continuation of a post I made in the DS dev forum that led to silent_code teaching me all of that wonderful magic that you guys call coding. He suggested I move it here, so I did. Last thing I asked:
<br/>
<br/>
when you say: 
<br/>
"int ruffle = waffle * baffle &amp; waffle;" 
<br/>
<br/>
what does the baffle <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">&amp;</span></span> waffle part do? 
<br/>
oh, and how do you know whether a variable you declare is global or local?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you sure the punctuation in that line of code is correct?  The &amp; and * operators have completely different meanings in certain places.
<br/>
<br/>
If your line is transcribed correctly, then * is the multiplication operator, and &amp; is the bitwise AND operator, but nobody uses the bitwise and operator without parentheses ( ) around it, which is why I'm not sure if you transcribed the line correctly.  The makes of the C standard screwed up in operator precedence order, and gave bitwise AND a much lower priority than it should have in most actual uses.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey Alpha, I like helping people learn to program, but there's way too much material to learn exclusively by asking questions on a forum.  It'll take you forever to learn that way, and a lot of people will wonder why you're not reading a book.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another question (yes, I have even more of them). Is there a simple way to draw lines that I am missing? The way I have been doing it involves putting something like this inside a while loop I am using.
<br/>
<br/>
while(1)
<br/>
<br/>
if (X &lt;= 256)
<br/>
{VRAM_A[(tileX)+(tileY)*SCREEN_WIDTH] = RGB15(0,0,31);
<br/>
X ++;
<br/>
}
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This draws it pixel by pixel, and when trying to use it for anything that involves a position for the line that isn't set, it can be a real hassle. Any help to get me beyond this pixel by pixel approach would be much appreciated.

I did not read the post, but the variable names frightened me at first sight.  They break the rule of "do not give variables similar names".  They may break the rule of "give variables meaningful names", although that rule can only be taken so far when applied to theoretical code examples.  Furthermore, I think the line is too busy.  Just as every function should do one thing and do it, so should individual lines (in general).  Personally, I would rewrite it is as:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">int ruffle = waffle * baffle;
<br/>
ruffle &amp;= waffle;</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
The above is still missing something very important.  The above code is not an idiom, and expecting anyone to know what you are doing just by looking at it is foolish.  This is a case where the code <span style="font-weight: bold">needs</span> to be commented.
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">// Set the ruffle setting for the waffle iron.  (or whatever you are actually doing)
<br/>
int ruffle = waffle * baffle;
<br/>
<br/>
// Mask the setting - see spec for details.  (or whatever you are actually doing)
<br/>
ruffle &amp;= waffle;</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
If the variables had meaningful names, the code may have been self documenting instead of confusing.
<br/>
<br/>
For what it is worth, I could see using int "va = vb * (vc &amp;&amp; vd);".  This sets va to vb if both vc and vd are true, otherwise va is set to zero.  The following C program, tested with gcc, illustrates a possible usage:
<br/>

@sgeos: all you've written is perfectly right.

@general: but for a beginner and especially for a totally random example, that needs no meaning and sense, but to show when declaring is needed, my example was "good enough".

i had in mind to show him, step by step how to make it meaningful and usable by showing him something "bad", then turn it into something "good".

If you are not open to what people are trying to teach you, then you are wasting our time.  Again, I suggest picking up the basics from your book before asking general questions; I suspect most of what people will try to teach you is precisely the information you won't find in your text, unless your question is very specific.

Chances are, you'll struggle with the text for weeks or months before you "get it".  If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think I will just avoid that one for now. I was confused, because when I made my program (and I am now sure I must have done something wrong, although it worked fine...) I used one &amp; rather than &amp;&amp; for the logical one, and it worked as I intended. Maybe the compiler is just smart like that, but I guess I will just be careful of how I write it in the future. edit: Operators... good idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When you want to ask about error output from the compiler then it's helpful to quote the exact error or warning from the build process.
<br/>
<br/>
I assume the error you're asking about is similar to this
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
template.cpp:70: error: 'void swapBuffers()' was declared 'extern' and later 'static'
<br/>
template.cpp:16: error: previous declaration of 'void swapBuffers()'
<br/>
make[1]: *** [template.o] Error 1
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
in which case you have a prototype for a function which is later declared static in the function body. This can be fixed by either removing the static keyword from the function body or adding it to the prototype.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Actually, this is a case where I'm going to disagree.  One should really learn about <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_logic" target="_blank">boolean logic</a> before picking up a book.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Alphanoob wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">so, what exactly *does* the &amp; symbol do in something such as</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Boolean logic is not specific to any particular language, and need it for control flow (if, for, while).  Without control flow, your programs can't do anything useful.  So, my advice is, forget about &amp;, &amp;&amp;, |, ||, !, ~, ^ and friends for a while, and read about <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_logic" target="_blank">boolean logic</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
When boolean logic makes sense, the following explanation should be fairly easy to grasp.
<br/>
&amp;&amp; is a boolean AND.  &amp; is a logical AND (ie, AND is performed on every bit).
<br/>
<br/>
For what it is worth, in C:
<br/>
0 is FALSE
<br/>
anything else is TRUE
<br/>
<br/>
So, (5 &amp;&amp; 10) is TRUE (some non-zero value, probably 1).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">lol, funny you say that. Boolean logic is pretty much what I am doing in math class. We just started probabilities (in functions, stats, and trig class), and were using those funny u = (union = "or") and n = (intersection = "and") lol. I do kinda get that stuff, especially from programming in basic, when those are about all that you have at your disposal for useful commands. =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
