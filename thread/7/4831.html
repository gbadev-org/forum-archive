<br/>
<br/>
I really thought it would be a while before I bothered everyone with another question on here.  I deeply appreciate all the help I have received from this board and I hope to one day add my own tips for people seeking help.
<br/>
<br/>
Today I thought I'd change to C++ so I can use classes, first of all I renamed all my .c files to .cpp files and suddenly lots of errors to fix?! - ok fixed them and then I realised I should also change from gcc to g++.
<br/>
<br/>
Since changing to G++ I'm getting a weird error which I have tried searching for answers:
<br/>
<br/>
../../devkitadvance/bin/../lib/gcc-lib/arm-agb-elf/3.0.2/../../../../arm-agb-elf
<br/>
/bin/ld: cannot find -lstdc++
<br/>
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
<br/>
<br/>
is this something about a lib?  :*(
<br/>
<br/>
Any advise on how to fix it?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks once again!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well this is embarrasing, I don't know how old my DevKitAdvance is but I must have installed it incorrectly when I 1st set it up; as I have now reinstalled DKA from the PERN project (zipped) and it compiled and working :)
<br/>
<br/>
It did seem to be a library file "libstdc++.a"
<br/>
<br/>
but Im happy now, sorry for posting too early!
<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,
