    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm kinda new to this forum so I hope this hasn't been asked before. I checked the present topics but I couldn't find anything so here goes:
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't found any rounding off functions. I could make one if I knew how to get the fraction part of a float, but i don't know that either. Does anyone know how to do that? And is there perhaps a mathematical reference available, because I have no idea what a lot of functions in math.h do.
<br/>
<br/>
Another question: How do I set the title of a program in the mutliboot screen?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Don't use floating point on the GBA. It is emulated in software and will be impossibly slow.
<br/>
<br/>
Learn how to do <a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=fixed+point+arithmetic" target="_blank">fixed-point arithmetic</a>, then <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=2036" target="_blank">see this topic</a> for instructions on how to round off fixed-point variables.

Sorry I can't help you out with your other queston, as I've never used multiboot.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you realy want to use use floats, it's real easy to round a float.
<br/>
<br/>
All you have to do is to add 0.5f before you store in a int
<br/>
<br/>
ex.  1.9 + 0.5 = 2.4 -&gt; 2
<br/>
       1.4 + 0.5 = 1.9 -&gt; 1</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I totally forgot about that one. Indeed, just adding 0.5 before turning into an int works.
<br/>
<br/>
Thx!
<br/>
<br/>
Still, does anyone know how to change the title of a program shown at multiboot?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
