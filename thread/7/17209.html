    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Avoid System.Drawing.  It's a wrapper for GDI, and is slower than hell.
<br/>
I hear there are .NET wrappers for libraries like Allegro or SDL, maybe look into those.  I haven't worked with them yet.
<br/>
<br/>
There's also plain old DirectX for .NET as well.
<br/>
<br/>
But if you're doing .NET, skip VB and jump straight into C#.
<br/>
If you're using VB5/6, I shudder.  VB5/6 is horrible.  I know that because I've used it too much and see all of its flaws.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dwedit is right VB6 is crap but I also think VB.NET is aswell but that's the syntax not the language. VB.NET compiles the same as C# so go with what you like.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as gaming API's well I'm not even sure if XNA supports VB.NET I know it didn't a while ago but doesn't make sense to not now. So try XNA, that is your best bet, and there are wrappers for practically everything in .NET these days from OpenGL, to as Dwedit said Allegro or SDL.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's a reason why we have all these strange rules when in comes to punctuation, it's because it makes reading easier.  Imagine what Wikipedia would be like if it was written the way you post, it would be unreadable.
