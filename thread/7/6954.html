    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A library is a compiled form of source code.  It allows you to use the source code without access to the original C code.  A header file is like a declaration of what is inside the library and how to use it.  Some people don't like to give out their source code outright so they will often compile their source into a library for distribution as well as the header file so others can use it.  
<br/>
<br/>
When you compile a C file you end up with a .o (object) file.  Multiple .o files can be packaged into an .a file (archive).  Think of it like a zip file for .o files.  Your compiler knows the format of archives so it can use it when linking your program.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
