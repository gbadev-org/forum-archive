    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've tried using various methods, but I could only get transfer to work one way. howevere since then I've found I'm probably losing data because I wasn't allowing a delay between transfers. I'll let you know how it goes when I get around to sorting it out again, that or someone else might be able to help you out. But in the mean time check out the gbatek document and read the part about serial communication, thats what I was working off.<br/>_________________<br/>[url="http://www.ice-d.com"]www.ice-d.com[/url]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Slip, you said that you was previously working on GBA communications. Since I've had no such luck in finding information since posting this topic, I was wandering if you would be as kind as to email the code you were working on so that I could get a sense of the requirements for GBA communication.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After all this time (amongst doing other things), I still haven't had any luck. This is how far I've got for doing Normal Mode communciation.
<br/>
<br/>
               REG_SCD0 = 0x?????? \\This initializes the data I want sent
<br/>
<br/>
	REG_SCCNT_L = BIT13; \\Set 32 bit Communication mode
<br/>
<br/>
	while(REG_SCCNT_L &amp; BIT02) {} //wait for SI to become low
<br/>
<br/>
	//GBA has detected tje GBA link cable
<br/>
<br/>
	REG_SCCNT_L = REG_SCCNT_L | BIT07; //Set start flag
<br/>
<br/>
	while(REG_SCCNT_L &amp; BIT07) {} //wait IRQ to become 0
<br/>
<br/>
	//Process recieved data
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone please help me send information to another GBA without a cartridge so I can run a program on it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I worked a simple version of this out a while ago.
<br/>
<br/>
The information is up on my site: <a href="http://downtou.cjb.net" target="_blank">http://downtou.cjb.net</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I have worked out a little more since then and have yet to update.
<br/>
<br/>
#define PLAYER_CNT	*(vu8 *)0x4000134
<br/>
<br/>
#define PLAYER1 0x80
<br/>
<br/>
This bit gets set to 0x80 if the player one link cable is plugged in, player 2-4 seems to do nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps you!
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the bump</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh, by the way, ive changed the web address to: <a class="postlink" href="http://downtou.whiz.at/" target="_blank">http://downtou.whiz.at/</a>, it now has no pop ups.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://downtou.ne1.net/" target="_blank">http://downtou.ne1.net/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's pretty simple when you get down to it. The way I did it was to buy myself a copy of NO$GBA which allows you to view the serial comms registers as it emulates it.
<br/>
<br/>
As slip said, the GBATek document is your best bet.
<br/>
<br/>
I may upload the serial communications part of the library soon. It does have a slip area in there somewhere where an error can occasionally get past my error detection which I may fix first or I may just give out as is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
