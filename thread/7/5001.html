    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well it was made by WntrMute (from memory) and he used to be a very helpful member of gbadev.org and #gbadev (or at least he was last time i went there ages ago). I think the only reason he hasn't updated it is that it works so damn well.
<br/>
<br/>
On his website (devkit.tk) there is build scripts to build it from source, shouldn't be much of an effort to build a gcc4 gba compiler that works with devkitarm makefiles using this.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

....works great, with all the benefits of 3.4 optimization, and it has a java and Insight. Hadn't heard about it before but looks like I'm switching, thanks :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It isn't cygwin. 
<br/>
<br/>
It has GBA specific crtls built in
<br/>
It has GP32 specific crtls built in
<br/>
<br/>
It's a considerably smaller download

If you have Visual Studio 6, then <a class="postlink" href="http://www.twistedpairgaming.com/gbadev" target="_blank">GBAForVS6</a> &lt;/plug&gt; makes DevKitARM easy to get up and running.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
