 Guess its kinda hard to cover up the fact that I'm a noob at the homebrew scene, but I have a long history of programming. Plus I've gotten a few game modification under my belt...

He probably uses other languages for programming.  I wouldn't blame him.  Honestly, they don't even use C++/C much in Computer Science and engineering course work anymore (except in Comp graphics or if a professor has any practical sense).  I actually had to learn everything on my own (except a small blurb in a class I took way back when).  I learned mainly through interest.
<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, all my other grad student CompSci Friends don't know the first thing about C/C++ or even most pointers/memory management concepts.  It's weird really, when all these high level buzz word languages take hold,, no one is going to know how to manage memory/etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I know plenty of guys who cannot program without a full fledged API.  Hey calls it "pampered by .NET".  Proprietary languages? :( , boo.  I had the luck of having to design and debug embedded hardware and being forced to use systems with no ported APIs.   
<br/>
<br/>
I have an A.I professor that referenced a page on this affect of only learning higher level programming (compromises and benefits).  I should find it. It was kind of interesting.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You learn loads of Math, theory and science as Keldon said.  But the difference is the practical aspects (such as a industry standard language) are neglected due to being "too complex" or other such ridiculous reasons.  That's why I did Computer Engineering for undergrad :)... but no Masters Science offered in CE!  So now I am stuck doing MS in CS, but I still like it.  More focused now.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the point I am making is that C++ people who are not using it in industry, or are new grads, are harder to find these days. Not a surprise many folks don't remember c++ syntax etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately for the non Engineers (CS majors, non CE) they will no longer be required to take much of the engineering core at our university.  This includes theoretical modern physics, and mechanical Phys, as well as electrical phys and Circuits. Gads.. and a 'different' version of CalcI/II/II.. no Diff eq, no linear Alg...  What's left, just programming/algorthims and computing concepts?  Ouch... oh well.  I suppose it is more focused on industry requirements now (Biomedical informatics etc) *Shrug*</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by elyk1212 on Mon Dec 24, 2007 2:01 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

There are many modules where there isn't even any programming but I'll bet your socks they are useful for programming in some way!
<br/>
<br/>
Why Java is chosen as the weapon of choice in a lot of computer science courses is simple; there's a lot less to have to worry about so from a teaching perspective you can get to the point a lot quicker.
<br/>
<br/>
However I feel that one of the major downsides to teaching with Java is that people are more likely to adopt more memory unfriendly algorithms, simply because they're easier to write. Also the length storing arrays, memory ignorant containers, String class, and garbage collector can grow a student who thinks very high level, but totally ignorant of the stuff that Java's API and VM hide!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, most of my grad classes are like that, except for occasional programs (and the other exception is graphics, there are loads of theory and programming there).  
<br/>
<br/>
I guess It isn't "necessary" to learn all C/C++, since there are so many facets of CS/CE and problem solving in general, but just weird to see it all change. Yeah, there's no need to know "all" of any language, I think.  But there is a real industry demand for C/C++  experience in some areas,  even in the electrical engineering.   Or at least engineers that can program at a low level.
<br/>
<br/>
 What happens when we develop a new architecture?  Someone makes an ASM to tie to OP codes... then later (magic of YACC grammars and sweat ,etc) there is a C compiler.  With some interesting exceptions, they're not putting Java or scheme,etc on these embedded test boards etc.. Just too high level. 
<br/>
<br/>
 Also, I think this tends to muddy the concepts of memory organization and (as  mentioned), what really "goes on".  Maybe.... You will see this shortening the gap between IT folk and the CS.. maybe (?).   Scary.... hope not though.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
But in all honesty Computer Science isn't really about getting into the industry (IMO), it's really geared towards research and people who have an academic interest. However it's an odd one, I couldn't say whether CS is a good choice or not for someone who wants to pursue a software development career. One of my colleagues has this view - as far as he's concerned CS has done sod all for his programming.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to get into the industry I think SE might actually be the more logical choice! But then again it all depends on what field you're interested in. The vision, graphics and sound department are all C (and maybe C++).

that doesn't stop me from know over 13 different programming languages, including c/c++, PHP, UScript, and even a bit of Java. Most of them self taught.

I was in a Computer Science &amp; Digital Electronics Honours program, but turns out I have math tests.  plus like Keldon, I learned that it doesn't lead towards the game industry. So I went into Art to round out a good portfolio.

Honestly engineering drove loads of my creativity  (and energy) out the window lol.   
<br/>
<br/>
Just to be clear, I wasn't saying anything bad about your education or anything, art's totally awesome.  Also, I forget many parts of languages, especially if they lay dormant in my usage.. I think everyone has done this.  Indirectly, this brought up a slightly off topic subject that is hot in the minds of students and prof at our university:  Many completing the CE/CS programs, don't seem to know C/C++ or lower level languages (including general ASM and memory concepts).  At times, I am included in this statistic.   This wasn't the case for many past graduates.  CE had about 70% focus on CS classes, so I am in tune with CS Academia to some degree.

You may be right for some career paths. However, language curriculum changes focusing on <span style="text-decoration: underline">very</span> high level abstractions seem to have led to much confusion on core computing concepts.  These choices matter, in that they can lead to different ways of thinking.  For instance, you would not program the same way in a purely functional lambda calculus based language, e.g. scheme, as compared to an imperative language.  Just  the same is true if you program with solely Java (or other memory managed languages), you would miss out on many Cache organization and memory management topics, as you don't "get your hands dirty" enough with the material, so-to-speak.  Therefore, their way of thinking while programming may not consider these topics if not forced to implement them directly in some way..  <span style="font-weight: bold">Anyway, it is just a hot topic right now... and it really had nothing to do with your post.</span> That's my bad.
