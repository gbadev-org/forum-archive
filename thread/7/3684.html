You can see (if you go frame by frame) the first the sprite is draw to the screen and then a partial tile set, then the rest of the tileset and then it orientates the VOFS and HOFS.  Is there any way to load the whole tile set and sprites and then display to the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I am mainly trying to get rid of the tile set initialization stuff that is going to the screen.
<br/>

Thanks,</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not quite sure about this, but have you tried enabling OBJ_ENABLE and BG0_ENABLE (or whatever backgrounds to be enabled) in REG_DISPCNT after all the background and sprite initializations? This could be a simple way if you are not worried about transitions. Now if you plan to do transitions like fading, you'll need to start using the REG_BLDMOD, REG_COLV and REG_COLY registers.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That gets rid of the map + sprite going to the scrren early.

The next problem is that there is a white blank screen while the tile set is loading.  Is there anyway to make this screen black?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It could be a Forced Blank, or maybe the frame buffers are cleared after your 2 image screens are shown (since in the demo the 1st palette is white), I not quite sure.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
