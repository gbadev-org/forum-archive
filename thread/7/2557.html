    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can use makefiles to tell VC++ to compile with gcc or g++. That's the closest I can think of. Never tried it on anything other than VC++ 6.0 though. Either way, google makefiles and see what you can find.<br/>_________________<br/>-Arek the Absolute</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
