    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone.
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone tell me the easiest way to make a .cpp file that i have made (and working perfect in my computer) .nds or .gba so i can run it in my nds?
<br/>
<br/>
It is not something special. Just a hello world. I just wanna know the easiest way to compile .cpp files to nds compatible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There are many things to do, and that operations are automatically computed, normally, by a software construction tool, like make, scons, aap, autotools, cmake and many many others, but if you want to compile only a file without use a software construction tool you can execute the following commands:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">arm-eabi-g++ file.elf -o file.o -I /path/to/libnds/includes -L /path/to/libnds/libraries -l nds9 -mcpu=arm9tdmi -mtune=arm9tdmi -mthumb-interwork -specs=ds_arm9.specs -DARM9
<br/>
arm-eabi-objcopy -O binary file.elf file.bin
<br/>
ndstool -c file.nds -9 file.bin</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I think that I don't forget anything, but a thing like this at hand is a pain :)
<br/>
If you want to develop an homebrew I think that is better that you learn how to use a software construction tool ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
