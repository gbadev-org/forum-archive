<br/>
<br/>
I've tried many things to get this done...  I've tried using BMP and PNG, resizing the image to GBA's screen size, using different code options...  NOTHING WORKS!!  Can anyone give me some sample code to do this?  Or, a tutorial on GBA programming (SGADE and devkitARM)?  The Boulder Bombers Advance doesn't show how to use bitmap (0) mode, and that's the only tutorial Google yells out...  Can anyone help me?  Thanks! ;)<br/>_________________<br/>"My wealth has doubled since we last met."

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try freemirror from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/" target="_blank">my GBA page</a>. It's pretty old, so it might need a few updates to the build process to work on devkitARM (try using arm-elf-gcc each time, and use -specs=gba_mb.specs at the link phase).
<br/>
<br/>
And no, mode 0 is not a "bitmap" mode as most people understand the term. The "bitmap" modes of the GBA are the extended rotation modes (3 to 5), which do not use tiles.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

[edit]Hold on a second...  I've been to your page before, and I played your "Tetanus On Drugs" game!  I cracked up at that! :-D[/edit]<br/>_________________<br/>"My wealth has doubled since we last met."
