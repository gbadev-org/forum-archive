You return the address of a function to change to that state.  The problem with this architecture is that I can't pass data from one state to another without global variables, and that would be very useful.  Any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
I think my functions might need a void pointer passed in, or soemthing to that effect.

What you're dealing with is "continuations", a concept which will be familiar to those who know Scheme.  You'll need to return a data structure that holds three things: a reference to the next function to be called, (optionally) the arguments to call it with, and its environment (possibly a void *).
<br/>
<br/>
To learn more about continuations and their implementation in C, read <a class="postlink" href="http://homepage.mac.com/sigfpe/Computing/continuations.html" target="_blank">this</a><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The arguements to call a function with are of variable size.  How is this dealt with?  (malloc probably)  What do you mean by environment?
<br/>
<br/>
I thought of having a state loader/saver for each funtion that stores the parameters as staic variables.  (Takes a save flag and a load flag.)
