    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think such a thing is available since patching overwrites whatever's currently in eeprom. You can only reset it if the device has a sort of reset mechanism, which will copy the original content from rom to eeprom...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">EEPROM patch programs was developed for pirates that want to play their pirated games on flashcarts that do not support EEPROM savegames. If you want to "undo" it you'll have to write your own patch program.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
