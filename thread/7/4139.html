    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had to leave behind working with the gameboy for almost a year but I'm interested in getting back into it.  At the point where I left off I had a small app that displayed backgrounds and allowed you to navigate around and I'm interested in getting back to that point as soon as possible, but before I do I have a couple questions that I hope some people can answer.
<br/>
<br/>
The dev kit advance doesn't appear to have been updated for a while.  Is there anything newer or should I use whats there?  Should I use the beta or the last stable release?
<br/>
<br/>
Are there any code libraries that will get me up and running quickly with all of the memory addresses already programmed in?  I saw the catapult engine but that's pay.  Is there anything free or do I still have to go about typing them all in by reading docs to see where they are?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You should try DevKitARM as your compiler. It seems to at least get updated compared to DevKitAdv.

As for libraries that handle specific registers like for manipulating backgrounds and sprites, chances are you aren't going to find anything, and if you do, you may be restricted as to what it does. Audio libraries, however, are plenty. The only one I've tried is AAS, and it is fast with SFX and Protracker MOD support.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you happen to know if there is any documentation on libgba anywhere?  The site just sorta drops the source code on you with no further information on where it's from or what functions are in it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
