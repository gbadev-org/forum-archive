Yes, but how do you differentiate between include-files for different languages? Besides, this is something that everyone who works on a project would have to setup manually to get decent readability of the code - not very optimal IMO.
<br/>
<br/>
I agree that data in headers is a bad idea in general, but I do find myself using it in some case. One example would be the LUTs used in Pimpmobile. Those are generated by a Python-script, and only included into one source-file. Perhaps prefixing the filename with something like "internal_" would make it clearer that it isn't for normal inclusion?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Neither is rebuilding all of your data tables whenever just one of them changes.
<br/>
<br/>
Or dealing with link errors when the file gets accidentally included in some other module.
<br/>

No matter what way I ponder it I always come back to the same question: why are you trying to force them all to be included into one file in the first place? It's simply a less scalable technique than having separate compilation units.

It could be a holdover from the days when the default %COMSPEC% shell generally limited a command line to 128 characters, requiring compiler vendors to implement workarounds in libc that were generally incompatible from vendor to vendor. It could also be a holdover from the FAT16 and HFS days when a single file filled 16 KB of a 1 GB drive even if it had only 1 KB of data. And it could be an accommodation for underpowered build hardware that has to reread and reparse a megabyte of actual header files (#include &lt;windows.h&gt; anyone?) for each separate source file.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One example situation that I might use .inc files for is if I have a table of tables that I need to edit by hand, and the child tables are too large to manage in a single file.
<br/>
You could just compile the child table files individually, but then you'd have to extern all of them in the parent table file, even though they're really supposed to be static to that file in the first place (assuming there are multiple tables within each include file. Otherwise #including would be no less hassle than externing).
<br/>
<br/>
But generally if I have a bunch of related tables that aren't too large (such as note frequency/pitch slide/etc. tables for music players), I just paste them into a single file even if they were originally autogenerated as seperate files by different tools. This is just my personal preference though, that if I won't actually be looking at/editing entries in the tables, I'd rather not have a bunch of files cluttering things up.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

"All .inc files are included in a single file" could mean that there is one module that includes all .inc files, or that for each .inc file there is exactly one module that includes it.  The latter interpretation makes much more sense.
<br/>
<br/>
A statement like "The .inc file is included wherever it's appropriate" does not imply that it's included in multiple modules.  It's quite appropriate to include it in a single, appropriately-chosen module.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, so long as they are singularly included then that's fine. I still think it's misleading and dangerous to use the header .h extension for those kinds of files, though.

Depending on what type of RCS you're using, forgetting to check new files in is often one of the bigger causes of breaks, which is why I try to add new files to the repository when I create them... of course, this wouldn't work with wildcard building (since I usually create new files off of duplicates of old files).
<br/>
<br/>
That said, wildcards can still be useful... we use them with our art assets, for example, which so far haven't required customized exclusion.

On Perforce, file checkins are part of a changelist, so the file isn't really added until you submit the changelist.

In fairness, I never knew that was in the build folder and I didn't expect it would build error-free anyway.

That's fine if you want to start with an empty .cpp/h file. I very often want to modify an existing pair, though, and it's more convenient to copy the existing files, in which case they can't be added to the repository if they will build by doing so.

Sounds nice. :(

It's hard to consider it "broken" if it's not even building. I'd rather not have people breaking the build by forgetting to check in new files... two sides of the same coin, really.

I have mine set up to look for all of the source files (.c, .s, .cpp) in the source directory and build dependencies and them compile.  The default is arm mode and using the appropriate compilers/assembler in thumb mode.  If the file is .arm.c, .arm.cpp, .arm.s them the code will be in ARM mode instead of Thumb mode.  This makes adding new files just dropping them into the correct folder and then type "make".  I does mean that if you leave a file in the folder then you might link in extra but it works pretty good.  This is not a method that I have seen many people use but it works for me.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

A lot more people are using this method due to the template projects I provide with devkitARM. Despite the apparent complexity of the makefile it's probably the best approach for beginners unfamiliar with make.
<br/>
<br/>
I even use these templates for cross platform projects including different base rules and folders depending on the target platform.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

I've never had occasion to do that though, for the simple reason that I've never wanted to duplicate an entire module.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
