    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everyone, I've made a singly <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list" target="_blank">linked list</a> creation and manipulation "library" so to speak. I've run this code on the GBA with no problems. It stores integers but can be altered to store almost anything. If you do change the type it can hold you will need to change the references in functions and the entire searchList() function, but that's pretty much it.

EDIT: This code should also work fine on the DS. I haven't tested it because my DS compiler just doesn't seem to want to compile anything at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To avoid having to modify code when using a different type... you could change to C++ and use templates.  
<br/>
<br/>
I understand there is danger to code being duplicated in the binary for some compilers, but there are ways to avoid this too (typedef LinkedList&lt;int&gt; LinkedListInt ?).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, as Mike alluded to, these things are already around in C++ for your consumption in STL, etc.  But that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to customize or roll your own for your/others use...  if it makes sense.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I recently tested.. and STL does work for GBA... at least trivially.  I haven't used it enough to say if there is a hit or caveat, in GBA anyhow.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
