    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi
<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to GBA coding, infact I'm new to C/C++ coding (fairly proficient in numerous BASIC languages, but this is the first time I've tried anything else).
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone let me know if there is some sort of document which lists commands etc for GBA coding in c/c++?  I've d/l HAM, got my compiler and IDE all working with examples, but when it comes to actually trying to code something of my own I hit a brick wall - for instance I can't find anything like a WAIT command or SLEEP (I know sleep works in windows, but the gba don't like it :)
<br/>
<br/>
I just think that having a database of commands and their usage would be an absolutely invaluable tool for learning from.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">windows? you're programming for the gba,
<br/>
a lot of prebuild functions are not available in there.
<br/>
<br/>
Since you are using HAM, i would go to there website
<br/>
and download some tutorials and/or documentation about
<br/>
HAM, that way you know what functions there are in HAM
<br/>
and not.
<br/>
<br/>
Anywayz, you can always make your own sleep command,
<br/>
<br/>
just let the cpu do something usless, that will keep him waiting.
<br/>
<br/>
hope this helps a bit<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Read the tutorials on gbajunkie.co.uk although they aren't for HAM so it might not be much use. But you'll find that programming for windows and programming for a GBA is very different. With the GBA you program much closer to the hardware and as jenswa said there are few prebuilt functions available. You will learn a lot from it. I have. 
<br/>
<br/>
Another way to do a wait command would be to use the timers that are built into the GBA. There is a tutorial on <a class="postlink" href="http://216.167.73.47/~dovoto/English/tutorial.html" target="_blank">http://216.167.73.47/~dovoto/English/tutorial.html</a> that is quite useful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
