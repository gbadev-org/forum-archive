    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've split my project into separate files so that I may compile my interrupt request handler in ARM mode, rather than thumb. As such, I have included gba.h in both files. However when I go to link everything together, I am getting multiple definition errors for stuff like OBJPaletteMem and OAMData.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't absolutely <span style="font-style: italic">need</span> to have gba.h included in my interrupt handling file, but is it possible to include the file in both of my files and not have redefinition problems?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">When you find yourself in the company of a halfling and an ill-tempered Dragon, remember, you do not have to outrun the Dragon... </span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
