    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi All,
<br/>
<br/>
I am a 'newbie' to the gba development community and have some cool ideas for some games i want to make (id o understand you can't just jump in and).
<br/>
<br/>
I want to make platform games, one like Mario/Sonic and one like MegaMan/Contra. I know this is very hard but i am very persistant and very hardworking.
<br/>
<br/>
The graphics are fine, i just need some help. I don't know any C coding yet. I can code HTML, CSS an d JavaScript if that helps.
<br/>
<br/>
All i hope for is some links to some cool tutorials and things. Maybe some sources or something. I am going to work on this so hard and want for the MegaMan one multiple weapons and things. I know this is a ll hard, i do realise but could someone please help.  :D 
<br/>
<br/>
P.S I don't really like the look of some of these websites (so black and dark) but the forums rool! I am thinking of making a site like these myself with a nice design and things. Any suggestions?<br/>_________________<br/>matt</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And no, I don't think that any website languages would improve your chances of learning GBA dev...java might...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also, do you have interest in working with someone as team?
<br/>
I know there are plenty of us coders here looking for someone

who can make graphics.
