    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I have tried and tried to get the assembly fast division code to work, but cannot. I am trying to divide an unsigned int by and unsigned int. Could somebody tell me how to do this in full, or point me to a place which tells in detail how to do this? Sorry for having to be lead by the hand through this, but I just cant get it working, and my knowledge is assembly is too limited to go through it myself!!!
<br/>
Thank you</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
