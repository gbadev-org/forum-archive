    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi folks,
<br/>
<br/>
not long ago I found the beautiful GBA and started coding it using assembly language and the really nice GoldRoad Assembler. But 'cause it's a bit strange to code some nice effects only in plain assembly I switched back to the PC (win32), learned C-language and used the nice LCC Compiler.
<br/>
Now, I want to do some codings for GBA using C-language.
<br/>
<br/>
and now my question ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any nice, short C-Compiler for the GBA (DOS/Win) ? I know, that there are some compilers discussed, like the GCC or DEVkit and so on ... but I don't want that huge ugly compilers which have to get installed with a lot of trouble ...
<br/>
<br/>
I don't need special libraries (except the standard-libraries), don't need a GUI or that stuff (Notepad rules :-) - I am a self made coder (oldschool :-)  ... so, just a straight forward C ARM Compiler, nothing more ..
<br/>
<br/>
... okay, thanks a lot 
<br/>
<br/>
[my search for compilers wasn't successful neither using google nor here in the forum ...]

You may take a little bit to download it if you have a dial-up modem, but compared to the DevKitAdv compiler, DevKitARM is much smaller. You'll also need to install MSYS, as makefiles require it (I guess). If you need help with makefiles, search the forums on that.

I think i understand what you mean. I used to code only assembly, and the assemblers i used were only a few k.b., stored in one executable without having masses of supporting files, and worked very cleanly and efficiently.
<br/>
<br/>
It would indeed be nice if there were a similar ARM C compiler. However, i think the best you would get would be a commercial compiler.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using devkitadv (gcc) which is the only setup i got to work easily, and even that took a some fiddling with makefiles. Instead of a few k.b. it uses 44.5Mb, and 425 files in 26 different folders :( It isn't particularly surprising that such a seemingly inefficient setup seems to produce not-particularly fast/efficient compiled code :(
<br/>
<br/>
However, it <span style="text-decoration: underline">does work</span>, it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">free,</span> and I don't think there is much alternative. If you do find a significant improvement on this, i'll be pleased to hear of it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I recommend trying gcc et al again.  I don't know how painful it is to install in Windows, but it can't be all that bad.  Besides, you only do it once ever and that's it.  You can start building with it.  gcc also does not use an IDE.  You can use whatever editors you want to build your apps and just call gcc on the command-line.  gcc is pretty much standard and used on a variety of platforms, so I don't know if you can get any better than that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

One thing that gets people who switch to devkitARM is that you have to specify -specs=gba.specs when linking or when compiling and linking.

<br/>
<br/>
It was a "one-click" install and most importantly allowed me to create something that actually ran on hardware without mucking with a single makefile, without having to "configure" anything, and without having to weed through (too many) docs just to get something working.  My first attempt with DEVKITADV took a couple of days to get working, while the HAMKIT took about 15 minutes.  It also comes with many examples, most of which compile and run in both HW and EMU the first time you try them.  Good for dissecting to see how things are supposed to be working...
<br/>
<br/>
The nice thing is that it comes with some stuff that will make things easier to learn until you become more comfortable with the environment, which is not like programming the PC.  Once you understand how things are compiling, linking, working, etc., you can begin to wean yourself off of the kit (sorry emanuel!) and do these things yourself.  The point is that the GBA is difficult enough to get a grasp of in the beginning, without having to "fight" the compiler or the environment.
<br/>
<br/>
Unless you are extremely comfortable with linker scripts, makefiles, and "Unix" style compiling, you may find the transition easier using HAMKIT.

jo, that's exactly what I mean ... and that's why i love assembly and the LCC-Win32 compiler ... just download, copy to the destination directory and start working ... a compiler which needs to be configured in thousands of config files just sucks, and unfortunately this is the most problem of that open source and freeware stuff (yes, I have a lot of cool open source software, just look at Goldroad :-). I want to code and not to beta-test software and write comments to forum how to get it work ... 
<br/>
<br/>
 The only guy who doesn't understand the "minimalist" prinzip seems to be sajiimori .. it's not a question of hardspace; i would install a compiler which takes GB's of space if it would run after installation .. perhaps you understand what I think, if you read the comments of the other guys ...

What is HAM? Why did you write it? When I started out on GBA development, there was little aid. The only way to start development on this precious little machine was by getting some tarballs off a GNU site, compile your cross environment, write your own linker scripts, fiddle endlessly with compiler parameters, and all that before you could even add two numbers together on the Gameboy Advance. If you were not up for this, there was no way to program this neat little machine in C or C++.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I'm not sure I totally understand these experiences people have been having.  The only trouble I ever had installing and using DevKitARM (DevKitAdv isn't really even relevant anymore) was knowing to use "arm-elf-gcc" instead of "gcc" and to use the "-specs=gba.specs" param. And all of that can be found by just glancing at the sample makefiles.
<br/>
<br/>
About what HAM's site says about the purpose of HAM (how it was hard to setup gcc to make GBA apps) hasn't been relevant since the DevKitARM. Unless wintermute can correct me, that was the whole purpose of the DevKitARM, so you didn't have to do all of that GCC patching and recompiling that HAM quote talks about.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, may be, I'm not sure ... but these simple thinks can be quite ugly if you couldn't find it on the websites ....

Also when I worked with the GB it was straight forward; the tools cannot be matched by what the GBA tools have to offer .. so it's not so seamless and rapid. Maybe it's down to me not knowing the tools enough and how to use them because everyone gets on fine.

Once the IDE was "invented", I for one spent ten years developing software without ever having to see the inner workings of a makefile or the compile chain.  Depending on when you got into development or what systems you worked on, the process can be difficult for many people, even people with a lot of programming experience (esp. Windows) to understand.<br/>_________________<br/>------------------

That's a good point, you're right about that.
<br/>
<br/>
Although since Outlaw was talking about having used Assembly and a command-line assembler rather than an IDE (Goldroad's just command-line, right? Or am I mistaken?) I assumed that he was on the more experienced end.  So that's why I was thinking along the lines of more experienced developers.

So, I downloaded a couple of gba projects with source code and within an hour, I managed to find out how to use gcc and all. Just a little googling and reading tuts was enough.
<br/>
<br/>
At first, I thought it was a hassle but in the end, I learned something. A lot of stuff in gba deving is not easy, so I guess we just have to get used to going through that kind of hassle. Have you tried debugging with gdb? I mean, it's not Visual Studio's debugger.
<br/>
<br/>
And if we don't like it, we are always free to create a better compiler with an IDE and all. But it might be an even bigger hassle ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of posters in this forum were first exposed to makefiles from GBA programming. I know I was. We learned to use them out of necessity, not because we wanted or cared to.
<br/>
<br/>
I think makefiles are crude and unfriendly, and taxing even to experienced programmers. But <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> competent programmer should be able to go digging into a pre-existing one and work out what it's doing if they have a bug to clobber. I don't get annoyed by people who have trouble doing this, just the ones that throw up their hands and don't try to begin with.

<br/>
I started ASM programming back in around '84.  Even when I moved to C in '88, I did not move to a "MAKE"-driven C environment-- all my MAKE-sytle tools were hand crafted.  Then came IDEs which hid MAKE effectively as well.  It wasn't until a few years ago that I had to get in there and muck with them on a personal level, even though I had a dozen years of hardcore programming experience under my belt.  I understand the pain associated with toiling over a makefile because I've been there-- they are still somewhat ugly beasts.  So, Outlaw could <span style="font-style: italic">still </span>be on the experienced end, just not necessarily on the makefile-experienced end :)

Yes, I come from a VS-heavy background as well.  I really like the suite, from all aspects.  I've managed to get my build cycle to be almost completely driven from VS, which is great, since I get all the nice features of the package to play with.  The only thing I really miss are the "reference library" tools (call graphs, symbol refs, definitions, etc), that I use all the time in my Windows apps.  If I could only get the gcc symbol files into the VC database format I'd be in heaven.
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I've debugged using gdb and find the experience painful at best, especially since my circa '89 Turbo C compiler had a better debugger in it.  I usually end up using VBA as my primary debugging tool.<br/>_________________<br/>------------------

In comparison with the GB development scene; GBA development is tedios until you have your working makefiles and tools set up; and even then there are too many broken links on Devrs to compare to Liz Taylor's marriages.

I agree.

The thing is people using these tools have to realize is that the devkit tools

are built upon existing toolchains (gcc and the rest of the GNU tools).  They 
<br/>
are standard tools, and can be painful to use for newbies, but they weren't

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi folks,
<br/>
<br/>
interesting discussion :-) ... yeah, I don't like Make-Files and compiler-configuration and it was never necessary for me to use them 'cause I used to code with Pascal and Assembly ... now I switched to C ( the only reason was the TinyPTC-Library (framebuffer library) for Using DirectX without knowing DirectX in detail), and I like it as language  ... 
<br/>
<br/>
Then I was looking for C Compilers (to write intros and that stuff in Win32) that were such simple to use like my (Free)Pascal or Fasm ... I tested GCC and it was just pain (even to install), I test VC, and I didn't like it 'cause using it for my needs is just like killing a fly using a Bazooka ... as I mentioned before: my needs are fullfilled when I create the Hello-World-Example, give it via command line to the compiler and I get - "Compiled &amp; Linked successfully" and it runs ... simple test - but effective. The only compiler that passed this test was LCC-Win32 (great stuff).
<br/>
<br/>
This doesn't mean that I have no idea of software and coding, it's a hobby for me for 15 years ... but in former DOS times there were great tools like Turbo C or Turbo Pascal ... I "grew up" with these great compilers and do not understand why a lot of up-to-date stuff isn't such user friendly as these software was. 
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, a lot of freeware stuff comes from the linux szene - they do a great job, no question ! - but these guys often think using and understanding "vi" (or GCC :-) is how "computer expert" is defined. It's an attitude that can be found in their software-development like a red-line.... (the second problem is, that a lot of coders are not experienced (or willing) in writing understandable manuals for their software. An example (or thousands) is no replacement for good manuals or logical, self-explaining software...)
<br/>
<br/>
Okay , I guess it's enough to explain my point of view ... :-)

Well, I guess it comes down to differing philosophies.  For people who 
<br/>
have struggled with unix-like tools and eventually got used to them and 
<br/>
realize their power, it's tough to go back.
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking for myself, I used to program in DOS as well.  It's how I got into
<br/>
programming.  I used MASM and Turbo C/C++ and the like.  However, 
<br/>
I later started using DJGPP (gcc for DOS) and after the initial pain, used
<br/>
it more frequently, and then Makefiles as well.  So I agree it is a pain
<br/>
initially to move to it, but I think in the long run, it's well worth it.  Sure,
<br/>
it's not as user-friendly, but I guess the attitude is that if you use it 
<br/>
enough, you "understand" why it works the way it does.  For people 
<br/>
who've grown accustomed to the quirks and realize it gets the job done
<br/>
very well, it doesn't matter as much that it's not as easy to learn as
<br/>
other tools on other platforms.
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, I use Emacs for text editing now versus Notepad or anything
<br/>
else.  It's got to be the most unfriendly editing tool (other than vi) on the
<br/>
planet, but once you get used to it, it's amazingly powerful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GCC is pretty good with what it does with makefiles. But I really do get put off with source downloads when you have to check for dependancies. Because you only find out after you've done configure (or the other command), and my linux does not have Internet; so imagine the fustration.

It sucks more when you're trying to compile a modem driver and it gives you a cryptic response saying, "you can no longer do this in this version of linux; if you are a developer rewrite your kernel-header include file."

Yeah, linux can be a pain to set up, but it's definitely rewarding when

you get it working.  And you learn something along the way.

<br/>
The funny thing for me was that I used to use Mandrake Linux and use
<br/>
Red Hat's RPM system.  But I got tired of all the dependency issues,
<br/>
so I moved to Slackware instead.  Now I just download the sources
<br/>
to things and build it and most of the time it just builds and works!
<br/>
However, there are odd times when the build fails and I'm not keen
<br/>
on figuring out why, so I just scrap whatever app it is I'm trying to
<br/>
build.  For development, though, I just love using Linux.  I have 
<br/>
a bunch of terminal windows open to different directories and with
<br/>
Emacs, it's just so much quicker for me to build things than to use
<br/>
Windows.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i realize that different people work differently, but what I've always liked about the Unix way is that once you learn it, it works pretty much anywhere.
<br/>
<br/>
Makefiles -- originally Unix, now I use them to build for Unix, Linux, MacOS X, Windows, and the GBA.  And they pretty much work the same anywhere I go...
<br/>
<br/>
command line -- ditto.  With things like Cygwin, even the Windows guys can get into the act.
<br/>
<br/>
vim/emacs -- personally, I don't use emacs, but I do use vim everywhere, and again, it works the same where ever i happen to be.  I don't have to go hunting around for an editor that's "like" the editor I was used to on another platform.  the one that I am used to is already there!
<br/>
<br/>
btw, regarding makefiles -- i've written one makefile for GBA programming.  One.  If you write it generically enough (and if you can't, there are others who would be willing to help you), you don't need to write any more...  just copy the makefile into your project directory, and go.
<br/>
<br/>
I would much rather have a mostly generic makefile as opposed to a collection of bash or DOS scripts that have to be tailored for each project and that aren't cross platform.
<br/>
<br/>
Just something to think about...<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Now, my program is running like lightening! It is MUCH faster. I was going to make a huge (very sexy, algorithmic) optimisation to make it run at a decent speed. However, this is now unnecessary. And I feel either cheated, or as though I am cheating :/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Perhaps the new GCC detected your inefficient algorithm and strength-reduced it. But if not, do the hand-optimization anyway if it helps, as each optimization means the code will get to the IntrWait() call sooner, saving batteries.

I'm 99% certain GCC didn't detect it. Basically it involved doing a big memory write (an entire 1024x1024 tilemap), event-triggered approximately every 100 frames, rather than writing portions (approx. 1/4) of two 512x512 tile-maps every single frame.
<br/>
<br/>
(this actually is more sexy than it may sound; on the event, less is done, so there is more time for the big write, and the big write can be better optimised and written in inline assembler)
<br/>
<br/>
The thing that surprised me a lot is that I had already severly optimised the loops in my code, so i didn't expect so much immediately visible improvement.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
