    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is the GNU (GCC) c library the best solution for GBA development ? Since the GBA is an embedded device isn't it better to use a standard C library which is optimized for embedded systems (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.uclibc.org/" target="_blank">http://www.uclibc.org/</a> comes to mind). 
<br/>
<br/>
Two more related questions:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Is DevKitAdv's gclib optimized for GBA in some way
<br/>
2. Is it a full version of the GNU gclib or it is a stripped down (i.e. a subset)
<br/>
<br/>
Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My personal opinion is that for an embedded system it's always better to strip away everything and write the functions you need for yourself. The reason why I'm voting against using standard libraries, atleast for the gba, is because of the memory restrictions aswell as often you don't need to use standard library functions. For printing your score on screen for instance, instead of doing your sprintf(buff, "You got %s points", score) you'd probably want your artist to draw a nice "You got ___ points" logo and put in the rest with moving sprites. I think the philosofy of using standard library doesn't go hand in hand with my philosophy of doing gba games.
<br/>
<br/>
That's just my opinion and I'm sure plenty of people would, and will, argue against me.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
