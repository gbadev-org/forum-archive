    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey all,
<br/>
I've been using devkit advance for awhile and been doing fine using C, but i was wondering if there was any compiler for using C++.  Specifically I want class, templete, and dynamic memory support if possible.  I do have someone's sample code i found online and it uses c++, but i don't know what they used to compile it.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks

DevKit Advance R5 Beta 3 should solve any problems that you have been having with C++.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

A bug has been reported which appears when you compile with the -mthumb/-mthumb-interwork flags and use STL.  I believe that a static constructor goes wrong.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://devkitadv.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">http://devkitadv.sourceforge.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
