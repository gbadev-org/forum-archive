OK, first my setup. I'm trying to use GBFS to provide script and graphics data for a generic GBA RPG engine. I'm using HAM as a development library, and VisualHAM for my IDE.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to include gbfs.h and libgbfs.c in my main program, but when I try and build I get a load of errors like:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">In file included from main.cpp:5:
<br/>
libgbfs.c: In function `const void* gbfs_get_obj(const GBFS_FILE*, const char*, u32*)':
<br/>
libgbfs.c:108: cannot convert `void*' to `GBFS_ENTRY*' in assignment
<br/>
libgbfs.c:102: warning: `GBFS_ENTRY*here' might be used uninitialized in this function </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I've never tried to code in C or C++ before (I've had a Java background) so excuse me being an utter newbie but I think my problem stems from GBFS being C code, and me trying to code in C++ (I'm trying to keep my project object oriented). gcc will compile both C and C++ right? If so, can I use C libraries like GBFS in a C++ program? Am I on completely the wrong track and there's an obvious answer? If this is impossible are there any plans to port GBFS to a C++ codebase, or any alternative packages in C++ that perform a similar function?
<br/>

Sorry for all the questions, and thanks for your time ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
