    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know that you can perform some vcount tricks with the scroll registers of backgrounds to get odd sized tiles and the like. I was wondering if this could be performed with the sprite cells too. Seems like it's not possible as all of the oam is written in the vblank. Could someone confirm?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Isn't there a bit you can set in the display control register than allows you to update OAM during the HBLANK or something like that?<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a reason why you wouldn't want to be able to write to the OAM during hblank? Or is it just to stop you accidently writing to it unintentionaly?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you give the PPU exclusive access to the OAM during horizontal blank time, it can display more sprite pixels on one scanline (1200 or so vs. 960 or so).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
