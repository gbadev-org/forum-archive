    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, you should learn C or C++. And you should learn it on a PC, making PC programs. This environment is allegedly friendlier than cross-development (compiling a program on one machine that is intended to run on another kind of machine).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">C++ is basically a superset of C, so you may as well compile your code as C++ from the beginning.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as the order in which to learn parts of the language, I'd start with the parts that are easiest to fully understand.  For the most part, that means starting with the C subset of the language.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, program for your PC first, and only switch to NDS after you're comfortable with the language.  Handheld programming adds another level of complexity that will only slow you down at first.
<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft offers a free version of Visual C++, which is awesome.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Tepples has the right idea -- "Yes", you should learn C or C++.  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
