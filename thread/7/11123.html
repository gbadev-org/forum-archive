    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I'm verry new to boath C++ and GBA/DS development so be warned this may sound very noobish.
<br/>
<br/>
I have been working on creating a basic program for the GBA t get use to the hardware before I try something a little more challangeing.
<br/>
<br/>
After reading about 50 million tutorials and downloading several e-books ont boath C++ and GBA dev I started to mess around with the examples to bend then to suit what I was trying to do.
<br/>
<br/>
Now all I'm trying to do at this stage is get a background on to the screen. however m getting an error when I attempt to compile it.
<br/>
<br/>
the error is as follows:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">linking cartridge
<br/>
yapg.o: In function `main':
<br/>
c:/devkitPro/msys/home/philbert/make/src/yapg.cpp(53): undefined reference to `DecodePCX(unsigned char const*, unsigned short*, unsigned short*)'
<br/>
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
<br/>
make[1]: *** [/home/philbert/make/yapg.elf] Error 1
<br/>
make: *** [build] Error 2</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Im assuming its something to do with me using C++ rather than C and that library not reading properly (it works if I make it C, but as im using C++ specific stuff else where I whant to keep it consistant).
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can point me to where I can find some more information i would be most gratefull.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's a very creative spelling of "both."  ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
putting it in the C++ file gives me a diffrent error</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's how you should declare the function.  Wherever it's declared now, surrounding it with extern "C".
<br/>
<br/>
If it's declared in a plain-C header and you don't want to modify the header, surround the #include with extern "C" instead.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
