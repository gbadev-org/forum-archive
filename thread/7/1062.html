    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The source debugger of mappy 0.9d looks very promising, unfortunately I can not get it to work. If I set any breakpoints, use "run to cursor", etc. it just starts running and does not break on any of them. 
<br/>
The selected c source lines have blue dots in front of them and on "toggle breakpoint" they do change to red, so I guess it is set correctly. But as I said above, when running the program it runs straight past those lines.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything else I need to do to enable breakpoints?
<br/>
<br/>
On a related note: I tried using VBA+insight, and though they talk to each other and I can break from VBA into insight, the breakpoints I set in insight also get ignored by VBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
