    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, please bear with me as i try to explain.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a cube, and I want to store 4 things about the cube,
<br/>
Its x Length,
<br/>
Its y Length,
<br/>
Its z length,
<br/>
Its ID.
<br/>
<br/>
I could save this information as (for example) "15,15,15,1" so "x,y,z,ID"
<br/>
<br/>
but, Would it be better to stuff the information into a 32 bit integer, thus reducing the file size???
<br/>
<br/>
as in, it would then become:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
00001111000011110000111100000001
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
and i could save that in a 32 bit integer and take out the bits i required?? Whereas saving as "15,15,15,1" i would have to use 4 variables?<br/>_________________<br/>Chris Davis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as I know, there's enough space in RAM and especially ROM that this wouldn't really be necessary, and would waste CPU time extracting the right bits and performing the caclulations needed to get the original values and update the old ones. Plus, the coding would be a tiny bit harder. If you were working with a large array it may be a problem, because the wasted space obviously multiplies up with the array size.
<br/>
<br/>
As the greats always say, it's better to save the optimising for when you need to - it'd probably be better to just use the 4 variables seperately for now and waste the few bytes of space, then if you need that space later (which is unlikely) you know what to change.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There.  Now you can replace u8 with u32 or whatever else if you need more range later.  ^_^
<br/>
<br/>
The important thing is to hide the implementation details that might change.  The interface to the cube structure shouldn't be dependent on the sizes of the elements.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
