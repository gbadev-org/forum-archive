    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody. Learning C++ right now.
<br/>
<br/>
I have no previous experience, so this should provide fun for those of you who will find pleasure in watching me fumble my way to knowledge!
<br/>
<br/>
As you know from my post in the announcements header thread, I have done Hello World twice (GBA and C++ Win32 Console). I am currently moving further into things and enjoying myself. I never thought I'd say it, but programmers are about the coolest people on the planet. 
<br/>
<br/>
Plus I'm crazy so Object Oriented thought is easily applied analytically to the real world in my head, which bugs me out. I laugh and it's fun.
<br/>
<br/>
For my first post, I was wondering if the people who regular this thread could make some introductions and if everyone would point out the best places to go from "Hello World".
<br/>
<br/>
Also, should I even be playing with GBA yet? Or is there something I should focus on first?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm Newbie J Sabott, from New Jersey in the US. 
<br/>
I love to make music of various kinds and am willing to make music for games anytime. 
<br/>
I am currently learning everything to do with Maya modeling and C++ right now, also I'm looking into the Mel language for maya, but that won't apply here. 
<br/>
<br/>
C++.
<br/>
<br/>
Let's make games.
<br/>
<br/>
Newb.

Maybe framebuffer mode first but thats pretty easy so yeah.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tiled backgrounds are easy to grasp once you've learned how to output text through <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#agbtty" target="_blank">AGBTTY</a>. Try to make the background of Mario Bros. out of ASCII art, and then add custom glyphs to the font to make it look better.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

You should probably learn C++ in a... less embedded system.

Take things one step at a time.  First learn C++, then learn the ins and outs of the GBA.  Start with basic stdin/stdout, then move onto something like curses.  Learning the curses API is simple.  The GBA text display modes are very similar.  You can even write realtime curses games =)
