    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.rmitton.com/gbacc" target="_blank">GBAcc</a>, and it's pretty good, except that I get a 'undefined or invalid # directive' whenever I try to use #include. Even if the file's correctly typed and in the same directory it doesn't show up. Is this a new feature of GCC 3, or is something horribly, horribly wrong?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Something is not right. :) Does this occur when doing system or user includes? Not that it should matter. Are you using forward slash or backslash? I've had problems when using backslash in my include directives but then I'd get bizarre errors throughout the code, not 'invalid # directive'. I assume you are trying to compile a .c file with the C compiler, not 'as' or anything. :)<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
