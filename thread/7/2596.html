    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For "the computer" as in Wintel PCs?  DirectX is for PC, so I'm not sure what you're asking.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Ohhhh, that sentence was very hard to understand.  When you said "GBA game libraries such as DirectX" it sounded like you thought DirectX was for GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess what you were really asking is whether there are any libraries for GBA that serve a similar purpose as DirectX serves on Windows.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, DirectX is mainly a way to allow game developers to write software that runs fast on any hardware that has DirectX drivers.  It's an alternative to programming directly for a particular type of device (the way many DOS games were written specifically for Soundblaster cards).
<br/>
<br/>
It's also there as a compromise between direct hardware access (which is bad on a protected OS) and bulky software layers such as GDI.  In fact, the reason it's called DirectX is because it's more direct than something like GDI.
<br/>
<br/>
Since none of those benefits apply to GBA (it's always the same hardware, and you can access the hardware directly with no problems), DirectX would be redundant.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course there are plenty of libraries that take care of some of the low-level details for you (HAM, Mushroom, SGADE, etc), if you don't want to write such code yourself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The GBA really is too simple to do something like that. There is only one area that sprite data can be contained, 4 backgrounds usable at most, and only 6 buttons and a D-pad.
<br/>
<br/>
Simple, eh?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Solution to what?  The OP only asked if there was something available.

It's too simple to use abstraction?  Good luck writing your spaghettiware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm just redesigning the site, once done, you'll be able to download it ! Its purpose is ease of use and not efficiency (not yet), so I would recommend it for beginners.
