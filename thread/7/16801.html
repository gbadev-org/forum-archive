What are you up to that needs fast floating point and cannot use fixed point?  I coded a pow(x,y) function for my last project that took fixed values so just about anything can be do ne.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

At the moment I am getting to know OpenGL since we use it in our game and think it would be nice if I could share my [personal] 3d engines across both platforms (PC and DKA) without any changes to the data types. I'm sure there are other floating point libraries that offer the best of both worlds, or at least are stronger candidates. Although having said that, they seem to come at a cost - and I'm not <span style="font-style: italic">that</span> concerned, I'm only exploring options now so that I know what to expect in the future.
<br/>
<br/>
I have created a 3d software renderer that allowed both fixed point and floating point (well, at least in the 2d rendering side) so fixed point is cool with me, but after what I've seen I wouldn't rule it out completely before a fair face off.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Makes me wonder how poorly the fixed point stuff was coded or if there were some precision differences.  It's awfully hard to beat a few shifts (especially on ARM) for conversions and management.
<br/>
<br/>
But for dual platform support, I could definately see the usefulness of a decent float lib.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
