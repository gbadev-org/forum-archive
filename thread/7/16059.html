    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm makeing a game using visual HAM
<br/>
this is my first time
<br/>
I'm tring to put a backround on my thing but it never works
<br/>
I do 2 codes(that was what the tutorial said)
<br/>
here they are:
<br/>
#include "Desktop/homebrew/backrounds/thefile(.rlf and .bmp)
<br/>
the .rlf was the first line and the .bmp was the second
<br/>
<br/>
it says that the .rlf files were "null character(s) ignored"
<br/>
and it also said "null character(s) preserved in literal"
<br/>
it said them 34 times.
<br/>
<br/>
can someone plz tell me how to make my backround work
<br/>
and also if you know what the 2 warnings are could u plz tell me, but that part is not that important.
<br/>
<br/>
Thx</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure what tutorial you are using, but you can't include graphical data directly.  You can use something like <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/projects/#usenti" target="_blank">Usenti</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/projects/#grit" target="_blank">Grit</a> to convert it a usable format -- the easiest way is to convert it to C code, and then compile it and link it with your application.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
When you do that, your compiler is opening the image and expecting C++ code in text format.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're trying to program the DS, there's a nice tutorial that explains grit and graphics: <a href="http://patater.com/manual" target="_blank">http://patater.com/manual</a>
<br/>
I would imagine the GBA is very similar.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
