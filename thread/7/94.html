    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here is a little question:
<br/>
<br/>
i know there is a substring command in c/c++ (like in almost every language).
<br/>
<br/>
i need it to split a two digit number like 79 in a 7 and a 9,
<br/>
does someone now the awnser?
<br/>
<br/>
perhaps a little example too make sure i get it?
<br/>
<br/>
thanx

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually the the string functions arent parts of the C/C++ language, they are functions implemented in the standard libraries. So to use these functions on your gba project you must make sure you have the standard libraries compiled for the gba.
<br/>
<br/>
Provided you have the standard libraries you can use <span style="font-weight: bold">strncpy</span> to copy parts of one string to another. Check out <a class="postlink" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vclib/html/_crt_strncpy.2c_.wcsncpy.2c_._mbsncpy.asp" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vclib/html/_crt_strncpy.2c_.wcsncpy.2c_._mbsncpy.asp</a> for more info on the strncpy function and pray to your local god or godess that the function you are using was implemented the same way. This is one way of doing what you want to do in C anyways.

char* pszFour = (char*)calloc(2, sizeof(char));
<br/>
char* pszSeven = (char*)calloc(2, sizeof(char));
<br/>
strncpy(pszFour, &amp;pszNumber[0], 1);
<br/>
strncpy(pszSeven, &amp;pszNumber[1], 1);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
pszFour and pszSeven will now be pointers to two separate zero-terminated strings, pszFour will say "4" and pszSeven will say "7" (of course :)<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi
<br/>
A combination of the divide and modulus operators should do the trick for you.
<br/>
<br/>
int thousands=(number/1000)%10;
<br/>
int hundreds =(number/100)%10;
<br/>
int tens        =(number/10)%10;
<br/>
int units        =(number/1)%10;
<br/>
<br/>
See the pattern developing?
<br/>
<br/>
There are faster methods that don't use a divide - usally using repeated subtraction and a multiply by 10 each time, which I won't go into here.

it seems nice and neat,

i was just looking at a source code

which uses the same trick.

<br/>
but i want to use it for score, so

that method works fine for me.

<br/>
About the substring, i probably need to
<br/>
have a lib or something for my compiler,
<br/>
i use devkitadvance, but i won't use
<br/>
substring for now.

I'd recommend staying away from standard librarys on the gba so you are better of using AnthC's method anways. :) Avoiding stdlib's is probably just me being old-fashioned.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
