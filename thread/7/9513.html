If anyone lives in the Royal Oak or Berkley, MI area, I would ask you to check my code in person.  It would be a lot easier.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Problem with that is, the coding isn't done yet - I need someone who can help as I go (although there is one area where I'm having massive problems - the gameover code).  I suppose one could get the code from SourceForge, if the project is approved, and when I uplaod the files.

<br/>
EDIT: The gamover code works now.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Lini on Tue May 09, 2006 1:45 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Didn't think of that.

I'll post it now, it'll be in the Downloads section. (Please forgive the noob-ness of the code, I'm not extremely familiar with how to write efficient programs)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How is the online portion of an online review relevant?  Do you care if the person helping you is in Japan or China or the UK or Brazil or next door?

Whatever.  It's a little late, my programming instructor is already looking over my code and familiarizing himself with it, so he will probably be able to help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Make a cvs/svn/etc branch and then have your build script check in the modified source every time you compile. Then your remote <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming" target="_blank">pair programming</a> partner can see the changes as you build.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Also, I'm uploading updated code to my site.  After this, I'll mostly be updating the ships, and adding new ones.  I won't be changing my flight/interface code much.  I do have a big interface problem though - the graphics bug out badly when there are more than 6 ships in the collection, not to mention it won't go to flight after that. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
