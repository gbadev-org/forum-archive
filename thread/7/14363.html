    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been trying to make a Gameboy game that using C programming language would ask a question and give 4 choices. 
<br/>
by pressing UP, DOWN, LEFT,and RIGHT, would make your choice.
<br/>
<br/>
If some one could make it in this source code that i have made.

I would usually not ask some one else to do something like this for me but, I'm brand new to C/C++ and want to try and see some more codes so i can learn more about programming.
<br/>
<br/>
Not only  that but i want to make a texted based game for Gameboy.<br/>_________________<br/>God  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.freewebs.com/jrohtmltesting/loveshack.htm" target="_blank">Speed</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This forum is for Game Boy Advance. Few people here know about C programming for Game Boy or Game Boy Color. I can point you to <a class="postlink" href="http://gbdk.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">gbdk</a>, which appears to have been abandoned over six and a half years ago.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you plan to run this on an emulator, or on a flash card? Do you have a GBC flash card?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I don't have a GBC flash card....
<br/>
I though if i started with GB it would be a ok start.
<br/>
This is the only game type i know how to compile effectively.
<br/>
I tried DS. but i have no idea how to compile it.  i always fail and i can't figure out my control panel stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
I think I'll switch to GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the dumb question.<br/>_________________<br/>God  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.freewebs.com/jrohtmltesting/loveshack.htm" target="_blank">Speed</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
