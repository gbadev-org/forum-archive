<br/>
<br/>
for a C Beginner, I recommend "C for Dummies" Vols I and II.
<br/>
<br/>
Depending on your skill level you may want to start with Vol II.   Vol I covers the extreme programming basics: arrays, strings, operators, if-then, loops, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Vol II is more advanced topics explained in depth and easily understandable.  advanced strings &amp; arrays, a good chapter on pointers, structures, modularization, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
The author explains it so any dummy can understand it.  I think it's why they named it that.
<br/>
<br/>
I already knew C, but I found them both at a book outlet store (in an outlet mall), so I thought I'd pick them up for reference.  I learned a few little tricks I didn't already know.  Amazon probably has them cheap too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't recommend any really good C/C++ books - initially I learned from the error messages in the borland turbo C++ compiler.  I do not recommend this as a good way to learn a language - it takes forever, and you may still not understand why certain things do or do not work.
<br/>
<br/>
I vote for learning C before C++.  I believe that it is simpler, easier to understand, and it is a good precursor to learning C++.  In fact, I think that a good way to go (for someone with significant time) might be to learn a better Object Oriented language like Java, so you get used to OOP, then learn C to get used to the syntax, then C++.  Also, I strongly reccomend practicing a little C code in windows before you get too heavily into the GBA.  Having a convenient debugger that's built right in to your IDE can make a big difference.  Turbo C can actually be had for free here:
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I realise that you want to do GBA coding, so advice to the contrary is unlikely to sink in.  As such, let me just say that IMO the following is the perfect first gba program.  It will serve you well:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
/**************************************/
<br/>
static dprint_asm(char *s) 
<br/>
{ 
<br/>
   asm volatile( 
<br/>
      "mov r0, %0;" 
<br/>
       "swi 0xff;" 
<br/>
      : 
<br/>
      : "r" (s) 
<br/>
      : "r0"); 
<br/>
} 
<br/>
<br/>
int main(void){
<br/>
   dprint_asm("Hello World");
<br/>
   while(1){}
<br/>
}
<br/>
/*****************************************/
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The dprint_asm function is one of the most important learning tools you will ever come across when learning to code for the GBA - it is the simplest, easiest way to spit out debug info.  Don't worry about understanding it yet.  Just know that it spits text into the debug window in your emulator.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that's just my opinion.  I already did my CS degree before getting into the GBA, so take it with a grain of salt. . .

I would have to disagree with the people that say that.
<br/>
<br/>
I used to do some Computer Science tutoring at college, for the intro to programming class. We had two professors teaching it: one started the students straight into classes/objects/etc. from almost day one, but the other started procedurally and built up to classes.
<br/>
<br/>
I had to help numerous students from the first professor's class throughout the semester.  Many of them were having major problems understanding and completing the assignments. I noticed fairly quickly that the vast majority of their problems stemmed entirely from a complete lack of understanding of basic flow of execution, functions, parameters, conditionals, etc.  A few of them were so lost I ended up having to refer them back to the instructor, otherwise I would have had to completely duplicate that professor's efforts and come up with a complete lessen plan of my own.
<br/>
<br/>
The other class by contrast (the one that started with procedural concepts and built up to classes/objects) had hardly any students coming in for help.  The few that did come in were only in for minor help, often just for double-checking, or for quick two-minute problems that I was usually able to coax them into answer correctly for themselves.  Not once did I ever see one of them have any problems understanding object-oriented concepts.
<br/>
<br/>
I would agree with the C++ book authors that switching to an OO style of thinking can be difficult after becoming deeply entrenched in procedural-style over years of experience. But it's been my experience that OO-concepts are things that *must* be built on top of the procedural basics.  After all, how can you understand a member function if you don't understand a function?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's cool, it's just not everyone's the same. I never really had a problem learning C++ first off but maybe that's just me. I'm just throwing in my own recommendation. Either may be better for ThUg4LiFe; it's up to him to decide which he prefers. :)
<br/>
<br/>
I agree it may be harder than starting off with learning C but not by very much. If you think you can handle it, go for C++. If you have no previous programming experience at all, maybe C is a better option for you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm going to have to chime in and say go with C first.  If you're just a beginner and want to get stuff working right away, you probably don't want to confuse yourself with such things as polymorphism or OO methods.  
<br/>
<br/>
For me, I learned C first and later read up on C++ but since I was beginner, I didn't see immediate need for the advance concepts that C++ provides.  It was just more stuff to process in my head when learning the language.  Later, I worked on larger apps and realized I needed to group code and data together somehow and found OO concepts really helped in that regard.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you may differ, but I think if you want to get into coding right away and don't care about "correctness" in coding and best practices, go for C.  In my opinion, do what's fun when you're first learning, 'cause that'll keep you going.  (Not that C does not allow you to code correctly.  It does, but it's true that OO is natural and easier to use for certain applications, like GUIs.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#28434 - Fatnickc - Sun Oct 31, 2004 9:49 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I Learnt C first, for two (well, 3) reasons:
<br/>
  I read into GBA development alot and found (at least thought) that most people used C, and the many tutorials out there seemed to be in C, so I thought that it was the only way to go.
<br/>
  I bought a book on C++ very early on, and by reading the 1st (and what i thought was the only) page of the introduction, and it seemed perfect. Then, when I took it home and opened it, it said that this book was 'to step up from C to C++ and Object Ori......' So, I had to learn C first to use that book; and I was going to use that book, I was 12 and it cost ?10.. that was 4/9 (or so..) of my monthly money, and i wrecked a few bags in the time getting it home.
<br/>
  The third bad reason, is that I couldn't find very good (or new..) C++ books in my library, so I got two C books out, one of which I found awful, the other of which was old, but Ansi, and easy to read, by an English author (not that American authors aren't as good or anything, just it used a lot of real life scenarios about a boy at universitie (college) and him going out etc. to work out how to build the pseudocode and put it into steps etc. and I didn't really want too many American anecodotes or something I wouldn't realize) and No one else wanted it for three months, so I could renew it three times (maximum) and then take it back,having finished it. I take long times because of long school, huge homeworks and tiredness on Saturdays and Sundays when I program.
<br/>
<br/>
But, I agree with both the sides, because from C you can step up, but won't neccesarily have the correct programming style, so who knows, just go with your personal preference, borrow a few books from a library.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
i feel i already have a good grasp of how the lanugage works.. all the things talked of in the C tutorial in the beginners FAQ. also,  the OVERALL structure is similar to Basic IMO but the individual codes/functions and their individual structures are obviously completely different
<br/>
<br/>
i learnt all the forms of Basic i know from self-teaching, trial and error, and using the list of functions and observing the error messages - in the case of VisualBasic. Basic was a lot easier as the structure is very, well, Basic and almost looks like normal english language IMO! i dont think it would be good to learn C like this though either - due to the complexity
<br/>
<br/>
all the things talked about in the C tutorial in the beginners FAQ i didnt really have too much trouble understanding. its all the AVAILABLE functiona and codes i am now interested in using so i want a nice thorough, descriptive, book which features hopefully a list of all commands available and descriptions on how to use them
<br/>
<br/>
ive read though all the posts here and im sure everyone has their reasons for their opinion - but i am going to start with C; and learn C++ in there is a need to
<br/>

i assume that using C++ would be benifical as in easier to program than C ONCE you understand it - and would also make shorter simpler codes than C to perform troublesome C tasks? am i right? thus allowing more to fit on a GBA cart</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In fact, some have complained that C++ makes their executables larger, but that's usually due to careless use of features that involve automatic code generation.  It can also be larger if you statically link in the C++ standard library, which is larger than that of C.

Yeah, that's total flamebait, dude.  You definitely do not need all the features of C++ for many applications.  I'm sure you can find ways of shoehorning your app to make it use C++ features, but there are always methods of getting by without it.  Whether or not it's because C is limited is a matter of opinion.

The idea is difficult to express without it sounding bad, but it is not bad.  In retrospect, the mistake in my previous post is very subtle: I said "...it's still nice..." which is an absolute statement, but it should be conditionalized on whether the programmer feels limited by C.
<br/>
<br/>
The mistake is apparent when you imagine a programmer who is good enough to potentially feel restricted by C and yet does not find it nice to have C++ features (e.g. possibly Dan), and compare to the programmer who is also good enough to feel restricted by C and <span style="font-style: italic">does</span> find C++ features nice (e.g. possibly me if I'm even that good).

It doesn't turn it into bad code. It's still good C code, just bad C++ code.

It would compile successfully as Objective C code as well, but I wouldn't necessarily call it good Objective C code either.

The choice of language is not reflected in the code if you can't tell it apart from regular C code. If you present me with C++ code that I cannot distinguish from C code and tell me that it was written in C++ rather than C, then according to my views either the language was poorly selected or the code was poorly written.

I'm not sure what you're trying to get me to say here. I'll put it to you very simply: if you write a program in C++ that doesn't use any of the language features that C++ offers versus C, then it's probably a better C program than it is a C++ program.

No better or worse off than if it had been coded in assembly or Fortran or Haskell (suitable compiler permitting). I never said it would be.
<br/>
<br/>
But don't bring me a reasonably complex program written in C++ code completely devoid of any classes, namespaces, private/protected members, virtual functions, typed constants etc. but all of the C equivalents to those (where applicable) and tell me it's good C++ code.

But let's say it did.  Or better yet, let's say it's a C program that doesn't use any structs, because that is an example of choosing to use only a subset of your available features, which is what I would be doing if I wrote a C++ program that only used features available in C.

I don't know what you're going on about. You seem to want to debate over philosophies of why coders should do things certain ways, when all I've been saying is that a C++ program that uses strictly C conventions rather than C++ features to accomplish the same thing is a better C program than it is a C++ program. Nowhere in there is there a statement valuing the overall or absolute measure of the program.

Sure it does. A good C program is not the same thing as a good C++ program is not the same thing as a good assembler program is not the same thing as a good Objective C program etc. That's all there is to it.
<br/>
<br/>
I have nothing further to add either. The only point I was ever interested in making is that the features in C++ can be inherently restrictive to the way you program. There is no value to me in wasting pages trying to prove something that should be as trivial as saying that the standards and expectations for what high-quality code looks like is different for different languages.

"Assuming compiler availability" is a big one. Did you mean to say that the only "reasonably complex" C code is a C++ compiler written in C because it helps bootstrap a C++ environment from a C environment?

Well, if you're strictly talking about correctness as a C program alone and as a portable C program, you don't want to start allowing extra C++ features by using a C++ compiler.  It's going to allow C++ extensions to be valid, even though you are trying to program in C only.  A C compiler will disallow any C++ extensions right off the bat.  You could argue that if you start using C++ in a strict C program, it's your fault, but if you can get a machine to force you to do the right thing and it'll reduce the likelihood of human error, then all the better.
<br/>
<br/>
Why would you program in C only?  Well, maybe you want strict portability with another platform that has no or poor C++ support, but does have good C support.  Whatever reason, by using a C++ compiler, you're now allowing C++ extensions to be compiled without warnings.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think I understand what you're saying, but allow me to clarify.  Are you saying that the additional features of C++ often (not always) leads a programmer to use features of the language that they may not necessarily need simply because they're there and maybe be easier to use?  They may be easier to use initially, but their complexity may make maintenance a bit more difficult.  If this is what you're saying, I think I agree with you.
<br/>
<br/>
With C++, it's easy to start looking at everything as objects and creating classes for everything.  The downside to this is it often leads to the unnecessary creation of frameworks.  I've fallen into that trap a few times before.  
<br/>
<br/>
The problem you're solving may be a simple one, but once you start creating classes for everything, there is further complexity in all the additional infrastructure that you have to build around it to support the methodology *correctly*.  For instance, if you have a private member variable that you want other objects to modify or read, but don't want to allow direct access to the variable, you have to create methods to manipulate it in a "protected" way.  You might cheat and just make the variable a public one, but in a way, you're not correctly adhering to proper OO techniques.  For large systems, this methodology may be a godsend as it allows better modular programming and it makes working in teams easier as you can well-define the framework and forget about internal details.  But for small systems, it complicates things that could be easily done using a procedural language.
<br/>
<br/>
Again, the above is not always the case.  Your mileage may vary, etc. etc.

Apparently, you still are.
<br/>
<br/>
You maintain that by the technicality that most any C program can be compiled in the C++ compiler, that programming in C++ doesn't affect how a program is written, and a person programming in C++ can choose to eschew all of its features and write a vanilla-C program and still have it considered to be good C++ code, so long as it's good C code as well. I think that's bogus.

That's bogus. Show me a rectangle with 4 equal length sides and I'll tell you it's a square. When in fact, it is both. (<span style="font-style: italic">Perhaps that's a far-reaching analogy, but I was hard pressed to come up with something while sick</span>). 
<br/>
<br/>
Do you consider using C++ to be just the language definition? Well, since that includes C, anyone programming in C can claim they are programming in C++.  Or perhaps you only consider programming C++ to be actually using the C++ extensions (classes, templates, overloaded functions, etc). If your definition is the last, then your above challenge is impossible. Too bad your definition would be wrong (if that is in-fact your definition).
<br/>
<br/>
As for "an open-source program on the net of reasonable size that ... doesn't use classes anywhere", there are plenty. Lua was the first to come to mind. But I'm sure you'll argue that it is written in just plain C. And I'll quickly rebutt that as long as I compile it into my C++ game it must be C++, too.

This is a rather pointless debate, though. But I'm sick and just surfing the web today, and felt like typing something before going back to bed :)

I'm not arguing that C++ isn't a superset of C.
<br/>
<br/>
You can make the technical argument that anyone programming in C is also programming in C++, and it is logically defensible. They're also programming in Objective C and C99 for that matter, and god-knows-what-other supersets you can conceive of. Sure, you can make the case for it, but then it's no longer meaningful to say that they're programming in any of those languages.
<br/>

Am I really the only one that sees this? To use your analogy, would you fault someone for preferring not to use the less descriptive name "rectangle" if they can use the more specific name "square"?

Well, I don't think the IDE is really going to help you if you're just learning.  It's definitely useful for debugging if it allows you to step through code and watch variables and such, but it's not going to teach you good programming practices.

<br/>
The best thing for you to do is go through some tutorials and try writing some simple test programs to get a feel for the language.

You do not need any IDE to learn how to program.  Just write some code and build it at the command line.  If you're a beginner, you're gonna be futzing around with the IDE more than trying to understand the code.
<br/>
<br/>
The IDE is an Integrated Development Environment.  It's a nice tool to edit your files, but you don't need it.  I wrote Project Hazuki using Emacs for text editing and a unix shell to build.  That's it.  I didn't even use a debugger.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, it's not. You're just choosing the strictest and least meaningful interpretation possible of the theorem to try and disprove. Obviously if I'm using a qualitative term like "good" and a measurement term like "consider" it can't have any significance in absolute terms. This is not boolean algebra and I am not trying to be PVS. Try proving me wrong in the real world, instead of nitpicking the semantics of it.

If you're looking strictly at C and C++, then perhaps a better analogy would be a single screwdriver and a drill with interchangeable bits. You can use the drill to do the work of the screwdriver, but the drill imposes selection of which type of screw-head to use, and may also expect you to do things you wouldn't be expected to do with the screwdriver, like drill pilot holes and stay close to a power source.

<br/>
Yes, your description is more accurate than mine, and it actually reveals to me a more fundamental difference of interpretation: rectangles are a superset of squares, but we define squares in terms of being constrained versions of rectangles. C++ is a superset of C, but do you choose to define a C program as a constrained C++ program (in which case the analogy works), or a C++ program as an extended C program (in which case the analogy is flawed)?
<br/>
<br/>
I find it more prudent to go with the second, because there is a temporal relationship (C came first, and the developments of languages (programming and otherwise) are traced through their ancestors), and because we also currently define other languages as extensions of the C language.
<br/>
<br/>
The former position - the one I think you have been pushing in this thread - is a technically correct one but doesn't carry the informational weight that the first one does. Yes, all C programs are technically C++ programs, but it is not very practical to try and define a language in terms of what's <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> there.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Eh.  You can probably live without the IDE.  In my opinion, it made life a lot easier when I was getting started.  I just like being able to trace through my code when I'm getting unanticipated results.  There are, of course other ways to approach things.  You can set up debugging without an IDE (not recommended for beginners, in my opinion), or you can use print statements to trace your code.  I just found that when learning - and this is not an issue that is particularily related to any one language - my programs frequently did not run as anticipated.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as you've probably noticed, there are strong partisans on both sides of the C/C++ issue; sooner or later, you'll probably learn both.  I think you already said you're going for C, and that's cool.  I would say that at this point, you should ignore the discussion for a while and just try out any compiler that takes your fancy. Check out some existing source code, modify it, see how it works, etc.   Post again if it doesn't work out.

Well, C is just a language. It doesn't define things such as graphics or sound.  Those are platform-dependent and often come in the form libraries, which contain pre-defined function calls.  Even basic things like drawing a line are not part of the C standard.  I believe all programming languages are like this.

You're probably referring to the C standard library.  There are books on just the standard library.  Those provide you with the most common functions you'll need to build up your app, such as math functions (sin, cos, etc.) or streaming input and output.  The header files differ with each compiler, but you should be able to read up on your compiler docs to find out where the header files are.

I never said it was a theorem. I simply said that clinging to the technicality that C programs can be compiled as C++ programs doesn't make good C code equal to good C++ code.
<br/>
<br/>
Saying "I invite you to prove me wrong" with the relevant challenge in the same paragraph was an attempt to get you to look at in from a practical, real-world perspective, but you just reversed it right back into a matter of absurdly boolean logic.
<br/>
<br/>
I still have yet to hear you answer me on whether a well-written C program that uses things like long function-name prefixes instead of methods and namespaces, auxillary structs with enums and  function-pointers to keep track of types instead of templates, and function-pointer tables instead of virtual vunctions ought to be considered a well-written C++ program.

Fine. I'll even give you that the screwdriver is gonna probably be a heck of a lot slower and require more energy than the drill to do the same amount of work. None of that matters. The point is the same one I made earlier: it's still a different tool, and it still will cause you to approach your project from a different perspective.

Fine, I can agree with that. The perspective is still important when evaluating the analogy, though, because when we compare rectangles and squares we tend to consider the square to be a more constrained version of a rectangle rather than thinking of the rectangle as a relaxed version of the square, whereas when comparing C++ to C it's this second interpretation that is more meaningful.

This is also where it's useful to distinguish between a tutorial, guide, etc. and a reference. A reference ought to cover all of the features but usually won't present them in an order that's useful if you don't already know what you're looking for, whereas a tutorial or guide may leave some out in order to facilitate an environment you can learn more effectively from.

Spare me; I'm not interested in quibbling over meta-semantics. You say a good C program should also be considered a good C++ program. The challenge was very simply to find a practical example where the creator also does, by finding a program that doesn't use any of the C++ features where the creator still chooses to call it a C++ program. I don't think one exists. Any that do are most likely the extreme exception. (But I'll still send you the dollar.)

Would I be correct in assuming that by "good" you at least mean "meets requirements"? Because you stated earlier that you considered requirements to include readability, maintainability, verifiability and infrastructure.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you really consider a C++ program that uses those C techniques instead of the C++ features to be sufficiently readable and maintainable for you to call it well-written?
<br/>
<br/>
If you had an underling program a C++ module for your project where he did this, would you be okay with it on account of it performing correctly? Would you not at all question if he even knew how to program in C++?

What if he used gotos instead of while loops?

I'm certainly not free of the effects of my tools. That's why I try to choose the appropriate tool for the project, and choose the appropriate language for the program. Perhaps the difference between you and me is that I'm at least aware of the influence the tools have on the code I write.

I merely wanted to point out that a language definition does not usually include a description of how to do basic things like draw pixels or play sound.

I suppose PostScript and Flash do include these, but they're obviously more geared towards displaying graphics and text and are not general-purpose languages.  Sorry if that was not clear.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Both arguments have valid points, but to say a C++ program must make use of C++ features otherwise it is C is no different from saying, (I believe) that a C++ program is Java if it uses classes and not structs, and no goto's; which is more in scope of the argument than comparing it with using direct memory references instead of variable names.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

By that, the code is piss-poor C++.  That's why I asked earlier if it was about expectations.  It makes a world of difference if you evaluate code based on what other people like.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Oh, it turns out I was reading too fast.  My real answer is: Given perfect programmers (don't jump just yet), I wouldn't provide a model at all.  They would be able to determine the best features of the language to apply to every problem.
<br/>
<br/>
What about imperfect programmers?  It depends on how imperfect they are, I suppose.  Really sucky programmers might need a lot of hand-holding and outlawing of "troublesome" features (pointer math, templates, globals, whatever) to get them to write reasonably un-sucky code.  Slightly better ones might just need some "best practice" kinds of guidelines (like OO), where they can apply them without thinking and get decent results (though it may be overkill or otherwise suboptimal).
<br/>
<br/>
And so on.  Note that no model will describe the work of the perfect programmer, because he is free.  Models are imperfect by definition.
<br/>
<br/>
So, "well-written" by this definition can imply many levels of actual quality.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit again: I'd better clearly answer the original question.  I guess I might provide a model consisting mostly of C features if I had a team of expert C programmers who would explode if they had to use C++ features.  It's a bit hard to imagine, but then again I've never had my own team of programmers.

Basically, your idea of "using C++" is loaded with the expectations of others, and I can only try to go back to which language(s) you're actually writing in.  We could have stopped long ago by saying it's all about expectations, but it took a long time to arrive at that and even then you say there's more to it.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess we could resolve it by saying that "writing C++" is not the same as "using C++".  That's a subtle distinction, and you could probably forgive me for not noticing it 6 pages ago.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, "using C++" (in the sense of absolutely requiring that C++-only features are used) is restrictive, because you literally lose some options.  Specifically, all C programs are outlawed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, but I consider those two (that I hilighted) to be essentially synonymous because when I'm not applying the C++ features I don't consider myself to be programming in C++ any more than I consider myself to be programming in Objective C, although both are technically true.

I'm not sure if it's just a matter of "expectations of others" or not. This is why I bring up the goto example in C. I make the claim that in the language C++, using &lt;insert any example I've used previously&gt; when you could use &lt;insert complementary C++ feature&gt; is what I would consider to be poor coding.
<br/>
<br/>
You seem to say that it only matters if others expect a certain style of C++ coding from you, but then by same token I say if that's true, then it should also hold that using gotos instead of while loops in plain C (or C++ for that matter) isn't poor coding because they are functionally equivalent. While loops are meant to automate and supplant the use of gotos the same way classes are meant to automate and supplant what you get when you combine a number of various C features.

Yes, "using C++" (in the sense of absolutely requiring that C++-only features are used) is restrictive, because you literally lose some options.  Specifically, all C programs are outlawed.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

It's fine if you want to put it that way, but that has less to do with my <span style="font-style: italic">original</span> point about the restrictive nature of C++, which is that when you use the OO features (which most people do by default when programming C++) in shoehorns you into a certain style of both thinking and coding.

Yes, coding in C++ doesn't exhaustively imply you have to use those features... it's just what most everyone <span style="font-style: italic">does</span>.

Never said you had. But your original argument is that if you can't distinguish  a C++ code from C code then it is bad C++ code and should not be called C++ code. If that statement is correct then code must contain elements of C++, which are not in C to be considered C++. If so then code must be OO based, or using other features that C can not.
<br/>
<br/>
Also if you agree with the first question, then at least the idea behind the second question must be in some part true. As those features (amongst others) distinguish C from C++.

A lot of what Dan's saying about loops/goto's make complete sense, and we can all agree with/understand those opinions. But with them being used as arguments, this discussion is running slower than  wheelchairs over gravel.

<br/>
There's no need to take hostility to anybody who does not completely agree with what you are saying. And where someone says they agree with some of your premises but not your idea of its implications; maybe your implication is a little flawed or needs a different approach to make sense. I.E. Bible is ancient (agreed), has many proven facts near impossible to have been known at that time (agreed) therefore God Exists (not agreed).

No, my original argument was that programming in C++ tends to make you think and program in a certain way that coding in plain C does not.

FWIW, this is close to something I would be in agreement with but not quite. I would not say that plain C code cannot be considered C++ code, but that less information is gained by labelling it as C++ code than if it's labelled C code. For that reason, I find C to be a much more meaningful label for it.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Edit:</span> I believe this common-sense approach is in agreement with the rest of the world, since people <span style="font-style: italic">don't</span> label their programs as C++ programs if they only use C features in it, the same way they don't label them as Objective C programs, etc.

They are apples and apples. The language provides a feature to streamline the process of a simpler or more archaic language feature.
<br/>
<br/>
Even what I said about modes of thinking is true in the comparison. Using while loops instead of gotos causes you to think differently when designing. I remember when I was a kid programming in oldschool line-number BASIC that didn't have a "while" construct. I approached the concepts of branching and looping from a different mindset I typically do when coding in C today. I'm not saying it's better or worse, but I believe I'm a better and more versatile programmer for my awareness of the difference.

By definition it's a C program, but does that make it bad C++. Wouldn't it be worse C++ code be if we forced its features when not needed? This is why I remove C from the picture when thinking of it.

I also do not agree that the newer C++ features will definately make everything easier. It's an alternative that has many benefits, but has its weaknesses too. In fact in a recent project, the problem was because it had to be created completely in OO using Java. Had we taken the procedral approach we could have had it done in 5 minutes FLAT !!!

EDIT: Then again C++ (I believe) was not designed to be as OO oriented as Java is. So its expected style (which Java does have) is not OO, or Structured/Procedral, but instead a possibly of any combination of the two providing it works and is a good solution.

How many angels can fit on the head of a pin? I think you already realize that this line of questioning isn't very productive. C++ doesn't exist in a bubble; it evolved out of a language currently still in heavy use, and what's more was conceived under the premise of being an extended feature set to the original C. There may exist C code that works as B code, but it isn't practical to consider it B code because no one uses B, no one would ever think to call it B code, and there aren't other B offshoots that it could also be mistaken as.

Um, I said it was a world of difference between using C++ and having it in a selection of tools. Then I said that I find programming in C++ and applying C++ features that aren't available in C to be essentially synonymous.

While loops can be simulated with ifs and gotos the same way C++ features can be simulated with C features. The only reason I keep returning to this point is to show that just because two styles of coding are  functionally equivalent doesn't mean they both amount to well-written code.

That's not what I said. I said: "the extensions to C that were implemented for C++ were designed to make it much easier (and therefore desireable) to do certain things, which has a consequence of making it less easy (and therefore less desireable) to do other things that previously required a comparable level of effort".
<br/>
<br/>
This is talking about choosing between two alternatives in either language, not choosing between doing it in one language or the other.
<br/>
<br/>
An example would be: a function table used within a struct (a C implementation of virtual functions) is about as much effort to code as, say, a dispatch function that examines a field within the struct and chooses which function to call based on it, which would essentially accomplish the same thing.
<br/>
<br/>
In C++, however, it's much easier and cleaner to create virtual functions than it is to set up a custom struct and dispatch routine. So the language favours one technique over another.

No. I've been saying that it favours the path of OO. Whether it's done brainlessly or not is up to the programmer.

If your language makes you do things, then you are further from that ideal.  You'll be PUI (programming under the influence) and your judgement will be impaired by a percieved inherent methodology.  That's bad!  There will inevitably be cases where you choose the wrong thing due to the influence.

These are the words of a technological determinist. I imagine you generally view tools as being perfectly neutral, and their users as the only factor that determines how they are employed. (I'm not sure, but I think you may have even said something to that effect in this thread.) You certainly are not alone in this philosophy, but it is not one that I ascribe to. I am more of a social constructivist, and do not readily believe in the separation of a technology and its application. The differences between and reasonings behind these philosophies is something far more complicated than I imagine either of us feels like getting into at the moment, so I'm prepared to agree to disagree on this matter if you are.

You can exercise good judgement in the selection of the tool you use. You <span style="font-style: italic">can't</span> prevent the tool you use from affecting your technique. Again, it's probably not worth getting into... see above.

I'm sure people really are affected by their tools.  One should strive to escape that, in order to work towards perfection.
<br/>
<br/>
I must be doing ok in that regard, because my coding style is quite different than any of my coworkers, and that of the C community at large.  The fact that I am using C doesn't prevent me from applying the techniques I've picked up from C++, Lisp, Lua, and Haskell literature, insofar as C will allow me to do so.

Never thought I'd be posting something meaningful in a C vs. C++ flamewar, but C99 still has a few incompatibilities vs. C++98 that may either make things harder to express in C++98 or affect interoperability: <ul><li>C99 has arithmetic on 64-bit integers.

C++ makes this a bit ambiguous. </li><li>Complex numbers are a template class in C++98 but a builtin in C99.

And how the heck do you expect the compiler to optimize that? Processors have carry flags used for adding multiword integers (such as a 64-bit type on a 32-bit CPU), but C gives you no access to the carry flag. And how do you expect it to infer use of ARM7's 'smull' or 'umull' instructions?

The only variable-length arrays in C++ are vector and new[], both of which go to the heap. C++ doesn't have auto types of variable size.
