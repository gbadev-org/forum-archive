    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Floating-point arithmetic is like scientific notation. It represents numbers as a given "mantissa" of a given precision times a given power of two. Thus, it can represent both very small numbers and very large numbers. Programs in the C language use the 'float' and 'double' data types to hold floating-point numbers.
<br/>
<br/>
However, doing floating-point arithmetic on a machine not specifically designed to handle it is very slow. The 486DX and more powerful x86 processors have it; older x86 CPUs and the GBA's ARM7TDMI don't and must perform the operations in software. On machines without dedicated floating-point support, fixed-point arithmetic is much faster than floating-point arithmetic.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A Float can represent very large numbers, as well as very small numbers, like:
<br/>
<br/>
0.0000000000001234

<br/>
or
<br/>
<br/>
123400000000000000.0
<br/>
<br/>
Usually, floats come in handy when you are working with non-linear values of some kind. Exponential stuff... Audio processing is one example where floats are very useful. 3D graphics is another.
<br/>
<br/>
However, you must understand that while floats are accurate, float math is not as exact as integer math. The same code can generate slightly different results on different CPU's because of different rounding techniques. When you assign a constant to a float, that constant will be rounded (by the compiler) to the closest float value. For example:
<br/>
<br/>
float a = 0.7;  //The value actually stored in 'a' will be something very close to 0.7, like 0.699942 or 0.700261
<br/>
<br/>
You should *never* use the "equal to" comparison when working with floats.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As tepples pointed out, though, this is all academic anyway since floats are much too slow for most GBA applications anyway. Fixed-point arithmetic only lets you work in relatively close proximity to the decimal point, but this should be more than sufficient for most GBA applications.

Usually if comparison of equality is necessary one should define a tolerance value as some small number, and then check to see whether the absolute value of the difference between the two is smaller than that tolerance value. This only matters if you've been applying mathematical operations to the number, though; the test (0.7 == 0.7) will still return true, even though it's not being represented exactly as 0.7 internally.
