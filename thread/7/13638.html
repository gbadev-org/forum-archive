    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I am a C n00b. I would like to ask something, well last time I was here I mainly used windows XP and vista while I was learning C++ as all the tutorials out there (or the ones I could find) were for windows. 
<br/>
<br/>
Well I slaked off last time but this time I hope I will be able to learn it without slacking off. I noticed while looking at a couple of DS and PSP home brew tutorials that the preferred dev environment appears to be Linux.  This is good for me atm because I have only been using Linux lately (I can't work out how to repair my windows partition). 
<br/>
<br/>
My question is do you guys think I should start learning C or C++ again today on linux? or wait until I get back onto windows and then move to Linux when it comes to homebrew?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are first learning C or C++, I would avoid any handheld or console development, and stick with simpler stuff first.  
<br/>
<br/>
So that being said, linux would be a fine platform to start with.  There will be some differences (not having visual studio do everything for you, for example), but it'll definitely be worth learning the command-line ways of doing things.  Go for it!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For homebrew you generally need to get your hands somewhat dirty with make and gcc, so there's no big real advantage to wait for your windows-setup to become well. All you need is your favorite text-editor (I see an IDE has already been suggested, but I think the text-editors are in general much more mature and useful than the IDEs on unix-systems), a shell and a target-compiler.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
