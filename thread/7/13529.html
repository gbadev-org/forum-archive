    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a way to make your own header (.h) or .c files other than main.c?  Is there a way to take a bunch of functions, such as those needed for a side scrolling game, and move them to another file so that the main.c will be easier to edit other things in?  I tried copying all my menu functions to a file, renaming it menus.h, then putting #include "menus.h" in my file, but it had errors with &lt;something&gt; isn't defined or something.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, "main.c" is just to indicate to other programmers that the main function is there. You can rename "main.c" to whatever you want, or put the main function anywhere else.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think I got it working...I had two functions:
<br/>
<br/>
displaySplash() and displayMainMenu() that I wanted to get out of main.c.
<br/>
<br/>
I moved them to a file called menus.h then put
<br/>
<br/>
#include "menus.h"
<br/>
<br/>
void displaySplash();
<br/>
void displayMainMenu();
<br/>
<br/>
and it said something about a data file, so I put the includes for my .gif images in the header as well as main and it compiled.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In general, do not put code in a .h file. Instead, put it in another .c file, keep only the function's prototype in the .h file, compile this .c file to a .o file, and link this .o file into your .elf file.
