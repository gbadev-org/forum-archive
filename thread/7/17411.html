    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to have one TSR start FIRST and one start dead LAST to complete a hacker proof program.
<br/>
Once complete it's going to be sold. but anyone here that ask's can have a personal free copy.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me how I would accomplish this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
This would be in TC++ 3.0.
<br/>
<br/>
Other than DOS I don't see a TSR being possible to make, but it need's to continue running under window's.
<br/>
<br/>
I have to swap computer's to check but I'm pretty sure that the few I made before did.
<br/>
Sorry re-learning how I rode my bike right now, been awhile so it's like look, grasp, and move on.
<br/>
But I don't expect you to do that for me.
<br/>
<br/>
I just have a really dam good idea and I don't wanna lose it in multiple disk's before I get it going but it need's that to be worth it at all.
<br/>
<br/>
I know it goes last in first out or first in last out but it's reverse, at least
<br/>
from what i've read...but I have no idea how to make it set it's position at all...yet.
<br/>
<br/>
I made a bios copy attempt and got the wrong position (thank god for floppie's back then lol).
<br/>
So I would rather take a few opinion's before I act...no more floppy unless I pull out an older comp. At least now I have a bios backup. But it won't help if I can't install it lol.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry it took awhile for a response but it ended up in my spam cause they suck lol.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW I love your quote Dw.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
