    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I got bit by this issue, searching the forums i found your faq that talks about this.
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Also, make sure that both your map data, your tile data, and your palette data are aligned to a 4-byte boundary within your binary. If you use assembly language, put .balign 4 on a line before the data; in C do this (recommended only for smaller arrays such as palette data): 
<br/>
__attribute__((aligned(4))) const char foo[8192] = { /*...*/ }; 
<br/>
Aligns the start of the array to a 4-byte boundary. 
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

 My problem is i had const strings in my file and based on the string length it would screw up my sprites and background. 
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">doSomething("text");</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
 After I realized what the problem was, I could fix it by simply declaring the string as a
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">const char text[] = "text";</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
and everything worked.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
sorry i just realized what I was doing, i was missing a "__attribute__((aligned(4))) " for my sprite data declaration, I had them on my tile data but missed it for my sprite.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
