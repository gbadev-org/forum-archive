    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi.  I'm relatively new, and am using the GBA lower level applications ( specifically servo moter control ).  I would like to run a multithreaded application, but I do not know where to begin.  Are there any 'thread' classes I can make use of?  I am using XPort which comes with GCC and G++ for ARM7.  I'd also appreciate all help I can get on timers.  I don't know anything about how to work with them.

I appreciate the fact that these boards aren't the place for such long discussions, so if you could, please email me at <a href="mailto:djc6535@rit.edu">djc6535@rit.edu</a>.   Thanks!<br/>_________________<br/>Dave</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
somebody will come and help you out.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason why it's taking so lang, is probably because
<br/>
not many people here use the xport but assembly or c/c++ compiler
<br/>
to create games in bin-form.
<br/>
But maybe somebody has already emailed you,
<br/>
isn't there a board on the xport site, which might give better help?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought my subject was "Timers and Threads"  I apologize if that seemed like a hopeless cry for help.  No there is no forum on the XPort site.  There IS a link to this site though.  
<br/>
<br/>
Please let me clarify... if the part about email seemed like a "Hopeless cry for help" I just meant that this promises to be a fairly drawn out conversation, which doesn't always work on message boards.  However if you do not want to email, feel free to post here.
<br/>
<br/>
The question is not strictly about the XPort however. It's more about G++.  Specifically, how do I go about making a multithreaded program?  Is there a thread library, and if so how do I use it?
