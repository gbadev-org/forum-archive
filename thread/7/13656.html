    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I rate myself as Intermediate in C++. Anything I am unsure about I will refer to in the books, but I am aware of what is not currently my intuition. Long story short I want to be prepared for the possibility of 45 minute test (most likely consisting of c++ questions) and need to be able to pass with flying colours.
<br/>
<br/>
First of I think that the content of the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.sourcepole.ch/sources/programming/cpp/cppqref.html" target="_blank">c++ quick reference</a> must be hard-wired in my head. I probably have more than 96 hours, but supposing I did how should I plan my preparation for this?
<br/>
<br/>
Recall is not an issue, I have memorized pages of notes for exam preparation, I mainly want to be well prepared.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I second this.  Read the full FAQ if you are feeling crazy.  Remember, sleep does wonders for test and such.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can you show what you're talking about in another OO language? When I went for junior programmer I took a C++ test, but I'm not very good at that - I can do C just fine, and got taught Java at uni. So they let me explain all the concepts via Java instead...and I got the job, despite it being a C++-only job.
<br/>
<br/>
If you can do it better in another language it doesn't hurt to ask, as it shows that you're not a one-trick-pony and you can apply the skills you've learnt in one thing to problems in another.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well they did tell me that they don't use Java, only C++, asking whether I were ok with this. When it comes to Java there isn't much to know in the sense that the language is much simpler. I was much more comfortable with C/Assembler for a long time, but peer pressure kicked in and I stopped using it and slowly began to prototype and test everything using Java.
<br/>
<br/>
But my case is the same as yours, we mostly did Java at uni and only used C/C++ for operating systems, high performance computing and image processing.
<br/>
<br/>
And as for the FAQ, it's quality. Wish I had come across it earlier!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Many of the OO concepts that I learnt in Java were pretty valid in C++, it's just that I didn't know the names of them. For instance - I've never used virtual before, but I somehow got away with telling them all about the same concepts in Java instead!
<br/>
<br/>
I've only used Java once since I've worked here, as it's a C++ company. I still can't do C++ either, but that's cool cos I sort of do my own thing and doing plain C is fine :-)
<br/>
<br/>
My programming test also looked straight forward but when they went through it at the end with me I'd made big mistakes as I didn't read it correctly! One annoying thing people seem to often get tested on is order of precedence. Many companies give you a terrible piece of bracket-less code and ask you what the answer would be. No-one ever writes code like that, and if they do they should put loads of comments!
<br/>
<br/>
Where did you go to uni anyway? Also, where's the job?

They're more likely to throw the application in the bin because of smart arse answers like that.

With paper tests it's much better to just answer the questions and leave the philosophy for the face to face interview.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
