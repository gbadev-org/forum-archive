    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From the looks of it, people say this quite often, but I want to develop for the DS. Seeing as the only coding I've ever done was Visual Basic .NET at school, I realise I have a long way to go.
<br/>
My question for the experienced DS programmers are this:
<br/>
How long do you think it would take to learn all I need to know? 3 months? 6? 5 years?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After having learned QBasic, it took me about 3 months to get up to speed in C to the point where I could make simple games using graphics in text mode (e.g. a roguelike or a Tetris clone). From there, it's a tiny jump to being able to program for the GBA.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also keep in mind that Tepples is rather bright ;-)  It really comes down to your aptitude for programming...for some people, it comes fairly naturally, for others, they have to pour a lot of time and energy into it to get anywhere.
<br/>
<br/>
If it comes naturally, then a few months of good effort might get you there.  If not, it might even take a few years.   
<br/>
<br/>
Just don't be discouraged if in 3 months you haven't figured it all out.  If you're having fun learning it, then enjoy the journey.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

sure brightness is an important factor, but if you have a good experience with an other language, some good software engineering capability and the required vector/matrix + geometry math, moving to an other language is quite fast...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">after all, it's not just the language. once oyu master the language as your primary tool, you still need to learn "game programming".
<br/>
<br/>
i think, depending on your present skills and your dedication, about two years of learning, experimenting and lots of ups and downs should get you to a level, where you can actually call yourself a game programmer. that's not that long and you're constantly learning (by doing)!
<br/>
<br/>
by the time you should have started a lot of small/medium sized projects and hopefully not canned *all* of them (even that is quite common, don't be discouraged!), so you have created yourself a reasonable code base (don't throw stuff away!).
<br/>
<br/>
well, go ahead and join us! Henshin a go go, Baby! ;?D

<br/>
happy learning!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
