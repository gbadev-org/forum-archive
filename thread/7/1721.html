    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there,
<br/>
I have a curious bug, when linking I have the error
<br/>
<br/>
"Multiple definition of 'OAM'"
<br/>
but this pointer was defined only once in a ".h" file.
<br/>
<br/>
and it can't be defined more because of the
<br/>
<br/>
#ifndef SPRITE_H
<br/>
#define SPRITE_H
<br/>
...
<br/>
blablabla
<br/>
...
<br/>
#endif
<br/>
<br/>
has someone an idea ? 
<br/>
thanks in advance, Michel</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you didn't find the fix, remember this. Sometimes if you are missing a ";" or making another syntax error, the compiler starts to interpret things oddly. It might think that you're redeclaring OAM when you are just using the variable. If the line error happens when you are trying to make use of the OAM variable its a good sign that this is happening.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
initialise and d?clare in one line in .h file, my compiler didn't like it.

thanks :Op</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
