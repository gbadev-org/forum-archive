    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it the new (std::nothrow) version? I guess so, as exceptions should be disabled (see below), right? Or is it just a malloc "alias"? :^o
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know this question is kind of noobish. But I am very prying atm. :^)
<br/>
... And, errr... I think it's important, especially for newcomers (as well as for everyone else), to know. ;^D
<br/>
<br/>
Short posts and links are very welcome. :^D
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
I did a little searching and found out, that the standard libraries are still exception enabled.
<br/>
<br/>
The standard makefiles also have the "-fno-exceptions" switch included, which means no exceptions in your program (you probably knew that from the name... yah. ;^p )
<br/>
<br/>
So, that's the core of the question: Is the default new (1) std::nothrow or (2) malloc? Or is it even like (3) std::nothrow == malloc?
<br/>
