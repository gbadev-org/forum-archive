This file doesn't appear in devkitadvance or other tools I've been looking at.
<br/>
<br/>
Where does it come from?
<br/>

Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You make it yourself, or more commonly copy it from tutorials and eventually improve it. gba.h/agb.h generally includes 4+ other headers including defines and the like for video, sound and all aspects of things. Where you see, for example, </span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">setMode(MODE_4 | BG2_ENABLE | OBJ_ENABLE | OBJ_MAP_1D);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
all of those words could be written as addresses, but to make life simpler we use defines.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So does that mean that everyone is homebrewing their includes and there is no standard set of includes with standard symbols for the registers and whatnot?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For example, when I first learnt how to fade, I didn't have the same names for the same addresses as the person who's code I was using did.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, that's not the page.  The download page just gives you a bunch of links to the sourceforge site, which has packages with no explanations of what is what.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Downloading a package from SourceForge.net typically takes three steps: <ol type="1"><li>Choose a package. In this case, you want "installer", also called "devkitPro Updater". </li><li>Choose a version.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah.  So the "updater" is really the installer.  I kept looking at that thinking it was for upgrading an existing version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
