    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone!
<br/>
<br/>
I followed these instructions to build my dev environment under Linux:
<br/>
<a href="http://linux.gbadev.org/gcc-gba/" target="_blank">http://linux.gbadev.org/gcc-gba/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I used the latest versions instead of the ones he used. Well, it all installed with minimum effort. I tried to compile his test program, it failed. Then I changed the CFLAGS to:
<br/>
<br/>
-Wall -marm -mcpu=arm7tdmi -nostartfiles crt0.o /home/leo/gbadev/arm-thumb-elf/lib/libc.a /home/leo/gbadev/lib/gcc/arm-thumb-elf/4.2.2/thumb/libgcc.a
<br/>
<br/>
and it compiled. Well, it runs on VBA, but on GBA (EZ-Flash IV Mini-SD) it crashes when I select the ROM, and on PSP (using gpSP emu) it displays the GameBoy logo, without the Nintendo part. (Something that shouldn't happen, I have no option set on the emu to display this logo, and none of the other games do it.)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know what to do? Thanks in advance!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds to me like a corrupted/missing nintendo-logo, have you run gbafix on the ROM before trying it? No$gba gives you a warning if this is the case, so if you're unsure, try in no$gba.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">By the way, are you sure you're not better off just using <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org" target="_blank">devkitARM</a>? It's a more up-to-date toolchain that has been pretty well tested.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What the... devkitARM you say? *Goes back to tutorial site* I thought that's what I was using... grr. Guess I gotta read the small letters next time.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, I'll post back if I can't get devkitARM to install.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
