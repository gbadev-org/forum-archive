Anyway, it depends. If you're using printf, you can do like this:
<br/>
<br/>
printf("%.02f", myfloat);
<br/>
<br/>
This will cause it to print two digits after the decimal point, including trailing zeroes. Consult the documentation on printf for more information about what this does and what else you can do.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're using cout in C++, do like this:
<br/>
<br/>
cout &lt;&lt; setiosflags(ios::fixed) &lt;&lt; setprecision(2) &lt;&lt; myfloat;
<br/>
<br/>
I dunno if this will print trailing zeros or not. Either try it or consult the documentation to find out ;)

The question is a bit confusing. Of course there's no rounding involved in getting from 0.000000... to 0.0, so it's not really a maths question. So it's either about printing, in which case the previous poster answered it.
<br/>
<br/>
Or it's about rounding arbitrary floats to arbitrary precision. I don't have all the C libraries memorized, but if there is not a round() function, there usually is a floor (or similar) function, and usually adding 0.5 or something similar at a different precision and then cutting off the rest does the trick.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I certainly agree that this has nothing to do with DS dev, and should be moved.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
