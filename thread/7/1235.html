    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am intruiged to know if I can setup VC++ to compile the binaries without using any third party library, i.e no DevKit or no HamLib, obviously I need to use the GCC compiler but I dont want to create my own library from scratch (purely educational!)  is this possible?  If so what would the makefile look like for a simple application with a .cpp file?  The makefile must be compatible with Visual Studio (7 if possible)  Im not a makefile expert!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Go to <a href="http://www.gbadev.org" target="_blank">www.gbadev.org</a> and select tools -&gt; misc -&gt; Gba Apwizard. Then you'll be able to select GBA project once you open a new project. At least that is the theory since it works on my Visual Studio 6.<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I use devkitadvance to compile my code and use no libraries at all (I'm writing a freestanding operating system) and it all works fine.
