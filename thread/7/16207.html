    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I just recently upgraded to VS2008, and now I am having problems with IntelliSense and stuff like structures that it should recognize.
<br/>
<br/>
What is odd is that my DS projects compile fine, and any structures that are put together in the devkitARM folder show up fine when I want to see their contents, but anything in the folder that my project is in won't show up. I've tried closing the program, deleting the *.ncb file that IntelliSense uses, but nothing seems to fix it. I went to basic scraps of my project. It compiles, but Intellisense does not work with any of the structures I create. I created a project with dovoto's template, and made a single structure to try it out. Still nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know of anything that I haven't tried out yet?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try to add the .h directories of your project to VC++ include directories (I don't remember where was that option). Or better, try CodeBlocks, code completion works much better than in Visual Studio (Intellisense works when it wants :p).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.playeradvance.org/forum/showthread.php?t=19881" target="_blank">Sh*tty RPG</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

LOL yeah aren't that the truth, I'm forever bashing F2 in VC when I want intellisense to work. I should try codeblocks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think I got it working without having to actually add the include directory to the project. What I finally figured out is that if I change how I do "includes" in the actual code file.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of something like...
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">#include "me.h"</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
...I ended up trying...
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">#include "../include/me.h"</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, my project folders would need to be set in this manner, but I already do that, so no problems here.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Late reply, but for archiving purposes, I think changing your includes to that format is the same as adding your include folder to your "include search path" in intellisense options.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's how to do that for those interested:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  Go to projects &gt;&gt; (projectname) options (alt+f7)
<br/>
<br/>
  -Project options window should pop up.
<br/>
<br/>
2.  In the left pane, expand the Configuration Options headline if necessary by clicking on the arrow on the left hand side.
<br/>
<br/>
  -You should now see: General, Debugging, NMake
<br/>
<br/>
3.  Select NMake
<br/>
<br/>
  -Right pane shows options
<br/>
<br/>
4.  In the right pane, under the "Intellisense" header, add any directories desired to the "Include Search Path" field.
<br/>
<br/>
  -for example, you could add c:\my_project_root\include  or c:\devkitPro\libnds\include
<br/>
<br/>
  -separate entries with a semicolon ;
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps, if anyone even needed the information =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
