    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am new to GBA developing.  I was able to get a program to compile which just changes the color of the screen.  I was unable to link in the CRT (C Runtime) though.  Does anyone have an example project for Visual Studio which correctly compiles a GBA rom (with CRT)?  A simple hello world, or not even that would work.  I just need a skeleton project to model mine after, I cannot set up the CRT with devkitadv to save my life!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
