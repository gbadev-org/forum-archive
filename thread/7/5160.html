    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
Can I access ROM data on a cartridge, like sprites or sounds from multiboot programs? How can I find where the data is? Does it encrypted?
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Occasionally, but it usually snaps right out of it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A multiboot program loaded through MBV2, through a USB linker, or through pak-swapping can access the entire GBA ROM area. Applications include a hex viewer, a sprite viewer, a map viewer, a savegame editor, etc. In fact, if you want to dump a whole cart to the PC, there's nothing stopping you. Nintendo originally planned to hide all of ROM except the first 4 KB from GBA multiboot programs as a privacy measure, but the feature was dropped. There is no encryption on GBA carts.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks for your help.
<br/>
What I wanted to do is to upload a multiboot software that'll use the info on the cart instead of multibooting that also.
<br/>
Does someone tried it once? Where can I find a sprite viewer to be used on e real GBA?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GBA ROMs and Super NES ROMs don't necessarily have a clear separation of tiles from other data the way NES ROMs have. If you want to view sprites in the commercial games, you're going to have to hack an emulator to log the source addresses of all copies to sprite cel VRAM and to log all calls to the decompression functions LZ77UnCompVram and RLUnCompVram, and you're going to have to send processed logs along with the multiboot program. Even then, you may have trouble getting the palette right.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
