    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm wondering if I should even reply, but I'm a sucker. In a word, yes, pleanty of people here could. But ... no. They're not going to; for several reasons.
<br/>
<br/>
Firstly your request is off topic for this board. It belongs over in the Help Wanted. Secondly, if you'd have been over there and read the sticky, you'd know the rest of the reasons why not.
<br/>
<br/>
Your post is badly formatted and mispelled. All caps is considered rude and childish. You're demanding a clone of an existing app, but you offer nothing more than a statement of "I want it!"
<br/>
<br/>
I strongly suspect you're a troll, but I'll be nice anyway. As you make no mention of any artistic or programming skills, the only thing you can bring to the table is a design spec. You say not to make it if one doesn't know all the ins and outs of skateboarding. That is a huge mistake.
<br/>
<br/>
While I can't speak for everyone here, I'm a programmer, so I could help, but I don't skate, so I can't. If you really want to see this done and not just contribute to the lulz, you'll have to put some effort it. Unless I'm mistaken, about the only thing you have to contribute is your skate knowledge, so you'd better start writing it down.
<br/>
<br/>
To even be considered at all (unlikely given the start you've gotten off to), you'll need to provide a solid design document. It has to be written in clear coherant english. It should be properly punctuated and capitalized. It should detail all of the application requirements and not rely on skater jargon. It should be written such that a coder who know nothing about skating at all could build the app. And write it like a school term paper, not a myspace post.
<br/>
<br/>
Do some research on design documentation and what is really required of a solid spec. Learn enough about the programming and artitistic ends of the project that the spec can adequately provide potential team members with the information they're going to need.
<br/>
<br/>
Do all that and post a polite request in the proper forum and you may have a chance. Continue as you are and you'll get nothing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
