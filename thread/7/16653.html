    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So all I want to do at this point is round/truncate a number. Using Dev-C++ I would have just included Math.h and called the floorf function. But I have to use DevKitAdv in order to produce a .gba file, and I can't even find Math.h or anything Math related in the library folder. So how do I add new libraries and where can I find them?

<br/>
Thanks for all the help!
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Sorry. I found I had just missed a step in the installation. Now I have all the libraries and everything...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, I did realize that devkitadv hadn't been updated since 2003. I've spent so much time getting this thing to actually work! Is there a thread/site that explains how devkitarm differs from devkitadv? Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
