    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi.
<br/>
<br/>
Short answer: It's only you and the hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
Slightly longer answer: Check out Ton<span style="font-weight: bold">c</span> (search the web for "Ton<span style="font-weight: bold">c</span> gba") and make yourself familiar with one of the available APIs / libraries for the GBA.
<br/>
Once you get around that, the GBA is a very lovely piece of hardware and quite capable when used efficiently.
<br/>
<br/>
Developing a tile map editor shouldn't be a big problem. Just make sure you know your programming language and how to use it efficiently. Also, knowing some alogrithms and common datastructures, as well as their implementations, helps a lot.
<br/>
<br/>
For inspiration I suggest you take a look a StillAliveDS (should run in the no$gba emulator), as it has a build-in map editor.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck! :^)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Oh, those young fellas these days and their Tonks! X^D
<br/>
Tonc, sure. Sorry, I was about to going to bed. ;^D
<br/>
Thanks. :^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

You had better asked that right away, that you want to know how to convert images. ;^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

What formats are you interested in? Different formats require different processing.
<br/>
<br/>
Please elaborate some more or else you can be helped, because it's unclear what you want. :^/<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

It loads the images into a box on the gui and you can import a windows bmp or png image and it will load inside the second box on the gui. If you hit write it writes the imported image affter converting it and then reloads the image from the rom to show the newly written image. I'm using windows api for the gui.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Interesting fact: the Sonic Advance engine is based directly on the original Genesis games' engine. The originals were compressed except for the player graphics, yet the Sonic Advance games aren't at all.
