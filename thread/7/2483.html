    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know what tiled mode is and get the basic concept of the mode. BUT, it seems that my tiles never manage to load correctly. 
<br/>
<br/>
I use gfx2gba to load my .bmp tile map to a .c file. I know there is a difference in loading when using a text map and a rot map.
<br/>
<br/>
After converting it, the output is JUNK. The palette is correct when running, but the tiles aren't. I know the data exported is good because i tested the same image data using HAM v2.8.  Anybody have an idea what my problem is? 
<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to follow the pern project tutorials but instead of using pcx2gba (doesn't seem to work for me) i am to use gfx2gba.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
