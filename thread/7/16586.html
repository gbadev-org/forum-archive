    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody,
<br/>
<br/>
I am developing a C# application that generates gba(C++) files. 
<br/>
What I want to do is compile those C++ files in C# application.
<br/>
Namely, when the C# application runs, I want to build some C++ files.
<br/>
Do you think it is possible. If it is possible, how can I do this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I've just learned it from MSDN form and i am sharing it here, may be someone need it..
<br/>
<br/>
In order to compile a C++ application from outside of the application, one need to write a batch file. 
<br/>
The only thing that batch file must include the calling code of makefile.. This is the batch file that i built my application:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">make -f makefile clean
<br/>
make -f makefile</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Save this as name.bat and run it in the directory of C++ application. If one needs to run it from C#, just call this batch file from C#..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Equally easy is (without any need for a batch file) most languages have a syscall function where you can call any command that is within your environment PATH variable.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow though, any way you could let us in on what your final goal with having C# call GNU Make would be?  Maybe we can give you ideas based on your goal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
