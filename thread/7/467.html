    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey folks, i am new to GBA programming although i have been doing general programming for awhile. I was wondering if there is a way to generate true random numbers. I have writen a funtion to fake it but it is psuedo random and is in the same sequence every time the program is run.  I know in windows programing you can seed the generator with time so it creates a random number every time the program is run.  Is there anything like this that can be use on the GBA.  Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
