    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am really not sure where I should post this...  I am posting it in the C/C++ section, but I really don't think this belongs anywhere...  But I really need help, and would appreciate a few minutes of your time (if you have a flash cart)
<br/>
<br/>
I have compiled this code:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.uleth.ca/~dave.brady/spritetest2.zip" target="_blank">www.uleth.ca/~dave.brady/spritetest2.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
But the problem lies in the fact that it runs just fine on VisualBoy Advance 1.4... but doesn't run at all on VisualBoy Advance 1.51
<br/>
<br/>
I would really appreciate it if someone could test the code for me on a real GBA to see if it's a problem with my code or a problem with the emulator.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It works just fine on my GBA SP, so it must be a problem in Visualboy Advance (maybe a config problem? If not, email the author and send him the rom so he can look into it).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you very much for your time.  I am very glad indeed to hear that.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I have just installed VisualBoy Advance on the computer I am at right now (public), and it runs on it too.  I think I might have a registry problem or something with my copy at home.  I feel kind of stupid now for posting this here.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, thanks again for your help.  You have taken a load off of my mind, as much of my code was built off of this piece.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
