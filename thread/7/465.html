    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi am im new to programming with the gba but have been programming for a good while now.  I was wonder how on the GBA would you seed a truely random number.  I have created a little funtion to simulate a random number but every time you run the code the same sequence occurs.  With the pc it is easy just seed with the time to make a random number.  Is there anything like this that i can use.  Thanks for your time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
