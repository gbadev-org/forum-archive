    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody,
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to start developing some simple c programs on my GBA. I'm buying soon a flash-cart set and, meanwhile, I'd like to try coding something and try it on emulators. Which tools should I use ? I saw there are lots of different compilers, so I basically am asking for a little suggestion :)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot to everybody</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm litte bit of a newbie myself (to GBA coding, not coding in general). I started out using HAM (www.ngine.de) and HAMlib to quickly get up to speed with my coding and not spend to much time learning GBA memory maps for the devices. Though, I have been reading some Goaldroad ASM and other misc tech-stuff since then. But in general I think HAM is an excellent introduction to the plattform since much low-level stuff is nicely wrapped in macros and libs. It is the closest thing to a complete (inofficial) development package as you probably could get.<br/>_________________<br/>"The best optimizer is between your ears..."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
