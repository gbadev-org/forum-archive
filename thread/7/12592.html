There is no language C/C++, just as there is no game console GameCube/Wii.

First step is that you'll need to throw out everything you know about the Windows API. This will be easier if the front end (graphics, sound, and input) and the back end (game logic) of your product are well separated.

Start with <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitpro.org</a>. You'll want to download devkitPro Updater and install devkitARM, libgba, and GBA examples.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

But is it easier to just use the IDE provided with devkitPro and is he only using the Visual C++ because he is under the impression it is better or because he is more comfortable using it. And also is it possible that all the features that are good in Visual C++ are redundant in this situation!
<br/>
<br/>
From the post it appears that the person is likely to be a newcomer and has merely taken the first steps in making sure that he, or she has all the right available tools and started off with downloading visual c++ express. I could [of course] be wrong, but from the post it does seem the most likely case.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Personally I prefer UltraEdit, it's served me well for a number of years. As far as my windows install is concerned, UE *is* notepad :) ( I got totally fed up with notepad's inability to deal with unix line endings )

I felt that way for a long time.  But for java, if you have a pretty kickin' machine, it actually ends up being really nice.  For C/C++, it's not nearly as useful, but still pretty convenient and customizable, once you understand how it does things (which is a little different than a lot of tools).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

its not the fastest program but with a relatively decen cpu/ram this shouldnt be a problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
