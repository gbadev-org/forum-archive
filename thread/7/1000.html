<br/>
<br/>
I am a super newbie.
<br/>
I know exactly nothing about programming, using c++.
<br/>
So, what would be the best tutorial, book or ebook to start with ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh, thats just C :). There is a difference between learning a programming language and learning how to program. To know how it works is different then to know how to use it ;).<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, in this book is described, what specific command lines do?

They have a lot of good tutorials on various languages.
<br/>
You have to register, but it doesn't take long, and it's free.

Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
