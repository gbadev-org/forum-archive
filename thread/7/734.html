    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In java, your program is most likely build up from classes.
<br/>
What is (sort of) the equilevant of those classes in c/c++?
<br/>
<br/>
Since they might be handy in a rpg game, where classes
<br/>
like player and enemy, but also items, etc are very handy,
<br/>
so i don't need to store the variables 'loose' in the game,
<br/>
but neat in the player class, if they belong there.
<br/>
<br/>
thnx

The equivalent of Java classes in C is structures and functions operating on these structures.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
