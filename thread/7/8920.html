<br/>
I've pretty much adopted the convention in my own work. There are some useful advantages the conventions can provide:
<br/>
<br/>
- Prefixing with an "I" instead of "C" can be used to distinguish interfaces from classes, since C++ doesn't make the distinction itself.
<br/>
<br/>
- I don't use the prefix if I'm declaring a struct. By naming structs differently from classes, it keeps it more apparent where encapsulation and OO behaviour is integral to the design. (I know some people use the "S" prefix for structs... I find that just a plain capital letter is sufficient. YMMV.)
<br/>
<br/>
Especially when working in a team environment where people have different levels of experience with and understanding of OO methodologies, maintaining a consistent convention can help reinforce weak links. I like to think that when someone sees the "C" prefixing one of my classes, they know more intuitively that they are expected to use accessor methods when dealing with its contents, rather than just going in and making everything public or what-have-you.

Not unless that kind of refactoring is going to be sufficiently beneficial down the line to be worth the time spent doing it now. I think so long as a system is being consistent in its design, though, it probably isn't adviseable.

Because programmers aren't robots, and ideas and design patterns aren't always adequately conveyed through a spec alone. When code is being shared with a team, it's important to be as communicative as possible, and adopting coding conventions that are meaningful to you (as opposed to just ritual) can help with that.

I waver on this. I think refactoring often generates client code change as a necessary side-effect, so doing things that will minimize that kind of code change is probably a Good Thing.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think exposing it is dangerous, though... in fact, I think exposing the structural hierarchy of your design is also a Good Thing. It just depends on what's more important to the environment you're developing in.

Consistent in what?  Obviously not in naming conventions.  Or wait, you said the name you choose is right by definition, because it becomes right by virtue of the fact that the author chose it?  That is a very consistent convention, but it conveys <span style="font-style: italic">no information to the reader</span> besides some historical detail about how the author felt about the original implementation at the time of its inception.

And the convention you suggest is not meaningful.

Having a prefix that reflects the primitive keyword used in the declaration does not "say nothing" at best; at the very least it says what that primitive was without having to look it up in the declaration. At a higher level, it can also provide a clue and/or reminder as to where the object fits into the design pattern.
<br/>
<br/>
Whether it provides that clue or not depends on the programmer who coded the system, the programmer reading the code, and the nature of the system itself. But while clues can go missing or unused they are very rarely misinterpreted... at least, I've never heard anyone who thought "he used a struct instead of a class; clearly encapsulated behaviour is the focus here instead of storage".

No, there is no right and wrong here, there's only what makes sense and what is useful.

<br/>
Code around the world wouldn't be made universally easier to follow if every programmer everywhere was forced to suck up their individual preferences and followed Hungarian notation exclusively and unwaveringly, applying it the exact same way in every language and every application. Odds are it would make things far, far worse overall. This does not mean that Hungarian notation can't be useful, though.

You can paint it that way if you choose. Again, spend some time deciphering code that was written years ago by people with varying levels of experience who are no longer around to explain it. Every clue matters, and consistent naming conventions can go a long way when you're following breadcrumbs.

I don't understand what you're saying here. If the convention I personally use that I described in the previous post is applied to a system that I write, then it can be used to better understand the system at any point in time. If the entire system is overhauled and refactored and changed around then obviously the names may require changing to keep the convention applied consistently, but this is a normal part of the refactoring process.

So when you apply this shortcut, are you not indicating an aspect of the design when you do so?
<br/>
<br/>
Do you not think that I or someone else would be able to comprehend this indication, even if we don't apply that same convention to our code?

True, when in Java, I generally follow this convention.
<br/>
<br/>
For C++, generally follow Hungarian notation.

But you have time to criticize the structure of my argument without providing specific example? That's mighty convenient.

Spare me the bull. If you don't have time to debate then that's fine, but don't expect me to take a parting potshot lying down.

Prefixing based on data type is Systems Hungarian, not Hungarian notation as Charles Simonyi conceived it. <a class="postlink" href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HungarianNotation" target="_blank">There's a difference</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
