    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I use Dev-C++ and I would like to ask how to configure this for DevkitARM. There is a topic here about this but it only discusses configuration for DevkitAdvance. I have placed all paths(at least I think all of them) but the makefile seems to have a problem. Can anyone post how to do everything just in case I didn't do something right?<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Personally I find it hard to recommend this editor for anything at all given that it has extremely limited support for custom makefiles.
<br/>
<br/>
If you used the devkitPro installer then you have Programmer's NotePad available which was chosen for both it's ease of use and extensibility. I really recommend you give it a try before getting too involved with the complexities of using dev-cpp with devkitARM.
<br/>
<br/>
The installer supplys a number of example projects for both gba and nds including some basic templates which can simply be copied and used as a basis for your own projects. Many of the homebrew programmers here are using PN2 and the devkitPro build system quite happily.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently I'm busy pulling the final elements together for a devkitARM release but once that's out of the way I hope to do some work on more extensive documentation regarding devkitARM, editors and the build system used for the example code.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

I see, but there is an option for custom makefiles. I was thinking maybe I'm doing something wrong with the makefiles or the configurations. 
<br/>
Unfortunately I didn't use the installer, I simply downloaded direct.<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright for anybody who is intrested I got it working!
<br/>
First of course is to setup the compiler options under the tools tab, create a new configuration, name it whatever you want. Don't touch the Settings,
<br/>
Add the directories for binaries, libraries, c and cpp includes. For the programs, replace the gcc and g++ with the arm-elf-gcc.exe and arm-elf-g++.exe. Press ok!. 
<br/>
    Now open project options under the projects tab. Under the parameters tab, put -mthumb -mthumb-interiwork and -specs=gba.specs under the linker additional command line options(You can also place the same under the c and c++ options). under the build options, check the override output filename check box and change the .exe to .elf. Thats it! I still havent figured out how to convert to .gba but I'll post again when I do.
<br/>
<br/>
**EDIT**
<br/>
<br/>
Can anybody confirm if this worked for them too? Feedback would bw appreciated!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK now here`s the last step to convert to .gba.
<br/>
     After the .elf file is created using the steps that I gave in the previous posts, go back to the Project Options. 
<br/>
      Now under the Makefile tab, check the "Use custom Makefile" then go to your project directory and look for Makefile.win(This is actually the generated makefile!). 
<br/>
     Now change the "all: all-before &lt;project name&gt;.elf all-after" to  "all:all-before &lt;project name&gt;.gba all-after".
<br/>
    after the "clean: clean-custom" command create another command
<br/>
"&lt;project name&gt;.gba: &lt;project name&gt;.elf
<br/>
&lt;tab&gt;-@arm-elf-objcopy -v -O binary $&lt; $@
<br/>
&lt;tab&gt;-@gbafix $@"
<br/>
and thats it! very little makefile changing! Please give me some feedback on this method!<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
