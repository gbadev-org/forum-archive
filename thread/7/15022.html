    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have just downloaded devkitpro using the devkitpro updater, and I am sitting reading the example given in a guide. I copy and paste it to the programmers notepad and then attempt to run it on my DS (using superkey/supercard lite combo on my flashed DSL). It doesn't work, and I am now very confused, and can't figure out:
<br/>
1. How to change it from .nds to .sc.nds (or .ds.gba, which also works).
<br/>
2. How to make it usable on my DS at all... please help a noob in need!
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if there is something simpler that I can start out programming with, plz tell me. I have made multiple programs on my Ti-83 calculator, but that seems like a joke compared to this stuff. If there is a better way to start out, I am open to suggestions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As of a few versions of devkitARM ago, ndstool automatically adds a header that works in both .nds and sc.nds modes. At least it works on my cousins' SuperCard SD adapters.

If your program doesn't run on a DS or in NO$GBA, then there may be a problem with the code itself. Have you tried compiling any of the examples that come with libnds and running them? Specifically, can you get C:\devkitpro\examples\nds\templates\arm9 to work in NO$GBA or on your SuperCard?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

At 150 KiB, NO$GBA is one of the smallest emulators I've seen. How would that violate your minimum?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

1. Can't find the example program

and 2. Can't run most of my normal ones that work on my DSL.

Are there some advanced options I have to set, am I an idiot, or is it just not working right.

(Answer 2 is very likely, by the way)

I was trying to test it out running a brickbreak game, and it just went black. I play this game on my ds quite often tho.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To get the NDS file, you need to compile the source code. The example program tepples is referring to, is produced then the example source code is built from the files found in it's directory.
<br/>
<br/>
A lot of compiled programs will not run on emulators, due to the emulators being released incomplete, however the example projects downloaded with DevKitARM will run on most emulators once the projects have been compiled.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#150962 - Dwedit - Sat Feb 16, 2008 1:52 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You start the msys Bash shell either by running bash.exe (from the bin folder) or msys.bat.
<br/>
From there, you need to use unix style commands to navigate to the directory, such as "cd" to change directory, "ls" to list all files in a directory, or "make" to execute any makefile script named "makefile".
<br/>
For example:
<br/>
go to C:\devkitpro\msys
<br/>
run msys.bat
<br/>
cd C:/devkitpro/examples/nds  (you need to use forward slashes within bash)
<br/>
ls  (you see a screen full of directory names)
<br/>
<br/>
To go back a directory, use "cd .."
<br/>
<br/>
Before you try to compile any of the example programs, make sure you have declared environment variables DEVKITARM and DEVKITPRO.  I have DEVKITARM=/c/devkitPro/devkitARM and DEVKITPRO=/c/devkitPro<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
