    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
Well there are several GBA I/O registers used to access the communication features. Overall all there are quite a few different modes of communication including: 16-bit Multiplayer Comms (2-4 GBA's connected), 8-bit and 32-bit Serial Comms, UART Comms, General Purpose Comms, and JOY-BUS Comms (for the GBA to be used as a GC controller interface, etc.). I suggest reading some public documents to find a lot more about the GBA's communication capabilities and how to use them. Here's a link to a very descriptive document: [url]http://www.work.de/nocash/gbatek.htm[/url]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe I should explain what I'm trying to do,
<br/>
<br/>
Do you remember the "virtual boy"? Well imagine the virtualboy with color. I have recently come upon the idea to recreate a set of goggles that could be connected to the gba. and in some games it can be used to see a forved perspective view (3d). 
<br/>
<br/>
The idea behind it is simple I enter a gba graphics mode that allows a double buffer. draw on both surfaces and send one screen the visual data and the other the buffer. Each would be the exact same picture with slight differences in the scrolling/zooming of each layer. 
<br/>
<br/>
This is what the vb did and I'm not sure if the gba's communication port is fast enough to do this. It'd have to export 2 screens ever 1/20'th of a second to even rival the vb in speed. 
<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess my actual question is, is it fast enough?<br/>_________________<br/>Some people think asians are smart, I've devoted my life to prove otherwise!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm.. are you talking about sending the graphics to the goggles through the 
<br/>
comms port?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think that would be possible.. on the other hand, standard shutter glasses could probably be used.<br/>_________________<br/>codito ergo sum</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hrm. I've never thought of that, Do you know where I might be able to purchase these shutter goggles? Also would it be simple enough to interface the shutter goggles with the gba through the comm port?<br/>_________________<br/>Some people think asians are smart, I've devoted my life to prove otherwise!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, i have about four pairs of them, a couple of years ago they came 
<br/>
bundled with gfx cards.
<br/>
<br/>
The connector is a standard 3mm stereo-plug, but i think the voltage 
<br/>
needed is 5V, and the comm port is only 3V, dunno if it's still enough..
<br/>
I'm not completely sure of how the signal looks like, but i'm pretty sure it's
<br/>
really simple.
<br/>
<br/>
But i guess you could get a pair of shutter-glasses for about $15 or so..
<br/>
perhaps i could send you one of mine..

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The com port is certainly fast enough for shutter glasses, but I doubt the GBA color TFT is fast enough for that technique..
<br/>
TFT's are much slower than PC CRT's.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thats true, even on a 'good' CRT screen the ghosting is pretty bad..
<br/>
But it wouldn't hurt to test though..
<br/>
<br/>
But i wonder if the voltage from the comms port is enough though..
