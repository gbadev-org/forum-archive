Once you're comfortable with coming up your own algorithms you could probably start making simple GBA games. The thing is that even the simplest of games is the work of many "words, number and string"-like routines all working in unison.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you really ready to tackle some graphics programming... that wouldn't be a problems. Just try to learn C++ from your class and try to read ahead and  also do some simple problem just to practice on C++ and getting know programming language. 
<br/>
<br/>
Basicaly all programming has the same concept or grammer but diffrent syntax and  try to understand the basic compiler... because compiler for GBA is diff than MVC++.  keep practicing everyday!!!

<br/>
and dont forget to read "tepples's" post =)

Just to name a few- ASM, C, Perl and Smalltalk are all fairly different once we look past language grammer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All of which are imperative languages.  Check out Prolog and Haskell for two truly different styles (logical and functional, respectively).
<br/>
<br/>
Lisp can also be molded to fit any of these styles, but you have to like s-expressions and dynamic typing (even if only to program your way out of them).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
