    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi, This is my first post (yay)
<br/>
<br/>
and I'm sorry for my first post being asking for help :(
<br/>
<br/>
but well it's like this:
<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to rename a file...
<br/>
<br/>
But am unable to.
<br/>
<br/>
I am using the "rename" function and the official libfat from DevKitARM
<br/>
but it keeps returning -1 (which means that something went wrong)
<br/>
<br/>
Can you guys help me?
<br/>
<br/>
I mean, I tried everything, from changing the source file and new file over and over, using "fat1:" in the beginning of the path...everything
<br/>
<br/>
Please, my project (iFile) depends on it :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Last time I checked, <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=137624#137624" target="_blank">rename() was broken</a>. Workarounds exist: <ol type="a"><li>Remove the SD card from the DS and use a PC to rename files. </li><li>Copy the file and delete the old one. </li></ol><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

How would you check for enough space on the card to make the copy, especially if you are trying to rename a folder?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
To rename a folder, create a new folder, move the contents into the new one &amp; remove the old one.  You could file in &amp; file out one at a time.

<br/>
I'm just throwing suggestions out for discussion...<br/>_________________<br/>-#2pencil</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
