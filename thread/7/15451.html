I don't know the precise state of the tubes in the US, but here in Norway dial-up is pretty much non-existent, and it has been for the last 7-8 years. DSL is cheap, and you can get free internet access at most caf?s or at the public libraries.

On all the trips I have done to the US, I've been able to get proper high-speed internet access without really paying anything worth mentioning.

Not if you're linking statically to the CRT. It's also possible to use the older CRT (msvcrt.dll, the same one as MinGW is using) that has been standard for a very long time (pre-installed since win95 osr2c IIRC), but that involves quite some nasty hacks in some cases.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you really want to spend your time on debugging the internet? If so, you've got a hell of a task ahead of you. Knowing what is worth spending time on is something that is critical to get anything at all done. (In case you didn't get it - I got your point, but I don't think it's a good one.

Apart from GBFS and bin2s, which are now included with devkitARM, there are seven programs that translate assets or write lookup tables for TOD: <ul><li>4-bit tiled image converter </li><li>8-bit linear image converter </li><li>LZ77 coder </li><li>audio converter </li><li>music compiler </li><li>tunnel lookup table generator </li><li>cosine lookup table generator </li></ul> If I compile more than one Python program to an EXE, is that 700k shared across all the EXEs (as it is with the <a class="postlink" href="http://alleg.sf.net/" target="_blank">Allegro DLL</a> used by some of my C projects), or is it 700k per program? I <span style="font-style: italic">could</span> go the BusyBox route and put everything into one Python program that takes a command-line argument telling which program to run, but by then, I'm working around the system as much as with it, which brings me to the next point:

Sure, Python makes <span style="font-style: italic">some</span> things more comfortable to <span style="font-style: italic">develop</span>, at the cost of runtime speed and/or deployment difficulty in some cases.

I haven't really tested it, but the 700k is for the python interpreter DLL, and several applications should be capable of sharing it. So I think that's a one-time cost, but I can't really be sure without testing it.

Yeah, you trade something for something else, which is basically what every decision you make here in life is all about. Anyway, my point wasn't that Python is so fantastic, it was that from the problem description he gave it could look that some other tool was more suited.

@Rajveer:
<br/>
I realize you found an IDE already, but I use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html" target="_blank">Dev-Cpp</a> for PC dev. Just today I discovered <a class="postlink" href="http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">wxDev-Cpp</a> actually works on my WinXP now, so I use that now. wxDev-Cpp is basicly an extension of Dev-Cpp, which adds RAD with wxWidgets. RAD means you can quickly create an application's graphical interface, kindof like how you do it in VS. I haven't actual tried programming any wx stuff yet... Some advantages of wxWidgets, is, it's cross-platform, and works on Windows 9x, unlike MS .NET.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But its not easy to use for beginners, because Eclipse is like EMACS.. you can do all with it ;) Also I think for the lightweight Editor users like  Ultraedit/Programmers Notepad/.. + Makefiles, it is not easy to change.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How about Vim used with g++/gcc and gdb?  Vim's not an IDE, but supports every point just mentioned (internally or through a helper tool), but it has a somewhat steeper learning curve.  It is all we use at work (but we are a hardware design and verification group, and as most HD design shops, we use exclusively Unix variants... Red hat enterprise Linux for us).  Yeah yeah, vim is weird I hear you say...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I used to use IDEs all day.  They were great, I thought.  Then I had to refactor C++ code.  It seems, there is no easy way for a parser to do this.  Something to do with the grammar allowed in C++.  But it is a one liner regex if you know what you are doing in vim.  :bufdo %s/\&lt;old\&gt;/new/gc .   Yes it is a manual brute force solution and is not really refactoring, but for most purposes, if your naming makes sense, it will work just fine. never took my hands off the keyboard for that one.  
<br/>
<br/>
Use the c in %s if you want confirmation on replace.  After realizing how powerful vim was at this one task, as well as many others, and forced to use it at work, I found it to be years ahead of most IDEs and on par with bloated feature rich IDEs. The kicker is, it has a VERY SMALL foot print, despite all the features of vim.  (Also, when telecommuting, who wants to be bogged down by all that slowGUI stuff remotely?  Just use ssh and vim :) ).
<br/>
<br/>
Configuring vim is pretty much llke boarder-line programming (in vimscript).  You can set up things however you'd like.  The flexibility is UNMATCHED by any IDE.  I have a very specific coding style that and indentation scheme I have vim adhere to, how code folding happens, you can delete folds, add fold types etc. We have to adhere to a standard for work. purposes.
<br/>
<br/>
You can use gdb side by side with Vim and gdb will spit out the source code line by line if you want.  As expected GDB has many of the features of modern IDE debuggers and seems quite a bit more flexible.   Of course, vim will parse compiler output (especially g++/gcc and bring you to the source file and line where the error/warning occurred, and you have much more control over how that occurs also). try :cope
<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I found I am a much FASTER programmer by using vim also.  All the terse shortcuts and no need for a mouse.  I fly around the code and my open buffers when using vim.  Spliting up windows moving code around etc.   You may also enjoy Emacs, which has just as many features as vim, but I haven't found a need to learn two of these types of tools yet.  
<br/>
<br/>
I disagree slightly with the last poster on how Eclipse is like Emacs.  Don't get me wrong, Eclipse has a lot of options and is a great tool, but I think Emacs and vim will always be more flexible (and therefore less user friendly, slightly).   Also, neither Emacs nor vim requires the use of a mouse, I cannot say the same for Eclipse.  I  also don't think it is plausible  to configure options with a small powerful lisp script, within Eclipse ;).  (In vim, you would use vim script for the same purpose).  Also, Eclipse has a very large memory foot print when compared to Vim or Emacs.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One thing though, managed makefiles.  Vim will force you to learn how to make these, or how to use Automake tools, etc.  Also a good skill to have.  Every interview I had out of school asked about my experience with Make tools, so I guess it must be useful ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Finally the best feature of vim is:  No need to port your projects files to multiple IDEs!   Why?  There are none and no (forseeable) need for them.  So, it is a true separation between Compiler, editor and debugger. The ultimate flexibility.  Back in the day I would spend hours configuring the IDE's compiler, editor etc, to work with my source tree.   Not any more, I am FREE!  
<br/>
<br/>
If compilation fails, it is due to a dependency or compiler version on the machine, and not some weird IDE problem or tweek.  You just use the same Make/Automake/etc files in your source tree as instructions on building your projects (which are much more tried and tested than proprietary build systems of some IDEs), and any issues are very easy to track down when this separation exists between your tools.  
<br/>
<br/>
All in all it saves you time to learn Vim (or Emacs).... for many, I'd say.  But results may vary.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I didn't wanted to compare Eclipse with Emacs because these are very different. Also I gave up with Emacs after 2hs because was too user unfriendly for me ;) I do not suggest Eclipse for beginners because its an heavy weight tool with (maybe too many) features. It is also not made to edit a textfile. For this tasks UEdit/VI/.. are maybe better. Even the startup time is much faster ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I do not understand why coders do not like the mouse..  You do not code 1000th lines of code a day. Most of the time I'm thinking what is the best way to implement a functionality. Also a lot of time I need to locating bugs. Analyzing of existing source code is a major part of my work. Navigating the source code using eclipse is easy and very fast even without cryptic commands. And nowadays most PCs has 1gb of RAM and this is enough to work with eclipse. If you want extends the functionality simply write a new java plugin. Its very easy to do. For example for new folding algorithms and source code markers etc. I think the similar way as Lisp for VIM.

In Fact, there are lots of approaches to (program) text editing, just as with anything. You have to find something that fits your current needs. If you find later, that you need something more, start looking for that, but you'll take the knowledge with you, that you gained while using the former solution.

I don't hate the mouse.  I just think for editing code it can get in the way.  I didn't use to have this mind set, but came to this conclusion while using vim.  Everything I do in vim is faster using the keyboard.   I use the mouse for most everything else (waveform viewers, Oscilloscope functions, Browsing the internet, opening up a new console, highlighting some parts of text to drop in my console from outside sources.. not from within vim).  FYI: You can still use a mouse in Gvim or XEmacs (even in the console version of vim), it is just optional, I personally prefer the console where I can set all my env variables as needed (since we have to do this many times when running test suites).

<br/>
<br/>
Vim offers many speeds of navigation with the keyboard.  I usually navigate through chunks using '}' or I can use ')' to navigate by paragraph, or I can use ']' to navigate ending braces, or I can use # on a symbol to navigate by symbol occurance.  Vim has any feature that GUI IDEs have, just more modularized or has to be learned or activated.  Vim (or in a smaller scale, Emacs) is also used in every engineering company I have ever worked for or interviewed at.
<br/>
<br/>
I really suggest trying them again, some time in your career future.  Don't bother learning both Emacs and Vim though, just choose one.  Both is likely a waste of time.   Then again, if you file Linux in the same category as Vim, as many people seem to do these days, and are married to proprietary OSs, I don't think I can sway you in the near future ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I started using every IDE you can imagin, Eclipse, Netbeans, CodeBlocks, and some are great with embedded GUI editors and the like, especially for Java.    I also hated the idea of not using a mouse too, how backwards and old school, I thought.  It seems like you are evolving in the wrong direction!     But then I feel in love with the power and flexibility of vim, and not having to use the mouse when coding :D.   I still could if I wanted to, but then I just gradually stopped using it (for editing anyhow).
<br/>
<br/>
You can really make either editor "your own", and do pretty much anything you can imagine as being useful, in the context of editing and programming.  Plus we need to edit Verilog, SystemVerilog, C++, C, Perl, tk, SystemC... and proprietary in house languages, and tie them all to our Automake/Makefiles this isn't possible in many IDEs, especially with syntax highlighting for all files.   This is the selling point to most engineers.
<br/>
<br/>
   Also there is no need to port <span style="font-weight: bold">CRAZY </span>project files between the design engineers, validation engineers, firmware engineers, etc, who may wish to use many different tools.   Instead, they can use what ever text editor they want and rely on tried and tested make systems (which are uniform versions across all workstations) to keep things sane.  Otherwise, we'd have to version control N diff project files for N diff IDEs and the like, that would be a mess.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the context of GBA programming.  I saved myself oddles of time when I completely dropped Eclipse and Netbeans etc, as I was spending hours changing project files anytime I wanted to try a new IDE (and in some cases, only a new IDE version).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll throw my 2 cents into this IDE/vim discussion.  I've been a vim fan for years, but in the past 2 years, have started really enjoying Eclipse as well.  
<br/>
<br/>
My thoughts:
<br/>
The keyboard movement for vim is the best thing ever.  I also hate the mouse, and what you can do quickly in vim is amazing.
<br/>
<br/>
That being said, many of the tools available in eclipse are wonderful:  refactoring, formatting, a smarter understanding of your entire project by the ide...it's really quite nice.  Especially for big projects, where you have source files strewn out in all sorts of levels, it's much easier to navigate using Eclipse, once you learn a lot of its keyboard shortcuts.  Unfortunately, there's still that whole "not being vi" thing against it.
<br/>
<br/>
So currently, I use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.satokar.com/viplugin/" target="_blank">a vi plugin for eclipse</a> -- Which is buggy, not well supported, costs money, and makes me rather frustrated at times, BUT lets me use Vi keys in eclipse.  It's really the best of both worlds when I'm working on large projects.
<br/>
<br/>
elyk1212 mentioned that vim is more configurable...which isn't entirely true.  vi is more easily configurable....as Eclipse is built on a very modular plugin system, you can make eclipse do ANYTHING.  But it's not necessarily as easy as scripting vim.
<br/>
<br/>
The other problem with Eclipse is still speed...until very recently, Eclipse was sluggish and horrible on anything but a nice powerful machine.  Things have caught up enough recently that it's not so bad, but it's still a bit too much overhead for small projects, or quick-and-dirty text manipulation.

But while navigating, you're rarely working, right? :^D

Not much of an issue hopefully, but from my understanding VC++ is not 100% ANSI C++ compliant.  I think he needed something portable across devkitARM and other compilers.  In most cases it would be, but there are some strange things you can do in VC++ that won't compile in g++, from my understanding.  For examples, I would have to search around, but I have come across them.  Perhaps they are more adherent to the standard now ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is there any compiler out there (apart from perhaps Comeau) that is is 100% ANSI C++ compliant, really? VC++ is standard compliant enough for most practical purposes. I'm not 100% up to the latest C++ compliance stats in gcc, but VC++ was generally better at standard-compliance than GCC a couple of years ago at least.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But do you think that gcc/g++ differ in allowable language/grammar sets?

If not doing anything strange, shouldn't be too bad to port around.    I am not sure, also, if porting compilers around changes the grammar they are using, but I would hope it shouldn't.

Friends of templated classes are declared in a different way than other compilers.  Visual C++ 6.0 sometimes fails to generate warnings or errors in cases where you forget to make a 'const' version of a method, and use it with a constant reference.
