    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You don't have enough memory on the PC. Make the swap file bigger. GCC uses vast, titanic amounts of memory (I've had a single compile consume more than 400MB of ram before, with an 80kb source file).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In GBA programming, the most likely cause of a GCC "Virtual memory exhausted" error message is trying to compile a huge pre-initialized C array. These often result when you convert a raw binary file to source code for a C array. 
<br/>
<br/>
There exist two workarounds:<ol type="a"><li>Use a binary file to assembly language converter (one that outputs .s). I've written one of those; e-mail me if you want source code and/or a win32 binary.</li><li>Use appended data. Many users on this forum swear by my <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#gbfs" target="_blank">GBFS</a> library for accessing appended data. However, appended data is not compatible with source-level debugging because it works only with binary images produced with objcopy, not with .elf files.</li></ol><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had the same problem recently when trying to compile a massive file that had one huge array in it, in fact it was the whole of "Hey Ladies" by The Beastie Boys, and I ended up having to set my virtual memory maximum to 3GB (under WinXP) to get it to compile, and then it took an hour to do anyway. I was watching a memory monitor program while it was compiling and devkitadv used nearly all of that memory.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

Version 2.0 now up - guaranteed at least 100% more pleasing!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In at least the R4 distribution of DKA for Windows, you must unpack and apply the winpatch archive (can't remember the exact name) <span style="font-style: italic">after</span> all of the other archives are unpacked in the the DKA directory. If it isn't unpacked and applied to the DKA directory last, compiling a project will result in the error you describe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
