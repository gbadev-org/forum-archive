I started my current job as junior programmer (as I'd come straight out of uni), and I know a couple of ex-juniors.
<br/>
Here's my experience of the role:
<br/>
- you'll write the same code as everyone else
<br/>
- you won't be trusted with difficult stuff
<br/>
- you won't get to know about the slightly more classified stuff
<br/>
- you won't get to play with 'rare' hardware
<br/>
- you'll have to listen to people who are more experienced than you, even if they're talking complete rubbish
<br/>
- ...on the flip side they're normally right
<br/>
- people will rarely depend on you
<br/>
- you'll get the lowst pay of all the programmers, but still more than everyone else :-)
<br/>
<br/>
The secret I found to getting promoted is to make yourself indispensible and show a passion for what you do...but again on the flip side you can get a bit pigeon-holed for certain roles :-(
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: btw many juniors are still juniors after their first year...some can be for even two years<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is with any professional career.  You need to be valuable to the company, but not to the point they will not promote you because they can't replace you.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It also really depends on the place where you're working.  If it's a bigger place, you'll get the boring, tedious work to start.  A smaller place is more likely to use "junior" just to mean that they're hiring someone with less experience for a lower paying job, but you still might get cool work.
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, like the other posters said, if you do really great work, they'll keep heaping more and more interesting stuff your way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
