    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought it from him with the passme for only $8...he said it was 2GB, and he bought it that way, so I bought it just for the pass device. Turns out he just bought the dock and bought a card, and he bought the best...A SanDisk Ultra II 1.0GB card. I won't be using the MMP much anymore in favor of my GBAMPv2, but that card sure was worth it.<br/>_________________<br/>867-530<span style="font-weight: bold">9</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
