    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One thing I've noticed since I've started reading here, is the rapid decline of GBA posting compared to the DS.  This is kind of common sense since the DS is current, &amp; the GBA quickly disappears from the shelfs.
<br/>
<br/>
So, my question then, since the url is GBAdev, what'll happen when GBA development stops?  I know it'll always have a trickle of interest, as the nes/snes systems still have some developers making games &amp; apps.  But the reality is, it'll come close to dead, eventually.  Will the site &amp; forums change urls, or will it co-exist with another site?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dunno about you guys, but I sometimes enjoy the gba games more than the DS ones. It isn't that I don't like the DS games, it is simply that some games just don't need a touch screen to be fun, and it slows down gameplay if you try to encorperate the touch screen too much. My guess is, as tepples said, as long as there is a gba slot on new nintendo products, people will keep making stuff for it.<br/>_________________<br/>w00</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">rofl, this may be true, but there are lots of good qualities to NDS and GBA. If I had to choose between my DSL and my GBA, I would first laugh because I have both and it doesn't even matter, and then I would choose the DSL. They got me with wifi play, but it is sad that I can't play my favorite old color and pocket games on it. Oh well, nobody does full backwards compat these days anyways (although the wii gets dang close with its downloadable classics).<br/>_________________<br/>w00</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
