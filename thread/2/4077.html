    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">recently my hard drive died out of a sudden. and i didn't follow the one magical rule: always do backups!
<br/>
the last time i didn't have to much time for GBA dev, so i didn't update the backups regularly. in fact, they old ones got lost somewhere (on a floppy *narf*) and theres absolutely zero left of my work. was nothing special to show off, but a nice little GBA dev api written in C++ (OOP) i put much effort in.
<br/>
now what to do? start again? ok, i still got the knowledge and some documentation, but it would take a some time to redo everything and doing things twice is not funny, indeed...
<br/>
or just trash it and start with SDL/OpenGL? actually my intention on the GBA was only to write the little api and maybe one or two little games, before i go somewhere else anyways...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Redo all the stuff is indeed a pain. If you have a good documentation it should not take that much time but it's still boring to do the same stuff you already did.

But shit happens and we can only learn for the future if such things happen to us. You should consider backing up against a cvs repository in the future.
<br/>
Create a repository on a second computer or a second HD or use <a href="https://www.freepository.com" target="_blank">https://www.freepository.com</a>
<br/>
Eclipse is great with C/C++ and brings internal CVS support. No external programms needed just checkin the work.
