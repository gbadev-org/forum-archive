    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello!  I have read the docs and FAQ with PogoShell but still cannot figure out how to get it to work properly with the GBA wallet.  I have read articles that say it works great with it, but they offered no instruction.  Any links or info into using would be appreciated.
