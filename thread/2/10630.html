My point is the following: <ol type="1"><li>Gbadev.org exists to promote homebrew software development for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS systems. </li><li>Gbadev.org administration has configured phpBB to be incompatible with text based web browsers. </li><li>Between the time the policy was instituted until a few days ago, the only available Nintendo DS compatible web browser was a text based web browser. </li><li>By 2 and 3, gbadev.org administration has configured phpBB to be incompatible with all known DS compatible web browsers. </li></ol> Hypocrisy?

EDIT: It's not hypocrisy as long as one can use ndsmail to contact an administrator.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Links, in my Linux experience has been fine with logging in etc (it also has a graphical mode if you really want it) - unlike retaqw on my DS

anyhow, the bugmenot user clearly wasn't posting from his DS :p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
