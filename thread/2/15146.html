Due to the fact that i'm not very good at programming I have beeen trying to make it using the unregistered version of XtenDS. I will attatch the graphics I have created so far for people who would like to use them.
<br/>
<br/>
Now here is what I need to do this project:
<br/>
<br/>
I will be glad to help somebody with graphics if they need, but I would rather do this project on my own. I have no access to a credit card so I cannot purchase the full version of XtenDS. I would like it if somebody could supply me with what i need to use the program. In Other words, the registration material. 
<br/>
<br/>
(I don' want to infer anything illegal)
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if the graphics uploaded correctly so use this rapidshare link:

First of all, you don't need a credit card to buy with a credit card. In many countries, you can get a debit card, which acts like a credit card but takes money out of a checking account instead of adding debt. So I have a few questions:
<br/>
<ol type="a"><li>How old are you? </li><li>Do you have the cash? </li><li>You didn't fill out the Location field in <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/profile.php?mode=editprofile" target="_blank">your profile</a>. Where do you live, so that other people in your country can help explain how you can get a checking account and debit card? </li></ol><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
