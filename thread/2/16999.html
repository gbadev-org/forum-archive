    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's basically because people perceive C++ as bloated, and under default build settings, it is.
<br/>
<br/>
To un-bloat C++:
<br/>
Get rid of any IOSTREAM stuff.  Other STL libraries are okay, such as Vector.
<br/>
Use libsupc++ instead of libstdc++
<br/>
Disable exception handling and Run time type identification.  (Virtual methods are a different story, those are okay.)
<br/>
Find some garbage the compiler sticks in there, such as __EABI_ATEXIT, and make a blank function to override it.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree with Miked0801.  You need to figure programmer time into your cost benefit analysis.  (Cost: Resources == Food == Money == Time)
<br/>
<br/>
Are you even going to finish your project?  If so, will you run out of space in the process?  What have you written already?  Will you need to rewrite it after you "un-bloat"?  Would you rather use the time for an extra feature or bug squashing?  Every situation is different.  Only you can answer these questions for yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
I think that in most cases you can just write your program and it will work.  If it does not work, it may be too ambitious for the hardware.  If you write portable but "bloated" code, chances are you will be able to adapt it to the next hardware cycle with minimal changes.  There are some cases where you do <span style="font-weight: bold">need</span> to squeeze everything you can out of the current hardware.  You are probably <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> that guy.  Those positions tend to pay a lot.
<br/>
<br/>
You can probably describe the macro level goals for your project in a couple of sentences.  Do not futz around with things that do not get you to your goals.  Your journey will take you to unexpected places even if you try to get there ASAP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Does it help to declare your public interface as extern "C", or do the link errors arise from within the library itself (or something it depends on)?

<br/>
Agreed about or'ing enums.  C++ pretends that enums are a "strong" type, but they are hardly that -- it's a sort of half-assed safety.  Oh well, minor syntactic issue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I experimented with "proper" OOP years ago, and reached the same conclusion as you, wintermute -- ultimately, it's a lot of jumping through hoops.  I really believe the best approach is to accumulate a large mental toolkit, and solve problems as they come, using any combination of the tools you have.  The kinds of problems I'm thinking of are:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">I don't know how to get the computer to do what I want:</span> Many programmers regard this as the only "real" problem, but it's actually the easiest one, usually solvable by looking for code snippets on google... unless you are <span style="font-style: italic">at</span> Google.  ;)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">It's hard to tell if my code is really correct, or if it just happens to be working right now:</span> Good code obviously has no mistakes.  Bad code has no obvious mistakes.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">I'm spending a lot of time in the debugger:</span> You know what's better than debugging?  Not writing bugs.  Closely related to the previous problem.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Making this code cleaner will also make it slower:</span> This is something I ran into a lot in C.  Of all the languages I've used, C++ is the best for writing code that's fast <span style="font-style: italic">and</span> good (though this may change as it gradually gets harder to write fast C++ for newer platforms).
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">I have a lot of code that isn't solving a unique problem:</span> Whereas OOP generates tons of boilerplate, free-form use of C++ features can shorten your code, especially initialization, cleanup, and minor variations on a theme.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Memory leaks and dangling pointers suck:</span> Ok, abstract over them, and never write one again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#172023 - vuurrobin - Sun Jan 10, 2010 1:48 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">one of the biggest problems programmers have when they go from c to c++ (or simular languages) is the whole mentallity/paradigm shift. what they can do good and fast in the old paradigm, will be difficult when doing it in a new paradigm because they simply aren't used to the paradigm. they may end up going back to the old paradigm because of this.
<br/>
<br/>
if you don't get the paradigm/idea behind OOP, then it can feel like you are running around in circles. but if you learn what OOP is really about, then you'll see that it becomes alot easier and better, and you may even use the ideas when you aren't writing OOP.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">however</span>, OOP isn't better than sliced bread. it doesn't solve all problems and it doesn't prevent someone from writing bad code. if you are a bad programmer, then you will write bad code. depending on the language, the paradigm, the framework and the techniques, the code may be less bad (or the bad code will have less bad results), but the code will be bad. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The single most biggest factor in writing good code is the programmer.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
like sajiimori says, a good programmer has a mental toolkit filled with solutions, tools and techniques and knows how to use the right solution for the right problem. with solutions, tools and techniques I think of programming languages, paradigms, algoritms, coding techniques, project techniques like agile development, design- document- and testing tools/techniques, common solutions like design patterns, ect. if the programmer knows and understands different kind of tools, then he/she will be able to choose the right kind of tool for the right problem.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
@sajiimori, those problems can be solved with choosing the right technique.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">I don't know how to get the computer to do what I want:</span> if the problem is generic enough, then look if the language has something to help or look for libraries. if the problem isn't generic, then search if someone had a simular problem or ask someone with more experience/discuss it with someone with equal experience to see if you can solve it togetter. this useally becomes smaller when having more experience and google will help in most cases.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">It's hard to tell if my code is really correct, or if it just happens to be working right now:</span> then use asserts to check if the state of the program is what you expect it to be and/or write testcases (unit testing) to see if your code works in different situations.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">I'm spending a lot of time in the debugger:</span> then use an other testing technique, like asserts or unit testing (like above)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Making this code cleaner will also make it slower:</span> then look at what is more important. does the code needs to be fast and is the speed increase significant? will the code be updated alot? can comments properly explain the code and the desision. will the 'unclean' code be contaminated to this part? ect.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">I have a lot of code that isn't solving a unique problem:</span> then try to solve the problem without code. if you have the solution, then it will be easier to put the solution into code.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Memory leaks and dangling pointers suck:</span> then use a technique that will automaticly solve that for you, whether that is a smart pointer like auto_ptr or a complete garbage collection system.

Interesting article by Charles Petzold, especially the closing paragraphs where he starts talking about "dealing with real problems".
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that there are many schools of thought in programming; I myself suffer in some areas and am strong in others. But studying various design patterns and learning where they can be used best will help a lot. Once you know how to operate classes it's just a matter of building up your arsenal of structures that best communicate what you are doing.
<br/>
<br/>
It's just like writing; once you've got past the basic mechanics of the English language you can then move on to the deeper use of rhetorical methods and NLP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This isn't true in all disciplines. In embedded C is used drastically more than C++ (or anything else), and as time goes on this has been becoming more true instead of less. Embedded can't be sneezed at either, there are billions of embedded CPUs in the wild and most of them are running C code. The thing is, a lot of them are being programmed by electrical/computer engineers instead of software engineers/computer scientists. Still, having a programming degree doesn't prevent you from getting an embedded job. On the other end of the spectrum, I think Java and C# will help you more than C++. C++ is really being kind of outmoded in a lot of market sectors.
<br/>
<br/>
I think that the comment of being able to develop faster in C++ is much too generalized. It depends what you're doing, how large your team is, your own personal education and experience, and your particular preferences and comfort levels.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sorry, but I think we are mixing two distinct things... C and C++ is a thing, but lots of people there think of "bloated with lot of useless libraries" when thinking of C++ which is quite different... you can have some C++ code just as clean as standard C with the addition of templates and all theses little great additions...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

...yeah, but a lot of embedded systems doesn't HAVE a C++ compiler, so you'll get nowhere with your templates there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
