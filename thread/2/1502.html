Maybe someone can start making CartMags for gba like the DiskMags for Amiga. I would do it my self if I knew how to do it and knew the scene, but I'm just a newbie and don't know anyone or anything.

<br/>
Think about it!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Erhm... I think very little diskmags are still active. They come from the days that almost nobody had access to the internet and so people swapped floppies... So diskmags are pretty much dead (If somebody can prove me wrong I'd like to hear that!)
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I doubt whether a lot of people would actually write 'em to a flashcart and read them "riding the bus or hanging out on a bench in the park"...

One could use a 16 by 16 pixel font.  (14 by 14 in reality.)
