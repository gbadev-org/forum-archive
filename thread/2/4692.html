    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know that this site for people skilled/interested in making games for the GBA, but it is the only mature GBA site I can find. I was hoping someone on here could point me in the direction of a Fan Base site please. I'm looking to buy a custom GBA and I doubt there will be a site dedicated to that; but any help is greatly appreciated.

I don't know about any GBA fan sites, in particular.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">By custom GBA I meant more like a refined machine. 
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted an original GBA with an Afterburner fitted, a rechargeable battery that suited the design of the GBA, not just an ugly grey '4player' pack tapped to the back.  And the GBA Movie player incorporated into the design. I know it can be done, but I also know I can't do it.

Edit: Also, those designer skins look realy cheap and crap.

Sory I wasn't trying to be mean, I'm just suprised that you like them.<br/>_________________<br/>If something I have written doesn?t make sense, or is spelt incorrectly; I apologize.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Jake on Sat Dec 25, 2004 1:29 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
