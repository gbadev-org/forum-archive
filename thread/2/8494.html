Can you explain what segment and offset are? 0400h(segment) would be the physical area that the data was stored and 0000h(offset) would be the number of bits you want to move that data(like 0400:0000 &lt;&lt; 1 = 0400:0001?)?

0x4000000 is equal to 0400:0000? Also, what is that 'x' for in 0x4000000?

Yes, I'm talking about GBA IO registers(sorry I didn't specify), so it works different on computers(GBA is the first hardware programming I've done)?

Thanks for the reply.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In the case of GBA programming, the 4:4 notation has the exact same meaning as the full 8 digits. Just think of the colon as a marker to split 32 bits into two 16-bit segments.
<br/>
<br/>
The main thing to keep aware of is that your C compiler only recognizes the 0x04000000 format - that is, 0x followed by a string of digits.

Oh yeah, I've used it enough with example programs to know that. I just
<br/>
wanted to know the specifics of reading it.

0x4000000, 04000000h, 0400:0000, &amp;H04000000 are all the same number, just different notations. '0x' is the hex prefix in C (and some assemblers), 'h' is the hex affix in some assemblers, '&amp;H' is the hex prefix for VB, and so on. The reason I usually use the colon is because it reads easier. You can quickly lose a zero in the others.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, thanks Cearn..... again :). Using the colon (semicolon is ';' ;) ) does make it a lot easier to read. Didn't even think of that as being the reason. Oh well, now I know.
