<br/>
<br/>
     Recently, Pokemon black and white was released in Japan. Now Nintendo has somehow made it so that pirated versions of the game cannot have the characters level up. Also, some other DS games have this kind of protection(Love Plus I think).
<br/>
<br/>
     Is this protection hard coded into the game? Meaning the pirated version and the original version is the same and it just somehow detects that an illegal cart is used? I'm kinda curious as to how they achieved this.<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When you run a game off a flash cartridge, the game is heavily patched and modified a whole lot to make it read from the flash device's storage card instead of an actual DS cartridge.  It's really easy to detect such modifications.
<br/>
<br/>
If a hypothetical flash cartridge actually included extra hardware to simulate how an NDS card operates, and run the game without patching, then the game could not detect that it was a pirate version that way.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
That surprises me rather a lot actually. Pretty much all of the flashcards employ patching to run commercial games so some targeted checksumming should, in theory, catch pirates in the act.
<br/>
<br/>
Are there statistics somewhere that suggest Europeans pirate more than Americans btw?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Is it the same for PC games? Like batman arkham asylum? One part is unplayable if you have a pirated version. Although I don't think those are patched<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what I've heard from our European publishers is that Piracy is so rampant in Europe that they are not even bothering to port some games.  I was told a story about brick and mortar stores in spain that sell flashcards that come with hundreds of ROMs already on them.  I know that things aren't that bad here.
<br/>
<br/>
And any copy protection scheme can be broken with time and knowledge.  Developers only have a limited amount of time and resources to work on copy protection whilst the public has unlimited time and resources in comparison.  All copy protection is supposed to do is discourage the average person.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I really wish they'd link sources instead of either copying verbatim or oversummarising (is it just me or is there no happy medium?)

Interestingly Iwata says that Art Academy topped the charts in Spain despite the rampant piracy there. Perhaps poor sales are due to something else ...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
