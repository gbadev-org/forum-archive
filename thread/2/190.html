    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello people, I'm new here, but I have a question of anyone can answer it. I thinking of getting the flash advance2 to upload my demos that I have created, but I read something about using GBAFix to verify the headers or something like that. So is it Imparative that I get this GBAFix, or can I just upload my demos to my gba and it will work??

Any help would be great..

Thanks,

Yes, you need gbafix or something similiar. You just run it on your bin or gba file and it fixes up the "cart" header to the format the gba is expecting. Without it your file won't work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Probably does :)  not got one of those so I always have to go the gbafix option,  maybe theres an newer version of the flash linker software I use that would do it automatically too (the amount of times I've forgotten and uploaded a huuuuuge file to the cart  arghhhh)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
