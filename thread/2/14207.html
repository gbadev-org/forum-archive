    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you mean by disc image where you create a false drive to load a CD image or you have a limited virtual drive I would think Alochol 120% or MagicalISO. I think Nero also has a built in version of this.
<br/>
<br/>
With MagicalISO you can litterially access the files on the IMG you created. Take for example you want to install a program but it is in image form and there fore you need to waste a disc.
<br/>
<br/>
MagicalISO and Winrar can access the data inside a ISO but Magical can do it much better. However I have not done this in a long time so I am unsure if installing.
<br/>
<br/>
However for a drive image I am unsure how to go along with it since it is a image of a format.  I would check the Msfn forums about this. In terms of a format image I would probably take that drive image and merge it with another same type of format image.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh right, well judging by the responses I would guess that your latest post is much more informative than the first; bearing in mind the typical uses of virtual drives. I'm thinking Paragon, which (to my memory) wasn't free and the demo was (again to my memory) non functional.

What do you mean by "free"? Do you mean libre or gratis?
<br/>
<br/>
Out on a limb, but have you tried a virtualization product such as one from the VMware or Microsoft Virtual PC product lines? You could install Windows or especially Linux into a virtual machine and then have the VM mount a disk image as a drive.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

you could use the set of tools i put together to create FCSR images, just alter the build.bat file to not patch the header etc.
<br/>
<br/>
get it from my left nav bar under tools. It uses a tool that was create by winimage to create the image but realeased under a different license.
<br/>
<br/>
That will at least get you the image created, not sure how you go about mounting it though.
