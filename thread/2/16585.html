    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"On paper, the DSi boasts a significant processing speed boost over its predecessor, jumping from 67 MHz in the DS Lite to 133 MHz in the DSi, but during our evaluations actual speed variations between the two were negligible."
<br/>
<br/>
"Like we experienced with the DSi's CPU speed enhancements, the benefits of the expanded RAM are hardly noticeable despite being four times that of the DS Lite."
<br/>
<br/>
Wonder what evaluation software he is running...is he actually saying that he saw any difference, whether negligable or not, between DS software processing on the Lite and i? Heh.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree though, I think they should have improved almost everything else first.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

hehe, no more streaming... you can simply load all your assets at once, isn't that marvelous? :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yep, I had that in mind. I was thinking of the card access penalty. It's a shame that all the bottlenecks seem to be the same.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Why improve bottlenecks when you can just make the numbers bigger?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
