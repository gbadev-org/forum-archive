    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First you'll need a GBA flash cart with a real-time clock so that the GBA knows what time it is. M3 and Flash2Advance Ultra appear to have RTC; SuperCard and F2A classic appear not to.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, you'll need a lot of battery power in order to keep the CPU going so that it can periodically check the RTC. <a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm#biosfunctionsummary" target="_blank">GBATEK</a> states that timers cannot wake the GBA from sleep mode; only the serial port, the gamepad, and the Game Pak IRQ can. The only other low-power state on the GBA is the one that IntrWait() uses. It stops the CPU, but the LCD is still turned on.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
