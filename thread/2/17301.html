    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I run my roms through the (snezzi) converter file by putting them in the same folder (per instructions), and thendragging it onto the snezziDS.exe file. Thus creating "Gamename.nds"
<br/>
Then, I take that .nds file and place it on my flashcard (DSTT).
<br/>
<br/>
And I start my DS, select "Gamename.nds", and... nothing happens, it loads halfway and then freezes.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I realize that the original program was for converting SNES games to GBA.. and it used a GBA flashcart.
<br/>
Does snezziDS require the games to be run from a GBA flashcart too, or am I doing something wrong?
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried several roms, and none of them are working by using snezziDS.
<br/>
snesDS works well with some games, but there are a few I really want on my DS that it won't work with.
<br/>
<br/>
So, if someone could help me out, I'd appreciate it.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to play Alien vs Predator &amp; Final Fight 3 on my DS. :-(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Any recommendations on a model to purchase or a retailer?
<br/>
Not to many folks carrying them any more.  :-/

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A quicker solution is to try SNEmulDS.  It uses the same core engine as SnezziDS but is much improved, and works on all devices.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
