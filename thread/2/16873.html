I need to be able to draw lines. I just noticed that SDL can't draw primitives without another library. I know allegro can, and I have some experience with it. Would it be possible to draw the allegro primitives inside my SDL window? Can someone give me an example of how to set that up?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
