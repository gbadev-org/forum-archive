    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I started Paradroid (the c64 one not ugly 90 hehe) as the 1st thing I did on gba.  Got the main sprite controllable with collisions, the doors working (animating) and a couple of other sprites following paths (pausing at doors till they opened etc), only 1 level in there but I ripped the gfx from the gba and just need to create the rest of the maps for those.  Would need firing, some ai for the enemy and the game logic and "bonus" game writing to finish it.
<br/>
<br/>
I could probably drop someone the source if I can find it (did it a long time ago), but it's probably ugly and was basically a test to learn gba hardware so it probably does things all the wrong way ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm, that sounds like it has potential there Splam. Perhaps I could do some graphics ripping/maps for you and maybe finish it off?
<br/>
<br/>
..or we could just wait for Splam 64! ;) How is that project going btw? Are you gonna finish it in time for the comp. There are some damn good prizes for it, and I reakon a 64 emu would be a good contender esp. since they are accepting emu's.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Probably won't have time to finish paradroid myself as I'm veeery busy.  Same kind of goes for c64 emu, I'm working on it when I can and it's basically waiting for a rewrite of the processor emulation to give it a speed boost but thats they type of thing I want to do in one go not start and have to stop to do other work.  Would be nice to enter it into the compo but I'm not really that bothered about prizes etc.  Got Splam!2600 as well, which is about 80% finished  hehe  ah well</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thats a shame you don't have time to finish the C64 emu, I was really looking forward to it.
<br/>
<br/>
I never played the first Paradroid, only the Amiga version - Paradroid 90 - which I thought was really good.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW Do you use gcc Splam?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">c64 emu WILL get finished asap :) I'm just don't have time to guarentee it will be done in time for the compo.
<br/>

I was a bit dissapointed with Paradroid 90 after being such a massive fan of the c64 version.  Graphics were more complex but imho lost the charm that the c64 version had AND no 8 way scrolling,  tsk,  bad Braybrook :P
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I use gcc.  Even though the compiler is a bit poor it's used by Nintendo so it's the most compatible to create libs with and I write mostly in asm these days so the compiled Cs performance doesn't matter much to me.  I did really miss incbin in the assembler (as) but I've just added ELF output to my tools so now I don't even need to go through the objcopy shennanigans to create a linkable raw file, especially if it needs to be aligned.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
