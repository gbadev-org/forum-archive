    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was at uni and some guys were playing DS. I've only played sonic for about 10 seconds when my cousin brought one round so I am yet to play anything that uses touch screen.
<br/>
<br/>
So anyway the guy says that he's got a couple of games on his *** device; and I'm like, "oh some homebrew stuff right?". "Yes", "I've seen a few shots of this stuff but I've never had a chance to play them, didn't think you were into that". "Yes", he replies, "want a go?".
<br/>
<br/>
So after following his instructions I went into what I thought was homebrew games, and I have no idea what he thought homebrew meant, but he had animal crossing on it, and I'm sure the rest were commercial games. He even told me that he had the metroid prime demo aswell; but I really was unaware that piracy had already reached the DS.

From what I have read hacker/cracker/pirate/warez people tend to be insecure {plural-insulting-noun} who have nothing better to do than feed their egos by attaining and distributing stolen data.

Evidently the head of some European cracking group (forgot the name) got off on being sent to jail for credit card fraud.  Maybe that floats his boat, but I don't know why these people don't do something productive.  What does the guy's mother think?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">People that gain from piracy are inclined to think it is acceptable.  The line is fuzzy.  Where you draw it depends on what your values are and whether or not you have a reason to care about piracy.  People losing money from piracy are inclined to think it is evil.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the DS firmware...<ul>A) Personal firmware updates = no money.
<br/>
B) "I'll update the firmware for you" by mail = no real money.
<br/>
C) Mass produced modified units = money, but I don't know how big the market is.</ul>A is under the radar.  B is probably under the radar.  I would shut down C.
<br/>
<br/>
If Nintendo wanted users to have that functionality, they would have provided it in the first place.  Budget and schedule do cause commercial features to be cut from products, but that is obviously not the case when it comes to the DS firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
Then again, there are few alternatives for DS homebrew.  Where you draw the line is personal choice.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Blanket statements are silly.  "Big businesses are evil."  All of them?  Do think that because they harm you or because someone you respect said they are evil?  What is "evil" to you?
<br/>
<br/>
Again, this all depends on your values and what you have to gain or lose.  If you have something to lose from big businesses (like your store), you would be inclined to think they are evil.  If you have something to gain (like a job) you would be inclined to think they are good.
<br/>
<br/>
Big businesses generally attempt to make as much money as possible while maintaining a coherent and positive image.  There is nothing inherently wrong with this unless you believe that money or image is evil.  Making an impact on the world without money or image can be done, but is difficult.
<br/>
<br/>
Big businesses, and big organizations in general are too big to be completely evil.  They are also too big to be completely good:
<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft small software companies out of business.  Clearly evil.
<br/>
Microsoft employs a whole lot of people.  Clearly good.
<br/>
We could list what makes greenpeace good and evil.
<br/>
<br/>
"Evil" is ultimately a silly term marks something as completely black.  Rarely is the world so simple.  More specific words convey more accurate meanings.  Talking about evil would require a clear definition and wants another thread.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i know i bought a xbox for the fact it was easy to mod and pirate for sure i pirated 4 games burnout3,halo2,gtaVC and Gun, but i ended up buying burnout revenge and gtaSA because i liked the games predecessors and i bought halo2 to play on live  while gun underwhelmed me and i dont play it that much.
<br/>
sure im a pirate but without me being a pirate i wouldn't have found xbox media center which is its primary function now i haven't played a pirated or legit game in months and the only other recent thing i did was install quake3 for a lan party
<br/>
piracy helps regardless of what it is your pirating
<br/>
for example
<br/>
usually companies ditch old consoles,computers,electronics ect. that they cant sell after a few years of a successor being released.
<br/>
so instead of MS loosing product cost on my console, i bought it saving them some cost and games i didnt pay for either wern't worth it or made me buy the successor or the product for extra features i lacked.
<br/>
another example is look at the music indusry ever since the napster boom sales have gone up or the vcr the mpaa said that would kill sales and it also did the opposite
<br/>
another example is years ago when i was in school i pirated photoshop but guess what i only know its layout so when i get a job as a graphics designer guess what il request my boss buy that right, photoshop
<br/>
now in university i pirate cause eating is more important than playing but il still probably pirate for the ds il also run more homebrew because it seems like a big sell point and unlike the xbox i was introduced to homebrew before piracy
<br/>
piracy aside i managed to buy 2 copies of diablo2+expan a few years back because it had multiplayer i could use with a friend that way
<br/>
people pay for worthy features
<br/>
<br/>
i guess to sum up my miniature rant of the day
<br/>
1)piracy helps there much proof of this but only anecdotal evidence of the contrary(just cause someone pirates doesnt mean they would buy it maybe cause they're cheap or actually cant aford it ect.) so you dont loose sales and the original owner doesn't lose possession so its not stealing
<br/>
2)it opens the doors to legitimate things eg XBMC other homebrew
<br/>
3)predisposes them to it so they end up paying in the long run
<br/>
<br/>
so the statement "From what I have read hacker/cracker/pirate/warez people tend to be insecure {plural-insulting-noun} who have nothing better to do than feed their egos by attaining and distributing stolen data. "
<br/>
is false that seems like just the media portrayal of"hacker/cracker/pirate/warez people" and doesn't at all represent the real thing</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Especially if nobody sells that software anymore. It is true they (probably) won't lose sales, but it probably is unethical anyways if you could purchase the software instead, and especially if you steal the software and use it for commercial usage. (Someone I know convinced the company that makes CoolEdit, a audio edit program, to give them a registered copy for free, and they will pay when they find a commercial use for it.)
<br/>
<br/>
It is still better to avoid piracy if possible but FlashMe may be piracy as well, and it is many used. But anyways, that isn't really stealing either because only people who have the NDS and the original code can use it anyways<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What does that have to do with getting off with credit card fraud?

no,

blocking wifime does not help against piracy,

it actually helps piracy...

because then more people were forced to buy flashcarts and most of them can run roms,

wifime could only transfer homebrew (and demos...)

now more people can run illegeal or backup copies of games...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">
