    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It just ocurred to me that it would be extremely fun to be able to play Hexic HD on my DS, and I was just wondering if anyone has cloned that yet. I play it a lot on my Xbox 360, and would be very grateful if someone could point me to a link. If nobody has made it yet, I guess I will have to keep on waiting or learn enough to make it myself, lol.

Thanks in advance =)
