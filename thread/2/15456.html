Although some of the stuff on sf (<a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=143208" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=143208</a>) looks vaguely useful. When people make a new N64 emulator, do they just RE the hardware themselves every time?

I've been reading this fat MIPS book on the tube every morning and I'm itching to write some code! If anyone is in the market for a good MIPS I'd defo recommend "See MIPS Run" however the version I've got is a bit old now.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
ha, that makes me think of nintendo not allowing the devs to modify some stuff (the graphics microcode!)
<br/>
<br/>
"Conker's Bad Fur Day" (the name, the name! awesomo?! [if you have animals, you know what "bad fur" means!]) reached the quality it had by slightly breaking that restriction. that, along with other "hacks", allowed it to have pretty nice and crisp textures and very good graphics while performing very well. &lt;- i guess this is totally wrong, never the less, CBFD's gfx kicked ass!
<br/>
<br/>
the game i meant was Indiana Jones. look it up in wikipedia. &lt;lol&gt; ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
that was kind of like with the nds' default arm7 binary (afaik - i'm not an offical dev, so i only have access to publicly available info ;^D ). dev's aren't allowed to use custom binaries in their products. (?)
<br/>
<br/>
yagcd is, although incomplete, a nice doc! thanks! :^)
<br/>
<br/>
you know what i suspect? there might not be enough legal doc for the n64... imagine what i might have written next. ;^(
<br/>
<br/>
the ps1 also had a mips cpu... wow. just found that out by googling. :^) i guess the ps1 is better documented than the n64, if that's an option (and it's a custom 3000 series based cpu, instead of a 4300.) ;^D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The PS1 was actually fun to code for.  GTE sub-processor with the R3000 meant you could do all sorts of interleaved CPU coding for nice speed gains.  Setup 3 dot products against 1 vectors and dot all 3 with 1 matrix call while setting up the collision code on the result.  etc.  Good fun.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sadly, it seems that gbatek stands far above what is availiable for most consoles.

There are a number of examples provided which illustrate various aspects of libogc in the same way we do with libnds. These are in the process of being expanded.
<br/>
<br/>
Trying to program a gamecube or a Wii at the same kind of level you program a DS or a GBA is really not for the faint of heart. It can be done but the process will take years if you're starting from limited experience.
<br/>
<br/>
Knowing the hardware is a necessity on low spec platforms and for those writing support libraries which provide access to features provided by the low level hardware. For someone writing a game as a hobbyist it's likely to lead to intense frustration.
<br/>
<br/>
If you <span style="font-weight: bold">want</span> to know the hardware as a general interest thing then that's a different matter but the acquisition of the knowledge required to understand the hardware of modern consoles is something that's going to require a lot of dedication.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah, that's right. i don't intend to program for the ngc, yet. it's my favorite console and i'm very interested in it's internal workings, as i know that nintendo had good hw designs in the past. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
i know it takes a *big*load of time to learn one of the "bigger" consoles... maybe after i master enough of the pc and nds platforms, dunno. ;^D
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the info on libogc. i have downloaded it several times, but had never actually looked at it (and the examples). as i said, i'm only interested in the design. :^D
