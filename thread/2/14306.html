    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey,
<br/>
<br/>
I was recently looking for my entry to PDroms Compo 3.33 and couldn't find the source or binaries for it anywhere on my computer/backups. I visited pdroms.de and it's currently under construction. After searching around for awhile I found out about pdroms.org and looked around there but it's not added yet I guess. Anyways I was hoping someone on here might have the zipfile of the entries somewhere on their hard drive. The specific rom i'm looking for is called SubAttack by The Black Frog :)
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has this or knows where I could get it plese don't hesitate to contact me by e-mail (blackfrog AT gmail DOT com) or on irc (BlackFrog on EFnet).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had a similar problem with losing the code (and art assets) to my PDRoms compo entry. So although I have the game I don't have the code, which is quite depressing (despite its simplicity)!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
