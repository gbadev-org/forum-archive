    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am just wondering if there is a way to set some sort of home file on the Msys so that I don't have to navigate to devkitPro every time I want to compile something. I forgot to save it to the C drive and put it on the desktop instead, so it is now a hassle to navigate to. I tried to move the folder, but I think that made my new vista mad at me, lol.

All you have to do is run make in the standard cmd, if everyting is set up correctly. ;^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">alright, so you guys are saying that:
<br/>
1. I should use the regular command prompt (which didn't work on my old computer, as I had 2 compilers, it should work on this one now that I think of it...)
<br/>
2. Save my projects to the C drive and *not* in the DevkitPRO folder.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks guys, will do. Makes sense now that I think of it, lol.<br/>_________________<br/>w00</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think* that the "proper" configuration would be to put the the msys binaries in your path, but not the devkitARM binary folder, then you have access to all the "standard" tools like make from your regular command prompt.  
<br/>
<br/>
Then, make sure you have the devkitPro  environment variable set correctly, and in your gba or ds project makefiles, use this variable to call the devkitARM binaries when building your projects. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you do it this way, having 2 compilers shouldn't cause any problems.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have devkitPro installed on C:\ and my projects are all on another drive.
<br/>
It's just important that the paths don't include spaces (but depending on your configuration it might work.)
<br/>
<br/>
devkitPro's updater aready does quite a good job setting up your environment. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
All I then do, is set up a compiler setting for devkitARM in Code::Blocks, which tells the IDE where to find each program (gcc, make [which should be in Msys\bin, iIrc] etc.) and then I can just provide a standard libnds example makefile, press "compile" and "It works! (tm)" ;^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released
