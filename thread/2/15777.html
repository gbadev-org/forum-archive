    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone else have this problem? Despite ticking the "Log me in automatically" checkbox, every now and then (like once a day maybe) I still find myself logged out and having to log in manually again. Bit of a drag. Any hints?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As for privacy and anti-ad, I'm a devout worshiper of AdblockPlus, SpybotS&amp;D, Spywareblaster, and AdAware. AdblockPlus shouldn't be able to affect this issue though, and I only run the others once a week so I guess they're not to blame either.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The URL contained an argument named "sid" or "id" or some such. Removing it appears to have solved my problems.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
