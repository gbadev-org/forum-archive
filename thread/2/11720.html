    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone, I was wondering if anyone could tell me of a simple, free java ide? I use Dr. Java now, but sometime it screws up and I just lost a days work of school work. I have Eclipse for large project, but I am looking for something a little simpler. Something as simple as Dr. Java, but with less bugs. I don't what to have to setup a project everytime I do a single class file for my class. I just want to be able to go in type it up, compile it, and be on my way. So, nothing to fancy, please.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For keeping your data safe CVS and SVN are good, as tepples recommended, although you'll want to read up on how to use them if it's your first time...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

Hmmm, no. Well netbeans does, but eclipse is excellent, and I can't imagine how you could better it. Plus there is a CVS plugin for it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can do that in eclipse. In fact eclipse automatically compiles every file and warns for errors in the text editor window after every save. It also features automatic text formatting and import management at the press of a button.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is one of the best text editors out there. It's what I use for html, php, makefiles and c++ (when not in an IDE).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Crimson Editor is pretty nice
<br/>
Notepad++ works well
<br/>
Programmer's Notepad is similarly useful
<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately most of the text editors provide the same features. Notepad++ is my fav of those three though...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

<br/>
With the ability to jump around by ctags, compile and jump to your bugs, debug within the editor, etc, you approach IDE-level.  Plus you have all of the goodness of being vi.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
