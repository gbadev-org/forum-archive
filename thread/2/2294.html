    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Probably not. Emulation has been said to require a factor of ten difference in CPU speed. The GBA's 16.8 MHz ARM7TDMI processor isn't ten times faster than the Sega Genesis's 7.8 MHz MC68000 and 3.6 MHz Z80.

If you want a Genesis game ported to GBA, start a petition, collect signatures, and pester the game's copyright owner.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It would never work. I've programmed the 68k before, and believe me, this chip couldn't be emulated even if the gba ran at 78Mhz. Maybe a Pentium at 100Mhz or 133Mhz could, but definently not the cheap little 32-bit ARM cpu in the gba.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They emulate Phantasy Start1, which was for Master System.

<br/>
The Genesis-sequals are more traditional ports, a mix of rewrite/recompile.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
