    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi.
<br/>
I'm new.
<br/>
<br/>
I started programming with Blitz 3d, learning (pretty much learned basics of now) c++, and know how to convert b3d to c++ by hand fairly easily. I've entered a contest for making a game with something to do with water, and because the whole thing is coming along so well and it seems able to run on a handheld, I intend to take the plunge to developing for handhelds and rebuild it for the ds when I am done.
<br/>
<br/>
So I found this spot and hope to learn how to do it :D
<br/>
<br/>
One note: If you don't like answering stupid questions, I suggest that you ignore all threads with my name on them for the next year.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Try not to finish your project too fast, or homebrew DS development won't be ready by the time you're done. ;)  Some good progress has been made, but there's a long way to go.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
