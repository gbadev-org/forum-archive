    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">RegalSin, often when I read your posts, I have trouble even understanding what you are trying to say or ask.
<br/>
<br/>
I think you'd often get a better response if you try to use meaningful grammar, and focus more on quickly conveying your main point.  (If English isn't your first language, then we'd be willing to give you a little more grace on that). 
<br/>
<br/>
In this case, what are you really trying to ask?  Recommendations for box art?  Finding someone to do box creation for you?  How to recycle plastic and make your own plastic cases?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">He is looking for a printing house that will do custom GBA boxes given artwork.  He is also looking for the plastic inserts that will hold the carts.
<br/>
<br/>
For what it's worth, I'm interested in that information as well.
<br/>
Manuals are not mentioned, but clearly they are related.
<br/>
<br/>
In summary, "where can I get packaging made?"
