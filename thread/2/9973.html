    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm gettin ready to purchase a the new DS, but I'm curious of something which hopefully the current Lite owners can answer.  My current DS has a good deal of scratchs on the touch screen, particularly where my thumb is usually placed (w/thumbstrap).  I'm not exactly sure what caused the marks on the screen (could be an imperfection on the surface, a chunk of dirt, etc), but I'm curious if the screen on the DS Lite was constructed of harder material or should I not use my old thumb strap at all on the new DS?
<br/>
<br/>
I should mention, also, that my current DS is quite literally the first availible version (purchased on realease day).  I can recall reading an article that there were two hardware versions of the DS around it's release (one with a darker, almost grid like screen).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks in advance for the input!
<br/>

I don't think you should use it, Nintendo didn't add a thumb strap with DSlite... The reason could be that it scratches?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ack, that could be true;  I wonder what the official reason for not including the strap is.  My two guesses have always been that either it is indeed known to scratch the touch screen, or the learning curve to using the "nub" was too much for a seemingly casual system (leaving it as a seperate purchase).
<br/>
<br/>
I am still curious to know, though, if the DS Lite uses a harder material for their touch screen at all.  I can't imagine playing Metroid w/o the thumb nub :/
