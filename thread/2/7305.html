There is a rumor about DS being upgraded to do DS-PC WiFi. Can DS use that to get into AOL/MSN/Yahoo messaging?
<br/>
<br/>
Is this possible, useful, conceivable?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think there's probably someone working on TCP/IP... other than that, I'm not sure what it would take. Although the protocols for most IMs are proprietary, but not difficult to find.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Given that there are hotspots in McDonal<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">d's</span></span>, I'd guess so. But other public hotspots might require the user to fill in an HTML form over HTTPS with a code from a receipt, which would work only for laptops unless someone makes a web browser for the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
