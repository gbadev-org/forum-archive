    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Did anyone else know that Isaac Newton predicted the Armageddon on 2066AD? First I heard of it was on the National Geographic channel; apparently he was also a biblical scholar and treated his religious work in the same way as he did with his scientifical.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just really shocked at this; especially hearing that is the one who calculated Jesus' death as 33AD and devoted 50 years to calculating the end of the world!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Second to this was Columbus' religious motives to his voyage, thinking himself to be part of the end!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
