    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would there be any interest in a DS application to view/control Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2 servers?
<br/>
It wouldn't be much use for anyone unless they wanted to remotely admin their server.
<br/>
<br/>
One idea I had would be to have an additional plugin on the server itself to give player positions and other info to the DS.
<br/>
That way something like an image of the current map and the locations of all the players would be possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Funny thing you mention this, before my pc blew up (well just the HDD) I made a program for Counter Strike: Source that was the buy menu (I took the code from the mk5 gamepad thing, implemented touchscreen buttons to act as the ds's gamepad, and bound the joystick buttons to a specific weapon) Of course there is probably a easier/more efficient way to do this, which is why I am throwing my idea out there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I actually made a Quakeworld - IRC gateway, whereas messages from QW were passed to IRC and vice versa.  The ultimate aim was to have QW bots spawn for people in IRC and if an admin killed one of the bots, they get kicked. :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
