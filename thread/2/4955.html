I'm trying to burn episodes ripped from a double-layer DVD onto single layer DVD's.  I have a double layer burner, but a single DVD+R DL disc will cost you at least $7 US (and I'm in Canada, so figure in shipping on top of that -- over here, cheapest I've found is about $15 CAN per disc).
<br/>
<br/>
I've gotten as far as being able to remake the IFO files so that I can at least play them on anything that has a Title Skip feature, but a menu would be SO much nicer.  I have Ulead DVD MovieFactory 3 Disc Creator, and it <span style="font-style: italic">almost</span> works with these VOBs, but sadly won't decode or encode the audio (doesn't support the audio format... which I think is total BS).
<br/>
<br/>
The long and short of it is... does someone know of a program that can take your VOBs and make a DVD menu to go with it in such a way that you can use Nero to burn a DVD Video Disc and when you play it, you get menus... I don't care how freaking basic the menus are; the menus can look like DOS having a bad hair day and suffering from nicotine withdrawal, but as long as they can identify Episode 1 or Episode 2 in some manner, it'd be good enough for me.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:  I should mention that I'm looking for a free way to do this.  I spent more money than I should have in the past week.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, DVDShrink doesn't make any menus, but from the look of things that just isn't going to happen any time soon.  Besides, I've spent so much time on this, and I need the space back.
<br/>
<br/>
But, at the very least, DVDShrink does allow the DVD to be played back and can jump titles by skipping from the last chapter, so thanks FluBBa.  At least I can make something that works (and better and/or easier than anything else I've found).
<br/>
<br/>
If I manage to find anything freeware that CAN create menus, I'll post it here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
