I + I + I = Wii

Mac mini + TV-out adapter + Bluetooth receiver = homebrew developer's alternative to Wii

But if Apple were serious about bringing games to the Mac platform, it would encourage more development of games that run on a set-top Mac, just as it has developed "Front Row" for noninteractive entertainment.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Back then we had PPC/PDA which you can listen to MP3 or even wavs and surf the internet wireless. You oculd even play emulated game or if your PDA was powerfull enough play GTA:Vice City with a image drive.

I say musicians need to record only to tape in poor format and sell the Cd version for the amount it would take to make a fair profit.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

The iFrame is something Apple just might do. I've seen plenty of digital picture frames from other companies. The iLamp would be more likely from Jobs' other company, which uses a hopping desk lamp as the mascot of its Pixar production units. The microwave and vacuum cleaner, on the other hand, don't.
<br/>
<br/>
I almost expected the iRack to be a home version of the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xserve" target="_blank">Xserve</a>, based on the naming of <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_RaQ" target="_blank">Sun's Cobalt RaQ product</a>. (The first and second servers Pin Eight ran on were Cobalt RaQs.) But then I realized it wasn't about iRack but about Gulf War II.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
