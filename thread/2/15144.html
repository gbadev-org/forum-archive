Some portable libraries have been mentioned. If you not only mean PC, but Windows, then those bits that are not done within .NET usually use the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API" target="_blank">Win32 API</a>, some of them MFC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am currently trying to decide between wxWidgets and GTK+. I use devcpp and there is a version of devc++ that is used with wxWidgets(this may be a dumb question, but can will I still be able to write console applications with devcpp for wxWidgets?(I will probably find that out with more research, but it is a current question I have.) But the GTK+ api is appealing to be, just because of some of the programs that have been written with it.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone here have a preference between the two?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not on the development side, (I haven't actually used either one) but on the user-end, on windows, I prefer programs written with wxWidgets.   The GTK+ ui in windows often looks slightly "off."  Not as bad as swing in java, but often doesn't look exactly like a standard native app.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Apparently things have got much better with Swing recently. And I say this as an SWT/JFace/Eclipse RCP developer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Interesting, that's what I do professionally as well.  But I didn't realize that swing had gotten that much better.
