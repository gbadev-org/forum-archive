    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just wondering if someone is working on a flash sort of thing for better internet browsers and whatnot on the DS... I thought I heard something about that. Maybe it is beyond the system's capabilities, i dunno. I found this rather interesting though...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">no... A "Movie Clip" is a type of object in flash.  It's Flash's way of doing any animated object that can move around the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Flash games involve code that moves Movie Clip objects around, with code either inside or outside movie clip objects.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That changed in AS3/Flash9, very few things are now movie clips. Usually you'll use the simpler 'Sprite' object (which should have an obvious name to anyone doing GBA/DS homebrew) &lt;/nitpick&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
