    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_pronouns" target="_blank">Japanese pronouns</a> are part of the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_honorifics" target="_blank">honorific structure of Japanese</a>. This makes them difficult to translate, and nearly impossible out of context. The adage goes that "screw you" would be translated not by using an impolite word for "have sex with", but by using an impolite word for "you".

I'm guessing this is all getting to you, but there really is no need to fall to that level.
<br/>
<br/>
But yes, I found that the many variations of you/your differ based on the context. I suspect that a Japanese translation for "your anime" may translate back as something else, such as "your personal anime" or something! A very poetic/descriptive language Japanese is, makes it much harder to say something without meaning.
<br/>
<br/>
Looking at it I think that "Anime" is the only Japanese text needed; I have what appears to be a Hiragana translation ( アニメ )! I have an okay design from it, but will seek a second opinion and begin finding an appropriate colour/texture for it. "Anime" in some of the other Japanese writing forms would be good to compare.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes you should figure out what "you/your" to use, are you talking about your personal anime, or do you mean "your" in a different way? And you could use the standard form if nobody cares about Japanese politeness, but otherwise you have to figure it out.
<br/>
<br/>
アニメ is katakana, not hiragana. I'm not sure if there is a kanji form of this word, though. In hiragana it would be あにめ but "anime" isn't usually written in hiragana, I have only seen it in katakana. Kana is easy, but kanji is much harder.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, what are you designing and why is it Japanese, can you explain it more better what you need? About color/texture, maybe you should post the design on here some people might have a opinion about color/textures.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I quite like "your personal anime". It's for a branding exercise project and the Japanese text makes it feel more Japanese (being about anime). Also I have an interesting tagline, "it's personal" ooh ooh I should work in branding -_-

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am not a language specialist or know how to speak Japanese fully. However I constantly watch various Animes and foregin films more often and I am making an attempt to learn Nipponese language.
<br/>
<br/>
The word Anime does not change but the "your" will change
<br/>
<br/>
"Anime" just means "Japanese Animation/cartoon /Nippponese Animation/cartoon"
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think there is a correct word for Animation or even Cartoon reverting to Animation 
<br/>
<br/>
Also when lining up characters or speaking the tounge like most old world languages you say the item first then the action.
<br/>
<br/>
like ITEM + What/Where/When/Who/ = Where is the ITEM or when is the ITEM
<br/>
<br/>
Then again the sentence might look like in english "ITEM where" 
<br/>
<br/>
The item might be
<br/>
<br/>
 ( off course you want this in the representive form )
<br/>
Anime
<br/>
Nipponese Animation
<br/>
Nipponese Cartoon
<br/>
Jipang Cartoon
<br/>
Nippon Animation
<br/>
Nippon Cartoon
<br/>
<br/>
and then you would most likely add "your" after the original word
<br/>
<br/>
Also like most original languages the letting will be in representive or figure form.
<br/>
<br/>
Think of it like spanish pointing out items.
<br/>
<br/>
Also you would need to search the word Animation ( as in movement ) in Japnanese to really make sense of it.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Crazy as this sounds, this would be the most Japanese way of writing it, Katakana English:
<br/>
ヨア･アニメ　(your ヨア anime アニメ)

The solid dot ・ just separates "your" from "anime".

<br/>
きみのあにめ
<br/>
<br/>
Katakana (not abnormal):
<br/>
アナタのアニメ
<br/>
<br/>
Kanji (appears pedantic):
<br/>
君の漫画
<br/>
<br/>
Mixed (probably normal, depending on what you use):
<br/>
よあ漫画
<br/>
<br/>
You could also do something freaky like this (and you see stuff like this):
<br/>
Yourアニメ

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay I've managed to come up with <a class="postlink" href="http://img406.imageshack.us/my.php?image=20070811anatanoanimeci9.jpg" target="_blank">a logo</a>. The background has clouds because I was trying to make a batman signal with the trademark 'A' ^_^ I was originally going to have the Japanese text aligned with the left of the 'y', but then I decided to use the black/white theme so it is currently positioned a little higher, brining it above the 'A', which I will have to fix.
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm happy with the logo, now to get some practise on the rest of the web design exercise!
<br/>
<br/>
And again thank you all for your help.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I've uploaded  the <a class="postlink" href="http://img518.imageshack.us/my.php?image=20070811anatanoanime2cb8.png" target="_blank">logo </a> without the background, and I did some repositioning. I'm really stuck on it because the Japanese text couldn't be too close to the dot of the 'i', but I'm not too sure if it looks right without it!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#137446 - tepples - Sat Aug 11, 2007 9:42 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The A might be confused for an <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecchi" target="_blank">H</a> in much the same way that the A in the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Acura_logo.png" target="_blank">Acura logo</a> looks like it implies the H in Honda, Acura's parent company.
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, the rest of the logo looks strong. The strokes in the left side of the の (no) kana need a bit of thickening, as they appear to break up on my monitor.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes there is some ambiguity to the 'A'. The font I used it like that with the の, but I've now added in the missing part of the character because it does look a broken.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll work on trying to make the 'A' less ambiguous - without a line at the top would be best as it makes it more original. However that may be impossible without it being mistaken for an 'H', and my sketches with a new curve look good so I'm sure I can do it.
<br/>
<br/>
And thanks for the feedback.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
