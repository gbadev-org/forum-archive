    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, I just found out today, so sorry if it's a bit of old news, but the GameBoy Advance SP has just been given a release date! A new GBA, and it's beautiful once you've gotten used to the thing. Here's a few details:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>Rechargeable Lithium Battery (10 hours lit, 18 hours unlit)
<br/>
Flip-lid (size of an MD when closed)
<br/>
Frontlight (!!!)</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
I must go now, but check out some of the previews. Apparently, the side buttons are easier to use, even though they're smaller. Go figure...
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: It's a frontlight then (also added battery times)<br/>_________________<br/>'Darkshines, Bringing me down,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It looks less comfortable to me, the GBA design is a relief after the cramped GBC controls...
<br/>
<br/>
Also I don't quite get why they are using that 2-in-1 port, instead of two jacks (DC and headphones) which would fit in the same space</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is NOT backlit, It is front lit, edge lighting...  Alot of fans seem to think it's backlit, but will wind up being pissed off when they find this is not the case.  Frontlighting by nature means more light at the edges, less light toward the center...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, frontlight, whatever. The point is it's lit, and I think you'll find that the light distributes itself evenly. Summin to do with some film they have on the screen or summin.
<br/>
<br/>
I was kinda disapointed with the design at first, but apparently the side buttons are easier to use, and I for one welcome the newfound portability of the unit. However, I do agree, they should've added a Jack. Maybe there just wasn't enough space...<br/>_________________<br/>'Darkshines, Bringing me down,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've spoken to someone I know that went to the NYC Press Conf. and he said it's actually far more comfortable to the adult hand to hold than the original. Also, I read a post on the Edge boards and one of the Edge writers said it was far more comfortable.

I don't think we have to worry about comfort, unless we're female or have girly hands.<br/>_________________<br/>-<span style="font-weight: bold">Sam</span>

I don't understand how this is relevant.  Please explain.
