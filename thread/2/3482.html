Just something I noticed and thought was cool, especially considering that in a year I have made no significant contribution. Well I released Columniser but even if that was good the version gbadev has is buggy on palettes :P<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

To think my anniversary was over 2 months ago, and it was probably spent cramming for a test.
