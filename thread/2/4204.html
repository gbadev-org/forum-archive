However, it'd be wise to generate the RSS feed to a static file periodically and then serve that file in order to save processing time on the server.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Is it possible we could get an RSS feed on the forum?

My bad.
<br/>
<br/>
It'd still be nice to seem some action on the main website. There are enough homebrew announcements that it wouldn't be too much work to sift through and occasionally post the new releases on the front page.
<br/>
<br/>
Erm... and a forum RSS feed would be alright, too. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, as far as I know, they purposely limit the front page announcements to GBA games, instead of putting both GBA games and DS games.

Has anybody released a new GBA game on here recently to test whether new game announcements are getting posted?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#170826 - SimonB - Wed Oct 21, 2009 10:21 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I check the forum, if not daily at least a couple of times a week. I see other mods online quite often too so even if we don't post we are here :)
<br/>
<br/>
If there is interest I will look into setting up an RSS feed for the forum. There is always a balance though in what features are added etc, as we don't have very much time to devote to the forum, and every hour I spend adding stuff to the forum or website is an hour of actual work I must pass on. That is why I don't implement every single thing that is requested, and with this RSS feed request I assume I felt there wasn't enough people requesting it back in the day (it looks like it took 3 years and 3 months before anyone replied also wanting the RSS feed for the forum, but I guess there could have been other RSS request thread I haven't seen).
<br/>
<br/>
Now, regarding dsdev.org, we didn't have any time to start a proper site. We attented the Nintendo press conference at the Hollywood &amp; Highland complex prior to E3 back in 2004 when they announced the DS, and we got very excited about it. Unfortunately real life came in the way, as it often does, and we could not devote the time required to run another site.
<br/>
<br/>
With the DS development scene however, there were other sites that catered to the DS homebrew scene, so instead of continuing with a half-arsed attempt we chose to let other people take the load this time around. The site has stayed online just as a reference so people will still find their way to the forum and to not let the domain fall into the hands of spammers. So I wouldn't expect any additions to the site in the future either josath.
<br/>
<br/>
This forum has never required much work from the moderators though, and the unwanted crowd has stayed away. I must say that, thanks to all of you guys, this has been the forum with the least amount of drama and bickering that I have come across.
