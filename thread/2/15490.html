    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OH NOES! i have accidentally posted this into hw instead of offtopic! could a mod please correct this?!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
as you pobably have seen (or not, doesn't matter), i have asked about the windows system menu icon not showing, despite the fact, that i've tried every possible way to let it be displayed...
<br/>
<br/>
but there's more that i hate about win32 window handling (in mingw gcc)... 
<br/>
<br/>
i probably have to rewrite my whole window handling system... going to fullscreen and back during runtime is a pain and will often fail, multisampling will refuse to work, despite the fact that i have everything setup just RIGHT. it won't do the SetPixelFormat, although the format is perfectly valid (tested with another application) ... damn it!
<br/>
<br/>
plus, giving the user (which includes me) maximum flexibility at minimum coding effort by making everything "just work" with different window types makes it even more complex given all the errors the API will generate.
<br/>
<br/>
during all the development time i probably haven't spent as much time on any other sub system as on the windowing system (with several rewrites and design changes - every time i got something fixed but never for all situations.)
<br/>
<br/>
it's back to pen and paper, i guess.
<br/>
sad panda. very sad panda.
<br/>
<br/>
so hereby, i name it my "Personal Coding Nemesis"!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think mine would have to be compression encoders. Always going in circles trying to find out what detail I missed, or what the target application is expecting that the format specification doesn't mention. 
<br/>
<br/>
I actually don't mind the windows C-style API, at least for making dialog boxes and such. Now MFC is another story, and DirectX is also wonderfully convoluted pain in the neck.
<br/>
Also, trying to make GDI do animated pixel graphics is not the best idea, which it sounds like you might be doing since you mentioned SetPixelFormat and fullscreen. I prefer to make an OpenGL window, draw stuff in a raw memory buffer in whatever format I like, and then render a single quad with that as the texture. Super easy, and actually runs much faster than memcopying the buffer straight to VRAM in DirectDraw.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">&lt;lol&gt; yeah, only, i'm doing openGL! ;^D
<br/>
direct-what you say? X^D
<br/>
<br/>
i think, i'm actually allergic to any kind of library that is not either openGL (and AL) or open source (libnds). it gives me the creeps!
<br/>
<br/>
well, compression, precious compression! :^D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
