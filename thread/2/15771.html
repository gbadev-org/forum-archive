    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, I don't know how many people remember the ill-fated Chrono Trigger: Resurrection project that got gunned by Square? Well Square finally decided to start doing something about porting their classic RPG to a modern system and well...
<br/>
<br/>
It's like a kick in the face.
<br/>
<br/>
First off, this: 
<br/>
<a href="http://www.square-enix.co.jp/ctds/" target="_blank">http://www.square-enix.co.jp/ctds/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Second off, this <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v298/PGamma/1214998257277-1.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pretty much a confirmation if you ask me...could be wrong but, let's assume for a moment that this is, indeed, Chrono Trigger as we loved it making it's way to the DS. Considering the fact that Square exercised it's right to preserve its intellectual property (rather anally, might I add), you'd think that their own offering would be better than the thing they trashed, right? So the fact that it doesn't seem like much more in than a straight port is potentially a boot to the face of anyone that looked forward to Chrono Trigger: Resurrection while it was in development.
<br/>

I could be alone in this opinion but hey, voicing it all the same. What do you guys think?<br/>_________________<br/>Uh oh, it's an oreo!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

FWIW, the correct procedure for using someone else's IP is to get permission.  That is not to say that I think gunning the project was the best choice on Square's part, although it was probably the simplest.

And yea, you are right. But...alot of companies let home developers do their own thing with their IP (look at sonic fangaming for christ's sake), because they know that there is very little any one of those fanmade creations can do to hurt their sales.
<br/>
<br/>
The fact that Square thought it necessary to nip CT: R in the bud conveys one of two (or both) things. Either Square were just being anal about it, or they already had plans for a mediocre straight port, in which case CT: R could have easily hurt sales of said mediocrity. Or maybe it's both of those reasons.<br/>_________________<br/>Uh oh, it's an oreo!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I suspect that they a protective corporate culture.  I doubt most individual decisions are very well thought out.
<br/>
<br/>
Last time I checked, Capcom's stance on fan based works is that they are not a problem (although I am sure they have limits).  I suspect it really depends on the company / current management.  There are only a couple of things you can do to protest- sell any shares you own (if any) and boycott.  I have no plans to pick up a DS port of CT.

Ask.  A snail mail business letter probably makes the most sense.  Depending on who you are dealing with, they may not give you permission.  Lack of a response is basically a refusal, although there could be routing errors, etc.  If you do not get permission, then invent your own IP and make a clone (to the extent no patents are being violated).

So far as I know, "Mario" is a trademark.  Distribution of Mario binaries falls into the realm of copyright.  Chances are slim you will be given access to trade secrets for a non-commercial project, and they are nil for IP addresses.  I'm curious, where do things like the right to create derivative works fall?  Trademarks?

Copyright, most of the time. Trademarks can be written around (see Pidgin or The Ur-Quan Masters).
<br/>
<br/>
But the term "intellectual property" has connotations that are loaded against free software and free culture: <ul><li>Copyright law, patent law, trademark law, and trade secret law are more alike than different. (This is demonstrably false.) </li><li>Holding companies deserve to own exclusive rights in works of authorship, inventions, marks, and the right of an employee to change jobs within one's field of expertise. (This is disputed.) </li></ul>
<br/>
The abbreviation "IP" is even worse, as it carries these connotations that are just as loaded: <ul><li>"Intellectual property" is so legitimate that it deserves to be abbreviated. </li><li>"Intellectual property" is as legitimate as the technical underpinnings of the Internet itself. </li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Copyright would cover the executable.  So long as you are rocoding the engine you are fine there.  Graphics, sound, text and stage layouts could also potentially be covered by copyright, so so-long as you use original assets you are fine that.  That basically takes you to 99% of your development budget.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
So it appears that copyright law provides for derivative works, or new versions in the above language.  Not only do you need a new program and new assets, but a new setting, characters and other flavor elements as well.  This is where Chrono Trigger: Resurrection crossed the line.  If you receive a salary for something you work on, there is a good chance that that is a work for hire, and you basically sold ownership for your salary.

<br/>
Are you aware of a better term to use?  Intangible assets could able be used, but that would contain accounting concepts like goodwill that are even less related.  Regardless, the point is that these are intangibles with ownership.  To the extent you are not the owner, you need permission from the owner which may or may not be granted.
<br/>
<br/>
People can argue about whether or not this is the best system possible, but there are no direct practical applications to answering that question.  This is the system that is in place now.

So it's like the straight port of <span style="font-style: italic">Parappa the Rapper</span> from PS1 to PSP, right?

<br/>
<br/>
silent_code is right that the cartridge/CD distinction is misleading. The vast majority[1] of Super NES games just mapped everything into byte-addressable ROM, just like the GBA (and the DS SLOT-2). DS SLOT-1, on the other hand, is a lot more like an optical disc in that it is a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/block/" target="_blank">block device</a> with a file system, just a shitload faster than the PS1 CD drive (unless you're on GnM).

I'd guess they're starting from the PSX source, since it's probably written in C/C++, and a source port from 65816 assembly would probably be more work than re-coding from scratch. You'd only have to change how assets are converted/loaded/displayed anyway.

Having all the artwork done would definitely make it a whole lot cheaper to develop than a new game though, so I do agree it should be more like $20-25. Probably would make them a lot more money with increased sales/reputation, but oh well. I'll still buy a copy provided they manage to keep the music the same quality (Tales of Phantasia GBA was such a disappointment in that area).<br/>_________________<br/>___________

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.

Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

Heh, the GBA's audio capability was only as great as the audio coder with the upgrade from the GB's sound capabilities with 2 DACs, vs the SNES's SPU.

Not sure where you're coming from here, but CT doesn't immediately lend itself to the kinds of enhancements that Animal Crossing got. The only people I know personally who've played it found the field of view so small that it wasn't worth playing, despite the all 'round enhancements.
<br/>
<br/>
While I found the Final Fantasy games that have been revamped to 3D deserved it, CT had a distinct style that would be compromised by that kind of change. It would be quite the project to fail to make the game any worse with this kind of change. However, I do agree that touchscreen menus (and any other kind of selection input) are an important feature of any DS game. Most games (ports included) deliver on this and I wouldn't expect any less of CT.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The frustum might be larger, but since the angle's so obtuse you can't see as much with it and IMO too many games do this. I can't say I'm interested in playing Animal Crossing regardless, it's really not my bag.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My guess is the low poly count on the DS. If you show less environment you can put more polys into your character models. I'd personally rather a worse level of detail though. I think most would agree with me, but graphical quality is one of the trump details in the initial perceived quality of a game.
<br/>
<br/>
Motion sickness is an interesting point. I suspect it has a lot to do with your threshold of perception. If the visual effect is rendered roughly at your threshold your nervous system will probably find it more chaotic with just enough information to focus on and make sense of, but not enough to anticipate. I don't suffer from motion sickness while playing games (Doom gave me vertigo once or twice, but it doesn't happen any more) so I've got no idea how the visible field would impact it. I would think a larger visible area would help rather than hurt, but I really don't know.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My guess is, that it's all about torgue. The streched image caused some (little) dizzynes, although I haven't experienced that before. That's because the rather fast rotations when additionally stretched, would become even faster and the brain would have to recalibrate the image a lot (due to the stretching and new orientation.)
