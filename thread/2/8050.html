    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a gbadev.org t-shirt? I haven't seen one and I was just wandering. I love this site and I would definetly buy one. The only site I know of that has t-shirt and is related to gba development  is drunken coders. I will probably buy that one soon. The devkitPro logo would make a cool t-shirt also, along with the old ngine logo. It's a pretty good idea I think, because you you have a lot of  fans of your software or site then you already have buyers, and it helps raise money for the site.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It'd be fairly easy for someone to set up a cafepress shop to sell stuff like that.   And like you said, if the site maintainers set it up, they could support the site that way....
<br/>
<br/>
(or you could just design your own shirt at cafepress with the logo, buy it for the base cafepress price, and then send a few bucks to this site's owners to cover what the "markup" would be)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, thats an idea. cafepress is actually the site I was thinking about. I didn't know if that would be legal, but I guess they wouldn't mind :). Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, you might want to get permission from whoever owns whatever logo.  But considering that you'd push money (not to mention publicity) back at them, they most likely wouldn't mind so much</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another idea:
<br/>
<br/>
A Mattel Power Glove controller clutching a GBA SP displaying the gbadev logo. Either below the gbadev logo on the GBA SP screen, or below the SP and Power Glove, the tagline "It's so <span style="font-weight: bold">bad</span>." where "bad" is in the same font as that used in the gbadev logo.
<br/>
<br/>
(Yes, you could probably actually use a Power Glove with a Game Boy Player through something similar to the <a class="postlink" href="http://boards.pocketheaven.com/viewtopic.php?t=2219" target="_blank">SNES Advance controller adapter</a>.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That is a cool idea :p. Maybe it would be fun (if you guys actually did want to sell t's ) if we held a small contest so that some of the artist on the site could show of their ideas. The winner's logo would be used(and that should definetly be enough of a prize!) The logos would have to be turned in by a certain date and we could vote on them on the site. Or do you guys think this would be way to much trouble?
<br/>
<br/>
I personally think it would be fun. I'm sure that there is someone a lot more creative than me(though I may enter ;) ) on the site and this would make sure that we got the best logo possible. I think some type magnified pixel art would be cool(but IDK). Well, bad idea?... good idea?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
