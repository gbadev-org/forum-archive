    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm, considering there are over 10 links that appear on every page removing images is a bit of a UI transition. I just turned images off and the first thing that one notes is that there is little distinction between common page links and those that are specific to temporal functionality - especially posting replies to topics.
<br/>
<br/>
Having said that it could possibly be solved by using different link colours, but should still remain looking like a button.
<br/>
<br/>
And I used to use a 56k modem until about 4 years ago, never gave me any problems except for forums where people had 1MB animated signatures - so I just turned off signatures ^_^ In fact I logged back onto the site last year and only realized that I took off signatures when someone made a comment about an image that a person had, I turned it on and it was awful; everyone had 1MB animated images, and their signatures took up half the page.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Then use the whitelist feature of whatever you're using to block images to cancel the block for forum.gbadev.org.
<br/>
<br/>
New topics are easy to detect: Try "View posts since your last visit" at the right side of the front page.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It adds to layout and focus. I was on the internet at 56k for years and I've never had to browse with all images turned off at all. Forums have many links and the images work as icons as well as give assist the layout. It could be done in all text, but is it necessary.

In the forum pages, with lists of posts it is EASY to see if there are new posts. It either looks like:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">No new     Why not a Dual Slot fat system? 
<br/>
posts
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Or:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">New         _View newest post_  comics on ds
<br/>
posts
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
The 'New Topic' image gets replaced with a text link '<a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/posting.php?mode=newtopic&amp;f=20" target="_blank">Post New Topic</a>', and so on.
<br/>
<br/>
If your browser doesn't show things correctly with images disabled, perhaps you need to switch browsers? (For reference, I'm using firefox 1.5 under linux)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Except that most of us love the fact that we're not spammed with stupid images.  Most forums that I go to are a mess of avatars, signature images, and stupid stuff like that.  This is the most clean and readable forum I've ever used.  And it's precisely because of the strict image policies.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Of course, we could let people upload signature images on the gbadev forum server but I think the majority of us prefer to see the text, and then click on a link to see an image if we feel the need to see it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
