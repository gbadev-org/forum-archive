    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been working on a design doc, sprites, and BG's on a game for GBA for a while now....Was wondering if anybody wanted to help program this bad boy? The GBA programer at my work has no time since he is working on GCUBE, PS2, and another GBA demo right now.....I am not getting paid so your not gettin paid kind of deal. If it makes any difference I have already worked on 1  Atari, and 2 Vivende (Universal pictures) games for GBA. Just wanted to see if anybody out there wanted to establish a fun working relationship, and make a game!

Lol...I figure this is a shot in the dark, but thought it might be fun.
