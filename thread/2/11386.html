    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering it there was anyway to make wifi work on them? I'm using a DI-624+ and DS wifi doesn't work on it. Well, it does work but it doesn't work completely like on MK: DS it freezes during the 4th race EVERYTIME and homebrew stuff like beup can't even connect. Is there any homebrew program or something that will make it work? :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
