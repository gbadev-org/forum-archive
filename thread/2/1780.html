<br/>
<br/>
I am currently searching for some music for use in my game, using NEiM0D's MOD player. My current problem is, that I don't know the rules for the modfiles that I have found, since it is normaly just ZIP's with nothing but the MOD's, and no credits or readme's at all. That is a problem, because I want to know if I can use the music :P
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know a site who has music that is 100% free to use in free projects, like compo entries, or can someone please tell me about how the license works?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you have found some mod files you'd like to use, you can try contacting the author. Find yourself a "real" mod player where you can see the instruments lists. Mod authors usually put their nickname in the instruments list. Once you have the nick name, finding the author should not be too hard.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
