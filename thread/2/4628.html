    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I spoke with a guy at a company who tried to get a Flash player running on the GBA, and their conclusion was that the GBA just isn't fast enough, which I'd agree with based on my coding experience. Flash is all about floating point calculations, so even doing a low-color Flash player would be unlikely.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, a few years ago people said that using the GBA for video playback was impossible... In any case, I think that if someone could get a Flash player running it would be AWESOME and really open GB homebrew to all the Flash people.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS is possibly more realistic, since its processor is faster.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone said that the DS has a floating point unit?

Keep in mind that your PC has to fuss with the OS.  That takes a lot.

I guess my point is that the GBA always runs at full speed and it has a 16.78 MHz processor.  10x for emulation takes us to a 167.8 MHz processor.  Windows used, say the other 165.2 MHz or so just to run the OS.  (These numbers are bogus, but you get the idea.)

The GBA has two processors: one a CPU and one a PPU. The PC doesn't have a PPU that maps cleanly, so its CPU must emulate it. Now you have 10x for the CPU and 10x for the PPU, and you get 333 MHz. I'm guessing the difference between frameskip 1 (TOD M1 ran natively at 30fps before I learned the various cheats I used to handle mode 7 in M2 and M3) and frameskip 3 is OS overhead.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

For creating games in Flash, you can use bitmap sprites - you don't have to use vectors for everything. I wrote an iso game engine (surprise surprise) entirely in Flash and it worked fine on my scabby old 233Mhz laptop!
<br/>
<br/>
Flash on the GBA would be fantastic and really would open up the homebrew scene to loads of developers.

Flash "developer" - do you use actionscript?
<br/>
Do you mean you "know nothing" about coding in general, or just coding for the GBA in particular.
<br/>
If you can create simple games using actionscript, you should be able to put something together in C - the syntax is very similar.
<br/>
<br/>
It also depends how you implement an 'object oriented' approach with your movie clips (e.g. I tend to create a movieclip for each object and put a two-frame loop with the functions on the first frame, and code and function calls on the 2nd). 
<br/>
If you want to discuss moving from Actionscript to C, PM me or we could set up another thread for anyone else who is interested...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry - let me clear that up a little.  I mostly do actionscript.  The best way to describe what I do at work is to take the designs from our designers, and make them actually do something.  They make it pretty, I make it work.  I'm pretty good at the actionscripting.  But coding for the GBA or in C - C++ is where I get lost.  
<br/>
<br/>
Lately I've been really digging into the AS 2.0 thing and trying to go to a straight OOP approach in my actionscript.  If you know of some good resources that can help in learning to code in C, that'd be great.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
