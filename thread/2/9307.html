    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know what it is but I can't seem to be able to play computer games anymore. I've got a playstation and a gamecube, and I've bought many games for it. But I just can't seem to be bothered to play it.
<br/>
<br/>
I try, I take out the game, I find the adaptor, but once the game is up I just can't be bothered anymore. Sometimes I don't even get as far as turning it on; and it is really bad because I have a couple of games that I haven't even played yet.
<br/>
<br/>
I used to play games a lot before, and I was pretty good at them. It's happened since I started uni. Has this happened to anyone else?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I'm not sucking up, but the 2004MBit was the first time I played a game for more than half an hour in ages. That and free online poker.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I spend *far* more time making games and related projects than playing them. That's probably why my games suck. I'm so out of touch. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
For me, playing games just gets my creative juices flowing. I generally fire something up for a few minutes, then get so interested in the game's conversation engine or graphics googah X or whatever... that I simply stop playing and go fire up my code editor or photoshop.
<br/>
<br/>
I had the same experience with the 2004Mbit compo. I actually *played* those games, which is unusual for me. 
<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, you're not (totally) alone.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I go through phases of gameplaying.... A month of gaming everyday and then a month of nothing.  (or two months, or 4 ....)
<br/>
<br/>
Right now its spring (here) so I am busier - yard work at what not, and when I get in I am tired, so don't really feel like playing games.
<br/>
<br/>
I also am completely infected with the game development bug. Similar to Scott, games are more inspirational than fun...
<br/>
<br/>
I am on the last level in BLACK for xbox, and have been since about a week after its release...just can't be bothered to finish it off now...  but then again, in 2001 I was playing XIII for xbox and got about 75% of the way through....I picked it up again in September '05 and finished it off!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I do the same things as you guys but I have been getting together with a friend of mine once or twice a week to play games all day. That's about the only time I play games. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have the problem of looking at a game and wondering not only how works, but what they used to implement it (like C#, C++, VB, or Java).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of playing with a friend 'cause I can usually do that no problem. I'm a competitive sucker anyway, so maybe I just need to play with friends.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I usually finish games I start.  Right now my stack is:
<br/>
<br/>
[ Just bought Rockman Dash I and II for PS ]
<br/>
PS - Ore no Shikabane wo Koete Yuke
<br/>
PS - Moon
<br/>
PS - Suikoden II
<br/>
<br/>
I'm busy though.  I'd love to spend a whole day finishing off Ore no Shikabane and getting halfway through Moon, but I have more important things to do.
<br/>
<br/>
I also hate battle animations that last more than 3 seconds... Suikoden II has no animation skip.  Ack.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can sit down and play a platform game (a good one like mario) for a while. Zelda games will keep me going for hours, as will other goos RPGs. But I agree, after so many nights it's like overkill and you have to have a break.
<br/>
<br/>
I do tend to wonder how they implement stuff. More often than not, I'll sit there while I'm playing and go "oK, it I put my code this way and used this logic, I could get this working in my own game." However, generally I'll keep playing for a while, if not just to get more ideas as to how it works.
<br/>
<br/>
With friends, playing for a while is no problem. A long while. Without them, I do suffer from the dreaded "I'm bored with games" which, coming from a pure gamer at heart like me, is a really bad thing. It leaves me with little to do!

I'd be happy to go head to head with anyone in a game of Twinkle Star Sprites though. =)  (Neo Geo, a PS2 remake was also released.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you just reminded me that the last mission of gta san andreas has been waiting for 2 months now...
<br/>
...but yeah, "uni" has done the same for me. Games get boring. I even got somewhat bored of Half Life and Half Life 2... oh well.
<br/>
its so much more interesting to read up on old software 2.5/3D engines and wondering how that could fit into the GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm more interested in re-creating Pixelships (on the PC) and putting my own version on the GBA than sitting down and playing for hours on end like I used to do.  Of course, that may help me get a job.  Then again, maybe it won't.  :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lately due to time constraints in my life, I do a lot more GameBoy Micro gaming than stationary console gaming.  The Micro is so easy to carry around and play when you're on the go.
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I have a DS, but the that little bit of extra bulk keeps me from sticking it in a pocket on impulse, and playing stylus games in a moving vehicle is nearly impossible.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe when the DS Lite comes out in the US...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, bottom line is that I'm able to play games a lot more than I normally could because I have the Micro.  But even more importantly, since most GBA titles are more about the pure gameplay than what next-gen feature is on the box cover, my enthusiasm for real gaming has been renewed.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
