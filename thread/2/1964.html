    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is a far off thought, but from my understanding it is nearly impossible to become a licensed developer without a proven track record of published games.  Also how profitable is it really?  It seems like the publishers bank off of games, but the developers seem to be struggling.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The GBA is a tough market, as there are SO many developers that want to do a game for it. So your game will be on the shelves between shedloads of other titles.
<br/>
<br/>
Publishers aren't doing very well either. Only the major publishers (ie. EA) are still doing well. Acclaim for instance might go out of business coming months, while they have released quite some nice games in the past!
<br/>
<br/>
The entire game industry isn't in it's best shape, and it is not just developers going out of business...<br/>_________________<br/>If everything fails, read the manual: If even that fails, post on forum!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe I am just slow... but I am not sure if I am following you on this funkeejefou.  Could you please explain if I am off?  Do you mean do I want to attempt to get reviewed for a license in the future?  Its a possibility, I just want to see if there is any potential return on profit for developing a game for the GBA prior to getting a license.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
