As far as DS-mode homebrew with flashcards, I'm sure that Nintendo will continue to block what they can. However, seeing as many flashcards are now bypassing the DSi blockade by mimicking actual commercial games (like the DSTWO with Fish Tycoon), Nintendo will have to step up the boot process a bit more while keeping the games being mimicked from being blocked.
<br/>
<br/>
I personally want to continue being able using my DSTWO for homebrew with the 3DS because my DSphat is starting to fall apart, especially since the SC team is planning to release the DSTWO SDK soon.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
While it could offload, the communication between the DS CPU and the DSTWO CPU is bottlenecked by the transfer rate between the card and the unit. While the output from the card to the DS (for video/audio) works well enough with GBA emulation, I'm not entirely sure about the transfer rate in the other direction.
<br/>
<br/>
But anyways, here's hoping that the DSTWO's method of booting doesn't get blocked on the 3DS. I still have projects to work with, and my DSphat is showing it's age.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If it would happen to be faster than the current ARM9 (though I somehow doubt that), then it could perhaps be used for the 386 CPU core emulation, with ARM9 emulating the VGA features and ARM7 emulating the SoundBlaster. That really sounds intriguing. :-)

I'm pretty interesting in what the 3DS can do and how the 3D will look, but I'm not sure whether we will be able to homebrew for it, seeing as we still can't homebrew for the dsi in dsi mode. maybe nintendo will provide a way to let us develop for it.<br/>_________________<br/>my blog:

The 3DS is really interesting though. I keep on looking at screenshots and thinking that they're very low resolution, but forgetting that it actually renders games at 800x240 not 400x240. I'm really excited about the possibility of homebrew in 3DS mode, although that could be a long way off.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was gonna answer this a certain way, but I began to think about it a little more. Even though it is 400 pixels for each eye to make up that 800 during the 3D effect, the translation of the two blended together in the brain could make it actually better than the simple 400 horizontal pixels people would think. And what about when the 3D effect isn't being used? Could that effectively make use of it as if it were 800 horizontal pixels?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was also thinking that perhaps in 2D mode we'd be able to see the full 800x240.
<br/>
<br/>
However the way I think it actually works is no matter whether you're using 2D or 3D mode, the pixel positions and parallax barriers always stay in the same position and each eye will always see a different set of 400 pixel columns. Then the slider just adjusts the distance in software between each of the 2 perspectives that the 3D scene in rendered in. In 2D mode, since the 2 perspectives will be in the same position, column 1 will end up being the same as column 2, 3 with 4 e.t.c, and the 2 eyes will see the same thing just on different sets of columns.
<br/>
<br/>
That's my guess anyways! If I'm wrong and in 2D mode we can see the whole 800 columns, the width of each pixel would need to be half of it's length if they're all to fit into a standard widescreen format, that would be some funky looking pixel!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, me and DuoDreamr first went to the Nintendo press conference at the Nokia Theatre on the 15th. Reggie did his presentation as usual...
<br/>
We did briefly have a look at the 3DS at the press conference but they didnt have anything playable there, only "non-interactive demos". After that we had to rush to the shuttle buses going to Sony's press conference (where we got front row seats right in the middle of the stage).
<br/>
<br/>
We did get to try the 3DS some more at the show, but they only had 2 playable games; Star fox 64 and some baseball game. The rest was "non-interactive demos". The Mario Kart 3DS demo looked really good in 3D...as did the Kirby demo. I had a closer look at the 3D effect in the Kirby demo...and from what I could see...the 3D effect was either on or off...the slider thing didnt seem to have any effect other than to turn the effect on or off in that demo.
<br/>
<br/>
We also tried taking 3D pictures with the unit. Fun, sure, but I wasn't really impressed by the quality or the viewing angle. I see the viewing angle to be the biggest problem with the 3DS.....you really have to be directly in front of the screen or you wont see much at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Over all though it looks OK, and I can't wait to play Mario Kart 3DS :)))

As good as Command was, I did not care for all-range mode all-the-time.

Anyways, while I'm very excited about the 3DS, there are some conflicting technology in it, such as the 3D effect conflicting with the gyroscope.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I didn't have a WOW moment but it looked promising for sure. I think the playable alpha was just about controlling a spacecraft and shooting enemies flying by.
<br/>
<br/>
We weren't allowed to take pics of the 3DS with any demos or games running ("if you want to take pics, we have to turn the units off first") but we managed to take 1 picture of the 3DS after we took a 3D photo (of me...and DuoDreamr in the corner) and then I took a picture out on the show floor when some NOA guy was walking around with a 3DS and DuoDreamr stopped him and tried the demo it had on it...

Considering that the DS had a horizontal resolution of 256, most developers went with the 512x256 when dealing with scrolling and adding newer parts of an image, level, etc. With the 3DS having a 320x240 screen (let's forgo the 400x240x2 top screen  for this), I'd say the 256x256 layout, if it still exists, would mostly be used for backgrounds that repeat, or they could use windowing or set it as an affine BG to prevent the repeating. I would assume that with the talk from developers of the 3DS having a lot of memory to work with, the need for having such layouts would probably not be there, or used.
<br/>
<br/>
Heck, they could even just have DS games emulated if the system is that powerful enough, so they could forgo even needing DS hardware inside the unit. I thought I read an article some time back about it emulating the DS while having room to spare, but I'm not sure if that was in a rumor connected with the Tegra chip.

The difference between consoles and handhelds is becoming smaller with each generation. I will say that my most enjoyable times with video games was with the NES and SNES.
<br/>
<br/>
While I think 2D graphics will be gone in the future, 2D gaming will still live, even if it is displayed as 3D. The problem I see is that some people and developers think that sophisticated gameplay is the future, when a game is meant to just be fun. That's probably why iPhone apps are somewhat popular, because they aren't over-the-top.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree, but I think this is an age thing.  My sister thinks any sort of commercial 2D gaming pursuits are crazy.  She was born in 1990.  My younger cousins also prefer 3D and draw a distinction between 2D and 3D gaming.

Agree, but so far as I can tell Nintendo isn't wholeheartedly behind the whole digital distribution thing.  FWIW, the timing of the transition is probably of critical importance to them, as they presumably have a whole lot of capital tied up in factories and whatnot.  I think Apple is the only player who wants an exceedingly fast game at this point.

Yes.  In any case, this would be consistent with modern console release strategies.  Not doing so would be suicide.  I don't expect developers to down spec games except at first (unless the 3DS flops).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
