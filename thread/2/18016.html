    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I couldn't find an introduction forum or introduction thread anywhere so I decided to make a thread and introduce myself. My name is NeonHB and today I registered here because of certain doubts that I have regarding Visual HAM and perhaps other related stuff. I'll probably post about that in a more detailed manner later if I don't figure it out or find a workaround. For now I just want to say hi. Hi.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nonetheless, those of us that are still around are happy to help. (Although many of us know little or nothing about Visual HAM, most of the discussion here focuses on the DevkitPro toolchain, using C and possibly bits of assembly)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I see. The site does seem a bit drowsy.  Thanks for the welcoming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
