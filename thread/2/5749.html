I ment more of an integrated mp3 player, like the one on the PSP. I understand that the GBA can <span style="font-style: italic">be made</span> to play music, but I'm not interested in something that ties up my flashcart, requires me to reburn the flashcart to get new songs, sacrifice quality, and limit me to 32MB of music. I want something where I can plug it into my computer, copy over at least 256MB of mp3s (and maybe OGGs or FLACs) at USB 2.0 speeds, and <span style="font-style: italic">go</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
And if this thing doesn't do that out of the box, I'm not interested. I already have a DS and a SP, I see no reason in spending more money, especially when I wil be spending enough cash on a PS3 and Revo (I'm on the fence about the 360)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you want a mp3 player, you'd better buy a USB Thumbstick wma / mp3 one. They are dirt cheap and do well the job. I myself have one + a ipod shuffle and they are both OK. Anyway, I think that a console is made to be plaid on and a mp3 player is made to be listen to. That said, I dont get people who listen to mp3s off of a GBA or watch movies on a GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, it's way smaller.

People who already own a flash cart and who like to regularly swap out the games on their flash cart are also likely to be people who like to regularly swap out the music on their flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
As for movies, on the other hand, some parents who have already given an 80 USD GBA SP to their kids would rather make several 30 USD purchases (GBA Video paks, 45 minutes each in length, purchased 2 at a time) than one 150 USD purchase (DVD Video player to use with already purchased DVD Video titles).

<br/>
It's not just the paycheck to paycheck thing -- as a parent, I certainly think a bit longer before giving my 8 year old something small enough to lose that costs $150.  But, if he loses a $15-$20 cart, no big deal.  
<br/>
<br/>
That's a big part of the reason why my son never gets to borrow my flash cart -- even if I'm not using it at the time.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, we went the alternative way -- we got a car with a DVD player in it.  We get to use our already purchased movies, everyone can see it that needs to (i.e, the kids), and it won't get lost under the couch, left a friends house, ran over by the car/bike/mailman, etc, etc, etc. :D
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I relalised that I didn't even comment on the topic at hand, which is why I came here in the first place :)
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think the Micro is a pretty nice piece of hardware.  If I wasn't planning on getting a DS, a Micro would definetly be in my future.  But, as it stands right now, it's not enough to get me to replace my SP.
<br/>
<br/>
I do prefer the horizontal layout of the Micro and original GBA, though.  If I didn't already have the SP, I would probably spring for the Micro over the SP.  Even though the screen is smaller, the buttons/joypad are spaced further apart than they are on the SP.  The micro won't be as hand cramping as the SP.<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

actually, he doesn't have a DS -- he wants one, but we've pretty much told him that he has to save his money to get it.
<br/>
<br/>
And as for losing it, he has misplaced his SP so many times, it's ridiculous. Luckily, he hasn't lost it someplace outside the house/car.  The latest time, it was missing for a whole month :O

I like the fact that if the screen's smaller, it'll be sharper. And after the DS I'm sure it'll be brighter and nicer too - just what the doctor ordered. I have big hands, but I experience no discomfort playing on tiny systems (small mobiles, SP, etc).

As long as it doesn't go for extortionate prices, and has a headphone port and the dongle/charger included, I'm sure I'll pick one up the day it comes out in the US (I live in the UK so I'll import it - it'd probably actually be even cheaper that way too thanks to the great exchange rate we're having, and have had for the past year or so).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I like how Nintendo is aiming towards the "fashion-concious" consumers. Hopefully if they have a wide range of interchangable faceplates (you know third parties will make their own like crazy if it's successful), they will attract more and more people. Just pay some popular music stars to walk around with one in their own faceplates, and watch the sales rise. 
<br/>
<br/>
Similar to that commercial where "Puff Daddy" gets a flat tire or something and has to arrive to an awards ceremony in a Pepsi truck, then everyone and their grandma is driving a pepsi truck with 45" rims (ok, exaggeration). 
<br/>
<br/>
I'd have to look at the faceplates first to see if I even want to buy one (a faceplate that is), but I like to keep things plain and simple and will probably just stick with the default look.

I can't even count how many times I've smashed my GC controller into the wall because of that piece of crap excuse for a d-pad... (And the Dreamcast's also)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You forgot the link to "this controller" which is an arcade size joystick.

The latter. Nintendo recommends strongly against trying to play tilt sensor games because the GameCube has moving parts: fans and an optical drive. Same with sun sensors and cameras; the fans and optical drives are designed to work in a position that may not be the best for receiving light. GBA Video, on the other hand, needs a cheat device to bypass the check which was put there for copy prevention.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

wait -- are they really trying to prevent people from copying video that is formatted for the GBA onto a videotape?  Why would anyone even bother?  Just recording the stuff off TV or possibly copying a DVD would be much easier, and will look much much better.<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
