I can't seem to find it and I'd like to see which threads I am watching but haven't gotten a reply recently.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">On the main forums page in the top left there is a link called "View Your Posts". This searched the forum and gives you a list of all your posts, starting with the most recent, and lists the number of replys for each one. This should be what you're looking for. I think they also have the icons to represent new posts and such there.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT- confirmed. They do have the icons.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

Thank you for pointing that out though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
