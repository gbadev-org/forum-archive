    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I heard tell that Nintendo had announced a Smash Bros. for the DS was in development, but I heard that once and have since been un-able to find any information on it. (I keep pulling up the homebrew attempt that was canceled instead, or info on Smash Bros. Brawl.) Does anyone have info on this? I am genuinely interested.
