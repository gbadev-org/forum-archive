You do know that theres SD card memory adapters for the Gamecube right? I'm thinking this might be easier to get if you had a choice it and what you mentioned.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Dood77 on Fri May 18, 2007 10:35 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

My wording got a little screwed up there earlier, I corrected it in the quote above... But it seems you got my meaning.
<br/>
<br/>
True, someone would have to already have some SD oriented DS homebrew hardware, but the majority of homebrew users do I would think... And it wouldn't have to be a slot-2 device, there are microSD slot-1 devices, and I rarely see a microSD card sold that doesn't come with a full-size adapter. And as for the availability of this SD adapter for Gamecube... its actually not originally homebrew hardware, they were commercially available and third-party manufactured, advertising the ability to expand using SD cards you might already have, and trade saves on the internet. After their release, a homebrew developer released a (rather lengthly) Action Replay code to boot unsigned code from the memory card slot, and voila! Gamecube homebrew without a mod chip.
<br/>
<br/>
But anyway if you're actually considering this, I would buy one of said SD readers to try it out!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

True, 51 percent is technically a majority, but we leave out DS-X users, G6 users, GBAMP CF users, SuperCard CF users, and M3 CF users.

The popular SLOT-1 devices such as R4 do <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> allow reading or writing the file system after the user reinserts the card into the powered-on DS. So you would need to use something like savsender, which needs a Wi-Fi access point and a PC-based server (which must be ported to Windows, Macintosh, and Linux) to copy between the DS Game Card's flash chip and an SD card in a USB drive connected to the PC. Every additional piece of hardware limits the audience.

But how much does this AR plus SD adapter cost?

I think either you've seen Datel's latest bundle, or you understood me wrong. The SD reader was originally sold by itself, advertised for SD compatibility with saves and online trading of saves. (I actually found out just now that it was originally manufactured and sold by nintendo, but it wasn't localized I don't think) There have been other third party ones that work as well but the ones that used to be in stores are pretty well defunct now. The one I saw that is cheapest and recommended by most Gamecube homebrewers is called Gecko. It can be found on ebay for around $15 + shipping. Obviously with what we're talking about here the AR would be useless. (Unless you wanted to cheat in your AC:DS indirectly, using the original AC)
<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, Datel recently released a package that comes with an "SD media launcher", a 1GB SD card, an SD USB adapter, and a disc for launching on Wii/Gamecube. Most places sell this for around 30$. I read also that this method has less homebrew compatibility (now where have we seen that before??) because it uses a clone of the SD card loader software, and most homebrew was designed for the homebrew-developed one.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
