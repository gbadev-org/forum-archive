<br/>
Tue Oct 24 2006 21:58:51 Hong Kong Time - Corporate Info
<br/>
<br/>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - OUT OF BUSINESS NOTICE
<br/>
<br/>
Hong Kong, October 24th of 2006 - Lik-Sang.com, the popular gaming retailer from Hong Kong, has today announced that it is forced to close down due to multiple legal actions brought against it by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Limited and Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. Sony claimed that Lik-Sang infringed its trade marks, copyright and registered design rights by selling Sony PSP consoles from Asia to European customers, and have recently obtained a judgment in the High Court of London (England) rendering Lik-Sang's sales of PSP consoles unlawful.
<br/>
<br/>
As of today, Lik-Sang.com will not be in the position to accept any new orders and will cancel and refund all existing orders that have already been placed. Furthermore, Lik-Sang is working closely with banks and PayPal to refund any store credits held by the company, and the customer support department is taking care of any open transactions such as pending RMAs or repairs and shipping related matters. The staff of Lik-Sang will make sure that nobody will get hurt in the crossfire of this ordeal.
<br/>
<br/>
A Sony spokesperson declined to comment directly on the lawsuit against Lik-Sang, but recently went on to tell Gamesindustry.biz that "ultimately, we're trying to protect consumers from being sold hardware that does not conform to strict EU or UK consumer safety standards, due to voltage supply differences et cetera; is not - in PS3's case - backwards compatible with either PS1 or PS2 software; will not play European Blu-Ray movies or DVDs; and will not be covered by warranty".
<br/>
<br/>
Lik Sang strongly disagrees with Sony's opinion that their customers need this kind of protection and pointed out that PSP consoles shipped from Lik-Sang contained genuine Sony 100V-240V AC Adapters that carry CE and other safety marks and are compatible world wide. All PSP consoles were in conformity with all EU and UK consumer safety regulations.
<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, Sony have failed to disclose to the London High Court that not only the world wide gaming community in more than 100 countries relied on Lik-Sang for their gaming needs, but also Sony Europe's very own top directors repeatedly got their Sony PSP hard or software imports in nicely packed Lik-Sang parcels with free Lik-Sang Mugs or Lik-Sang Badge Holders, starting just two days after Japan's official release, as early as 14th of December 2004 (more than nine months earlier than the legal action). The list of PSP related Sony Europe orders reads like the who's who of the videogames industry, and includes Ray Maguire (Managing Director, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd), Alan Duncan (UK Marketing Director, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd), Chris Sorrell (Creative Director, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd), Rob Parkin (Development Director, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Limited), just to name a few.
<br/>
<br/>
"Today is Sony Europe victory about PSP, tomorrow is Sony Europe?s ongoing pressure about PlayStation 3. With this precedent set, next week could already be the stage for complaints from Sony America about the same thing, or from other console manufacturers about other consoles to other regions, or even from any publisher about any specific software title to any country they don?t see fit. It?s the beginning of the end... of the World as we know it", stated Pascal Clarysse, formerly known as the Marketing Manager of Lik-Sang.com.
<br/>
<br/>
"Blame it on Sony. That's the latest dark spot in their shameful track record as gaming industry leader. The Empire finally 'won', few dominating retailers from the UK probably will rejoice the news, but everybody else in the gaming world lost something today."</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Nevertheless it's still bad press for Sony - due to the DRM incident and DVD region codes I am on a Sony boycott anyway. This news item is one more for the long list. Hopefully Sony continues to piss off people so that they actually get to feel the impact of consumers turning away from them, because my lone boycott probably isn't going to make them recant their ways.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The difference is that Sony invented region codes on DVDs (afaik), but MS and nintendo merely followed suit. Also, Nintendo ditched that nonsense of creating artificial market zones and made the DS regioncode-free.
<br/>
<br/>
Normally I would be on a Microsoft boycott thanks to their snooping into people's computers to find unpaid versions of their programs. The reason why I am not on a Microsoft boycott is that I *need* to use windows. If I weren't dependent on it, I'd boycott them too, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, it would be different if Bill Gates kicked my dog. Since MS's actions didn't adversely affect myself - whereas region codes on DVDs are a big nuisance to me, I'll cut them some slack and still use windows. When it was time to buy a console, I didn't go for a PS2 or X-Box, though, but bought a gamecube instead.
<br/>
<br/>
But basically you are right, if I don't need a product, then it's easier to boycott the company for having a policy I disagree with. I would never boycott the only butcher in town, as I like eating meat - boycotting the guy who sells flying carpets is more my thing :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Making up false movie reviewers to give their movies better ratings, Constantly saling poorly checked hardware, Putting DRM in stuff then offering a "fix" that is even worse, Making up lies about your competition..it goes on and on.

Its utter nonsense.They twist the little bit of technical knowledge people have and use it to make flat-out lies.
<br/>
<br/>
Lik-Sang was a superb shop, I got my DS from there, 5 or so games, and many other imported accessories. I was going to buy a few spare power packs for my DS (future proofing), but now i have to go to Play-Asia.
<br/>
<br/>
As a gameing community we should be FURIOUS with this, as it sets a hugely bad precident that could result in many other sites being shut down. 
<br/>
Sony is all too happy to exploit the free world market to get their products made as cheaply as possible, but they arnt happy at all when people dare to try to get their products imported.
<br/>
Importing, put simply, should be a right. Its is fundimentaly, moraly wrong to restrict world trade they way many companys are now trying, and succeding. 
<br/>
<br/>
Sony has the cheek, to go further though, and pretend its for our own good.
<br/>
Its their non-stop arrogance that makes this all worse.
<br/>
If they just gave honest answeres, it wouldnt nearly be so annoying. ("We want our europen regions to sale more",  "We thought motion controll seemed to be popular so we added it" ect).
<br/>
<br/>
A tiny bit of honesty would get a lot more respect.
<br/>
But nope, we dont get that.

<br/>
<br/>
I mean, what does it take for people to see how badly miss-mangaged and poorly public seriving this company is?  
<br/>
<br/>
They dont even know their a games company, they still see games only as a route to sale other things. (and how blind must you be to the state of games these days to list "Real Time Weapon Change" as a feature worth mentioning)
<br/>
<br/>
All companys do wrong things, of course.
<br/>
<br/>
But Sony has been getting away with a heck of lot more shit then most for quite awhile now.

Wasn't PS2 linux something like $200, and thus never really got any wide adoptance? I think most homebrew developers would rather pay $50 (maybe even less? I never had a PS2) for a modchip, which unfortunately has the side effect of also allowing piracy. If these companies would just open up a legit cheap way of doing homebrew, it would remove the homebrew excuse from modchippers, and may actually reduce piracy.
<br/>
<br/>
Back on subject: Yes, closing lik-sang is a bummer, but they stopped offering homebrew dev devices a long time ago, and there are still many other import shops, so I wouldn't say it's a big blow to the average consumer. Interesting to note is that lik-sang didn't even show up for their court case, so they must know that they are in the wrong, and no point to fight? Also, that bit about releasing personal info does make them look a bit bad.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not necessarily. It's like saying that someone is guilty for going on the run. The courts allowed amazon have their one click buy mechanism (which is complete nonsense), and they also allowed the T9 patent, so would you be confident in a courtcase against sony when you know that the courts allow stupid rulings.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lik-sang were at a disadvantage from the start since they are a Hong Kong(?) based company and the court case took place in London, UK. How many small companies or individuals can afford to defend themselves in a foreign country under a foreign legal system?
<br/>
<br/>
I feel that the villian of the piece is not so much Sony but the UK legal system. How can providing a means to import for private individuals be breaching Sony?s intellectual property rights but that is the precedence that has been set up. In a similar stupid precedent, mod-chips are illegal in the UK  as they bypass copy protection mechanisms, so UK residents (it is illegal to possess a mod-chip apparently) lose the ablity to play import games and are restricted to the software companies provide for them since most games consoles are region protected (UK citizens are not protected against such protection existing in a product - is region protection illegal in Australia?).
<br/>
The UK consumer is already protected against faulty and dangerous goods and these laws/rulings do not provide additional protection for the citizens or the state of the UK, which, in my opinion, should be the focus of a countries laws not the companies that operate there.

If companies are given these legal mechanisms then they will use them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
