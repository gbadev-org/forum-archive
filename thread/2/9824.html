Games will cost US$4.50 to US$8.99. In my opinion thats a bit high :-( I would like to play Mario on my Rev, but i hoped it would cost me 2-4$ :-(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Whats more important to me is good organisation of the games to be honest.
<br/>
<br/>
This is what Nintendo wont do, but they should:
<br/>
<br/>
*Anyone that buys a game can leave comments and a rateing for it out of ten
<br/>
*Anyone that completes the game can rate it again out of ten, and that rateing is weighted more.
<br/>
<br/>
When browseing games you can then order by rateing, and also look at comments.
<br/>
<br/>
Think about it, there could be hundreds,possibly thousands of gams on this system. How do you find a good one to play?
<br/>
We probably all know a few we want to get straight away, but I'm also interested in discovering new stuff :)
<br/>
<br/>
This applys even more to new downloadable games.
<br/>
Indie and small scale games shouldnt need to advertise or spend on premotion, it would be fastastic if they earnt their reputation and position on the download list by how much people enjoyed playing them.
<br/>
<br/>
You could have a "best of the week", "best of the month" thing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo probably wont do this, but they should.
<br/>
A "newgrounds" of games, effectively.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

I may not be "most people", but you should see my NES, SNES, GB and PS game selection.  The PS games have cases, but most of carts are without boxes and manuals because I buy cheap used games.

The software is illegal last time I checked.  The hardware is legal.  I'd like to see a unit that boots off carts plus some other standard media.  The old Hong Kong backup units are rare and expensive and are probably antiquated at this point.  Admittedly, I don't have a use for such a device- hence "see"ing it would be neat.
