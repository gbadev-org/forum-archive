    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well first off I'm going to need to find the capture thing so I can capture the demos. I usally go to gamestop about every week once or twice a week. I'll look on google for a capture thing to capture em. Then I'll take my laptop over to gamestop and capture the demos. I found a media and a real trackers for getting the media demos and a wireless sniffer for getting the mac address and the frames and beacons. NVM, that site was for linux open suse and GT set wireless drivers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
