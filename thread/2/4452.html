    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">12 days ago, I sent Martin $15 US via Paypal to get a copy of the no$gba debugger, home-use edition.  The money was cashed within an hour of my sending it.  However, since then, I have received <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">no</span></span> other communications from Martin:  No e-mails, no messages, and <span style="font-style: italic">no debugger</span>.  I have sent him e-mails at intervals of 4 days each, asking about the status of it, and I have not received replies to any of my e-mails.
<br/>
<br/>
Rather than send yet another ignored e-mail, I'm posting publicly here.  Has anyone contacted Martin recently?  Is he alive?  Is there any liklihood that I will ever receive a copy of the debugger?
<br/>
<br/>
At this point, I'm about four days away from initiating the Paypal "buyer complaint process" --- I've paid money but received nothing in return and am starting to get very frustrated with the utter lack of customer service I've received.  Two weeks with no communication is too long.
<br/>
<br/>
Martin, if you see this and would care to reply via e-mail, I read my mail every day at <a href="mailto:inker2576@yahoo.com">inker2576@yahoo.com</a> and am frequently signed onto Yahoo Instant Messenger as inker2576 as well.
<br/>
<br/>
(Edit:  Apparently, having read the "Cheat and Win" forum for no$gba, this has been a problem before with other buyers:  Martin, why does it take upwards of a month to purchase something that can be sent in e-mail?)<br/>_________________<br/>Do you suppose if I put a signature here, anyone would read it?  No?  I didn't think so either.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe the disks are being stopped(/stolen) by customs =D that kept happening when my friend ordered stock from Bangkok and he was recieving packages stamped as confirmed by customs filled with paper.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The money was transferred out of Paypal, into <span style="font-style: italic">somebody's</span> bank account within an hour after I sent it, two weeks ago Thursday; <span style="font-style: italic">somebody</span> has that money now, and it's neither Paypal nor I.  But at the time the money was transferred, the only communication I received was from Paypal, indicating that the money had been transferred.  Nothing from Korth.

Maybe, but given that Korth lives in Germany and I live in the U.S., it's pretty unlikely.  The customs agents in both countries are pretty upstanding.

<br/>
Well, the e-mails included "no$gba" in the title, as his web site requested, and were hand-written with different text each time.  If his spam controls are that strict, he probably needs to change them.  I should not have to send multiple e-mails from multiple addresses to get <span style="font-style: italic">one</span> message to him.  Moreover, it would've been appropriate to hear at least <span style="font-style: italic">something</span> from him when he cashed my payment, dontcha think?

<br/>
Too busy for paying customers?  That's a good way to lose business.  This kind of word-of-mouth is probably not good for him, but there are a limited number of things I can do beyond what I've already done to try to get him to communicate.<br/>_________________<br/>Do you suppose if I put a signature here, anyone would read it?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm sure it's just a simple misunderstanding. If you PM me some details such as your name etc I can try e-mailing him from my address to tell him about your account. Then at least we'll know if it's the spam filters or not.

<br/>
You never know, he might be on holiday or something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
seems that Martin isn't the fastest regarding his customer care ? I did a money transfer via bank account one week and a few days ago and sent him three mails from different accounts (private account and company account)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm living in Germany, same City as Martin and we got our Accounts at the same Bank !
<br/>
<br/>
No reply up to now. May be he is on vacation, but he just released no$gba 2.2 a few days ago. OK, may be he is out of office due to consultant job or something like this, but nevertheless a short eMail reply should be no problem at all.
<br/>
<br/>
It is really hard that the customers, or at least people wanting be become one got so much problems to get in contact with Martin.
<br/>
<br/>
Even if it is 2006 now, did you get your copy phantom-inker ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This morning I got no$gba from Martin !
<br/>
<br/>
Seems that he couldn't check his bank account online and thus there might be always a delay of a few days.
<br/>
<br/>
Got two mails from him, he's a nice guy and one couldn't be angry with him.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
