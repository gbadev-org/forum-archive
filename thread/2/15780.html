    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have recently started using code::blocks as one of my IDEs. 
<br/>
<br/>
The line #include &lt;cstdlib&gt; gives me a "no such file or directory" error. I have never had to do anything special to use that file before. Why is this happening?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No errors for me (I assume an NDS project, right? Well, even for Win32 programs I don't get the error!) I have the (as of writing) most recent devkitARM and libs installed and I am using the stable version 8.02 of C::B released Feb. 2008.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually it is just win32, sorry I forgot to mention that. Thanks for trying. I am very confused. I am still inexperienced with some simple things (I am sure it is something simple). I have just never had an IDE tell me that it wouldn't find one of the standard library files. Hopefully I will figure it out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You may just have not installed MinGW correctly (it's simple though...)
<br/>
Did you succeed in compiling anything?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, because this has nothing to do with C::B. ;^)
<br/>
Just download the IDE and compiler (MinGW) pack (C::B 8.02) and it should be fine.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released
