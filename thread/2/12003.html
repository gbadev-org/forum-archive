    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok guys Im going to give you some clues on what I can remember you will proberly be able to guess it after this. I cannot remember it is almost 2 years ago since I lost it somewhere and I want to buy it back but I don't know the name so could someone please tell me thanks.
<br/>
(not in order)
<br/>
ok its an rpg (im pretty sure) its for GBA and its really addictive hard and fun ^_^
<br/>
<br/>
Ok it started off right your on a bridge and these guys come and you end up falling off trying to save a girl or soemthing and then you get found in this meadow by this man or something and thats how it starts off. You come to this draclulas castle thingy and you have to go inside and its sorta freaky but you meet the girl when you get out your running throught the forest and you bump into her and you both tell you that you love eachother and then you go on a quest together. You can grow weird things I think a big clue would be something called a celeryspade which is like the most rare most important thing for putting on weapons. theres lots of monsters around and you have to travel everywhere to find this guy i think. Im sorry I cant remember much. oh yeah you fight this huuge plant thing in a cave and its really hard umm god everything is so blank i hope i have given you enough clues.
<br/>
all i need is the name and I can buy it from a store. but yeah i cant remember. thanks. oh yeah I remember one other thing theres this castle you to go near this desert meadow place and its got lots of brown grass and you and the girl go there but i cant remember why...
<br/>

Whoa, I'm a little shocked that I didn't recognize that from the (admittedly spastic) description. I guess it was the Celeryspade that threw me off... that must be something from the Sword of Mana remake (which I've attempted to forget as best I can).
<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, if you're ever interested in exploring the roots of that game, see if you can't find a copy of Final Fantasy Adventure for the original (!) Gameboy. Graphics and gameplay obviously can't compete with the GBA, but back in the day that was like The Little Game That Could.
