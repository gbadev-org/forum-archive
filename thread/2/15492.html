gameplay, entities, stages, resources... "what makes a game."

make it two pages in word, should be enough. :^D
<br/>
there are some design document guides on the net, too.
<br/>
<br/>
let's say "donkey kong" meets "love parade" (that's not a game) meets "metroid" ... could go on like that.
<br/>
<br/>
just make it simple. ;^D

you should also list team positions, so that we can decide who will do what and if we need anyone else in the team. (you may include inspiration as well!)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Go for it! Mario-style games are great fun and will teach you a lot of useful things. One suggestion: don't take it too seriously. Just whip stuff together and don't worry if the collision detection isn't perfect, or your data formats could be more efficient.
<br/>
<br/>
Check <a class="postlink" href="http://deku.gbadev.org/program/oiram.zip" target="_blank">this</a> out (might need <a class="postlink" href="http://deku.gbadev.org/program/alleg40.zip" target="_blank">alleg40.dll</a> in windows\system). Created from nothing in 2 days of awesome high-speed typing and scribbling, including a 300 line function that reaches no less than 12 levels of indentation. Enemies are a bitmap and an entry in a code table, tilesets are a tall, 1 tile wide bitmap, and maps are an 8-bit bitmap (the game just interprets the color index of each pixel as a tile number) and an array of enemy positions. Who needs a level editor?<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

<span style="color: darkblue"><span style="font-weight: bold">%%Jorge the French Superplumber%%</span></span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Enemies</span>
<br/>
?	Chimpan-Z?s: First level they walk towards you. Second roll barrels. Third throw poo. Fourth roll barrel, throw poo, and charge at you if they miss.
<br/>
?	The 1337s: Guys that jump around, and have sunglasses on because they think they are 1337, lol.
<br/>
?	Scissor runners: crazy little men that charge at you with wildly snipping scissors. If they miss you they trip and land on the scissors.
<br/>
?	Demon toilets: Fake toilets that chase you if you come close enough.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Level Design</span>
<br/>
?	Similar to classic Mario, boxes with coins in them.
<br/>
?	At the end of each level you can but stuff with your accumulated money.
<br/>
?	Pools of radioactive waste rather than pits, if you fall in you die (maybe fly out all malformed and stuff, then walk off screen in a cut scene?)
<br/>
?	Boss on the last level of each world. Lvl 1 will have a crazy forum troll. He shoots spam balls at you and rains flam from the sky every once and a while.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Items</span>
<br/>
?	First thing you find is your plunger. It is down a toilet in the first level.
<br/>
?	You can buy a poo launcher at the end of a level once you get enough money.
<br/>
?	You can find lives throughout levels in some boxes, or buy at the end of each level for 100 coins each
<br/>
?	More time is also available at the end of the level, 1 coin = 1 second.
<br/>
?	3rd level there is a toilet with a spam ball technique in it. (should it shoot straight or bounce like classic fireballs?)
<br/>
?	You can change weapons in the start menu, just text (funnier that way with our totally conventional weapon setup)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">You</span>
<br/>
?	You are Mario?s brother; Jorge the Superplumber.
<br/>
?	You are on a quest to rescue your mail order wife from the clutches of the chimpan-Z overlord (a child eating super pooing sad troll panda, maybe?)
<br/>
?	Pipes are for sissies, you flush yourself down toilets to find treasure underground.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

it's a first rough sketch. ;^D
<br/>
<br/>
i think we should go more into the konkey kong direction with gameplay. it's quite easy to implement. jorge could also shoot some stuff... "stuff".
<br/>
maybe the big C'im-Pan-Z should throw turd balls! ;^D

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, what else should I include in that thing? I got a rough outline on the first page, but I am pretty sure I need a lot more. And you said we should go with a donkey kong-ish approach... could you elaborate? Do you mean like the arcade one, or like the gameboy color sidescroller? I think I see where you might be going with this though... awesome drawing btw =).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#156032 - silent_code - Tue May 06, 2008 1:04 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i mean more like the early arcade, where Mario was called "jump man". :^) it should be a multiscreen vertical jump and run.
<br/>
<br/>
Jorge should be Mario's kinky cousin. ;^D
<br/>
<br/>
... and in mere minutes i have come up with this:
<br/>
behold, for the earth stands still when he arrives:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://home.pages.at/rebirthband/jorge/c_im-pan-z.png" target="_blank"> C'im-Pan-Z</a>, evil emperor of the Chimpan Z'z and child eating troll monkey!
<br/>
<br/>
the leet guys should be harry potter like haxor wizzards throwing <span style="font-style: italic">teh</span> "1337", "rofl", "omg!" etc. words at you! much like kamek. only, wielding an msn passwort hacking usb stick and instead of potter's lightning bold mark, they have an L (now, what would *that* stand for?) or alternatively a "0x" or "lol" or "teh". :^)
<br/>
<br/>
... and i like the scissor guys, really great!
<br/>
<br/>
btw: this goes all into the DD.
<br/>
<br/>
we will have to go for low animation count. first step would be to have Jorge running around a room. then add some shooting / throwing stuff (if gameplay requires it). after that we'll have to build in ladders and platforms. then come the boss on the top, throwing stuff (he could even have a diarrhea spray attack or something! think "particles", lots (i typically simulate around 2k) of particles!) and after that the other enemies. in the end we would glue the stuff together with game screens.
<br/>
<br/>
sounds and music should also come in there somewhere. :^D my brother has a small recording studio, so i could record some sounds, if we get that far.
<br/>
<br/>
input should be done for r/l handed ppl.
<br/>
left/right - move
<br/>
up - jump / ladder up
<br/>
down - ladder down
<br/>
stylus - aim
<br/>
trigger - shoot / throw
<br/>
<br/>
i guess fighting games, cool as they are, require too much animation. we should really go for something that could be done in like 1 - 3 months (remember, this is just an exercise!)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">ATTENTION</span>:
<br/>
<br/>
maybe we should look for a graphics artist that can turn the sketches into more cuddly characters (but still quite gay / evil)? then i could concentrate on coding. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
can someone recommend an nds map editor? (not actually *running* on the nds.) so far i've used cearn's Mirach, but it seems he's discontinued it. :^C
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
i have an idea for a shooting device: a water gun (think "super soaker") sized <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enema" target="_blank">Enema</a>!
<br/>
much like super mario sunshine... only filled with "love". ;?p
<br/>
i'm going to revice jorge and make him blond. there's no blonde mario character (besides peach!), right? ;^D
<br/>
i guess, he need a less "hardcore" look, too.
<br/>
<br/>
at the beginning of a level, he should "come out of the closet". ;^D
<br/>
his ultimate goal should be to save the children of thw world from C'im-Pan-Z's evildoers!
<br/>
<br/>
i really like these:
<br/>
- Pipes are for sissies, you flush yourself down toilets to find treasure underground.
<br/>
- Pools of radioactive waste rather than pits
<br/>
<br/>
if we should decide to put in some super powers later on, i imagine we could make something like smw2 (or was it 3?) and give him different outfits for different powers. like those in the village people's YMCA. X^D
<br/>
<br/>
i've also made up another possible boss: he's got the body of Godzilla and the head of Al Gore (i don't care about politics and i'm european, so please don't interpret this in any way) - it's Gore-Zilla! ("It's Man-Bear-Pig! I told you it was real!") i guess it also needs a red cape. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT, AGAIN: knocked up a quick and clean <a class="postlink" href="http://home.pages.at/rebirthband/jorge/index.html" target="_blank">page</a>. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
once we decide what the game will be like, i'll start coding. i'm ready when you are.

well, feel free to post your ideas, Bean_xp! your help is welcome! :^D
<br/>
share your experiences with us, so we get to know you (and therefore your skills) a little better.
<br/>
<br/>
i would concentrate on graphics (the first stage should have a paris theme!) and just help out with coding. being a reverse "technical artist" (a programmer, whose programmer art sucks less than average?) is a "person who changes partners *very* frequently"...
<br/>
<br/>
i was kind of going into a more adult comedy style. ;^)
<br/>
anyway, kids don't play hb, they play romz! ;^p
<br/>
<br/>
i'm for the a bit rougher humor, because that's what got all of this started (a mokey throwing crap at you, the gay plumber with the gigantic enema...). taking away any of it will kind of take away the appeal. :^D
<br/>
seriously, i have worse ideas than a cartoon "pickle". (nothing graphic! kids wouldn't even know what they are looking at! just like in the simpsons etc., where you understand so much more when you're older.) ;^D
<br/>
<br/>
so, who's got the ballozos to do what they want? (wow, how biased was that? it's just my humor! :^D ) and who's for more kid friendly content? :^)

Edit: 2 Posts since I started typing this (you guys move fast) - A Donkey Kong clone doesn't seem to be too much work (I guess?) Perhaps once that is done other 'levels' could be included. Maybe a game like "Mario Bros." could be included (The arcade game).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All right, sounds like a plan. I have edited the design doc a bit, added in a few things I heard and whatnot. And if you guys want I am game for expanding this when we finish the basics =).
<br/>
<br/>
%%Jorge the French Superplumber%%
<br/>
<br/>
Enemies
<br/>
?	Chimpan-Z?s: First level they walk towards you. Second roll barrels. Third throw poo. Fourth roll barrel, throw poo, and charge at you if they miss.
<br/>
?	The 1337s: Now changed to silent?s sweet idea: These guys are going to be Harry Potter-ish haxor wizards with usb wands and spells that shoot net slang at you (rofl, pwned, noob, 1337, etc.)
<br/>
?	Scissor runners: crazy little men that charge at you with wildly snipping scissors. If they miss you they trip and land on the scissors.
<br/>
?	Demon toilets: Fake toilets that chase you if you come close enough.
<br/>
?	Any death involves plenty of blood and the like, courtesy of silent?s system.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     Level Design
<br/>
?	*Arcade style, c?impan Z throws stuff down at you
<br/>
?	Pools of radioactive waste rather than pits, if you fall in you die (maybe fly out all malformed and stuff, then walk off screen in a cut scene?)
<br/>
?	Boss on the last level of each world. Lvl 1 will have a crazy forum troll. He shoots spam balls at you and rains flam from the sky every once and a while.
<br/>
?	Occasional toilet midway up the level (1 or 2 each world) with powerups or a new weapon in it. (haxor wand, 1 use ROFL BOMB, enema, lol, spam ball shooter, and anything else you guys can think of)
<br/>
<br/>
     Items
<br/>
?	First thing you find is your plunger. It is down a toilet in the first level.
<br/>
?	Poo launcher?
<br/>
?	Maybe a plumbers snake as a whip
<br/>
?	Another early weapon could be the enema, rather than the plunger?lol
<br/>
?	You can find lives throughout levels occasionally.
<br/>
?	3rd level there is a toilet with a spam ball technique in it. (should it shoot straight or bounce like classic fireballs?)
<br/>
?	You can change weapons in the start menu, just text (funnier that way with our totally conventional weapon setup)
<br/>
<br/>
     You
<br/>
?	You are Mario?s brother; Jorge the Superplumber.
<br/>
?	You are on a quest to rescue your mail children of the world from the evil reign of the chimpan-Z overlord
<br/>
?	Pipes are for sissies, you flush yourself down toilets to find treasure underground.
<br/>
<br/>
     The Team
<br/>
?	We have 3 ppl on the programming so we will need to split it up.
<br/>
o	Level design
<br/>
o	Sprites
<br/>
o	Sound (is this an ok setup for you guys, or is there a better way to do it?)
<br/>
?	We need someone specifically for graphics and art
<br/>
?	I got the design covered mostly, but help is welcome
<br/>
?	Anything I haven?t thought of? any help or suggestions are welcome!
<br/>
<br/>
Should I try and whip up an outline of the first level in paint?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
this should be an exercise on how to do things *right*, not fast!
<br/>
it is very important to *first* design and then create. therefore i call out to first gather ideas and sketches, then talk about limitations, alter the design and when we're done designing, only then should we go create.
<br/>
<br/>
when we're done thinking, we will need some proof of concept tech demo with placeholder graphics to prototype the gameplay.
<br/>
<br/>
anything done earlier may end up being wasted time. we all know where that leads to. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
so, first let's decide what style, conctent, gameplay, characters etc. we want!
<br/>
then we go on and devide tasks more or less evenly across the team members. (i guess we have a team here, right?)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

@bean: true, true. I figure we could spice it up a *little* though. maybe horizontal rather than tilted bars, with enemies on them. When you get near the top (I think we are using both screens, right?) then he could start rolling things. once you get on his level he starts shooting projectiles (explosive diahrreah? lol) at you.

Yeah, I thought that was the new idea to have Chimpan-Z at the top (as in DK).

As for music I think we need a more general style first, but I don't know if we have any musicians on board. I think chiptunes, parodies of other games and the like should fit the (tongue-in-cheek) style of the game though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i also think we need to shift towards a simpler game.
<br/>
<br/>
i was imagining this (pic is coming, too):
<br/>
<br/>
like in the oldschool DK, you need to climb ladders and dodge "things".
<br/>
but rather than simply copying a great original, we'll extend it a bit.
<br/>
<br/>
instead of barrels there will be some nasty stuff thrown by the baddy on top. additionally there will be some enemies places throughout the level.
<br/>
<br/>
but jorge should be able to strike back! that's where the plunge / enema come into play. he can throw plunges and the enema can flush enemies with a nice clean water jet. at least i believe it's water. ;^D
<br/>
water needs to be recharged, plunges are also limited.
<br/>
then there's still the melee attack of neck breaking by jumping on someone's head. ;^D
<br/>
<br/>
we first need to implement the "neck breaker", the other attacks have to remain optional for now (or else this will be going nowhere, i know it!)
<br/>
<br/>
well, jorge will jump, dodge and climb his way up and every time he'll reach the top, the boss will leave the child he was about to eat behind and move one level up (where there's another child). this is when the scrolling happens, otherwise the scene is static.
<br/>
<br/>
the lower screen would be the game screen, the upper would show the next level. this is because, if we want to include some type of stylus action, we have to restrict ourselves to the bottom screen.
<br/>
<br/>
on the last platform (screen) there will be a boss battle, where jorge directly faces the boss. i imagine a crap throwing and spraying monkey... then an enema... what will be the monkeys weak point? how will jorge defeat it? who knows? (it happens so, that i have an idea...)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">one neat gameplay idea: what if the boss gets stronger the longer it takes you to complete a level? he's standing on the top eating stuff and pooping and when you get to the top and disrupt him, he stops building up energy and leaves for the next screen.
<br/>
therefore, when you finally get to the last screen, the boss arena, the amount of his health depends on how fast you were. there would be a certain minimal amount of health (or maybe strength?) that he'd have anyway, to be somewhat chellenging.
<br/>
<br/>
well, that "health rate" would also accumulate throughout the game. if you're not fast enough, the bosses get stronger and stronger, so HURRY, Jorge!!!! :^D
<br/>
<br/>
there should also be some gameplay mechanic that evens this out a bit, so the effect wouldn't get too extreme. good players will always be faster and we wouldn't want to annoy new players.
<br/>
<br/>
also, if we drop stylus input, we can have button jumping. we have to think about weapons. are they really needed? i mean, the ideas we had so far are cool, but think about it for a moment. to what extend would it make sense to have weapons? "jump man" had a hammer, iirc.
<br/>
<br/>
the enema could be reused as a jump booster do jump twice as high, though. again, think super mario sunshine, only a bit kinky. :^D</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by silent_code on Wed May 07, 2008 3:37 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

maybe as a "power up area" (like the little houses with minigames in yoshi's island) that somehow resembles a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottaging" target="_blank">Cottage</a>? could refill some health. (... gta ... you know what i mean, don't you?) i can clearly see use of a rumble pack while Jorge is being "healed" inside such a house...

<br/>
This is true, maybe if you had a difficulty setting the scheme would be ok (I don't really like settings though)
<br/>
<br/>
In terms of the base gameplay, if we are going to stick with a DK style game then I think we should divide it into levels. Something like, you climb the first stage then the chimp jumps up to the top of a new stage, so then you have to climb this new level. Then there could be a boss fight at the end of the stages and you could use the time idea so that the player is rewarded with more powerups or lives the faster the levels were completed (or in-between each level). Or for an alternative idea the screen could advance at a constant rate and it's lose a life or game over if the player falls off the bottom of the stage.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't personally the player needs weapons (if we stay with the platform game format) as they shouldn't really be needed. Infact I don't know if Jorge even needs to attack at all, bosses could be defeated like the switch for the drawbridge in the original "Super Mario Bros.".
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it's important that a length of the game is decided before decisions are made for the style of levels?
<br/>

@all: gingerbread houses would be cool. lol. sick joke, man. enema as a rocket booster sounds funny. bean_xp's right, we need to have an idea of how long the game will be. maybe 10-15 levels? boss every 5 levels? it has to be short-ish, or it will get boring. also, weapons are definently not needed. we could have 3 styles of play in one game, maybe. dk, street fighter, and the screen moving up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
that's exactly what i am talking about! each stage having several levels (screens). :^)
<br/>
<br/>
i'm also for dropping weapons. if we went on making other stages with different gameplay, then we could bring it back, but seriously, we first need to make that DK stage. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
and yes, a SF style game would require waaay too much animation. i don't think fighting fits the gay plumber theme, but we could have something like a maze type of world, like a dungeon... in the sewers (he flushed himself) ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
well, i have also thought about the reverse mechanism. we should put this off for a while, as that is a rather sensible gamplay mechanic. when we have a tech demo, we can make playtest to make further decisions.
<br/>
<br/>
length wise i think 5 screens of bottom up DK jump'n'run action are fine. :^) think paris, think eifel tower... :^)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This would allow a challenge for better players and keep it manageable for new players.

about the tower stage: it should be demolished (and therefore more enteraining and chellenging) by mr poopthrowermonkey! :^D

I agree we need a basic level plan before we can think about anything, I think it should be something like classic DK, spread across both screens (fixed screens, only scrolling for transistions as silent_code said), I don't think there should be any weapons, perhaps if more is needed then a puzzle element could be added (switches to move platforms or something).
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about the name/race of the player but I don't suppose it matters too much.
<br/>
<br/>
As for sketches we need something to show the basic elements of the level before any design document of sorts can be written up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
we also need to decide on a set of actions that the player / enemies can make. that also includes what animations are needed.
<br/>
<br/>
do we want paralax maps? how many and where should they be depth wise?
<br/>
<br/>
btw: i also happen to be a musician... (man, do i feel like a poser), but i haven't done any music for games, yet. i don't think i would do music, but i could make sound effects. ha ha, i just remembered i have done a sound that is quite simmilar to Mario's jump sound (i made it from scratch, no samples used!

I was thinking that we could do horizontal for the bottom screen, and then the more traditional slanted bars for the top one, allowing for some jump-stomping fun but still keeping a classic feel to it. So, Jorge the French (blackanese/french?) Superplumber that has a Spanish name and is Mario's cousin... some sort of paradox. Maybe he went back in time to achieve this?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i think we initially decided on 2d, didn't we?
<br/>
we still don't know who's still *serially* interested in helping out and willing to "donnate" some time and work.
<br/>
if it's just two, there is a chance we can make it, if it's just one, it won't happen.
<br/>
<br/>
as i see it, AN (maps / design) and me (gfx / snd / code) are willing to work on this. who else and under which conditions?
<br/>
this is the step where most projects fail miserably, so we need to get this straight. i'm serial! ;^) we need to organize.
<br/>
<br/>
making content and sketches is easy and fun, building up a team and making a game isn't. so, who's with us?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">please post the following "about me" information here:
<br/>
- what have you already experience with?
<br/>
- what would you like to help with?
<br/>
- what would you like to learn with this project?
<br/>
- maybe some other info. (like age and education, location, if not already available via your profile, etc.)
<br/>
</span>
<br/>
<br/>
i'm starting:
<br/>
<br/>
- obviously, i have some experience with programming, graphics and i have my brother's little recording studio at hand to make sound effects. i haven't made a game or mod, yet, because my interest are more into technology programming and tools. that's what i do most of the time. although i work in the 3rd dimension most of the time, i have also some background in 2d.
<br/>
<br/>
- i would like to help with sounds, and graphics or coding. i can donnate some lines of code, no matter what position i get in the end.
<br/>
<br/>
- i'd finally like to make a little game demo for the nds that doesn't inviolve shooting innocent zombies' heads off (the background in 2d i mentioned earlier.) ;^D
<br/>
i'd also like to make an experience of a team effort succeeding. even if the result is just a cheesy, little (but remotely fun to play) demo. i'd also like to utilize some hw features i haven't done much with in the past (most of the backgrounds stuff.)
<br/>
<br/>
- i'm mid 20, currently studying computer science. i've been programming for &gt;&gt; 5 years in different languages (compiled and interpreted.) i'm also interested in various art forms and i'm a rather average musician. the timezone i'm in is GTM+1.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by silent_code on Tue May 13, 2008 2:36 pm; edited 7 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thats a nice idea, are different 'scenes' going to be different styles of games like discussed or just more of the same styles?
<br/>
<br/>
I think we should go with the different gameplay styles like we discussed. So then we'd need to figure out a style or theme for each scene. I think we already have the style of the first theme with the C'Imp-An-Z idea. So we should probably continue the idea of video game parodies (C'Imp-An-Z is like DK).
<br/>
<br/>
For ideas for other themes, we already said platformer and a scrolling shooter. But what about something different like "duck hunt" or "excitebike" as styles of games just to mix it up a little?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by bean_xp on Sun May 11, 2008 5:48 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

it's sort of fun to try not to get bitten even one time. btw, do you remember what your highscore was?

@ bean_xp: yes, make more gameplay styles. just like a little game demo / mini game compilation with some common elements (character, style, plot etc.)
<br/>
but first we need to get the first edisode done. then we could think about the next one, maybe even post a vote on the forum to ask the folks which idea for an episode they would like to see made next?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sure, so we still need a plot for first episode, or a basis for one so we can expand it in other episodes. Maybe we need to figure out some enemies and different elements to fill each level before we can design the actual layout of the stages, otherwise the game will be Donkey Kong with new level layouts (which isn't necessarily a bad thing).

<br/>
<br/>
Jorge is the usual friendly neighbourhood spi... super plumber.
<br/>
one day he goes to the new circus that came to town (paris!), with his albino indian daughter (you might think "OMG, racewars!" - i see it that way: not all heros are caucasion, not all baddies are colored in the *real* world. sadly that is how most games depict the world. there's too little truely multi cultural games out there.)
<br/>
everything is fine, until the main attraction is exhibited: the mighty evil Troll Monkey from Scat Island: C'Im-Pan-Z! (... now where did i steal that from?)
<br/>
<br/>
he breaks loose and takes some children with them, naturally Jorge's daughter is one of them. he starts to chase CPZ immediately and ends up at the first stage: the Eiffel Tower.
<br/>
<br/>
"but why did CPZ break loose in the first place? come... i mean "tune" in and find out on the next, thrill packed episode of: [generic cereal name goes here]"
<br/>
<br/>
;^D
<br/>
<br/>
ps: he's got a daughter, does it make sense? well, he's not her father, but her mother after a sex change and the daughter still calles him "mommy"... that's sick, dude!

I think if we do duck hunt we need to change *something* about it tho, because if we use the touch screen to just click the duck to kill it, it would be too easy. I was thinking maybe show ducks, scenery, and aimer on top, and just scenery and aimer on the bottom. This would make it a little more challenging, and we could use L or R to shoot.

<br/>
<br/>
I think your control idea for shooting "ducks" could work, but what about using the touch screen like a catapult or slingshot that would be much more challenging.
<br/>
<br/>
To make things more backwards in the game, we could make the levels extremely difficult and the bosses so easy that they defeat themselves! For example we could make the DK stage a very complex assault course of missiles, cannons, flames and rolling poop boulders (all at the same time).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

that dude sure knows how to write haxor scripts!

his geek-shirt says H3^, which translates to hexor... with an 'e'... this species is much more 1337 than haxors, because they are much more "hexadecimal", thus much more low level. (get it?)

he should be one of the later bosses. mut still a "mario"nette to the final boss... (what would be the last boss? a giant, *somehow* "familiarly" looking puppet maybe? &lt;hint, hint!&gt;)

basically you just have your regular particle system (with position, velocity, gravity, "termination condition" etc.) using fixed point math. you draw the particles to a bg. the interface is just three little class member functions: initialize (for more complex systems, that need it) and update (does all the updating and drawing) and cast, that reinitializes a particle and starts it.
<br/>
that's it, no big deal. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
the class looks very much like this:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">class CParticle

   int32 m_pos_x, m_pos_y, m_vel_x, m_vel_y;
<br/>
   int32 m_limit; // termination condition... like "if you hit the pos_y value Y (which is in m_limit), stop"
<br/>
   uint8 m_color;
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
   CParticle(void);

<br/>
fixed point is just integers! but you interpret them a little differently.
<br/>
e.g. you can define that "1 := 16"
<br/>
so an int value of 1 would be reffered to as a 1/16th! :^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just had 2 more ideas for *possible* world themes. 
<br/>
<br/>
1. TETRIS!! Don't see how it works with Jorge? Well, For the final boss maybe he could throw tetris pieces down on you and then you get trapped, which forces you to control them with ur superplumber mind pwrs and form a wall to free yourself. Either that or there is a control panel. You could then reach the top, and C'imp-an-Z goes up to the next floor, at which point you fight enemies to get there and dodge things as usual.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Hardcore text based Jorge rpg. No sprites or anything. This was mostly inspired by a video I saw on homestarrunner.com many many years ago, about what it would be like if stronbad were in a video game. My favorite command was: "get ye flask", becuase it would tell you the flask was stuck, but if you type it in enough you  take it anyways and the roof falls on you. but yea, text based fun! =)

So now we are thinking of creating 'chapters' ideally what length would each chapter be, as in how many levels? Is the game engine going to require some kind of level loading system, or should things be more hardcoded?
<br/>
<br/>
Do we have any more ideas for C'Imp-An-Z's background/story? So that we can figure what kindof setup he would have on the eifel tower (to base obstacle designs on the background)?

<a href="http://frip.dk/mrb/Episode1Levels.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

My idea was we could use something like that with a 'you are here' sign between levels or something (to give the player an idea of progress).

<br/>
@all: no copyrighted material! tetris sounds cool, and we could work in the text. like, have the screen black, and have the text scrolling down. ok, anyone want to fill in this?
<br/>
3-4 levels
<br/>
different theme for each
<br/>
chimpan'z the enemy
<br/>
(i think loading the levels would be cool. that way other people could add more levels.)
<br/>
the chimpan'z could have kidnapped mario. and jorge has been trying to get it on with him, so he goes to save mario. (jorge is gay, right?)
<br/>
<br/>
so, maybe we could each do a level, based around the same system? then it would be more like 4-5 levels, and we could prove that a level loading thing could work.
<br/>
<br/>
the game engine could go like this:
<br/>
load level(in consecutive order. so, if you beat level 1, you go to level 2.)
<br/>
level code:
<br/>
draw characters and map(map could be static, characters can move)
<br/>
check if chimp'z throw, jorge moves, enemies move, ect
<br/>
check if you have won the level(maybe an end point?)

-Speaking of saving the children... how about one of those bonus stages becomes a game of snake in which you drive a bus and pick up children, and maybe put chimpan Z pics as obstacles. Just another thought for one of our many themes...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">guys... i see a lot of good ideas, but i also see a lot of confusion. we need a downloadable design doc, so that everyone can read it, without the need to read all the posts in the thread.
<br/>
<br/>
snake - sounds cool!
<br/>
tetris - probably our own cheesy version.
<br/>
copyleft - i haven't had much experience with copyleft. ;^)
<br/>
loading - everything should be loaded from files.
<br/>
Jorge - if nobody disagrees, i have made him up to be an post sex reassignment male, who has given birth to a child (that "he" needs to save alonge with other children around the world) as a woman. he somehow felt like a gay male trapped inside a female body in the past. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
... and now he's a superplumber (plumber being a stereotypical male job.)
<br/>
<br/>
the eiffel tower level plan looks good! that's exactly what i, personally, imaginged. the destruction of that wonderful building should get worse, the higher you get, with stuff bent all over the place etc. because the stages would get narrower, we need to think of some platforms, but not those generic, macically floating ones. something that fits the design.
<br/>
<br/>
hope that helps a little.

<br/>
<br/>
i count five people interested (only [?] two [?] posted <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=15492&amp;start=90#156547" target="_blank">info about themselves</a> so far!) in working on this project. imagine everyone would just start doing things withouth any common knowledge... a desaster. it would end before it even started.
<br/>
<br/>
that's why we *must* have a DD - we all need to have a clear vision of "what" has to be done by "whom" and "when" and everybody needs to know more or less (ideal would be "exactly") the same about the project and (!) it's members.
<br/>
<br/>
careful planing makes 90% (the rest is: 90% production and 90% testing... ;^D ) of a projects success.
<br/>
<br/>
best you guys send me a pm with your infos. maybe also include your age (if you like - you can also send stuff like "around 20" or "still in school"), so we can all adjust to each other.
<br/>
that is needed, because it's pretty strange and sometimes frustrating when (this is fictional) you're an university educated, experienced game programmer and others, not knowing you *are*, treat you as if you were a 15-year-old beginner, that had no clue of what is going on. the other way around is equally bad.
<br/>
so, again: communication is the key in team play. i'm telling you this as a person, that needs a lot of direct communication or else i'm getting lost (mostly by misinterpretting things) all the time!

<br/>
we ain't coding the first level, dude. we'll be coding the first episode! ;^)
<br/>
a level is more of a map than code. 8^D
<br/>
<br/>
if all goes weel, i'll be preparing the DD this Wiikend. that means, we might be able to divide tasks among team memebers next week and start "preproduction" (which the DD is a part of.)
<br/>
<br/>
Wii Niid to Diicide on THii folloWiing tasks, WHiich all are Liike: "[whatever] DiiSiign: [how maNii Piiple]") [just don't ask.... SiiLii mode OFF, right *now*!]:
<br/>
- sprite graphics / animation: ~ 2
<br/>
- tile graphics : 1 - 2
<br/>
- game screen / menu graphics: 1
<br/>
- map: 1
<br/>
- sound: 1
<br/>
- music: 1
<br/>
- programming (minus the designer): 2 - 3
<br/>
<br/>
what needs to be programmed:
<br/>
- file loading and (what also belogs to the next two points) background / sprite streaming (for scrolling / animation)
<br/>
- a sprite management and animation engine
<br/>
- map / background management
<br/>
- user input
<br/>
- collision detection
<br/>
- game mechanics (all gameplay related rules etc.)
<br/>
- enemy "ad" (artificial dumbness)
<br/>
- game glue... errrr, i mean "screens / menus"
<br/>
- sound and music playback
<br/>
<br/>
in a somewhat similar order, maybe. add in some nice effects, too! ;^)
<br/>
did i forget something?
<br/>
<br/>
different tasks can be done by the same person. we just need to know who will do what part.
<br/>
<br/>
don't get me wrong, i don't want you to go all "i will do this and that" right now! this stuff is going to be put in the DD and i'm just asking, if i might have forgotten something. after the DD is out, we'll divide the tasks.
<br/>
<br/>
btw: i'm no good at leading teams, i guess, so i just don't want you to think i'm trying to lead this by posting stuff like this. i think that we might not need a leader (who wouldn't be me, anyways), as long as the team is small and fixed and everyone does what he ( / she) *volunteered* to do. keep your word, guys. that's a friendly reminder about the fact, that most people starting / helping out with projects like this, don't. ;^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

So you want to detect whether two objects in a 2D game are overlapping. The first few subroutines that you need to write are functions that answer the following questions:
<br/>
<ul><li>Does rectangle X overlap rectangle Y? </li><li>Does circle X overlap circle Y? </li><li>Does rectangle X overlap circle Y? </li><li>Is tile A solid? If so, what is the bounding rectangle or circle of its solid part? </li><li>Does tile X on the map overlap rectangle Y or circle Y? </li><li>Which tiles on the map would possibly overlap rectangle Y if they were completely solid? </li><li>Which tiles on the map actually do overlap rectangle Y or circle Y? </li></ul>

1. Figure out the range of these circular/rounded attacks

2. Make it so that they don't simply look cool and then morph through the enemie without any effect.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">@ AN: hey, the best way to learn it is to do it! ;^)
<br/>
try to make one "sprite" (stickman in your code) push another. if you manage to do that, add two more "sprites" (he does not use hw sprites) and see, if you can push all of them and if they will push each other when being pushed. psuh, push, psuh, push... ;?D
<br/>
<br/>
after that it's time for scene CD. ;^)
<br/>
this involves some sort of collision map. that may be the regular level map. think of it: the character should be able to walk in all the "blank" tiles and not be able to penetrate (don't be childish, guys! X^D ) solid tiles, like the ground (which is a special case of:), platforms and walls. that means, while the character moves, you need to check if the next tile it will "enter" (not really, as sprites and maps are indipendent of each other) is either "solid" or "hollow" ("blank"). the character would only allowed to move in a direction, in which it whouldn't penetrate solids.
<br/>
the next step is collision response: if a collision is detected, you need to do something appropriate, so that the character can move within the restrictions of the map. like walking on slopes or, in 3D, "sliding" when constantly colliding with walls.
<br/>
<br/>

i could run a local sever, but i'd prefer using some external resources, as i couldn't guarantee constant access to it. the server, the current project page is on, is too restricted: 25mb, no php, no sql... just plain old HTML. in fact, only ftp writes are allowed, so no script can change a file's contents. :^C

<br/>
It's great news that you got some hosting (silent_code), and it would be quite helpful if projectpages, forums etc could be hosted, as long as you are happy to offer that.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess failing that we can still use lord_hardware's forum (and thanks for the offer). 
<br/>
<br/>
With regards to forums however, I don't think we need any fully-accomplished forum scripts such as phpbb, a simple bulletin board script should suffice.
<br/>
<br/>
And Alphanoob, with your "&gt;&gt;4" thing you are refering to 'fixed point math'. I wont go into details as there are plenty of posts on the topic on this forum. But basically you are dealing with moving fractions of pixels at a time (per frame) which cannot be handled by the DS hardware. To deal with this we create a variable and use a fixed number of bits on the right as the fraction. When the DS hardware needs to use the whole number, we move the whole number so many (binary) places to the right to discard the fraction (&gt;&gt; is the bitwise right shift operator).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

imagine a black and white "map" of the level on screen. black means "hollow", white means "solid". when a character moves, you just check, if the tile it enters is hollow. when attempting to enter a solid tile, you push the character back according to the collision you detected. ;^)

<br/>
you would simply just look up the tile "type" in the map... if it's the (well known) "empty"/"hollow" tile (index), moving into it is allowed. that's about it. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: now i understand! you mean platform! noes! just check the tiles the character is moves to! i'll try to make an image to visualize it for you, but i have too much to do, so it may take a while.
<br/>
<br/>
now, the "clever" part is to not just return true or false, but rather the distance! what distance you might ask. anything "0" for no collision and anything else for the distance the character needs to be moved to not be stuck in a solid tile (in other words, the signed [depending on direction] amount of units [e.g. {sub}pixels] that the character has penetrated a solid).
<br/>
<br/>
... and you don't need enemy tiles, as these will be represented as characters (sprites) that are indipendent of the background. ;^)
<br/>
but latter (and of course toilet "lifts") are a good addition! :?)
<br/>
<br/>
i'm aware of the fact, that most of you are sitting idle here, but i've already posted the open positions, so maybe you could drop a line telling us, what part you would like to do? then we can decide. well, i'll send the team info around in the coming 24h, i swear! ;^)

Someone other than silent can answer if you like, lol.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">tile maps are just arrays of indexes. it's much like "int map[]", only a bit more complex. ;^)
<br/>
you can access that map or a simpler representation that is kept in main ram to query a "type", which means simply the tile index (or number), as you can predefine certain indices to special tiles (like hollow tiles could be tile number 0.)

everybody should run <a class="postlink" href="http://folding.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Folding@Home</a> while illegally downloading data from the inet, browsing the net because they're bored or just letting the computer idle for no reason. that way their computers (and all those PS3s out there) would actually do *something* useful!

it's really easy to actively help medical research by donating processing time and you'd be wasting less energy, too! (the latter measured in "calculations that matter" per watt.)

what jobs do you guys wanna do? Silent posted them a while back, and that will have to go into the DD. We have all said what we have worked on before this project, but how are we going to divide this up? That is still a little unclear (at least to me) and is essential to gettting this finished.

EDIT: nice DD silent =). Oh, and I tried that thing you suggested with having my "sprite" push another "sprite", and so far it is working pretty good.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, we need to discuss actual gameplay (which is a very broad topic) and then sketch the elements of the first episode's map.
<br/>
Then we will be able to sketch the screens of the map.
<br/>
<br/>
Only then will we know what we need to program and how.
<br/>
<br/>
As I'm diving into rather involved tile map programming for my zombie demo anyway, I *could* offer to write the sprite and map system (which I would do anyway), if nobody else wanted, that is.
<br/>
<br/>
Another problem is, that there are a lot of "map editors" out there, but I found none (I still have to check out one, thouhg) fitting my needs. So, the question is: Would somebody of you guys be able and willing to write an editor from scratch? I'm asking, because I don't have the time now and I doubt it will be more in the near future (it might become much, much less,) but we will definitely need one.
<br/>
<br/>
I would list the features, help to design the user interface and maybe I could even help with programming.
<br/>
<br/>
This is a valuable opportunity, because the moment you start to develop a (more than basic) game and you write a proprietary engine, you will need to roll your own tools. Unless you'll be using existing file formats... which in most cases is nonsense to me (I *could* elaborate on this, but I would like to prefer not to.) ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, we have a list of positions and I'll send an updated version (to include lord_hardware) of the team overview today (within 24h), so:
<br/>
<br/>
Who want's to do what?

<br/>
<br/>
First identify the time commitment from the most dedicated, such as 5 hours per week (which is quite a lot). If someone can only offer 5 hours a month you can still find a way for them to be useful.
<br/>
<br/>
However a lack of design/management experience will make it difficult to allocate tasks and plan the project; so it might be a good idea to leave that aspect open and have it reviewed by the more experienced to peek at. <span style="font-weight: bold">What exactly are your initial stages of development</span>?

Maybe you can better aid yourself by colour coding posts; blue = management (i.e. how where you will focus, development strategy); dark-green = design; dark-red = code; black = anything ... It will help people skim the posts ^_^ (j/k)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

We have the design of the story and a rough gameplay design ready. It's is very likely that most parts will change anyway, but we already have a good start with what's in the wiki.

It's time the game elements get carved out, as well as technical aspects.

The "no technical limits" time should then be pretty much over and a realistic and doable view on the game should be developped.
<br/>
<br/>
As always, I'm hosting the project and I'm willing to help out with anything I have the time for, but it's up to *you* guys to do the major parts. That's kind of hard, I know, but that's how things work. You have to be a little consequent about the things you do.
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm already happy that you guys made it this far. :^D
<br/>
Actually thinking about the game and not doing the very tempting and fun stuff is something most web based projects don't do and they fail very fast. I hope this one will at least spawn a little gameplay demo. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
So, what we need is a little self motivation and patience and in the end things will probably work out fine. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
Now: To Jorge! X^D

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">On teh sprites: 
<br/>
we could make the sprites kind of cheesy at the start, and just use those pics you drew scaled down. This could just be a placeholder until we make the actual sprites. Or we could save some time and leave them that way, the game is a spoof after all. 
<br/>
<br/>
On teh gameplay:
<br/>
I think we have enough done to start making the first set of levels/chapter ("jump man"). So maybe we should start drawing up some specific level designs.
<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts:
<br/>
Should we make a quick first level demo?<br/>_________________<br/>w00</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
What about everybody's status?
<br/>
<br/>
Me: Just released the (hopefully) final version of VSD, but I have started to work on a highly improved version, showing much more game like look and feel and hear. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
Though I have not forgotten about our little thing here, so I'm also working on a little background management system when ever I can, so that we can finally start working, "for real!"
<br/>
<br/>
How's everybody else doing? Could anyone make an "animating sprite" management system?
<br/>
I guess AN is still into collision detection (and response), right? :^)
<br/>
<br/>
Then someone really neeeeds to do some research for a map editor, that will fit our needs. I tried PernEdit and it's a good tool, but it's still "not quite there." (Anyhow: Respect to dovoto! Keep it up!)
<br/>
So, we need someone who tries to make a map (with placeholder graphics) in one or two editors that look promissing (like PernEdit), so we can decide which one we will use and in what format to expect map data for the background management system.
<br/>
<br/>
So long. :^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most of them don't deal with dev, but I thought I might give you some suggestions on some software I use and think you should try. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
Avira Antivir is a very good and free scanner. I never had any virus related problems due to it. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
ZoneAlarm is my favorite free personal firewall. I like to know when software "phones home" (using up network bandwidth without asking the user's permission!) :^)
<br/>
<br/>
PeerGuardian2 is a free software, that will block access from / to blacklisted IPs (spam, ads, spying - including governments - and IPs in p2p networks).
<br/>
<br/>
SVN or "subversion" is a version management tool. It is being developed as the successor to CVS.
<br/>
<br/>
Folding@Home should be known - you donate some processing time for folding proteines and help research on Parkinson's, Cancer etc. Also available on PS3 and ATI desktop graphics cards. :^) You get points and downloadable certificates, too. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
Code::Blocks is an IDE. I am currently using it for all my development (Win32 and NDS targets) and I openly admit, that I really like it. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
MinGW is a set of tools that will let you use the GnuCompilerCollection to develop native Win32 applications. It comes packaged with C::B 8.02. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
VLC is "the" mediaplayer. At least it's the player I had the least trouble (next to none) with. It supports most filetypes (as well as media types) and comes with build-in codecs (no extra codec pack needed to use the player.)
<br/>
<br/>
doxygen is a documentation generator. Basically, you can make comments in your source files, run doxygen through your sources (easy with GUI wizzard!) and it spills out a fully cross referenced HTML-documentation. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
Btw: All of this is freeware!
<br/>
<br/>
XVI32 is a hex editor... do I need to write any more? (I currently use it, but it's not 100% what I want, which is just a matter of taste.)
<br/>
<br/>
Open Office should be clear to anyone who knows what the words "open" and "offices" mean in terms of software. It's much better than stealing MS's office suite and it's quite a complete package, too. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
Firefox3 is pure awesomeness! Loooots of very useful addons available (e.g. an FTP client, flash / ad / script blockers etc.)
<br/>
<br/>
If you like mail clients, I recommend the simple, clean and intuitive Thunderbird2. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that's better. :^D<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

<br/>
Btw: It really doesn't matter what format we want to have in the game right now.
<br/>
All we need is a means to create some data that can be interpreted.
<br/>
As I imagine it will be nothing fancy, all we nead is an ordered tile table and maps that hold the data for the tile indices. Which practically means, that all we need is just these data fields in a binary format, no matter what format it is. even raw binary output should be fine, as we know the dimensions of out data beforehand (we don't have to dynamically adjust things on load time.)
<br/>
<br/>
Given, that we don't have any code base as of yet, that expects any map format, we are free to adapt to existing dataset structures.

    <h4>#160042 - bean_xp - Wed Jul 09, 2008 6:32 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">2D would also be my vote, however you say that "we don't have a codebase that expects any map format", but the 2D engine does expect data in it's own format(s), so we should probably try to model our system around it, to leave us with minimal hassle/effort in the game code.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course the other option is to use some existing "map" format and base our code around that, although the game code would perhaps require more effort, the advantage is we can use existing tools. This is dependant on us finding a suitable (documented) format with freely available tools, does anyone have any suggestions for this? (For example we could base our system around the outputs of one of those mario level editing tools by implementing our engine over the top of the dataset)
<br/>
<br/>
As for knowing the dimensions of the data, we already know that we don't want the screens to scroll at all during gameplay, only between level transitions, doesn't this mean we already know the dimensions of the two tilemaps for each level? I personally don't think it would be too difficult to design our own format, and produce tools for it. The problem is building the format up in stages, without having to re-write the majority of level loading code.
<br/>
<br/>
I think we can break this down quite easily for our relatively simple levels, if we split the binary data into blocks, the first block being the header, the following blocks being the actual data, the header, along with information about the file, should contain an indexed (the index representing the segment type) list of addresses of each section. This would allow us to add additional segments to the levels as each layer is built into the engine (eg we could start with tilemaps, then items, then enemies etc).
<br/>
<br/>
The question being at this stage what do we need first, the game engine to load the level data into or a map editor to create the data. If we make the engine first we must start with editing files in binary. (Or perhaps one person could work on tools, while others work on the engine). Either way it's pretty important to design the format first. I'm ok with working with the binary data, but I don't mind coding up some tools if that would be prefered.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I think that if you think, that you can really handle it, then you'd be the "background man". ;^)
<br/>
I personally see a lot of project failures due to missing tools. At some stages in development, tools are more important that the actual game code.
<br/>
So, I you think, you could write the engine and / or tools, then you're welcome. :^)
<br/>
It would be a relief for me, as I have the 3D project to work on and I'm also preparing for my upcoming job.

Well, I didn't want to get too much involved in the development process anyways, besides design and general "helping out". ;^)

But I can sure help you with algorithms, bugs and feature implementations.

I guess, if AN does the CD and bean does the BG programming, then all that's left is sprite management, before game code can be worked on.

How did alphanoob get on with his collision detection system, and would it be fair to say this will also include some kindof sprite handling (I'm assuming is necessary for testing), I'd like to know as once my code is tidier it can be integrated so we have a basic framework to work with.

<br/>
Also an update on the editor it now has loading/rendering/editing/saving (the key parts I guess) though they are all in the most basic form, I will continue to expand this (firstly the UI needs improving), once I consider it to be in good form I'll release it to you guys in some way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I need some kindof tileset for the map layer which is the actual level, eg platforms, walls etc. Currently I use 16 colour mode with a single palette, however there wont be a problem using multiple palettes (we need some palettes free for the other layers too of course). So paletted bmp/gif files are fine. 
<br/>
<br/>
I currently link the data after it is converted with grit - I don't expect this to be a problem if the amount of linked graphics are kept to a minimum, but if necessary it wont be any trouble to write a loader. The level files however are loaded (through EFS).
<br/>
<br/>
If you need a hand creating any of those graphics just leave a message, I don't mind doing graphics work, and I'm sure the others will help (if they still read here?)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So what are the specs on our tiles? I dont know why I havent asked this in that past, but now I think I should. If I make my test programs on a different tile size than we are using, none of this will mesh easily. I still have some work ahead of me cause I slowed down when I stopped seeing posts from anyone.

As with regards to the pixelformat, I seemed to have jumped ahead without discussing it, is it acceptable to use 16 color tiles? (we can use multiple palettes of course). I made the assumption based on the fact the game has a kindof retro appeal and this graphic style would be fitting (in my opinion).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ok, I have done some stuff, but it wasn't going anywhere. I am trying another approach, but I'm too tired now.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, that's nice!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm still looking for a style that will fit the game, and I think two of my ideas are worth trying.
<br/>
<br/>
I am designing the whole stage with all it's maps in a vector program now (basically inking things.) After I have a concept ready, it'll be exported as a bitmap and probably get some photoshoping, too.
<br/>
<br/>
The whole image contains several "screens" worth of data. Now, what you could try, is to add an importer to your editor, that will make a tile map out of the bitmap and maybe even divide the big image into smaller, screen sized portions, so that it doesn't have to be done manually. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
That was just an idea, though. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sure anything is fine right now, I've been using 3 tiles I knocked up in about 60 seconds up to now, so I'm sure anything will be an improvement. If anyone else feels like donating some tiles then feel free.

<br/>
As with regards to the importing of bitmap files, it's not something that I have thought about doing, but I guess it could be added.
<br/>
<br/>
Today I've finished restructuring the code for the editor (re-writing much of the UI code). Before I continue, I'd like to know what features you would see to be necessary (or desired) in the editor. As of now, you can simply paint tiles to either screen, by picking a tile and drawing with that (maybe you'd think of it as a "Pencil" tool). Which is functional, but could be very slow for editing complicated maps. Saving and loading is also present in the editor. My idea is to expand the interface to have tabs which will represent later elements of the engine (eg. enemies or skymaps or something), so what is present at the moment would become the map editing tab.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ah, that's cool, I'm not sure I need full blown hosting for anything at the moment (other than the editor ofc), perhaps you could host a release of it at some point?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I've uploaded a couple of screenshots to show the basics of the editor (and trust me it is pretty basic :D).
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://robs-basement.de/jorge/wiki/images/Bean_Editor0.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
This first shot shows the basics of the level editor, pick a tile on the right, and draw (by dragging the mouse) on the "maps" on the left. The tiles and palette data is statically linked to the windows exe file, and is in the exact same format as the NDS data and runtime conversion is done to turn it into 24 bit image data format I have used with OpenGL.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://robs-basement.de/jorge/wiki/images/Bean_Editor1.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
Also the editor supports palette switching and X/Y flipping just as the NDS tilemaps do. Also the screenshot shows that the grid that can be activated under the "view" menu.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://robs-basement.de/jorge/wiki/images/Bean_Editor2.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
Of course, the editor supports saving and loading (It is an editor after all :D). There is some kind of metadata supported in the file format (and the DS loader), namely you can give the level a title and a description, also there is a way of listing the order of "elements" in the map file (Designed with adding extra layers to the maps in future - enemies, items etc), at the moment neither of these are used in anyway by the editor, so it will just output some default information (though this could be easily edited with a hex editor of course)
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://robs-basement.de/jorge/wiki/images/Bean_Editor3.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
I also wrote the loader to get the map onto the DS screens using EFS for the file loading, and the graphic data is statically linked to the DS Rom. (The text on the No$ window is just a little console debug output thing I wrote). The DS rom is tested and working on the DS and obviously the emulator.
<br/>
<br/>
I can release the code for both parts of the project if anybody thinks they will be helpful at all (I would suggest that I should clean the code before that though). There are a couple of small graphic issues with some devices (Ati and nVidia cards should be fine).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Clean it up and I'll host the file for you, if you'd like to.

<br/>
I have only one question: Why two maps?
<br/>
I know it's NDSque, but usually, a (PC / MAC based) map editor would give you a (single) scrollable map view.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, unless you want the maps to be restricted to 32 x 24 tiles. ;^p<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

That was the plan yes, and I'll get round to tidying the code at some point.
<br/>
<br/>
In theory it shouldn't be difficult to add scrolling, or a single view at all, I simply split the view as that's how it appears on the DS and in the file format.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
