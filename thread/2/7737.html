The coder will start on 15th December. A brandnew layout is also done! So leave your opinion and help to enhance this community service! Once the code is done I will REUPLOAD the whole archive on a new serer, which means more speed and it will also allow larger files, which haven't been uploaded yet (like homebrews larger than 50mb, - pdx intro collection for psx, etc) 
<br/>
<br/>
I will also go and upload missing releases and start new sections as for gp2x and psp.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading and hopefully thanks for your opinion!
