    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all..
<br/>
<br/>
I had a little question.
<br/>
My internet cable has just broken and my internet acces is on a stupid placed installed..
<br/>
<br/>
Now i have the nintendo USB with hacked drivers so now its a normal router...
<br/>
<br/>
so now is my question:
<br/>
<br/>
I want to buy a normal router for my internet connection but can i use my hacked USB connector as receiver for my router internet acces or do i have to buy a special usb receiver for routers..??
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
for the people who dont understand me:
<br/>
can my hacked USB connector only send data out or also receive internet from other routers..??
<br/>
i want to buy an router for internet acces and i want to use my USB connector to connect to it to receive internet..
<br/>
<br/>
Is this possible..??
<br/>
<br/>
sorry for the explanation i?m always hard at explaining something :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, you can probably get Wi-Fi device drivers for that USB stick, but then it won't work as an access point anymore. Your DS would connect to the Intertubes through the "normal router".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
