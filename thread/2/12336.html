Both. By the time I got into GBA development (early 2002), GBC flash cards were already unavailable. In addition, the ARM architecture is a lot more conducive to the C language, which was popular among Windows game programmers at the time, than the GBZ80 is.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Yes, but it's terribly buggy and lacks some features such as read breakpoints, execute breakpoints in RAM (it just crashes), table files, etc. It loves to randomly stop working, claim I don't have a valid license, crash, or whatever. Just so many bugs...

I've also used bgb which emulates nicely but its interface makes me want to stab someone, especially since switching windows at the wrong time will deadlock it.

On such a weak system?  Using ASCII is insane if you ever intend to localize your program.  ASCII should be converted to some sort of precalculated font encoding before it hits the message engine.

Use (memory address)?
<br/>
<br/>
Or (n)! for read or write.
<br/>
<br/>
Very powerful, very easy to find memory leaks and such.  We ran it under 95/98 without too many issues.  Yes, over a lot of time it would slow, but most debug sessions last under 5 minutes so no big deal. 
<br/>
<br/>
And preloaded fonts on a system with such limited hardware would be insane.  We wrote a font render system and used a byte lookup to get to each character.  Works great for a non-asian release.  For Japanese, we used a limited shift-jis and no Kanji just to keep the symbols small enough to be useful.
<br/>
<br/>
And exectuion from RAM?  We used it for interrupt vectoring, fast palette loading (ld hl,n at 3 cycles per byte), a tiny bit for ROM page flipping, and bits of esoterica here and there.  A vast majority of stuff didn't need RAM to work, which is good because the system had so little.

All of these languages can be handled by using unique code points for each unique display glyph.  You need to figure out what characters you will actually use.  The font only needs to contain this subset of the writing system.  To make things simple, the font probably wants to be arranged in ascending order.  You'll probably want to precomile your text so that the version in your ROM works with the font.

<br/>
You will need to dynamically load glyphs into VRAM.
<br/>
<br/>
Assuming ASCII or an ASCII like writing system is bad because the assumptions that come along with ASCII can and do cause problems.  The space for the font, text bloat and the rendering system may hurt to a lesser extent.
<br/>
<br/>
For what it's worth, most Japanese GB/GBC games only used kana, or they used kana and a small subset of kanji specific to the game.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess you guys didn't push the hardware as far as I did. Try hacking Pok?mon G/S! :-p Adding on to a game that already uses just about all available RAM and VRAM and the largest ROM size the MBC3 can handle is interesting if nothing else. (And you can't upgrade to MBC5, or you lose the clock.)
<br/>
<br/>
I've never looked at a Chinese game, but I'd assume they use something like 12x12, 16x16 or variable-size Kanji using a VWF-like system. (8x8 Kanji? No thanks!) It's a nice trick, instead of loading the font to VRAM and writing tile numbers to your map for each letter, you blank an area of VRAM and write incrementing tile numbers, then load the characters from ROM into VRAM as needed. E.g. if you wanted to print "Hello" then you'd just write tiles 0 1 2 3 4 and load the letters H, e, l, l and o into those tiles in VRAM. (You could get clever and use 0 1 2 2 3 but then you need to keep track of which letters are loaded.) What makes this system nice is its flexibility. You could, assuming you had sufficient ROM space, implement all of Unicode. You can do variable-width fonts by shifting the bits around as you load them. Apply bold/italic/underline effects at runtime. All manner of fun stuff like that.
<br/>
You'd be surprised how many games do use preloaded fonts, though, but I don't think I've ever seen an official game use ASCII.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, my debugging sessions tend to last hours, but are interrupted every so often by the debugger leaking so much memory it starts to get confused and draw its interface wrong. I suppose ROM hacking is a bit different in this aspect.
<br/>

Miked0801, from my experience and the manual, that's not what ? and ! do.

For something like <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_alphabet" target="_blank">Arabic</a>, maybe; I don't know enough about the language.  Nobody seems to mind that they have to choose between upper and lower case in English.  I could see forcing Europeans to select the fancy vowels one by one, although a proper accent system would certainly be friendlier.  Some lexical transformations will probably have to be made.  "To upper" is a good English example.  Exactly what needs to be done will depend on your game and your publisher.  You still might be able to precompile.

Now?  Chinese games use Chinese characters.  Mainland China uses simplified Chinese, and Taiwan uses traditional Chinese.  Hong Kong used traditional characters but is starting to use more simplified characters.  I don't know what they used in the days of the gameboy.  English?  Really old Japanese NES games certainly used English.

VROM on the NES was 8 KiB, split into equal banks for background tiles and sprite tiles. Each 4 KiB bank could hold 256 different tiles. An uppercase-only ASCII chart would take about 18% to 25% of that depending on which dirty tricks a program used, such as repurposing unused punctuation, repurposing unused letters such as Q and Z for graphics if the game don't have high score initials input, etc. Luckily, 25% of background VROM (64 tiles) was the same size as the 1 KiB sub-banks that several mappers used, and a <span style="font-style: italic">lot</span> of games would bankswitch between the graphics and the text tiles when the raster hit a certain scanline.
<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you that <span style="font-style: italic">Lode Runner</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Mario Is Missing!</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Adventures of Lolo 3</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Little Nemo The Dream Master</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">I Can Remember</span>, and several other NES games bearing the Official Nintendo Seal used a block of glyphs in ASCII order. So did (unlicensed commercial) <span style="font-style: italic">Tetяis</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Klax</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic">Spiritual Warfare</span>, and so did the <span style="font-style: italic">Earthbound</span> prototype. The fact that 0x20 through 0x5F straddled a sub-bank boundary didn't mean much; a simple add instruction could map characters in 0x20-0x5F to glyphs in 0xC0-0xFF to fit them all in one sub-bank. The <span style="font-style: italic">Mega Man</span> games for NES used ASCII encoding for strings in the ROM, but the equivalent of cputs() translated ASCII characters to VROM glyph numbers.
<br/>
<br/>
What would popular NES games' fonts look like if rearranged into ASCII? Wonder no more; <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/nes/8x8s.png" target="_blank">here are numerous 8x8 pixel fonts</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Also, my debugging sessions tend to last hours, but are interrupted every so often by the debugger leaking so much memory it starts to get confused and draw its interface wrong. I suppose ROM hacking is a bit different in this aspect.
<br/>
<br/>
Miked0801, from my experience and the manual, that's not what ? and ! do. (foo)! breaks on any write to foo, and (foo)? breaks on any write if the value written is not the current value.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Ok, I went back and tried to pull up the manual for GB and it wouldn't let me - the .hlp format is not supported anymore :P 
<br/>
<br/>
I am quoting from my more recent knowledge of No$GBA.  I guess he added some features from when I last used no$gmb a few years back.
<br/>
<br/>
But on your debug sessions: Do you really have to play the game hours at a time without resetting the debugger?  That seems more like playing and less like debugging from my experience.  Or more likely a difference in what we do as you state.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, yes we pushed the hardware pretty dang far.  VBlank being precious, VCount interrupts ended up doing all sorts of fun things for us.  High color, BT loads, splits, etc.  It was amazing how much No$gmb made possible over the boat anchor crap from Nintendo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

China has the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuyin" target="_blank">Bopomofo</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin" target="_blank">Pinyin</a>.  Children learn the phonetic system, but they quickly stop using it for communication.  I had actually never seen the Bopomofo before today.
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
That Zhuyin/Bopomofo looks remarkably similar to Japanese -kana. Kinda makes sense though, since both originated as phonetic offspring of traditional Chinese symbols. I didn't look closely enough to see how much the sounds actually match up though, or if it's merely a visual similarity.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, ROM hacking is a lot different from plain coding. I might have the debugger open several hours to hack new routines into the game, trace routines and references, look for pieces of code, etc. Pretty much writing the code right in the debugger, then copying it out. (I do use an assembler for the longer routines though.)
