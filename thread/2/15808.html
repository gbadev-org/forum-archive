    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm having a problem with this Google Code Wmb Asm SVN. When I first imported the source code into SVN, and then did a check out of the whole respiratory, everything was fine. Later, the icons were screwed. The directory I checked out into, SVN, has that ! icon on it. Meaning it's out of date or something, I think. Inside, the trunk sub-directory has that icon too, but the other two directories have the green check mark icon. The wmb_asm sub-directory, inside of trunk, is one of trunk's sub directory. That directory has the ! icon also. However, everything inside this directory, all of that has the check mark, no ! icon at all.
<br/>
<br/>
How do I fix this? Could this somehow affect people that attempt to check out the source code?(The Google Code project page URL has yet to be linked to, but still, it's possible to find it if you know what to search for on the Google Code web site.)
<br/>
I tried right-clicking the SVN directory and then on Commit, but nothing changed.

I discovered something about Google Code, that I thought I'd let you guys know about:
<br/>
For your user name, it is your E-Mail address. If you sign up for G-Mail, this user name becomes your G-Mail address, minus that @gmail.com part. Indeed, spammers could still discover your G-Mail address, but IMO, that's better then them finding your main address.(I signed up for G-Mail so my main address wouldn't be visible in my user name.)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by yellowstar on Mon Jul 14, 2008 3:42 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Apparently when deleting files, I need to first do a commit to make sure changes for the working copy aren't lost, delete the file(s) on the respiratory, then do a SVN update. The last time I deleted a file, I deleted the file on the respiratory, then I manually deleted the file in the working directory. Apparently, I'm supposed to do it the way mentioned first, since the ! icons seemed to have appeared since that file delete.(Probably any file/directory moving should be done this way, also.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
