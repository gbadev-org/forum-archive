    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
  not sure if this is the right place to post this question, but with christmas coming up I have a big decision to make.  The question is whether to get myself a new Nintendo DS, or to get a gba flash linker of some sort.  I'd have a lot of fun with either one, but with the flash linker (which I don't have at all for gba, I've got an old gb one, however) I can finally put some homebrew code I've been working on on a cart to take around with me.  The DS looks tempting too though because of it's capabilities, and I would be able to help out with the DSLinux project (since I'm a linux hacker anyway)
<br/>
<br/>
  So any suggestions?  If you think I should go with the linker, which one(s) have you used and which would you recommend. 
<br/>
<br/>
  thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is a big price difference between a flash linker and a DS. I figure if you have enough money for a DS, why not buy a flash linker too? Also, it depends on your priorities. What do you do most, play games or develop them? If playing games is something you enjoy most, then go for the DS.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's a great idea to buy both, problem is my wife and daughter would probably shoot me if I spent that much of our christmas budget on me.  I'd say I play games more than I develop, and when I do develop I'd need the flash linker to cart my stuff around anyway, so it's a real dillema.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think, for gaming, the DS is really a waste of money, the PSP will cost more but it will be better for gaming<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's my thought:
<br/>
<br/>
If you're not using your GBA to play games on a GameCube that require it, or I should be more general and say you don't use the serial port, then THIS is what you should do, IMHO.
<br/>
<br/>
Step 1: Buy your DS.  You can't live without it!  To live without a DS is to cause you great pain.
<br/>
<br/>
Step 2: Sell that worthless ol' GBA (Just KIDDING!  Geez, I've still got MY GBA-SP!)
<br/>
<br/>
Step 3: Use the GBA $$ to help finance your flash cart, and make DAMN sure to get one that has a stand-alone flasher!!!
<br/>
<br/>
You get the best of most of both worlds.  Of course, this plan gang aft agley if you need the serial port on the GBA (The DS doesn't come with it... so no Pokemon w/ wireless (no, DS doesn't support it -- STUPID!  HOW STUPID OF NINTENDO!), no Four Swords on GC, no Animal Island on Animal Crossing, no GBA multiplayer AT ALL).
<br/>
<br/>
BUT, if all that doesn't mean much to you, I'm sure you'll agree that this isn't such a bad plan.
<br/>
<br/>
OPTION 2:
<br/>
<br/>
Get a hold of your parents (whether you live with them or not) and beg them DAY and NIGHT (if you don't live with them, keep calling collect) until they cave (if calling collect, promise to stop) and buy you one of the two... then buy the other!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, I've made my decision.
<br/>
  I'm gonna go with the linker and work my butt off to earn some more money for a DS later.  Now the question is what linker works good for playing roms (for multiplayer with games I allready own, of course, nothing illegal ;) ) and for doing quick uploads of homebrew stuff in development.  I was thinking of the EZ-Flash2 Powerstar, as it seems most similar to what I've got for the GB/GBC (Bung GBXchanger) that I'm used to.  But I've heard good/bad about most of the options.  Any suggestions anyone?
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I do my development on a Linux box, so linux compatibility is a plus, but my wifes box is WinXP, so that's a possibility if linux doesn't work right off with the device.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree on the size I didn't realize they made gba carts that were only 64MB that's the biggest size gb and gbc were, seems kind of small for gba.  I was thinking of a 512 myself, as that seems the best value for your money these days from what I can tell.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the input this has been great.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
*sniff*  I didn't realize at the time I bought mine that it was megabits, not megabytes... I thought 64 MB would be plenty, as most commercial games range from 8 to 16, with a few 24 or 32, so I thought 64 would be lots...
<br/>
<br/>
Let this be a lesson to y'all, make sure you check bits vs. bytes!  Or else you end up like me!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
