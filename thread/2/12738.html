<br/>
<br/>
i, like, browsed only these forums yesterday and checked some mail, but my ISP says i downloaded ~200 MB, and i am gettiing over my limit this month. So I wonder whether anybody knows of a program that keeps track of how much every program downloads (under xp)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also, if you double click your network icon in the system tray, you can see amounts of data transferred...you can see whether that much traffic is really coming from your computer.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have wireless, you should try to make sure that nobody is using your wireles....

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah, cuz similarly to cell phone minutes, the gigabytes of download just seem to disappear ;). And of course it would be even be better to see some nice graphic showing which program is the culprit.

Thanks for the help though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But if there is something free that does the same then why use NetPeeker? I think gauauu's suggestion is the best suggestion, see if your computer thinks it is sending that much; you can also check this with your router (if you are using one). Then if you find that your computer is sending that much data you know that you need to find the culprit, although it is probably easier to run either a spyware/adware removal software or just reinstall windows.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You guys are missing the point.  He doesn't want to analyze his network traffic.  Free or not.  If he knew how to do that, he wouldn't have posted the question..
<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, without having some type of logging software running on your router to keep track, your not going to get what you want.  Even with sniffer software, without knowing the network configuration, it's hard to say he will get the results he is looking for.  If someone is "borrowing" his network using WiFi a wired sniffer isn't going to see it.  If he wants to monitor wired, he'll need a hub to be able to see all the traffic.  If he want's to monitor both, he'll need a hub between WiFi, wired, and the router.  And the router can't accept any traffic except from the WiFi and Wired network through the hub.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right, but if he runs a program on every computer on the network to tell which programs are using a lot of bandwidth, and none of them are, then he'll know either someone else is on the network or he has a massive virus problem allowing the program to hide itself.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In XP I find that there is four Programs continuesly sending and recieving data. One is Explorer that will load from time to time even in 9x.

Also while you might be only checking mail you are also loading the page data regaurdless if it is over and over again. The loading of any page will keep loading over and over unless something changes in the page itself or you set it to load from your PC only.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.
