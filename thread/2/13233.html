    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm visiting Vienna for three days and Paris for five. Those who live there, could anyone suggest any places to visit that would be of interest to a computers/electronics/retro technology geek? Or are there any tech-related events (expos, gatherings, parties, etc) coming?
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, are there any tech/electronics markets in Vienna or Paris?<br/>_________________<br/>If you would not be forgotten

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well Europe is pretty small and you can travel to Russia by car.
<br/>
<br/>
Also if you want that real France exprience I suggest dressy casual and not too wealthy looking and walk from one end to anoter end of France at night.
<br/>
Don't leave your car out in certain areas your not sappose to park. Thats all I can say about France.
<br/>
<br/>
I would also check some other forums for people who sell stuff who lives n Europe also. Since everything is just a cake slice away it should not be any trouble. I don't know about rules and restrictions of luggage however.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

Although the pic is funny, I'm not sure if you're trying to agree or disagree.  New York to Kansas is definitely travelable by car.  So it sounds like you are agreeing?
<br/>
<br/>
U.S.-centric ideas removed, Europe IS pretty small compared with the bigger countries of the world (Canada, Russa, China, Australia, Brazil, etc).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">New York to Kansas is at travelling distance, but for a 5 day journey he'd be better off going to Portugal or England (depending on what part of France he is in)

And you are aware that Europe is about the same size as Australia, Brazil, USA, Canada and China! Remember that the UK and Scandinavia (Sweden, etc) are all part of Europe. In fact Europe is 200,000 square miles bigger than the USA, 50,000 square miles bigger than Canada and is bigger than Australia (according to the land size on wikipedia). For a continent it is very small, and is the second smallest continent.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
