For engineering try:
<br/>
<br/>
Stewart "Calculus"
<br/>
Kreyzig "Advanced Engineering Mathematics"
<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what editions these books are up to now.<br/>_________________<br/>There are 10 types of people in the world. Those who understand binary and those who don't.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Stupid me, I should have specified.  I'm going to apply for the monbukagakusho (scholarship to study in Japan) and they'll test math (if they let me take the test).  I should ask them what exactly they'll be testing.  I'm looking for a good study book in general.  To the extent that this is self study I'm mostly looking to learn useful stuff for programming.
<br/>
<br/>
The physics and chem are to study for the monbukagakusho test as well.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll look into the above books.  Thanks much!
