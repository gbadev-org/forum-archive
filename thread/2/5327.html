    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When the DS is turned off and I plug the charging adaptor to it, the orange(charging) led lights for a second and turns off. And if I remove the plug from the DS and put it in again, it does the same thing. However, when I try to plug it to the adaptor while the DS is on, the orange led keeps lighting all the time, but if I let into sleep mode, the led turns off.
<br/>
What is the solution to this???

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't have a DS but, Is the battery low? If not then, it must be fully charged (Thats what happens to me with my GBA SP when the battery is fully charged and I did'nt know).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, the light turns off when the battery is full. It stays on when you are playing because you are using electricity at that time, so it needs to be replenished.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
