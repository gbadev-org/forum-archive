    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was under the impression that the PSP had the power of a PS2.  If this is true, I don't see why Halo couldn't be end up portable.  The only problem is the same exact reason why Halo was never ported outside of the Xbox: it's Microsoft's game and so they've kept it exclusive to a Microsoft console.
<br/>
<br/>
Supposing that the PSP sells well, I would not be surprised if Microsoft eventually entered the handheld market the same way they did with the console market.  Why risk your own money and reputation when you can leave it to Sony to break the ground against Nintendo?  If and when they've proven it can be done, then you release your own.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Halo also looks a bit empty and boring and the main character is looking like a toy.

But thats all the power of Microsoft marketing.

They have already done that actually. For the console market they used Sega and their Dreamcast as a testing grounds for their ideas about Windows CE in consoles, R&amp;D'ing at a very low cost by working with Sega. Now they are doing the same with Gizmondo, although at lot smaller scale. So now we'll just wait and see if there's a Microsoft portable game console out in the next three years.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think it's the multiplayer aspect that makes it a good game. All other multiplayer FPS only let you live until you have been shot x number of times. With Halo's regenerating shields, a person can easily dominate the game if they are skilled. I think it pretty much changed the way people play a multiplayer FPS.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You mean like camping the armor in Goldeneye 007 (N64) or camping the health in a lot of the other FPS games? I also seem to remember that the very first FPS for a Nintendo system, <span style="font-style: italic">Faceball 2000</span> for Game Boy and Super NES, regenerated the player's health gradually as well.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
