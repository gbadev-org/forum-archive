    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What are the current DS Lite screens like? I remember them having some problems, and I tried out a friends yesterday. The bottom one had a horrible yellow tint, and the upper one ghosted more than my original DS when playing games. Is this a one off or are they all still like this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>

I finally brought a DS Lite today and I wish I had brought it earlier! Instantly the screens were a huge improvement, and then I realised I could still turn the backlight up one more setting. Strange, the one I have has hardly any tint on the bottom screen, where as hers is very noticeable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Every NDSl I have seen so far had rather noticable ghosting... but it's still looking way better than the PSP. ;^D
<br/>
No tint, whatsoever, though.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You know, I took a good look at my screen after reading this, and I can make out a coloration--the bottom screen will reflect more red than the top. With the backlight on it looks like a yellow tint, but I think it's additive and not subtractive. I haven't noticed it in the years I've had the thing, so it's not really a big deal.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah mine appears to have the same difference, but I guess that's to be expected from 2 different types of screens. My friends however has a very noticeable yellow tint on her touchscreen, which is why I was initially put off buying a Lite. Glad I did, though :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it is the touch screen module that turns yellow, not the LCD itself. You can get a replacement touch screen module for a few dollars. I have a launch day Nintendo DS and it does not have either problem. The yellowing and ghosting only are noticeable on DS Lites. I wonder if the DSi will have these issues too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've worked on about 12 DS Lite system so far, &amp; I have  not seen what ghosting that you are referring too.  Can you provide a photo example?
<br/>
<br/>
I can say that the DS Lite LCD is a 150% improvement over the GBA!<br/>_________________<br/>-#2pencil</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is best seen with two primary colors in a scene. It looks a lot like motion blur. :^)
<br/>
It can be "hidden" with good use of colors, though. However, it's still there.
<br/>
<br/>
I will try to make a photo and post it during next week - that is, if nobody else does it faster than me. :^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released
