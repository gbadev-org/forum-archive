<ul>
<br/>
<li>C - Coding
<br/>
</li><li>C++ -Coding
<br/>
</li><li>C# - Coding

</li><li>HTML - Scripting
<br/>
</li><li>CGI/Perl/Python/Ruby - Scripting
<br/>
</li><li>Java - Coding
<br/>
</li><li>Lua - Scripting
<br/>
</li><li>ASM - Coding
<br/>
</li><li>Make - Scripting (can you even really call it a language anyway?)
<br/>
</li><li>JavaScript - Scripting

Usually people talk about statically typed (Java, C, C++) and dynamically typed languages (Javascript, Python). Statically typed languages usually require compiling before they can be used as a program.

Then you have other ways to describe languages - "managed" (Java, Python) and "unmanaged" (C, C++). The difference here is the way the user deals with memory or the security measures involved.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

TeX is.

VMs and scripting languages do different things.  VMs run virtual instruction sets.  They can also be used to sandbox code in a virtual environment to make the resulting executable more stable.
<br/>
<br/>
Scripting languages for games, macro languages included, abstract common tasks so that complex tasks (like RPG events) are less laborious to put together.  You can make a scripter out of a poor programmer or savvy non-programmer to save money on labor expenses.  The end result is that a fair number of your scripts may be really ugly, so sandboxing scripted event code is a very good idea.
<br/>
<br/>
Game engine VMs were combined with custom assembler-like scripting languages in the SNES days to get games made.  I understand that the scripts were not especially hard to write, but they were incredibly hard to read.  =)

Then you'll have to forgive me. "Scripting language" doesn't really mean anything to me, except sometimes: "probably has an interpreter, maybe has a VM" in the nonexclusive sense. Assembly-like language, OTOH, means that the language is assembled directly rather than compiled or interpreted, and certainly runs directly on <span style="font-style: italic">some</span> kind of machine, be it real or virtual.
<br/>
<br/>
Getting even more OT...
<br/>
If you're just interested in opcode-controlled event scripting, I think the reason you won't find any of these systems out in the open is because they're as trivial to create as they are to write for, and I expect they're all tailored to exactly each task they're responsible for. I haven't done the necessary botany to really know how other people use these systems, but there's a reason they're not using TCL or $fad_scripting_language_du_jour -- any general language is overkill.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Programming is programming. What matters is getting the task done and meeting the requirements, not whether your language uses static/dynamic typing or whether it's compiled and interpreted. Of course, performance, including low memory usage, is often a requirement, and that may dictate the use of a compiled language, but the performance is the real requirement and the use of a compiled language is just incidental; it's only the means to achieve that requirement.
<br/>
<br/>
Back when I started programming I remember I had this hangup about what's "real" programming and what isn't, and this idea that languages like C and C++ were inherently superior to, say, Visual Basic. They're not (although I still wouldn't be caught dead using VB in particular). People care about your product, not about what it was made in.

Sure.  They are a basic grammar and an API all rolled into one.  I was actually hoping to see an old school scripting example just to make 2008 is a "better" time to be writing scripted events.  In a language with assembly-like grammar, you get to do fun things like use branch on zero statements to implement flow control (if / while).  Looking back, this sounds horrible if you have 300 scripted events to write, but I'm sure it was a nifty thing to do at the time.  =)

It sounds a lot like an assembled language. Though I don't think it would be all that problematic to write for even a lot of events. Just about any individual thing is probably fairly simple, and the language has been tailored to the task, after all.

Incidentally, I totally agree that LLVM and most other established VMs would be inappropriate for game scripting on the DS.

I'm sure some of them were, but one guy in the SNES days said that if you intend to break a million (units sold), you need to build <span style="font-weight: bold">everything</span> from the ground up.  I'm sure there were cases of revamping an existing game engine VM and revising the API for the next project.

Again, it depends on your lifecycle model.  I suspect something like the Super Robot Taisen series may have recycled the map scripting system for all the SNES titles.

The topic is "Coding Languages(<span style="font-weight: bold">Lack of a good word</span>) or Scripting Language?"  Lacking the vocabulary to ask what you think you want to know probably indicates poor knowledge of the problem domain.  But, if you ask anyway, you might learn something.  I wonder if the OP wanted to know the difference between "low level" (assembler) and "high level" (ruby) languages...

Fantastic advice.  You need to know what you want to do, and then pick a tool do it.  You could do everything with a hammer, but personally, I like to eat with specialized tools- forks, spoons and chopsticks.

PCs aren't Turing complete because they lack unbounded memory. You might need to step down to "LBA-complete" which is physically realizable. In this case, XSLT is LBA-complete, and a lot of things use XSLT to turn XML under some random schema into XHTML for display.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as I can tell, a "scripting language" is one that doesn't aim to be "as fast as C". Generally, such languages run in a bytecode interpreter and use some sort of dynamic typing and/or late binding. In dynamic typing, variables don't have types; their values have types. Often, in the case of Lua, Python, and JavaScript, an "object" is just a dictionary from field names to their values.
<br/>
<br/>
So to relate it to the topic: "How can dynamically typed languages, such as Lua or JavaScript, improve a DS program?"

Shouldn't the topic just be refiled into OT? The original post doesn't really have anything to do with the DS. None of the generated discussion really has anything to do with the DS either, aside from the admonitions to bring the discussion back to topic--a place it's never really been.

Here's why I tried to swing it back to topic: People on Slashdot keep recommending XNA as a way to try to break into the video game industry. But XNA games have to be either Xbox 360 exclusive or Xbox 360 + Windows exclusive, as XNA doesn't run a game model written in C++ (even with /clr:pure) and no other platform runs a game model written in C# with the XNA libraries. So a truly cross-platform game has to be written in a "scripting" language, so that it can be run in an interpreter written in C# (for Xbox 360 and possibly Windows), in an interpreter written in Java (for cell phones and web browsers), and in an interpreter written in C++ (for other PC-class operating systems, DS, GP2X, or Pandora). Things like that are why Z-machine, AGI, SCI, and SCUMM were invented.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Zune.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, emulating or interpreting with C#/XNA is likely to be incredibly slow, at least on Xbox 360 and Zune, because there is no ability to use pointers. For example: in the case of a framebuffer, this means replicating the data three times using relatively slow functions just to update the screen once. According to the author of an unreleased NES emulator for the Zune, the screen update speed alone limited it to 7 frames per second.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On unix/linux hosts, virtually all of them that actually provide CGI will (perhaps unintentionally) allow you to upload binaries. It's the great part of CGI--it's a common interface. The handler doesn't know (or care about) the difference between an elf binary and a bash script. So long as it runs, it runs. If it talks CGI, then it might even do something useful. :P<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You (multiple individuals) are interpreting a lot, from what I see.
<br/>
<br/>
Guess why I put quotes around the word "Real"? ;^p
<br/>
The word self/irony (it that's what it's called in english) comes to mind, althouhg I do realize, that this is probably very hard to detect and not so obvious in my post.
<br/>
Also, I consider programmers that work with scripting languages real programmers. (Notice the lack of quotes here.) As long as people know their stuff and don't jerk around how they can "programm" in HTML (not in java script, they haven't heard of it yet). I do not attack the original poster with that in any way.
<br/>
<br/>
In my "defense", I could only judge from the original post (and it frustrated me a little bit, I have to admit that), which seems rediculous to start with. Anything else is fine, but should, in my opinion, be split, as most of the discussion seems offtopic, even though the subject is somewhat related.
<br/>
<br/>
As I understand it, this thread was started to gather some impressions wheather some languages are considered scripting languages or programming languages. I don't see a lot of post trying to elaborate on that, probably due to the rather poor quality of the original post (I don't know if the poster has a higher quality of posts or not, and in this case it doesn't matter). tondopi has only made one comment so far, which is pretty much "not right" "by definition." Because markup is not scripting, but can rather contain scripting, if specifically supported. Exel files aren't exactly scripts... But they can contain VisualBasic macros. At least in MS Office.
<br/>
<br/>
But hey, whatever. Smile and keep dicussing, I'm fine with it. No offense.
