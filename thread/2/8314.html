I'm sort of a pragmatist/theorist hybrid I guess. I learn best by reading/listening for a while and putting it to use immediately, but I'm not satisfied until I have some nice quiet homework to fully absorb what I learned and understand the details of how/why it works.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well there is a book by Honey and Mumford, one in 1991, and on in the late 80's. The first is a book on teachin teaching using the learning styles, the second is for the learner.
<br/>
<br/>
Some people are a mixture. There is also a theory using 2 learning styles with a combination of (I think) Pragmatist / Theorist and Reflector / Activist. There is also a 7/8 wheel learning style that makes use of about 5/6 learning attributes - but is fairly complex.
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to note is that people enter different tasks in different learning styles. There is a learning cycle - which takes 4 stages, and each stage representing a learning style. Each stage compliments the next. The learning cycle - I think - is on page 41.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
