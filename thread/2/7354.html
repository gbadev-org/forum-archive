    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I'll give you $20 for your PSP if you haven't sold it by now.  I know it's not as hot an item as the DS, but I wouldn't mind having something to put my feet up on.

<br/>
Whatcha think?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Even if i'de wanted to sell if for you, i got some reasons why not...
<br/>
<br/>
First of all, i don't actually have the PSP! GBAX is taking thier time and i am still waiting for it to arrive.
<br/>
Second, i'm going to sell the PSP and donate most of the money for the DS Wifi bounty, and devkitPro.
<br/>
Third, isn't 20$ is a bit... low?
<br/>
And finally, i don't think GBAX are actually planning on shipping me one :/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Why not?
<br/>
<br/>
1st: I just thought I would ribb you some more.. Got bored of doing it on IRC only.. :P
<br/>
2nd: You still wouldn't be the top donater for the DS WiFI Bounty :P
<br/>
3rd: Like I said, I can get a pretty nice foot stool for $20.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally... I agree.
<br/>

Edit: Oh wait.. it's only been 6 months.. maybe he is building it from scratch?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

as i have said, i don't think i will ever get it -_-

6 months to arrange a shipment... Maybe GBAX had some problems, but isnt correct to make a compo and send prizes after months. Can you contact other winners to see if they have received something?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://itaprogaming.free.fr/" target="_blank">My homepage</a>!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, That's what I think as well.. I shouldn't poke fun I guess, cuase it's not LiraNuna's fault...   We all know GBAX.com was sued by Sony (or, at least that is the rumor) but if you are going to put a compo together, you shouldn't offer prizes you don't have.. so being sued or not, the PSP should have been sitting there, waiting to ship..  Of course, that is just my opinion..  What is even worse, is that LiraNuna has chatted with the guy on IRC and he says he is sending it, or will send it, or has sent it.. but of course, LiraNuna never gets it..
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it's because I am new to the homebrew scene (since the DS came out) and didn't realize that compos were like this in the past.. and that a lot of homebrew devers have been "screwed" by the compo holders..
<br/>
<br/>
LiraNuna, I say these things playfully.  No harmful intentions.  If it really bothers you, let me know in PM and I will stop kidding about it.  If you ever do receive your PSP, let me know..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For a while there I thought Datel didn't come through with payments for hombrew games, I was corrected recently that they were. But they never released the cart did they? I heard the guy who organised this lost his job from datel. Then again this is all just talk from IRC so who knows?
<br/>
<br/>
Then we have neoflash latest comp. Mollusk hasn't receieved his first prize of a PSP yet. Ok so the MK2/MK3 isn't out yet. They could have at least sent out the PSP.
<br/>
<br/>
I dunno, personally it's all a bit dodgy. If they don't deliver why should we ever endorse or enter a comp by these people again?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GBAX are usually quite reliable in handing out prizes even if their choice of winners seems a bit odd sometimes.

Hard to know what to do really. Is there anywhere you can complain to when competition prizes aren't handed out?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
