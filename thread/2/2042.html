    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you talking about the equivalent of flash carts, or something that can rip ROMs from carts?  I'm not aware of any NES/SNES flash carts, although they may have been part of dev kits.  I think copiers are probably your only option at this point.  Famicom copiers are extremely rare.  I'm not aware of any NES copiers, but one could use an NES to famicom converter.  Super Famicom copiers are also rare, just not as rare.

By the way, there is also a nice and polished Tetris on the GBA, Tetris C64 ;o) available at <a href="http://rmstudiogames.free.fr" target="_blank">http://rmstudiogames.free.fr</a>
<br/>
<br/>
True that Tet*is Advance and TOD are really nice, however I regret that they lack an important feature. Depending on the geometry of the shapes, some will not be able to be turned when too close from the edge of the screen ! Really annoying when game speed is high... Tetris C64 lets you rotate any shape even when at the edge of the screen. Easy to implement and so user friendly...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

BPS, Blue Planet Software, Bullet-Proof Software, The Tetris Company LLC. These are Henk Rogers's enterprises to market the Tetris brand, among other things. For instance, you'll see a "BPS" credit whenever you turn on <span style="font-style: italic">Tetris</span> for Game Boy or <span style="font-style: italic">Tetris Worlds</span> for Game Boy Advance.

Care to discuss algorithms? I've been looking for a good way to do "easy spin" (as <span style="font-style: italic">Tetris Worlds</span> for GameCube calls it) that won't feel like cheating. Try <span style="font-style: italic">Tetris DX</span> for Game Boy Color, hold a stick against a wall, and rapidly press one of the turn buttons. (A turbo controller connected to a Super Game Boy or Game Boy Player makes this easier.) The piece will actually move <span style="font-style: italic">up!</span><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
By "easy spin", you mean being able to rotate the shape even when you are close to the edge ? I do not think that in mine, the shape would go up... I'll try but I can not imagine (still having the code in mind) that happening :O)
<br/>
When you say "care to discuss algorithm ?", do you want me to let you know how I implemented that ?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, I didn't try Tetris C64. At first, by only the name, I thought it would be a C=64 game running in emulation on the GBA.  But then I looked at its screenshots, and it looked like a native program. Still, when I went to <a class="postlink" href="http://rmstudiogames.free.fr/Products%5CTetris%5CTetris_V1.zip" target="_blank">download it</a> using the Mozilla web browser, I got a 404 (not found) error, possibly because of backslashes in the URL. (According to specification, URLs must use forward slashes.)
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I want to know how you implemented knowing which way to move a piece when rotating it should the most obvious rotation wind up overlapping the playfield.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Emulation ? This is way beyond my knowledge and competences :O)
<br/>
Concerning the backslash, it's because I used this f......g Word to make my HTML page and it inserted these non compliant slashes. Will be fixed soon !
<br/>
<br/>
Concerning the easy spin, here is what I do:
<br/>
A shape had three coordinates. An X an Y of course, plus a dY (between 0 and 7) to implement the fact that my shape is falling on a pixel basis rather than on a block basis. Animation is quite smooth. To handle the easy spin, I add a fourth coordinate called originalX used only when rotation is not possible. At that moment I inspect if the shape is on left part or the right part of the playfield. Let's say I'm on the left part, I store X in originalX and increment X until the shape fits in the playfield. Now it's done, if player moves the shape, I just forget about originalX, but if the player wants to rotate, I reaffect my originalX into X (eventually reapplying this algorithm if it still does not fit in this new configuration).
<br/>
And that's it. After reading this, I can imagine it is not quite clear... If it does not make sense, I can send you the piece of code :O)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So, "If rotating the piece would make it hit a side wall, nudge it toward the center." Did I understand that right?
<br/>
<br/>
But it still seems a bit incomplete.  What if rotating the piece would make it hit blocks, as in the following diagram?</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code"> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
