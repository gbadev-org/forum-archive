<br/>
I have had this book, Beginning Direct3d Game Programming by Wolfgang F. Engel, for quite a while. I haven't been reading it much because it is much to advanced for me. I really want a new book but don't have the money to get one. I was just wondering if any one would be willing to trade me for another book that covers a less advanced topic. Some of the books I am interested in are:
<br/>
