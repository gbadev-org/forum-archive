    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just though I would let you know that the EZFA II from Success-HK is not from the same maker of the EZFA. The maker of the original EZFA Borden has stated this and is asking that people do not buy this product. It is in no way affiliated with the EZFA. 
<br/>
Also the website "www.ezf-advance.com/" is not the official site of the EZFA but it's <a href="http://www.gba-toys.com." target="_blank">www.gba-toys.com.</a>
