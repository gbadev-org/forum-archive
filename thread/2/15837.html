On a keyboard the homerow are the letters asdf jkl; i.e. the keys your fingers sit on when they are in a neutral, resting, comofortable position. What would the DS equivalent be for you?
<br/>
Where are the thumbs in a comfortable, neutral position on a DS, which keys and their combinations can easily be reached?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Index fingers loosely on the shoulder buttons, right thumb on A, left on the center of the dipad.

This is possibly related to why I <span style="font-style: italic">usually</span> spin my tetrominoes in a single direction.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I always have to grab it a second time to move the ds lite higher in my hands and put the the shoulder button next to my distals phalages and the thumbs in the middles of the d pad and the middle of the buttons ( ABXY )....<br/>_________________<br/>-jerome-</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So I guess the middle of the d-pad (all keys accessible), and a, a/x on the right.
<br/>
When playing mario kart (on ds lite), I notice that both my thumbs and index fingers get cramped because the space is cramped. I wonder whether not using the shoulder buttons would help. Maybe using only d-pad and a,x would make playing easier for people with bigger hands.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
My index fingers go to the shoulder buttons naturally. My left thumb is a little off-center of the D+pad, I have it sort of in-between Up and Right. My right thumb is smack in the middle of ABXY, so none of those buttons are difficult to me. Because of this, "Select" is the most difficult button to hit quickly, as I have to actually move my thumb forward. With start, I can just quickly tap it over to the "right" of the buttons and it goes right to it.
<br/>
<br/>
The lite s the same, except that I dislike the positioning of the Start+Select buttons. I like to Snake (for time trials) in MarioKartDS, and I found that the buttons on the Lite weren't responsive enough for me, so I actually traded in my lite for a Classic, and I'm happy that I did so, as I prefer it. I have big hands, so I like there to be a little more handheld there to hold.
