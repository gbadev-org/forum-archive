    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone. I've recently completed my 8month old project "Knee Deep in Phobos" Its a custom doom wad for those who don't know, and I thought I'd share it with all of you. The only way you can relate this to a ds is by the fact that its fully playable on dsdoom. The maps are done in doom2 format but the dehacked is in .bex meaning it uses alot of prboom features. 
<br/>
So what is this?
<br/>
Its a 9 level doom1 remake for doom2, I'm presuming you think this sounds a tad bit bland? Well I can tell you that the levels have been extended drastically. It also comes with 3 new weapons Super shotgun, Rifle, and Machine gun, 2/3 brought to you via Dehacked. Two new monsters. (a new zombie and final boss)
<br/>
Now a for a short gameplay video :)
