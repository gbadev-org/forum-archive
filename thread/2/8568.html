    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is a thankyou note, to all the people whos hard work made the best christmas present even better!
<br/>
<br/>
When my girlfriend offered to get me a DS as my christmas present i wasnt sure if it was for me, but after looking at some games online and somehow stumbling onto this site, my mind was made up with the promise of an mp3 player, movie player, nes/snes emulator, linux + more.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem for me was that i was absolutely terrified that i could damage my girlfriends present to me, but thats where everyone here helped.
<br/>
<br/>
I may not have posted much, but ive read a near encyclopedias worth of data of the last month and i must thank all of you who sit here and write clear and concise guides, i must offer more thanks to those give advice to myself and other newbies and I must offer even more gratitude to those who have written the software to make my favourite toy even more fun to play with :)
<br/>
<br/>
So thankyou to everyone who has helped me with pimping my DS! I can now happily report that i have been listening to mp3s playign the original FF1 on the nes (the gba game isnt the same is it?) and have been watching futurama and harvey birdman all day.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.
