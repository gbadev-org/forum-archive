    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Scenario:  For the rest of your life, you can only say five phrases.
<br/>
"Yes."
<br/>
"No."
<br/>
"How much does this cost?"
<br/>
"Where is the bathroom?"
<br/>
You can choose the fifth phrase, but it must be a question.  What question do you choose?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Before you go to a foreign country, what phrases do you think would be most useful.  Assume a one week trip.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to go with:<ul>A) Where is the bathroom?
<br/>
B) Yes.
<br/>
C) No.
<br/>
D) Basic counting.
<br/>
E) How much does this cost?</ul>
<br/>
I should probably get in the habbit of asking what I really want to know in the first place. =P  Admittedly, psychic mates was really funny.

<br/>
Another good thing to remember is to grab appropriate written things to show to people.  For example, it really helps to get a hotel's business card to show to taxi drivers.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, where are you travelling to?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
