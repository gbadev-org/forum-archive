    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I were old enough/had the money to invest, Nintendo is doing very well, considering the Wii and DS Lites are selling like crazy and the numbers are way above Sony and Microsoft's offerings.
<br/>
<br/>
And Nintendo's cool, I have a GBC, GBA, DS regular, GC, and Wii...
<br/>
<br/>
I'd want a DS Lite but I'm saving money for a homebrew launcher for gamecube and some Wii games.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Well considering the Wii is using practically the same hardware as the Cube I'm guessing that they are making hardware profits already!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well...The Wii seems to be doing pretty well...
<br/>
<br/>
It was hard to find one when I got mine, I had to get it the day they came in stock, and they only were in stock like every 2 weeks.  A week or so later, I was at Target (where I got my Wii) looking at Wii games, and in the short period I was looking, they sold 2 Wii consoles (it was a day they had just stocked up, and already there were only 3 left).
<br/>
<br/>
And considering I"m playing mine right now...yeah, it's a great console, just wish it had homebrew :(<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right, but the major stock impact from the DS and Wii are pretty much over.  Your only looking at profit reports.  It's when they announce a new device, and it sells faster than they can produce it, do you get the spike that everyone likes.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
