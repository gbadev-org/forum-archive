    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Before we start, i do not have a wii, but from my reading of forum posts who have one i theorised a hack method.
<br/>
<br/>
Wii has virtual console games right? they can be downlaoded  to the sd card and thus we can get the "packages" on our pc.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason i said packages is that they contain a manual too and they are allot larger than their respective rom images without the manual.
<br/>
<br/>
Now is that mannual seperately coded for each game? or is it just a bunch of image files automatically loaded by the wii os
<br/>
<br/>
if each manual has its own code, to run our own code would be like opening a hacked virtual console package and running the menu.
<br/>
<br/>
discuss.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope the Readme method materialises</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just for clarification, you can't copy Virtual Console software to an SD card.  You can copy the channel data, however.  It seems to be one giant lump of data, called "content.bin".  However it should be possible to reverse-engineer the data structure used, and then craft a Channel file that, when run, does <span style="font-weight: bold">something</span> (probably an overflow, or a jump to some "malicious" code) that then executes a bootloader for homebrew software.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm very excited about the possibility of homebrew titles on the Wii. My thought is that since the Wii shares architecture with the Gamecube, it may be easier to hack considering the documentation already available. I'm thinking this may be a good entry point for homebrew Wii. At least you could run some form of unsigned code using GC homebrew tools, although it will likely be restricted to a sandbox like playing GBA games on the DS. But just like the DS, this may allow running some sort of launcher that could play unsigned Wii executables. This would be my initial idea, although I'm not a hardware expert, so I'm just tossing out ideas at this point.
<br/>
<br/>
What Technokami said sounds very promising. If the data saved on the SD cards holds more than just a ROM file, it is likely it also contains some code specific for the Wii. It also seems a lot more useful to be able to run homebrew on an SD card rather than some proprietary device or even having to burn a DVD every time. This is why Im glad Nintendo went with a standard format like SD. 
<br/>
<br/>
I really hope people are working on this right now, because I have some really cool ideas for some Wii games I'd like to make. Also, if there are any serious hackers who need a Wii, just toss up a donation link. I will definately send you a few bucks if you can make this happen.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
There might be check sums though to check if the binaries are "clean" and not corrupted since the games can be put on sd cards nintendo might have corruption detetction.
<br/>
<br/>
Put that content .bin in a hex editor and have a look around. Please :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It will not happen that easy. The encryption on the ds was small because it was being done in real time using low cost hardware that was being shipped inside every cartridge. It will be as hard to crack as the copy protection used by sky-by-broadband - which has been cracked, but there are much more people who want to watch films than there are who want to develop for nintendo wii.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

otherwise people would be able to put their sd cards in someone else's wii and copy the game they downloaded...

im sure there is a way to overload the save buffer though and run unsigned code!

Kind of funny how everything we're doing on the DS side has a chance of occuring on the Wii as well.  First will come the PassWii, which will exploit the GCN backwards compatibility to run Wii homebrew, but then PassWii2 will arrive once a downloadable firmware update disables the original.  Eventually NoWiis (hehe) will make running homebrew easier, and they will become integrated with Wii-slot devices that will be shunned by the homebrew community for catering too much to pirates.  World War Thwii will then commence, the victor yet to be decided.
<br/>

That would be nice, but nobody should get their hopes up like with the DS - the fact that Zelda: Twilight Princess ships in two SKUs hints that this isn't possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's been no need. I'm sure there's a second-stage loader that can be exploited (or does the DS check for extra data appended to the binary? Could try overflowing memory.) but hardware is so cheap nobody's bothered to try.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
