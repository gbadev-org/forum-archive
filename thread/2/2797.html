    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are any of you going to the GDC? I've been working on a GBA game project over the past two years and hope to meet up with some prospective publishers to generate some interest. This may prove extremely difficult, but maybe I'll bump into the right person! 
<br/>
<br/>
So if you plan on attending then perhaps we can setup an informal gathering of GBA developers and show off what we're working on and exchange ideas, etc. This would probably be more fruitful than running around hoping to find publishers and getting their attention! ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Hope some of you will be there!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You might get more than 3K for it though, if the game has style and quality :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, so far not too many people are going. I understand in part because this is mostly a hobby development site and travelling to the GDC isn't exactly cheap. That's the reason I didn't go the past couple years.

<br/>
I'll be getting a tablet PC to show off our project, so if you're interested (project or just to try a tablet PC!) and you will be there, then drop me an email:
