    <h4>#125024 - RegalSin - Tue Apr 10, 2007 11:17 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The job is busboy. The sad part is that most Busboys are short, Speak Spanish, and I look Spanish based but I do not speak it 
<br/>
<br/>
Everybody thinks I am Mexican or some kind of Spanish so most people ask about my background almost when they come in. The Waiter staff dislikes the cooking staff, the cooking staff is in entire other speaking voice, and the owners is a bunch of fat white haired cows.
<br/>
<br/>
The begining of the day is heck with all the Elders demanding Sletzer water proclaiming that they need it to live, the the afternoon I have to deal with families who is trying to find some reason to not give me a tip, and during the late nights I see people come inside with there dates, drunk, demanding beer when we can't give them any, or some weirdo self proclaim pimps saying kill, kill, kill,
<br/>
<br/>
While I am working I saying the following besides doing the big bitch 5PM-7AM shift with a whole staff full of smokers and a kitchen full of people who is litterially in another time zone. 
<br/>
<br/>
What I hate the most is how the people who work here is not healty. The worst tippers are Negros ( note how I do not use the slag or false term ).
<br/>
Most of them are the crazies at night, the families have the church women with nothing in there heads, and they allways ask for a glass of hot water to clean there utensils 9 which are hypo cleaned already ). Then the families are super wusses which is good.
<br/>
<br/>
I hate this job with all my heart. The only thing good is that I make most of my pay from the 15% of the waiters and soetimes people tip me on the job that I am doing.  so far I make from 30-70 a night and right now that comes to around 337 or 387 dollars in one week. 
<br/>
<br/>
I do not know the pay yet. It might be 2 dollars and hour which I will probably complain about. Still I heard I am sappose to make 70-90 a shift.
<br/>
<br/>
God I want to kill my self
<br/>
God I did not mean that
<br/>
God please cast Judgement on me 
<br/>
God thank you for this job
<br/>
<br/>
I want to get a couple of Dynamite sticks and Gasoleane and blow it to smitheruines.
<br/>
<br/>
It is hell on ice and god almighty why won't the place just blow up.
<br/>
<br/>
My hands are not made for this type of work. I am thinking about Geek sqaud, or even postal worker, or officer.
<br/>
<br/>
The thing is I need something that I could make enough money to live on my own at the same time not something that I ging to cost me my health and makes use of my kowledge.
<br/>
<br/>
No really never eat at any outdorsy place again. The kitchen is torked out meth lab, the materials and only half washed. If you do go to any of these places please tip the busboys or at least six dollars towards the waiters.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I pray I get fired. I dream about working there after I drop dead on whatever is left of my futon, and even playback seeing the place get blown up.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I feel like fry man from Aqau Team force. Only I cut my hair, took out the braces ( which you should never do once you get them ), and I can't shoot laser beams out of my eyes. If I could the first day I would have probably blow up the entire place. I can't float but I shoot up ( pour ) listereine up my nose to clear my stuffyness from the resteraunt.
<br/>
<br/>
I am telling you this to anybody who project I am working on and understand that I will have limited time now unless I am paid in advance. Allowing me to dedicate time to people here. So anybody who's project I am working on plese PM on the sed prject.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

The thing is I am the tallest person on the job who does not have a hump or is hunched over. I am constantly walking barely being able to take breaks only on slow days. 
<br/>
<br/>
While I need the money I also consider my health. Each night I come home with cold in my troath and my vioce is out of tune ( I am unable to talk in certain high or low pitches ).
<br/>
<br/>
Also the main staff. Some time during there shift they go not so outside and smoke.
<br/>
<br/>
They are godless and want death. There is even a guy on the job who is turned on by Condalisa Rice interlect, teeth, and stair walking behin
<br/>

<br/>
There is four diffrent atmospheres. The kitchen which is dusty and is basically a meth lab. The dining area which is carooded with peoples breaths and smells of past meals, the cold storage area where there might be vermin from time to time, and the auwful bathroom which just plane stinks. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhows yesterday I got a cold on the job and all my energy went away. Now this is the weekend so the big bosses was up my arse on working. 
<br/>
<br/>
I feel like they a slave drivers telling me you got to do this and that. They make me do this and that. Even I was at slow speed. All they care about is the money dammit. I am throwing up in the bathroom ( which smells like death ) and my throath and eyes start to hurt along with a head ache and you have these guys telling me your being lazy.
<br/>
<br/>
I am no friggin illeagal so I decided that after this week screw this job. not only that I start have dreams of working and get up with soar legs. The best dream was watching the whle place blow up and I rewind it and watched it again. Working here has no inetlectual needs and is making me lose my inspiration. 
<br/>
<br/>
After seeing all the kinds of people twice in two weeks I truly see the world in a slightly diffrent way. I am now truly convinced people do destroy them selves unpurpose (which I already determined that previously with barely any contact with people). 
<br/>
<br/>
I think I am going to write a report on this place also. Lastly never out again. The dishes is half washed and the people serving the food is touching money. They also have convicts working in this place.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

<br/>
About wages and europe. There is this girl who is practically paying her way threw college with $427 per class and she is on a visa and is not allowed to work. Compared to me she is only making One dollar per hour.....I am not kidding anybody she get's paid one dollar per hour.
<br/>
<br/>
I also think she might be engaged and personally she was like America you get to have so much fun rather in europe where you only have some fun and then just you know. I forget where she is from I think it starts with a C or something.
<br/>
<br/>
I will never ever ever ever eat out again after working with a kitchen full of illeagals and a staff full of smokers along with all the super happy customers for two weeks and being under paid... Never again.
<br/>
<br/>
The thing is minimum wage is a must for all jobs in USA espeically in NYC and so on popular places. The thing is the people in this place could get deported faster then you could think about it.
<br/>
<br/>
As the saying goes... fear nothing but fear itself. After this job I have no fear not even of fear and there is no such thing as fear. There is no god in in that place after having to smile to all these abominations of life while serving and cleaning there messes.

UPDATE ON MY CONDITION....
<br/>
<br/>
I am home with a scarf around my neck. My shirt I never wear since I'm not too fond is on and I am on the couch. 
<br/>
<br/>
I made 666 dollars in two week which might have been a perfect 800 but then again to hell with that horrible place. It is not 1960's it is 200? and for the first time I could remember I have pink eye and it still burns to drink OJ or anything with Sugar or is sweet.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

<br/>
<br/>
It will be something around me being an assistant to this guy who fixes boats. It sappose to pay $200 a week. That is $800 a month.  
<br/>
<br/>
Generally that is a lower wage then the busboy job which was a lucky $1160 a minumum per month plus tips. 
<br/>
<br/>
The plus side hopefully I am getting less hours and hopefully if am painting or weilding I get a mask. 
<br/>
<br/>
Plus there is a nice sea food resteraunt ( which I was going to apply to get a job there before but never returned the papers ). Then again in the place I was working I would rather not eat from any place again except a Sushi joint or Chinese food.

Well my last job was 10-15 hours mostly 5PM-2AM, 9PM-7AM, 5PM-7PM for six days and with the minimum with 15% tips from the waitresses/waiters and a minimum of $30 per night tips and $110 per week I would get in four weeks is $1100-$1400. 
<br/>
<br/>
What I do now is 9AM-5PM on a five day week day. The worst I imagine I am under a boat while they are lifting it or somebody throws fire in the storage ( which is filled with half filled gas tanks and propaine valves. )
<br/>
<br/>
This job is basically me taking orders moving stuff around. I get to see how some of the business is runned. The sad part is I think I may have taken another persons job in the process.
<br/>
<br/>
The guy is wearing a HMD shirt and have one of those surfers hair cuts and has grey hair. Imagine a guy from the 80's ( OR those guys you see in GTA or a 80's movie ) who have had the same exact job from he was ...my age with stained teeth and a small beard. He came to work riding one of those mini bicycles.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope I am not taking this guys lively hood. Still I heard he would come late every now and again. 
<br/>
<br/>
Right now I think I have seen the worst of my new job and it is my first day and I am lifting boat motors and giant rusty wrenches. Never knew Boats was that Cheap also only $4000 I think it was or was it 4.2 Mil????
<br/>
<br/>
At least I am alone most of the time and there is no cameras or speakers listening on me. I get to wear a mask and gloves which is the best part. The air itself is pretty clear at times and I have to remove my mask to blow my nose. 
<br/>
<br/>
Yes it is kinda heavy to lift part of a motor boat and yes I see dead barnicles or those thingies all tday besides the boss person laundary. 
<br/>
Personaly the best job is the only there that I would have to go to a college for and that is the guy who operates the crane kinda like getting a bartender License.
<br/>
<br/>
The thing is I need the money but I can't risk my health and sanity. The other Job I was singing like a radio while people stare at me in the morning*......While I do enjoy that and seeing all the so called people I rather be alone.
<br/>
<br/>
Again $1 per hour waitress......WTF???? and all these "illeagals" in the back. I want to save them all but I can't.
<br/>
<br/>
*After that job I have no fear. I am pretty sure that I can run naked in the night now. The night is no diffrent then the day to me now.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

It does cost money; but is it not possible to get a loan with the expectation of having higher financial expectations? There is risk, but in his situation that risk is far more beneficial to the alternative of never having an opportunity!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So the guy paid me the rest for the first week ( which was only $100 )
<br/>
and yet I have not gotten payment for last week since the person did not come and pick up the boat.
<br/>
<br/>
Now what is funny a boat there cost at least $4000 and this is just for repairs. 
<br/>
<br/>
YET THE PERSON CAN'T EVEN SPARE $200. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now I need to take out a loan for $1000 at least to cover my behind. Please check what I have for sale and if ther is something you are intrested in please tell me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So today I went to work to finally look for my pay from last week. ALL I GOT WAS ANOTHER FRIGGIN $100. 
<br/>
<br/>
After sweeping up to find a dried up condom.
<br/>
<br/>
listing to the crude remarks.
<br/>
<br/>
And also watching a lesbian complain about her boat and listening to a hermit talk about frog roaches while taking a hit.
<br/>
<br/>
More important having pay delayed this is it I am not going back to that place.
<br/>
<br/>
Cleaning down a boat while somebody else is walking around in there briefs and is not too far away from me.
<br/>
<br/>
They delay my pay. So I took the last Red Bull and went home only to talk to somebody about my from old job.
<br/>
<br/>
Soooo I am selling stuff and my main goal is $1000 at least. So like if you can send a message about thw stuff I am selling.
<br/>
<br/>
The day that place catch a fire is the day I smile agian. At least at the restraunt job I had respect from people in the back and front. I have respect here too but there is no pay comming here at all.

    <h4>#130986 - RegalSin - Sat Jun 09, 2007 9:13 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I think I will go back to my old job since.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Tax free
<br/>
2. Free Food ( my have bateria and be sabatoged )
<br/>
3. It is less then a five minute drive or 30 minute walk.
<br/>
<br/>
While I might lose my voice Ihave recovered it over time.
<br/>
<br/>
also I have this nonsense to deal with.
<br/>
<br/>
So a delevery man rings my door bell and says "I Have a delivery for my mothers name" and I get dressed to go down stairs to get the delivery. They ring again and say the exacty same thing.
<br/>
<br/>
Then afterwards I go downstairs and see this really buffed out guy with tatoo on his arm waiting for the lift. I go to look for the delivey person and even before I turn the buff bald guy with tattoos ask for mothers name and then I had to reply ( which I should have never had done ) and gives me a paper and walks off thinking I am the person. I tell the guy I can't let people in and that I only live with the person and he says he understands.
<br/>
<br/>
WTF????
<br/>
<br/>
This is for another court case that my mother who was in a accident earlier some time last three our four years ago for a passenger from the other car who slammed into her car ( which the front got crushed like a can ) .
<br/>
<br/>
The end result was my mother back was damaged ( whiflash or whatever ) and she had to go to shock treatment ( or was it threapy )with needles and she constantly was getting a bunch of stuff for her to use on her back.
<br/>
<br/>
Ever since that accident she barely moved around for a long time. She walked around the place with a cane for a long time. The other two guys from her perspective was okay looking.
<br/>
<br/>
In fact she even told me that ( she might have seen the two guys exchange seating prefrences ) while she was shocked in the car.
<br/>
Another person from outside sawed the accident that was there fault.  
<br/>
<br/>
The thing is that now somebody who was not the driver wants more money and is trying to get my mother to go to supreme court ( not the big court the court of our boro ).
<br/>
<br/>
I heard from the cable guy awhile back that his freinds spend all day getting into accidents for money and my father told me that people do this for a living to women mostly knowing that they have insurance.
<br/>
<br/>
I mean dammit all when you have people in the world with business and law degrees and using them against other people. Just to get money from the other drivers insurance they ram other peoples cars.
<br/>
<br/>
Lastly the guy came to where we used to live and my uncle the super was wondering how did he get in and to be honest I am wondering the same thing too. How did this guy get into our building?
<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering if the guy would sneak into our place if I was not there.
<br/>
My mom told me that the other people probably hired him to make sure that she got the letter. 
<br/>
<br/>
A teacher once told me that they do this all the time when they try to get people to serve jury dutie. First they send the letter. Then again. Then they lie and say package or something else just to get you to come outside. They even might wait for you at work.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally that is not the most wrong thing I have seen lately.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay so now I had to cut my hair before asking for my job back. I can't go back and ask them to cantact me if they have anymore openings for ubsboy with my hair looking laid back not for this job where 
<br/>
I look like Mr. belverdeer without jacket.
<br/>
<br/>
So I had to get a repalcement tip for my Hair cutting machine which I was sappose to cut my hair from painting before but I did not. So what I did I cearched the 99 cents stores first but no luck yet I did found some nice frames. 
<br/>
<br/>
So I finally found this place but it was 12.99 and this store helper guy took out a pack of them from a returned product where I paid him $3.
<br/>
<br/>
With that on the way I found this TV lying in a pile of trash. It said SONY and reminded me of my original TV. So after the kids and adults went away I picked up the TV from the smelly trash and carried it home.
<br/>
<br/>
So I turned it on to find it working then I tried a test with my SNES. Hey guess what it was not my TV that was malfunctioning it was one of my replacement SNES that I was currently using has a region lockout.
<br/>
<br/>
Soooo now I am using a SNES that has a slightly busted but repairable Second input and power reciever that is rusted but at least does not have a lockout.
<br/>
<br/>
Then again I think it might be the TV that has a lockout. Since certain TV's will not work with some SNES. 
<br/>
<br/>
I never imaged that I would own a SNES that has region lockout. It was like viewing threw PAL mode on my computer but more viewable.
<br/>

This weekend there is going to be job fair so hoefully I will not end up working Wuncler again getting called pep boy or being told things in Spanish even if I could make 1100-1400 in one month.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.
