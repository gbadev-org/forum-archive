    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got a mint condition 2004 Compo cart - the actual hardware.  Do you think it would sell for a decent price?  It's a pretty niche piece, but perhaps it might be valuable to a cartridge completionist?

I don't plan on selling it, but it would be nice to know that it's worth something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Considering supply is quite limited, I do no think it would be hard to get more than what you paid for it. Just last week a friend offered to buy one of mine and offered a few times what we sold it for back then, but I plan on keeping mine for a long time (especially the one Miyamoto signed!) :)
<br/>
<br/>
The only problem I can see is getting word out to interested buyers/collectors that a cart is up for sale, but I guess if you post on a few forums (digitpress and whatnot) it shouldn't be a problem.
