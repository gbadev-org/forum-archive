    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi folks. I'm a homebrewy GBA/GP32/DS guy who's been keeping a real low profile. I'm in a bit of a jam, and I'd like your advice.
<br/>
<br/>
Some time ago (five or six months) I released a kinda major DS project... I thought nothing of it at the time, it was just a silly something I put together. But, recently I've been contacted by <span style="font-style: italic">a 'major' studio</span> that says that they were impressed by my handheld work, and they would like me to join them on a temporary (paid) basis and assist on prototyping DS game engines that they are developing...
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don't know a whole lot about the DS, so my first thought was 'this is a joke'... so I asked for a little more information. Soon after, I was offered more information (I can't elaborate) on the project and an NDA document...
<br/>
<br/>
Have they got the wrong guy here? I hardly know anything about the DS; I certainly don't have the experience required to prototype game engines on a professional basis. (Or do I? I don't know!)
<br/>
<br/>
Will I be obligated to join with <span style="font-style: italic">the studio</span> if I sign their NDA? Do I need to get myself a solicitor here?
<br/>
<br/>
I really wish I had more experience in this area, I only started this stuff as a hobby. :|
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">An NDA shouldn't obligate you to do anything other than to not share any information or assets they provide you with. Read it before you sign it, but you shouldn't need a lawyer or anything like that.
<br/>
<br/>
Work is work and money is money. If it's the right deal then go for it. If not, then either pass on it or negotiate for something that is. If you aren't already familiar with the company by name then I would look into it a bit more and find out just how "major" and financially stable they are, but it doesn't sound like they're asking to hire you on to a full time position or for you to relocate or anything, so the risk doesn't sound huge so long as they're legit.
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't worry too much about your own ability; remember that <span style="font-style: italic">they</span> are the ones interested in hiring <span style="font-style: italic">you</span>. It's not unheard of for companies to pick people up from the homebrew scene.
<br/>
<br/>
And congratulations! At the very least it's a good compliment that you were recognized by someone in the industry.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">IANAL, but I am a game developer.  Having to sign an NDA during the interview process is not uncommon in the game industry if they intend to show you any sensitive information as part of the interview.  I had to sign one as part of the interview for my current job.  It would be extremely unusual for an NDA to obligate you to do anything other than not disclosing anything they show you that is not yet public information.  Like poslundc said, read the NDA and be sure you understand and are willing to fulfill its obligations before you sign it, but it shouldn't be a big deal.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as your ability, they are the ones interested in you, and they will decide during the interview process whether your skills fit with what they want, just as you will have to decide whether their company is a good fit for you.  If you are at all interested in taking a position in the gaming industry, and you think this looks like a good company (again do your due diligence here, find out all you can about the company), I'd say give it a chance.  It very well could be a great opportunity to get into the game industry.
