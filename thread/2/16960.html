    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looks like Nintendo will be releasing the <a class="postlink" href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2009/10/it-just-keeps-on-growing-nintendo-announces-dsill.ars" target="_blank">DSiLL</a> soon in Japan.  It is a bigger, heavier DSi with larger screens and longer battery life.

214g = DSi

314g = DSiLL

Here is a <a class="postlink" href="http://news.mixi.jp/view_news.pl?id=1015669&amp;media_id=77" target="_blank">link</a> to mixi article I first read, although it doubt it will be of much use to anyone else.  (If anyone wants a mixi invite PM me...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I still don't have a DSi, but with reports of the new system to come out possibly at the end of next year, my want for one lessens, even if it has bigger screen and increased battery life. :(<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the DSiLL looks attractive, as I am a big handed American who often plays DS at home.  When I ride the bus, I throw it in my bag, so I don't care if the unit is pocket sized.  I'm still using the original DS Phat.
<br/>
<br/>
Having said all that... I've heard that it takes about a year of manufacturing anything to work all the bugs out of the process, so I'll try to wait a year before picking one up if I can help it.  If the next system is out by then, I'll skip it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The real question is will they fix the button layout so my hand doesn't cramp up after 30 minutes of play?  I loved my GBA sp and GBA micro, but I can't play the DS for extended periods of time :(
<br/>
<br/>
(it's the A button that does it to me, the position of it right next to the edge of the device causes me to curl my thumb in a weird and painful way)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That would probably work with my left thumb, but my right thumb is extremely stubby and fat, so I end up mashing other buttons half the time when I try.
