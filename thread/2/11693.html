Does anyone know if this site is for real? What do you have to do to get a free DS Lite?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If the idea is you give your e-mail address for them to spam and you get a free DS Lite, I still think that it's a good deal. Just don't give them your primary e-mail address.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">generally, it's more along the lines of:
<br/>
1) give them your info
<br/>
2) complete 1-3 'offers' (like signing up for credit cards, joining various memberships like netflix, or aol, etc)
<br/>
3) get 2-7 of your friends to also complete 1 &amp; 2. 
<br/>
<br/>
The middleman (omgfreestuff.com) gets money for each 'offer' they complete, and they make enough money that they can buy you a ds lite (ipod, tv, etc), and still make a tidy profit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Let me see...
<br/>
<br/>
Here's what I'd do if I was a spammer...
<br/>
<br/>
Get someone's email address and spam them. And not give them a DS Lite. Once I have their address I don't need to give them anything.
<br/>
<br/>
Seems like a logical thoughtpath to me...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what I hear, some of the free xxxx schemes are legitimate, but it is a pyramid scheme.  You must get people to sign up along with you, and if they want to get the free xxxx, they must sign up a bunch of people as well.  You'll run out of people before everyone interested gets their free xxxx.
<br/>
You also have to give up lots of personal information, which spammers love.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
