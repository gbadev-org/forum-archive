    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's funny how Sony would release something like this. It's weird because (at some time) homebrew developers are going to use this very document as a base to program *hack* the PSP.

Kinda nice to see what pro code looks like. Maybe I'll get up there. One thing though, I wonder when the devkits come out?? If they plan on releasing it Winter 2004/2005, shouldn't they be out by now (of course, they won't tell us)?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Though Linux for PS2 is a relatively mass produced product, Yaroze was shipped in extremely limited numbers. Heck, there aren't even any on eBay as I write this.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
