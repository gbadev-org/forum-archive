After my friend (and the homebrew community) convinced me that R4 was the way to go for homebrew, I searched around the internet for anywhere that I could get an R4 from, without having to order more than 1. It turns out that I can't find such an online store.

<br/>
Does anyone know any good online shops selling the R4, that ship to the UK? Amazon seems to be down right now, so I'll have a look at that when the site is back up.<br/>_________________<br/>My favourite DS apps:

If anyone knows where this person can get his r4, and the retailer isnt listed in the retailer section, feel free to PM me and Ill add that retailer or feel free to PM this person with a link.
