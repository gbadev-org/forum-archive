<br/>
Well, I fixed the balloons (the problem was a capitalization error).
<br/>
<br/>
I do not plan a NDS/GBA version and I'm not sure how I would program a NDS/GBA version anyways. I don't think the display is big enough, nor are there enough buttons on it (or maybe not even enough memory). And I wrote this software in PHP, and would be hard to run a PHP program on GBA or on Nintendo DS.
<br/>
<br/>
To show you a few of the features possible with this software, here is a copy of the codes for the BALLOON class:</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">:msg_destroy
<br/>
  'pop 0 sound
<br/>
;;
<br/>

<br/>
:msg_moved
<br/>
:msg_jumped
<br/>
  me objbelow obj!
<br/>
  obj@ temperature@o 250 &gt;= if[
<br/>
    obj@ 'usr_burn 0 0 send ; me destroy ;
<br/>
  ]
<br/>
  4@s bit9 | 4!s {{ Prevent rollers from moving rising balloon }}
<br/>
  nm not if[
<br/>
    4@s bit9 not &amp; 4!s {{ Allow roller to move stuck balloon }}
<br/>
    me objbelow d; obj! @o 'roller == if[ obj@ 'usr_arriving 0 0 send ; ]
<br/>
  ]
<br/>
;;
<br/>
<br/>
:msg_moving
<br/>
  distance
<br/>
  lastdir@s n !=
<br/>
  me objbelow @o 'ice ==
<br/>
  &amp;&amp; &amp;&amp; if[ 1 ret ]
<br/>
  1@ x@s != 2@ y@s != &amp;&amp; if[
<br/>
    me 1@ x@s - 4 &amp; objdir @o 'field != if[ 1 ret ]
<br/>
    1@ 2@ objtopat @o ( 'bridge 'water 'ice 'fire 'roller 'teleport 'raft )== ret
<br/>
  ]
<br/>
;;</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">There are also attributes, which I didn't copy here. Some of the functions of the program are already done by the attributes, but these codes allow you to extend it much more than by just using the attribute functions. (The attributes don't do much by themself) Also, as you can see, comments start with {{ and end with }} and most functions are dealt with by sending messages between objects.
<br/>
<br/>
Probably it would be faster if convert it to C codes. It would require a lot of stuff added  if done in C, because C is a more low-level than PHP and doesn't have some things that PHP does automatically. But if you want to write it in C, you can do so!
<br/>
<br/>
Also, tell me if you can find more bugs, make more suggestions, etc.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
