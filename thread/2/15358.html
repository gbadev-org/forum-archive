    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know that they can be bought from jameco and perhaps digikey, but I am having trouble finding specific chips. Maybe I just don't know how to search the sites properly. One specific IC I am looking for is the 7484.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">try octopart.com and findchips.com. also the 7400 series ICs are usually in the form like 74xx123. eg I used some 74HC595's before. the letters are different versions like high speed or low power or something i think. Also, try searching for the name of the chip, perhaps you have the wrong part number (eg "3 to 8 demultiplexer" or "serial in parallel out shift register" or whatever)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the sites. Yeah, you are right about the letters. They stared out with only numbers (i.e. 7484), then as they developed new technology, they added the letters to distinguish them (i.e. HC or LS etc.).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
