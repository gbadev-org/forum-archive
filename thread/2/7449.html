    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ever since I first got my system last November, it has had a stuck pixel in the lower left corner of the touch screen. Now 1 year later, I've decided to send in my DS for repairs, before the 1 year warrenty expires, but hopefully being able to get it back before the Thanksgiving weekend, since I plan to go out of town, and I want to have my DS during that time.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, my question about it is this, for anyone who has sent back their DS for repairs. If I were to fill out the form for repairs under the US Factory Service today, you think I'd be able to get it sent in and received back with repairs before that Thanksgiving weekend? I know it's cutting it pretty close, and if I were to do this, I'd be missing out on some initial Online Mario Kart action, but it must be done.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I had heard some time back that, if Nintendo deems it necessary on a DS that needs repair, they will send a fresh new DS to you, and you send them your malfunctioning DS back to them. I don't know whether or not this is true, but it would be nice if it were so.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nope. There is not a single modification done to my DS, but someday, I hope to begin work on some DS stuff.
