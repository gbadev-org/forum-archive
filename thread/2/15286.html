Maybe they could add the feature of multiple themes. One theme would be the original, while the other would be this black one.
<br/>
Every user can set these themes in their profile, so nobody has to stay with black.
<br/>
<br/>
I kindof like this theme too. But, the posting text doesn't stand out as well as the original.(But, I've gotten used to it)

I think it makes it easier to look at for long sessions...(Browse for a long while on these forums with this theme)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">and again, they assume everyone is using CTRs. does anyone know the numbers / the ratio of LCDs/CRTs used? the trend (at least here in germany) is that most users buy laptops now, nearly all offices have already had LCDs for years and even MACs haven't had CRTs for quite some years &lt;jokingly&gt;.
<br/>
i just know of some hardcore gamers, that are still using 100hz CRTs for gaming (i even find that nonsense... but that's about personal opinion, so let's leave it at that.)
<br/>
<br/>
let's remember, those sites claim to "save energy" by simply changing the frontend's color.
<br/>
<br/>
so then, how is it still true, today, that a dark image is more energy efficient than a bright one? when it comes to that, simply changeing colors on a webpage won't save us much, when compared to the amount of energy we waste for standby and pure "entertainment" (youtube / myspace / youporn / whatever nonsense.) 
<br/>
(i like wikipedia, though!)
<br/>
<br/>
could anyone explain that to me? this all looks kind of "shady" to me. it's so pseudo. most of us (i don't mean you guys) think we live in a world with no limits, but the quite opposite is the case. when will those people learn? oh, i know, when there's nothing to harvest anymore... enter the "matrix"... anyone? ;^p
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;sarcasm&gt; i could go on, but i don't what you to "waste" energy to read an even longer post. ;^p &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
btw: i'm by no means an activist or something, i simply fail to see how things people do apply to what they say. (what about you tepples? right now i'm interested in you point of view - it's not because of something you said or did, though.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I guess they figure that even if there's no saving for LCD users, the few (?) people out there using CRTs will able to save power. On the flip side, by changing the main page, how many web caches were invalidated forcing machines to reload the page which has simply had the colour tweaked? How much power would that use?
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I have a dual monitor setup...an LCD and a CRT. The CRT is completely stellar for games - if my machine is too slow to play at 1280x1024 on my TFT I just stick it on the CRT! And if the machine's up to the task I crank it up to 2048x1536 and let fly! It is a right pain in the ass to lug when I move house, though ;-)
<br/>
A lot of graphics companies are stockpiling CRT monitors too, since they often have well-better colour response than equivalently-priced LCDs. I work with a good few peeps who recently quit the post-production biz...

My point of view is that we are within 100 years of the end of this simulation. The major world powers will fight a World War V over the remaining resources. Sometime during this war, the most fit individuals alive at that point will be pulled out of the simulation and respawned in another.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
only biological and evolutionary rubbish could be left (hope i count among that) when all the powerful and meaningful creatures are gone.
<br/>
it will be sticks and stones again! (wasn't that in the movie "australia 3000" or something?)
<br/>
well, you can still make games with sticks and stones (and a bit of imagination). ;^p
<br/>
<br/>
@simon: what you seem to have forgotten is, that it's not just that it doesn't save LCD users anything, it uses (or transforms) *more* energy to display a dark image. you would see the (rather small, but everything sums up in the end) difference when displaying a dark 3d scene (doom3) and a bright 3d (some poppy bright colored kid game) scene. someone made that test once (that magazine i haven't found, yet.)
<br/>
<br/>
my point is, that with (i assume) most users having LCDs at home (think about LCD-tv and browsing on your tv, which gets quite popular these days), this is not savin, this is *wasting*!
<br/>
<br/>
btw: you're right about the CRTs and color responsibility. :^) it's a pain to design a webpage that nobody will see in the end because it's too dark. also, CRTs don't have that annoying change in brightnes/contrast over the screen's area. i've allways worked with laptops... it still strikes me sometimes how wrong stuff can be displayed on a LCD.
<br/>
but compared to the power CRTs use, i might say, "LONG LIVE THE LCD!" ;^)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, is anyone else concerned by their power draw even if they're not paying for it? I reckon all the crap on my desk at work pulls 1kW and that's pretty worrying...

A thought on the black Google thing: I wonder if they would have saved the world <span style="font-style: italic">more</span> power if they'd taken their site down for the day!

a) I'm sure their servers use more power than a small town

<br/>
<br/>
about the LCDs: i have that article somewhere, but from what i seem to remember is, that the matrix needs a bit of energy to hold the state a pixel is in. i really *have* to find some info about it.
<br/>
<br/>
man, this really got me started on that topic, didn't it? ;^D

75% LCDs... just as i thought. ;^) although i don't know if it's the world marked or what (though, it looks like that).
<br/>
<br/>
i'd say this was "corporate BS" day to silence the "greens" a little. although i am not one of them (greens, as opposed to "greys" ;^p ), this makes me a bit angry. it's just another case of a wonderful idea, that has been butchered, torn apart and abused. that's not the way such things are meant to be.
<br/>
<br/>
i'm trying to waste as little energy as i can on a dayly base, but the power companies will charge more and more. and that's not because energy gets more expensive, it's just because they can. this is a big topic in the news here in germany. what about the other countries?
<br/>
<br/>
now i feel sorry. :^C
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
ok, i now found it it really IS 75% OF THE WORLD USERS, that use LCDs. wow. (different sources of information in german [google first searches for german pages by default, no matter what i set it to...])
