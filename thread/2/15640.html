    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I figured someone here may have enough knowledge or expertise to settle this little discussion I started with someone about the quality of Dell Laptop motherboards and other laptop motherboards (I'm not arguing that dell laptop motherboards are any better or worse though).
<br/>
<br/>
Overall, I'm just really curious, as this touches a bunch of ground I know very little about and I'm curious just how stupid and or intelligent my comments and responses were.  If anyone knows another forum or even individual to talk to, that would be neat also.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the conversation, any comments would be appreciated:

i just got a sony vaio like a month ago its the best ...not even to say that for myself my pops friend is a laptop expert since he basically can make one out of scratch he could of just made me one but i wanted the pink exterior design.....he looked at my vaio said it was top of the lined......never go with dell nor gateways the problem with them is they have all the features incorporated into the motherboard meaning if one component on the board goes wrong the whole motherboard will not function leaving you with nothing......sony toshiba pansonic etc... the japanse laptops allow the component to be place in the motherboard seperatelt which is why is cost more.......but if one thing goes wrong you can just replace that compnent..and it wont damage the whole motherboard.....since dell gateway etc make the component inversely inside the motherboard all they hve to do is produce duplex motheboards which is why the cost is SOOO LOW...also ram gb etc are much easier to upgrade for japanse laptops..........hope that helped if you have any other concerns hit me up......however the to of the line for gamming movie watching et would be a joy...or alienx....anyway hit me up if you have any ther questions
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i dunno maybe cost is a factor which is most people concern.... but if you buy a cheap you risk it lasting only a two years max.......japanse products last 5+ years......i am a hard on quality if you dont really care and just need the basics then just go for dell......but i would never recommend it.

Me:
<br/>
"also ram gb etc are much easier to upgrade for japanse laptops"
<br/>
I have the Dell Vostro 1400 and I don't see how popping up the keyboard and replacing the ram is all that hard or could be made all that much easier. Also, it is a very sturdy laptop and other Dell's that I have had have lasted me for years (though, they were not laptops....but I've opened them up a ton of times and there is nothing weird about how they are put together).
<br/>
<br/>
As for components...I'm not totally sure what you are reffering to. First of all, to make the laptop small laptops become less upgradable and parts have to be more integreated. Regardless, on my Dell Vostro 1400 thing like the internal wireless card, drive bay, hard drive, RAM, and bluetooth can all be replaced or upgraded. If your motherboard dies....that's probably the end, the average person is not going to be able to fix it...there aren't components on the motherboard that you can replace (the only things would possibly be the processor ...on board graphics are....on board, they aren't a separate component, so you can't replace that). If you got a laptop with a actual graphics card (I opted for on board graphics due to the less cost and less power consumption) you could replace it (though, you'll probally have to do some ebay searching).
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Dell dosen't build all the components themselves. If you really want to look up build quality (other than the exterior), get a list of all the components and what company makes them and look it up. Dell may use some stinky parts in one computer, but in another use great parts, or there may be a mixture.
<br/>
<br/>
As for Dell laptops dieing in two years, my dad has one he bought five years ago, it's running fine (battery is fairly dead though...which, is to be expected..it doesn't matter who made it the battery will die eventually, though there are some neat new things in development).
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, do your research, and be warry of listening to one particular person. Choose reliable sources and ask on forums dedicated to this topic so you can get a variety of opinions. Always read the reviews and never judge the quality of something by the company (unless they really are known to produce nothing but junk or customer service is important to you).
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: By the way, I love my vostro 1400. :) Though, I may end up replacing it in the next two years anyway for something smaller when prices go down and the power of smaller computers goes up. Only thing that bugs me is that driver compatability for the on-board graphics in linux is still in development and is thus not perfect (I am running a lot of drivers and software marked as "unstable" to get it to work, but everything is fine for the most part).
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT2: Also, Crystal, a lot of your post sounds like nonsense :S I'm still trying to figure out what a "duplex motheboard" is. &gt;_&lt; No offense.

first of.......dell does not build any of it's components therefore they have no sense of their products.... second i work at panasonic corp so i know how theese motherboards are created..........a cm602 or cm402 electronic laserhead highspeed machines are used to place the component on the motherboard...my job is to anaylases the customers alignment of the motherboards &amp; how they want there component setup on them.....the motherboards for dell are not very well build&amp; i was not refering to ram, harddrivie etc when i mentioned components...those are of course easily to upgrade......when i spoke of components i mean the component withtin the motherboard which would include the quad mircrochips..circuits... etc....for dell the motherboards are custom build meaning if one of the circuit systems in the board goes wrong it corrupts the whole motherboard...since they plaster the components with sauter..for japanese products that is not the case they are individually handled and not plastered with sauter......therefore for you to buy a replacement component in the circuit it be much easier in the long run......then to replace the whole laptop itself.....&amp; no offense but destops&amp; laptops are much different arrangement in circuts.so therefore desktops are build last longer.....dell in general is uncompareable to japanse products.....no judgement but the dell itself is rigged as it most of its harddrive supply comes from either samsung in korean or china etc....and what i meant by duplex moherboard is that they just make imittations of an orginal motherboard ( duplex production) the motherboard itself with everything build in......therefore productivity is lessen allowing the product to be sold less to consumers.....no judgement but by reading internet sites you are getting false information..why dont you call in the actual engineers building the productions lines and not customer service as most are unexperience&amp;unknowledagable on the product or line of electronic build.

Me:
<br/>
"dell does not build any of it's components"
<br/>
I said that myself. See the beginning of the third paragraph.
<br/>
<br/>
"i mean the component withtin the motherboard which would include the quad mircrochips..circuits... etc...."
<br/>
Give an example of a specific component that may break and that the average person (or even above average), but with no special tools, could actually replace their selves out of curiosity. As for if one component breaks, it will still work, ....yet, it won't work if it was saudered on sloppily and then breaks....I can't see why. Unless something shorted because of the sauder, but then that has nothing to do with the components failing.
<br/>
<br/>
Further more, in terms of sending it in for repairs, for the end consumer, there probably won't be any sort of price difference and most people won't have access to anyone or any place that could do the repairs within easy reach or expense. I'm speaking in terms of what is practical and what isn't.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not going to dissect the rest of your post as I'm actually having trouble reading it and I feel I may be misinterpreting some of the things you are saying. I don't question you about there being a difference in quality, but I do question whether that quality will truly affect the average life of the device and whether it will actually mean anything in terms of repair to the end consumer. Anywhere past replacing things like RAM, HD, procesor, battery, etc. and you are talking about people with professional experience or are hobbyists who read a ton about it.
<br/>
<br/>
"not customer service as most are unexperience&amp;unknowledagable on the product or line of electronic build."
<br/>
I never mentioned customer service....and customer service is really something I try to avoid as you are right....they usually don't know anything. &gt;_&lt;
<br/>
<br/>
"why dont you call in the actual engineers building the productions lines and not customer service as most are unexperience&amp;unknowledagable on the product or line of electronic build."
<br/>
I will. I hope you don't mind if I provide some quotations of your paragraphs.
<br/>
<br/>
For the sake of curiosity,

<br/>
...........&amp; i don't mind at all go ahead calling an engineer using my quotations..make sure they are a specifically an electronic engineer otherwise they also will not know the references...companies i would suggest are the japanese one of course as no offense i love america but most american production lines are held at oversea productivity..meaning they imitate foreign countries....&amp; of course the product that we later recieve are the old line of technology....when i referenced customer service i was just emphasising that most people rely on them &amp; take into their words when they know absolutely nothing........again as you call in engineers i dont know how many of them will take your call as many of them are productivily busy but there are headquarters in the US .....you could try toshiba.....fugi....etc any producers in this webpage

But that's how laptops are.  Everything is onboard.  It doesn't matter whom you go with, that's the way it.  The video (card) is integrated, audio, usb ports, everything is on one board.  The wireless is the only exception.  There is a wireless card that can be removed, it's similar in size to the RAM.  &amp; as far as the comment "Dell doesn't make there own devices" this can be said for ALL manufactures.  I mean, come on, they are putting NVidia or ATI chipsets on for the video, yes?  Not Dell, not Sony.  I'm really confused by this comment.  It's like saying Ford doesn't use Ford whipper motors.  Of course not.  They buy them &amp; manufacture the car.  All that a device truly is, is a chipset that integrates into the system bus.  So on a laptop, it's only natural to have it all compact onto one board.  The chipsets still interact the way they are designed to.  They just are not interchangeable.  The same can be said for gaming systems.<br/>_________________<br/>-#2pencil</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If it helps back my story, I run a business that (among other services) repairs laptops.  I fixed the DC Jack on a Toshiba, as well swapped out an LCD screen on a Dell Inspiron today.  In a general month anywhere from 5 to 20 units will come through my shop.  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.irisvista.com/tech/laptops/ToshibaM45/Satellite_M45_disassembly_1.htm" target="_blank">Here</a> is an online guide to the Toshiba unit I finished up today.  It shows detailed images of what the motherboard looks like.  I have yet to see a laptop that doesn't have everything on the motherboard, other than the Wireless.<br/>_________________<br/>-#2pencil</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">nah, I believed you from the start as that is what I thought/new from the start (I do do a lot of reading about these kind of things, but I can only be considered a hobbyist and my knowledge is still fairly limited).
<br/>
<br/>
Though, now I don't feel like I'm going crazy anymore. :-P
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, there are some laptops that have an actual graphics card (which may or may not be easily replaceable/removable though).  I know the vostro 1400 I ordered had the option of an actual graphics card versus the on-board graphics, and I know there are a few laptops that actually support upgrading the video card (though, they are expensive, heavy, and not all that portable and for all I know, may no longer be manufactured...I don't keep up on the latest laptops really). ***I may be wrong here....it's been a long time since I remember reading about what I'm thinking about*** EDIT: I verified the upgradeable video card statement to be true for a select few laptops :)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: to describe how I felt, it was sort of like knowing that the grass was green all your life, but then an expert plant person or something comes up and says that all grass is pink.
