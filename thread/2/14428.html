    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What happened to the People working on the Work Master series of Operating systems for the Gameboy? I found Work Master 3.20 for the Gameboy Color and it's sweet, but I can't find anywhere that has a good explanation of how it was used. Their site is still online, and Work Master 4 looks very promising, but are they still working on it?<br/>_________________<br/>867-530<span style="font-weight: bold">9</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
