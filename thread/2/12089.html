    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You know those things that you can stream live tv using tivo and the locationfree player by sony to your psp. Well I was wondering about it and want to buy it. The model that i want is the LF-PK1 because it looks like the cheapist and it will work with my psp on the go. If anyone owns one and has a psp can you give me some details on how good the streaming is. I would also like to know where the cheapest place to find it is.
