    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't find a Japanese mahjong set with 3 tiles transparent and 1 opaque, out of each 4 tiles in the set. I saw a picture before but now I don't know where to purchase it from? I searched for long time and I still can't find it!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interesting. So do you play the game the same way with the transparent tiles? Sounds like a fun variant since everyone has more information on which to base their play.

-Scott</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">Yes, generally. But I also write my own rules called Extended Washizu Mahjong which is a more complicated set of rules to play with the tiles that some of them are transparent and some opaque.

<br/>
But, would you bet your life on a game like this?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
