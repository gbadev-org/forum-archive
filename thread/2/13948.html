I did the online version in 2 minutes an 47 seconds by the way.
<br/>
(online has 16 pieces, the real one has 256 :-/)
<br/>
EDIT: If I calculated correctly, there are 2765952 different combinations for the 256 piece puzzle, keeping the corner pieces in the corners and the side pieces on the sides.
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm... I guess I didn't compensate for different rotations of the same result.  Would I just divide my number by 4? (that still leaves 691488 :P)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well actually the real one has 256! * 4^256 possible combinations, which is about <span style="font-weight: bold">1e+661</span>. Of course the fact that there are corner pieces and a centre piece reduces it a little bit.
<br/>
<br/>
When you consider the corners and the outer border cannot rotate, you get ((4! * 56!) * ((14*14)! * 4^(14*14))) == ((4! * 56!) * (196! * 4^196)) == ((1.7e+76) * ( 5.1e+483)) == <span style="font-weight: bold">8.7e+559</span>; which is not much different from the first figure.
<br/>
<br/>
Now everyone is talking about genetic algorithms. Although I am considering an attempt using that I think you need a much smarter type of GA. The reason being is that GA's are good for finding "good" solutions but not necessarily the best solution. There are estimated to be <a class="postlink" href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/2001/20010402/biggest_numbers.shtml" target="_blank">between 10^72 and 10^87 particles in the universe</a>!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">but see the real problem here is not the math needed for how many pieces there are, it's for how many people will pay to try their chance at winning the prize, when the prize has already been won. read the rules, the contest doesn't stop when someone completes the big puzzle. winning entries will be 'locked in a vault' for the next year and a half, at which time they will open it and declare the winner (the first person in the past year and a half that solved it.) so if I paid to do it right now, and completed it in say 2 days. big deal. it'll be a year and a half before I know if I've won the $2 million prize. but I guarantee you several people have already completed the puzzle. therefore if you play, you're out ?39.99 cause somebody's beat you to it, and have 0 chance at the prize even if you do complete it. it's luck a fricken pyramid scheme!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if this puzzle is "technically unsolvable" then why don't they end the contest once the first person solves it? why do they wait almost a year and a half to reveal the results? because it's a dick move on their part to sucker people into giving them money in which 0% of them have a chance to win once one person solves it. and the numbers of possibilities fricken billions and billions. yeah the pieces can be arranged in that many formations, but they won't fit together with the other pieces. this puzzle can be solved by a human in a matter of a few days if even that, and the creators know this. so people go and drop ?39.99 thinking they have a chance of winning, and then realize they're pry the 100th person to solve it, and they won't find out that they've lost for another year and a half. the scheme would be totally different if it took every winner, and divided the money up amongst them, but no, it goes to the first person that solves it.
<br/>
<br/>
so to sum it up, the contest goes for a year and a half, the first person (who has already solved it) has won, so any new entries have 0% chance of winning, and have spent ?39.99 to play a stupid little game thinking they had even a slight chance at winning. you guys do see the (brilliant) scam right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Phoneymike, do you understand the complexity of an NP complete problem? And no brute force is not going to find a solution with brute force alone. Look at the size of the problem; 8.7e+559. You <span style="font-style: italic">may</span> find a solution but it would be unwise to assume it is easily solvable.
<br/>
<br/>
Check out the <a class="postlink" href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/eternity_two/" target="_blank">Eternity II Yahoo Groups</a>, there are plenty of knowledgeable people trying to solve it using computation.
<br/>
<br/>
The wait of two years is more [IMO] about publicity, since it gives a reason for a news headline. "Today is the unveiling of the solutions, there are no solutions"; as opposed to there being no headlines. And it would most likely increase sales from people by increasing the need to buy it quickly. I will say it again - NP Hard/Complete. And though there are some good solutions to NP problems; the complexity of this problem when converted would be astronomical.
<br/>
<br/>
I've sent this problem to my university lecturers, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/~smriis/" target="_blank">Soren Riis</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/~pbo/" target="_blank">Paulo Olivia</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it really depends on the pieces. on a wiki it claims there are 8 colors not counting the edge colors. if there's an equal amount of each color, then it'd be pretty easy, just solve a small portion (say a quarter) and copy it over the board. but this would be too easy, I doubt they have equal amounts of each color.
<br/>
<br/>
but what I'm saying is it's easier than you think. one website claimed it would take a computer 10^20 years to compute the answer. what kind of bullshit is that? and again calculating those high numbers 8.7e+559 is incorrect. yes you can place all the pieces in random orders randomly rotated, but the pieces have to interlock together. that's like saying there's 7 billion people in this world you could meet and fall in love with, however I'm not gay so that cuts out half of them. bad analogy I know but you get the point :)

Wrong; he's talking about the mini puzzle, which gives you two pieces of the puzzle.There are not 8 colours, there are 17+5 colours not counting the edge colours. And yes you don't have exactly 8.7e+559 possibilities, but 10^20 sounds about right for a brute force solution. Even simple chess games do not use brute force alone as it is weak for searching NP problems.
<br/>
<br/>
Solving a portion of it will not help either, the whole difficulty of NP hard problems is that you have to get yourself deep into the tree before you can be sure you are not heading to a solution. And like I said, many experienced mathematicians are researching into this - with many believing it to be impossible but are trying it anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Really, read up on NP hard problems and artificial intelligence. When you have a better understanding of problem complexity you'll probably laugh at it all.
<br/>
<br/>
To get an understanding of NP hard problems, consider all the roads around you in your town - say 50 roads. Now think of a new delivery company who wishes to deliver to each house but only wants to travel the shortest possible distance. Sure finding a short distance is fairly easy, but this company needs to compete with DeliveryCo, and they must have the fastest possible route. That problem is NP hard. Each new road junction makes the problem grow <span style="font-weight: bold">exponentially</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
That's not to say it will never be solved; but really it's not as 'simple' as "just make an algorithm". I've taken part in algorithm competitions so I'm used to looking at problems and creating solutions to them quickly; and I took "algorithms and complexity" as modules in my uni studies as well as "genetic algorithms" and AI - so I'm not a stranger these topics.
<br/>

if they didn't market it with the $2 million, then it would just be another crummy puzzle that costs $1 to produce. yet these asshats have the gull to market it at $50usd, claiming you have a chance at $2 million. well once someone solves it (which they do not tell when,) you are now spending $50usd on a puzzle and wasting your time. for all you know the puzzle has been solved, someone's already won the $2 million. so everyone who purchases this puzzle, all these mathematician geniuses and all, are wasting their time to solve a stupid little puzzle because not only do they not win, but someone's already solved it. do you understand this? why are you trying to solve this puzzle?

mike, what I'm saying is why do you call it a scam? Are you suggesting the money will not be paid? Or are you suggesting the puzzle is in fact easy?
<br/>
<br/>
Again I will ask you a simple question, do you know about NP hardness? Have you ever tried to solve one using algorithms? Are you aware that there are thousands of experienced mathematicians, including grandmaster chess champions and world class programmers who have more faith in it not being solved easily. Do you also know about algorithmic complexity?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm asking this because like I said, I've studied (a) algorithms and complexity, (b) artificial intelligence and (c) computational genomics. The branching factor is <span style="font-weight: bold">exponentially hard</span>. Honestly, do you seriously think an polynomial time algorithm is <span style="font-weight: bold">easy</span> for an exponential problem.
<br/>
<br/>
If you say it is easy to compute, then tell me how you suspect this. Nobody has come close to finishing it, with the first one people were able to get far in the puzzle - but here people fail to get that far past half of the board.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">But to highlight the point in bold in case you're skimming; without an understanding of algorithmic time complexity, and decision problems it is impossible to properly debate.

I get it. what you seem to overlook is the simple fact that they don't end the contest the moment someone solves it. why? because they'll make money giving people false hopes of winning. if the contest ends once someone solves it (for all you know someone has,) then why would anyone spend $50 on a stupid puzzle and waste their time if they had no chance of winning $2 million dollars.

read my post, please. read any of my posts in this topic. I've answered your questions multiple times but it's not clicking with you. of all the advanced algorithms you're capable of thinking and solving, you can't see a scam in front of your face. I believe the money will be paid out, because of all the people who purchase this game will give enough profit to cover it as laos clearly pointed out (read his post too.) but the company is cheating people out of their $50 by not telling when the solution is found. <span style="text-decoration: underline">once the solution is found, nobody would buy the game if they didn't have a chance to win $2 million dollars, but they don't tell you, so people still buy the game hoping to win</span>. it simply can't get any more clear than that dude. it's a stupid puzzle!
<br/>
<br/>
if this puzzle is so impossible, why not send me your pieces, any sort of data file you can send them as. I'm not gonna solve it (it's near impossible right?) so what do you have to lose? send me the pieces, because the possibility of me solving it before you do is much higher than the possibility of you solving it first and winning $2 million.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A <a class="postlink" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=scam" target="_blank">scam</a> is a very powerful term to give to something. A "stupid little puzzle" is again a big term to give to something; the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle" target="_blank">sliding puzzle</a> is a deceptively difficult puzzle. Sure you can always find a solution, it's not hard to do; but what is hard is to find the shortest possible solution. I can think up thousands of unsolvable puzzles that are impossible to solve easily, honestly it's not hard. If you are thinking that it's not easy to make impossible puzzles then know that impossible puzzles are easy to make, what is hard is making them <span style="font-weight: bold">fun</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, there are countless mathematicians working on this; if it were so "easy" they would all be optimistic that there is a solution. The man behind it is a bit of a marketing and PR genius, so setting up the competition like this actually gives it more publicity and incentive. Sure someone 'could' have solved it before the scrutiny date, but the chances are surprisingly low. I would call it a scam if the puzzle was easy, but it most certainly is not. A human is unlikely to find it by chance due to the high branching factor, and it takes time to be able to find properties that make these types of puzzle easier to solve (if there are any).
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not suggesting it is totally impossible, but calling it a scam is extremely far fetched. And suggesting that the puzzle is easy is way off the mark of common sense, if he wants to make the most money he would make it more difficult to solve so that the game goes on for longer - of course you could argue that due to the nature of PLC's that it is better to have it solvable in due time. But as it currently stands there is no known approach (for this case) that will find a solution while any of us are alive, including distributed computation, as they will not reduce complexity.

It seems like you're saying that because they want to make as many people buy their puzzle as possible, <span style="font-weight: bold">it's a scam</span>. I guess <span style="font-weight: bold">it's a scam</span> for a company to make a profit, <span style="font-weight: bold">it's a scam</span> for a company to use marketing, and unless this toy company is horribly bankrupted by having to pay $2 million (which they didn't have to do) without enough sales to recuperate, <span style="font-weight: bold">it's a scam.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Heaven forbid that they get people excited about their contest (and that's what this is, a contest) by setting a looming deadline, and using a mysterious locked "safe." And then they have the GALL to make money by selling to customers? Appalling! They should be giving away the $2 million dollars just to anyone who tries! &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

So you can spend $1 per lottery ticket (let's say 649 - pick 6 numbers from 1-49), which requires absolutely no skill, and nets you 1 in 10 billion chance of winning regardless of who you are.
<br/>
<br/>
Or you can actually use your brain and solve an interesting puzzle, which is a fun challenge in itself. If you one of the few to solve it, you have an extremely good chance of winning (if 50 people can solve it, all you have to do is be the first). In this one, having a brain actually increases your chances. Some of use actually prefer that - maybe you do not?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 10px; line-height: normal">DS Lite white, R4DS, 1GB Kingmax microSD</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

just on projected sales figures, even if they sell half of what the first one did, they'll still be making plenty of money even after they pay off whoever wins. not to mention it's <a class="postlink" href="http://trus.imageg.net/graphics/product_images/pTRU1-3968083dt.jpg" target="_blank">only a few sheets of cardboard with ink on it</a> (money well spent.) you don't even get any dice or anything! this thing probably costs little more than a deck of cards to produce.

but the real problem again for the fifth time is that the box claims you could win. however once this child's puzzle is solved, then it immediately becomes false advertising. all this hype becomes false advertising the moment someone submits a correct answer. when's the last time you spent $50 on a puzzle in which you couldn't win a prize? please, make something up and reply with it.

If your problem with it is that you don't find out the winner until 2009 that's fine, but from a marketing point of view that is actually better. Also note that the puzzle is actually too difficult realistically expect a normal person to solve it, and too difficult to expect a simple algorithm to solve it. So the whole statement about a child having as much chance as an adult at solving it is technically correct - they both have no chance!
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to know if someone has solved it right away, of course, but "better" can be interpreted in so many ways. Better for me yes, but better from a marketing point of view - no. Whatever he's done he's managed to get 500,000 people doing a <span style="font-weight: bold">puzzle</span>. You said it yourself, nobody would buy your puzzle without the marketing. The only reason the first one was solved so easily is because they made a huge mistake with its design and built it to be too big, had it had been smaller it would have been more difficult to solve.
<br/>
<br/>
If you can tell me a good method of how you expect an algorithm to solve it in polynomial time I will personally send you my Game Cube by mail - and that is no lie!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you would like to get into solving the puzzle the join the Yahoo group; the trick to solving it is not computation but in reducing the search space as much as possible.
