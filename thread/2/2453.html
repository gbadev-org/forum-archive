please comment on your vote! (e.g.if you're a hobbyist, does this compromise on the quality and polish of you're demos and games?)<br/>_________________<br/>tough cookies are hard to bite.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Samer! on Mon Dec 08, 2003 2:02 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would certainly like to "Go pro" but to be clear, I don't mean that I expect to convice a publisher to buy my game. Don't get me wrong, it'd be great if someone wanted to, but I see no reason they would; If I made it by myself in a few months, they could make it themselves and own all the rights (And profits) too easily. 
<br/>
The whole fun of GBA development is that it's still possible for one person to make a game in their free time. The commercial GBA game market is very competitive, and games without either a large marketing budget or some liscense tie-in will have a hard time finding a market.  Usually it's not the best games that sell best for GBA, it's the games with the best liscenses. 
<br/>
I suppose it's not <span style="font-style: italic">impossible</span> to make a game around a liscense and then sell it to the people who actually have the rights to that liscense, but I don't know of any examples of it actually happening; most liscenses worth milking these days have official games being designed for them almost before their primary liscense has actually hit the media.<br/>_________________<br/>"Only two things are infinite: the universe, and human stupidity.

By the way, welcome to the boards. If you ever need help, look at the FAQ and use the search function. Chances are your question has already been answered.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I disagree.
<br/>
<br/>
They say resturants are high risk and most go under in the first year.  Ability is not the problem for people who go into the resturant business.  Resturants take a lot of money to start.  Generally speaking, they lose money the first year, break even the second year, and start to make money the third year.  The third year pays off the first, so the owner doesn't start to turn a profit until about the fourth year.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess I'm what people call a "professional", but I don't like the term as there is still SO much to learn and experience to gain. I have been working in de games indy little over four years now.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been coding GBA on and off for about two years now and had the intention to do something commercial with it. Nowadays with the saturated GBA market that thought is long gone. Still developing for it as it's a fun platform, still learning while I code.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm writing a generic (2D) game engine/library for handheld devices with GBA as my main platform. I can tell you it is quite a challenge writing something that will work (pretty much the same) on ie. GBA/Mophun/WinCE and DirectX:-)<br/>_________________<br/>If everything fails, read the manual: If even that fails, post on forum!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
