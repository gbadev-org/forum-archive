    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I mentioned it in another thread, but it went pretty off-topic from what i was actually asking, so i'll be more direct here. there's a game that i think would be great if it were ported to the DS, but alas, I know nothing about game development.

<a class="postlink" href="http://mduel2k5.spadgos.com/mduel96/" target="_blank">Marshmallow Duel</a> is a 2-player, side-scrolling, 2-d fighter originally made for DOS that's really fun, and it seems like it would work well on the DS. each player could use one hand to hold one side of the DS, and then use the d-pad or ABXY to move/jump/duck, and L or R to use items. if you're really ambitious, download-play multiplayer would be even better.
<br/>
<br/>
i'm not offering to pay anyone to do this (although if it helps motivate you i might be able to scrounge up a few extra bucks ;) ), i just think it'd be a fun project for someone, and an even more fun final product.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sure, I'll help some. Yay! my first project. Ok, I won't be a ton of help right away(look at my other post "Hello".) because I won't have much time until after December. I also don't have any experience and I just started C++. But I need help getting started with programming and this might be the key. I will help/research/program as in some of my spare time if I can be of assistance.<br/>_________________<br/>Homebrewer!
