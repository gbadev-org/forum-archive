    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm toying with building a pure-javascript Legend of Zelda clone, mostly for the fun of it, partially to learn HTML5 game dev.
<br/>
<br/>
I could do the project with all my own sprites/SFX, etc... but it's so charming to use the original LOZ assets! And copying the maps and stuff would be kinda fun.
<br/>
<br/>
But if I were to use the original assets and put it on some website, will Nintendo come and shut me down? As importantly, do you think it's "just plain wrong" to use commercial assets, even for a no-profit fan project?
<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts? Suggestions?
<br/>
<br/>

I've seen lots of crappy Flash Mario clones and stuff which have not been taken down, but Nintendo has a reputation for being lawyer-happy.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, you will get a takedown-notice. And yes, I think it's "just plain wrong" to use commercial assets even for not-for-profit projects. You're still using other people's work without their permission, which I don't agree with.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You never know if they'll shut you down.  There are things like Super Mario War that are still trucking along.
<br/>
<br/>
Do I think it's "just plain wrong"?  I dunno, I think it's a pretty gray area.  I guess my own gut feeling is that it's not wrong (I considered doing a blaster master fan sequel, using the original assets), but I could definitely understand why it would be wrong.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
