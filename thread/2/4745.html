    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I heard from somewhere that if you massage the area that the dead pixel is in for a bit, the pixel would come back on. The again, it that worked, then it wouldn't have been a dead pixel in the first place. I think I'd rather just get a replacement if I were you. Besides, don't you keep the one you currently have until they send out the newer one to you, then you send back your old one?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i bought a DS yesterday at Best Buy and it had one dead pixel in the upper screen that stayed red all the time......i took it back and got another one today and it has THREE dead pixels (two blue, one red) in the lower screen!
<br/>
<br/>
I must say that i am not very impressed.  Tommorow i am gonna get another one (if Best Buy doesn't flip out) and if it has one i'm done with thier asses.  It'll be time to wait for a PSP......which i hear has the same problems ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
As for me, I got my DS the day it came out in the US, and it has 1 dead pixel that stays the color blue on the lower screen. I really have no problem with it, and I don't plan on getting a replacement just because of that, but perhaps (*speaking in a sneaky voice*) make that the excuse to get a replacement after vigorous use, and use the 1 year warrenty to get it. Then again I may not. 
<br/>
<br/>
What I do hope is that actual homebrew development gets started once the DS is figured out. I've already got some ideas that I want to try out, as do many other people here on these forums.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is why large flat screens are so expensive- more pixels means more change of dead pixels - for monitors and tvs I remember reading somewhere that 3 dead pixels is the threshold; any more and the whole screen gets junked by the manufacturer.

<br/>
I suppose the manufacturing process just got better which is why the prices are coming down....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The only thing you misunderstood was my sarcasm that is explained in the last line of my original post.....(again I say)PSP's seem too have the same problem.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, it doesn't make any difference to me if the Oompa Lumpas make the LCD screen that goes into the DS.... I'm pretty sure when you close the cover over those defective screens it says Nintendo right on top.  That makes them responsible for the crap they are selling.  
<br/>
<br/>
They have been good enough to offer the no tolerance deal to fix screens and that is great, (i like you're idea of returning one down the road) but i think it sucks that i would havew to do that straight out of the box.
<br/>
<br/>
Long story short (too late), I just returned another one and got my money back for good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Instead of junking these TV, sell them to people who don't mind dead pixels for discount. There are people out there (like my parents) who could care less if the picture on the TV has a miniscule flaw in it.
<br/>
<br/>
Small screens though, like the DS, bug the hell out of me if they have dead pixels. Because of the low resolution, one dead pixel on a small screen is so noticeable that it drove me nuts and I had to return the DS for a new one!<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.slurrey.com" target="_blank">http://www.slurrey.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
