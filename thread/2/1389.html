    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi! I like coding on gba really a lot. I have to do a 6 month programming project at my university and I have to write a paper on it. I was thinking about doing something like "Game Programming for Gameboy Advance" as my project. I plan to use the devkit advance. can anyone of you tell me if there is something "illegal" about programming for gba without the official, unreachable nintendo dev kit or describing the gameboy architecture in papers? There are some other threads about legal issues, but they are only about making commercial games, not about programming only.Thanks! night</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Apparently, even some commercial developers use the publicly available DevKit Advance because its C library is better than Nintendo's. Nintendo QA doesn't care what compiler toolchain you use, only that the program runs on GBA hardware.

If that were illegal, would Barnes &amp; Noble have offered <a class="postlink" href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=2UUASU4D6L&amp;isbn=1931841780&amp;itm=1" target="_blank">this book</a> for sale?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have told a couple of my professors that I am interested in GBA programming, and asked them for help with some key problems I had.  I also used GBA programming experience on my resume, as I thought it showed an interest in computers, and the industry in general, as well as the ability to research and learn independently without being told to do so.
<br/>
<br/>
It seemed to have worked well, as I have just recently landed a pretty high paying computer job.  ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
