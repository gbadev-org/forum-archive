Why must Catapult and Dragon Basic come with their own IDE, instead of letting me use my own editor? Couldn't the programmers just write the compilers and let me decide the syntax highlighting colors?

I use OS X on my iBook whenever I can. Otherwise, at least for development, I use Linux. If you get something from VC++, great. But to me, nothing is better than Unix and the GNU utils for programming.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe they run under the assumption that if you run a different OS than Windows, you're smart enough to just use C/C++ for programming.  The IDE's tend to be "all-in-one" type of things that little n00bs like.  Anyways... get a windows emulator if you really want it, or better yet, install windows on your computer with a bootscreen...

Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Dragon BASIC is a command line compiler. And is written entirely in ANSI C. There will be an OS X and Linux port in the future (be patient). The IDE is for Windows simply because that's what I have... but it is nothing more than an editor.

Image converter?? A tool that converts a bitmap to a C-style array? There should be tons of such tools available for any OS worth mentioning, cuz such tools are anything but GBA specific.
<br/>
If there exists no such tool for your OS, then that's a good sign you're the only person alive who uses that OS ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, if you are a programmer, you should be able to put together a ugly image converter in an hour or so.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Very heartening to hear that. I'm sorry for assuming  that is was all integrated, but it isn't really clear on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.simforth.com/" target="_blank">simforth.com</a>, or any docs that I could find online.
