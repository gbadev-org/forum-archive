    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently dusted off my GB Xchanger and have tried to get it working with my new computer, nothing but problems so far. What I  would like to know is there a send tool compatible with Windows XP, and if so where? I have already installed giveio.sys but have found very little useful/current information on the GB(C) dev front. Hoping some old schooler can help me out. Thanks in advance.

PS. I have the GB Xchanger released by Bung also known as Mr. Flash.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
