This has got to be one of the most rediculous schemes I've ever seen, and yet they are actually succeeding in gaining money from it, and from their arguments, it's perfectly legal. In this circumstance, it's almost feels like a hostage situation, where unless the person gets what he wants, he'll kill what he's taken hostage. And according to NBC from whatever date it was, they've already made 20,000$ USD from it.
<br/>
I wish the government  would single-out these guys and draft them to go into Iraq, and let them get captured by terrorists, just so that they can feel what it's like to be on the other end of the stick. Sure it may be just a rabbit, but it's more of the case that they have complete control over this rabbit, and are telling the world their demands, very much like terrorists, only that they went through the trouble to help it recover and then plan to kill it. I'm not even convinced that they even have a rabbit, since they can always borrow someone elses just for the pictures.
<br/>
My concern about this is that other crazed maniacs will do the same thing, and profit from it. There will always be those people who aren't smart enough to not give in and give their money away. If I were educated in laws concerning animals and/or pets, I'd do something about it. However, I'm not. From what I'ev looked up, all I could find is a section concerning abandonment, but I'm not sure if that would count against these sick people.

Anyone else want to say anything about this?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Heh heh heh. I guess some people don't recognize a joke site when they see one. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I saw that one awhile ago. It's not so much a hoax as it is just simply a joke. The pay link never even worked in the first place.
<br/>
<br/>
There's been a lot of other sites like that too, that a lot of people have thought were real despite how incredibly over-the-top they were.  Manbeef comes to mind.  And then there another one, forget the name of it, that was sort of like an obsessive-stalker-for-hire sort of thing. And every once in a while the television news media starts playing along too. Like the Bambi-Hunt (or something like that) thing.

I guess the thing that threw me over the top was the fact that there was an article about SaveToby.com on the NBC website (with them stating that over $20,000 had been collected)....and yet they don't seem to have the video clip of it though....hhmmmm.

Yea, I've kinda learned to take what the mainstream news media says with a grain of salt.  They're under so much pressure to report the most scandalous stories as fast as possible that I've seen quite a number of cases where their fact-checking was, umm..., questionable, to say the least.
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, there was one time not long ago when various media outlets reported on a dad that bought a Disney GBA game for his young daughter. The game supposedly told the daughter to "F** off", but they never reported the small detail that it was a pirated copy, and the message was in the cracker's intro (not to mention taken out of context). Hmm, now that I think of it, I think there was a thread about that on this forum somewhere.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
