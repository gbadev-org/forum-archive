    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know how everyone is talking about running a PDA like application on the GBA, but what about running GBA emulators on a PDA?  That saves me the trouble of carrying around a couple of cartridges.  I'm going on a trip for the summer, and don't want to have to carry a bunch of stuff around.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just in case the admin missed it:  I own the games I want to play, as well as the system, so I'm not asking for anything illegal.  I just don't know how to create a program for the Pocket PC that will let me play ROMs.
<br/>
<br/>
**Please Help**
<br/>
<br/>
Please make the program on Pocket PC 2002, dont use Palm please!<br/>_________________<br/>-----------------------------

It's not that the people here that are working the PDA thing do it because they actually need a PDA. They are just trying to pull it off on the limited GBA hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
And to program a GBA emulator for a PDA, you need to know HOW TO program for a PDA, and since this is a GBA Development site and community I don't think many people know how to program for a PDA.<br/>_________________<br/>Currently playing: NGC: Metroid Prime

<br/>
Head over to the makers of Visual Boy Advance and ask them (nicely) to do a conversion for pocket PC - it would be pretty simple.
<br/>
<br/>
You may have to bribe them with PDAs, bread, pizza and coffee.

Good luck m8.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.fmsoftware.btinternet.co.uk/Pictures/3dGBA.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does the Pocket PC platform support anything like DirectDraw?
<br/>
<br/>
VisualBoyAdvance is GPL'd. The best way to get VBA on a new platform is to port it yourself and then send Forgotten the patches.
<br/>
<br/>
But once a GBA emulator has been ported to the Pocket PC platform, there may be a bit of confusion with regard to the <a class="postlink" href="http://pocketnes.retrogames.com/" target="_blank">twin</a> PocketNES <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pocketnes.org/" target="_blank">emulators</a>...<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">there's gapi (game api) for wince/pocketpc which allows direct access to the display and the buttons.
<br/>
<br/>
embedded visual studio (or however it was called) can be downloaded from the microsoft website.
<br/>
<br/>
don't know about the new pocketpcs, but the one i own (a 3630, older model) sucks ass, because of one silly thing: it can't detect more than one button presses at once.
<br/>
<br/>
now go and create a decent action game with such input hardware =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A lot of the 213 different three-second levels in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.warioware.biz/" target="_blank">this game</a> don't need more than one simultaneous keypress. In fact, a lot of them only use one button.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">with VStudio 2003 .net enterprise are u able do make programms for pda. There is also a PocketPC 2002 emu in there. But u can update the emu up do  Pocket windows 5.0
<br/>
If u dont have de enterprise solution from Visual Studio.. i think u can download the Plugin from microsoft homepage (MSDN) so u can do that also.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW.. there are also GB, NES, GBA ,... emus available search google for MorphGear i think.. (Google: Pocket PC Game Boy Emu / / or somethink like this)
<br/>
<br/>
But remeber.. u must have the Full versions of the Game! Otherwise its illegal!
