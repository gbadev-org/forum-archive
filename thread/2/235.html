You can for example look for the reset/irq vectors at the start... there should be several B 0xXXXXXXXX instructions at the start of the bios.
<br/>
And, there should be a exact copy of the Nintendo logotype somewhere in the BIOS. (the stuff stored in the header on every game)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can hear the difference between the BIOS floating around on Kazaa (which may have been dumped from a devkit) and the release BIOS in the logo sound.  On the common Kazaa BIOS, you'll get a Cmaj9 arpeggio on a piano-like instrument and then a plain da-ding reminiscent of GBC.  On the release BIOS, you'll get an Fmaj9 arpeggio with smoother reverberation and then a fancier da-ding with two voices an octave apart.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most likely your dump is good -- there was an early version of the BIOS that was distributed on the newsgroups/gnutella/etc, etc, etc.  I don't know if there is anything wrong with it, but it's obviously not the release version.

<br/>
Here is the checksums for the BIOS -- I dumped this from my own machine, so I know this is the correct version:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No doubt this is covered elsewhere on the board, but there were at least two hardware versions of the original GBA before the SP was released.  I modified my original style GBA with the "TV de Advance" video-out mod and when it first arrived the cable didn't fit.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't imagine the two different versions have the same BIOS.  I would imagine there are at least a couple of BIOS versions for each hardware version.  Since the GBA is a closed system, so long as the official instructions behave the same, Nintendo aren't worried about changes to undocumented stuff -- in fact it helps deter unwanted (by Nintendo) hardware developments that might aid piracy.<br/>_________________<br/>--
