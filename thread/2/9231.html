    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, I was online looking at video and this one video said that I needed a new codec to watch it and against my better judgement I downloaded it(stupid I know). Anyway ever since then I have been getting random viruses on my computer and I can't get them to stop. I downloaded AVG which catches a lot of viruses but I still get more for no reason. One guess it that I downloaded a program that keeps making these similar viruses. I downloaded a trial version of Ad-Aware which still didn't rid me of the problem, but found like 18 spyware that the problem seemingly produced. So today I decided to go through my add and remove programs and look for anything suspicious. So SMSC IrCC V5.1.3600.3 SP1 is one that I saw. Does anyone know it this is a valid program? When I run it it seems to be a security program that logs threats. I'm not sure if it is part of AVG or not?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm pretty sure thats a windows update, or similar. Here's what I recommend you do:
<br/>
<br/>
Start your computer in safe mode, then run these programs: 
<br/>
<br/>
AVG 
<br/>
AdAware (with all of the most recent updates)
<br/>
Spybot S&amp;D (with all of the updates)
<br/>
Microsoft Anti-Spyware (if you can find it.)
<br/>
<br/>
In safe mode, the programs won't be running so you should be able to get rid of them without them "re-spawning".
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!

It's not as bad as it looks, and does a pretty good job of finding a bunch of stuff that might be wrong.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It might not be worth the trouble, but there is a virus virtual cure all:
<br/>
<br/>
A) Backup all files you want to keep
<br/>
B) Clear hard drive
<br/>
C) Reinstall OS
<br/>
D) Reinstall drivers and other software
<br/>
E) Scan backed up files for viruses
<br/>
F) Restore backed up files
<br/>
<br/>
*) Napster style file sharing programs are evil
