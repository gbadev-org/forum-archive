<br/>
The GPL, while maybe not "evil" is completely useless.
<br/>
Everyone seems to throw it into their project seemingly for the hell of it, especially audio libraries.
<br/>
<br/>
Any less restrictive license would do, but nooo.
<br/>
They had to go and choose one that would leave so many existing projects with existing licenses have next to no options.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm all for open source, but when a section of text basically fucks your project over I get pissed.
<br/>
<br/>
As for re-inventing the wheel, honestly, how many people are capable of writing audio libraries that not only sound good but have good filesizes?
<br/>
Some things need to be left to the pros, but unfortunately they're all just continuing to throw that horrible license into every project possible.
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't be surprised if there is a hello world app somewhere licensed under it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lazy1, if you had actually taken the time to read what the FSF thinks, you'd realize that placing libraries under the GPL is actually pretty smart. The point is to give an advantage to open source programs against commercial software. Commercial companies can not use the library, as it would force them to license their entire program under the GPL, but people who write free, GPL'd software can.
<br/>
<br/>
When you see it from that perspective, it really makes sense.

The solution is simple: If your own license is incompatible with GPLd software, or if you don't want to release your source,
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Don't use the software that someone offered you for free.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
That's not to mention how there's a good chance they gave you a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">damn good selection of fast mirrors</a> to download it from.
<br/>
<br/>
When you use software, you accept its terms.
<br/>
Period.
<br/>
<br/>
(Hm... this reminds me of a few other sad tales with people moaning about the quality of some DS homebrew...)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I've used MPL a lot over here. It seems a bit happier than GPL... I forget why though, so I'll have to read it again :/
<br/>
<br/>
I have found that actually talking with the original developers of software with these licenses can get some nice little deals going. As long as they're okay with what you're doing, it's fine.
<br/>
The license doesn't really take precedence over a solid communication with the developer, unless that person turns out to be a real jerk, which is surprisingly rare.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

You can't just go changing licenses around, thus making some libraries unavailable to projects that desperately need them
<br/>
<br/>
You all seem to be missing the point of what I'm saying, now it's just your personal fight to defend the GPL despite this critical flaw.

Luckily for me, someone in IRC pointed out an LGPL mp2 decoder that I can use with Wolfenstein which was released under the ID Software license.

However, it still is the case that the developers chose to make a library which promotes GPLd software.

My point exactly..   They want other peoples hard work to be free, but they don't feel their hard work should be free..  Sounds like a duble standard, doesn't it?
<br/>
<br/>
Even libs, someone had to do the hard work.. and their work is important to them.  If you want to use their hard work, you PAY THE PRICE and follow the GPL..
<br/>
<br/>
I love it.. this falls into the same thing when people complain about homebrew.. it's free!  You want something better, go buy a commercial version of it..  So, if you want to piss and moan about a lib that is GPL, how about you go buy a commercial version that does the same thing the GPL'd lib does?  Yeah.. screw that.. I'm not going to pay money for something when I can piss and moan about a GPL'd version that I can get for free!
<br/>
<br/>
I can see if you spend $300 to liscense a lib, and it sucks.. complain all you like, you paid good money for something that sucks.. and it's your every right to complain.. But, when all you spent was a few minutes of your time downloading something.. if you don't like it, or it's liscense.. ya'know what?

If you don't like that, you're entirely free to pay someone for an alternative library. Heck, many authors of GPL software will relicense for individuals when approached with a serious offer.
<br/>
<br/>
If your project has an existing license that isn't GPL compatible, that's hardly the library author's fault.

Yes, but the point is degrees of separation, what your contributing might be open, but the existing thing your having to use from someone else might not be.

Indeed, it seems many here have failed to understand the scenario. It's a tough situation lazy1 has found himself in, being crushed in the middle between two incomapitable licenses. But in my opinion he has quite severely misunderstood the situation himself. He has directed the flamethrower into the wrong direction and is now proppelling himself backwards. The incompatible license is not GPL, it's the ID Software license. 
<br/>
<br/>
So to sum things up.
<br/>
Instead of writing an email to IDsoft explaining his situation and petition them for a solution, he ended up creating a close to useless thread turning   on the heat for every freelancing developer out there.
<br/>
<br/>
The only flaws in GPL I can see is that not everyone reads it before licensing their code under it.
<br/>
There is as earlier mentioned in this thread several different prewritten licenses which could be better for your particular project.
<br/>
the best thing would be if you simply wrote your own if you don't have time to read through a prewritten license.
<br/>
<br/>
But then there still is the LGPL or BSD(new) license which in most cases is better suited for a library. That ofcourse is still up to the original author to decide.
<br/>
<br/>
If revenge really is what lazy1 wants, then I suggest he writes a very useful library, then release it under the old BSD license and request that anyone using his code must somewhere display the text "I'm the bastard of a monkey and I sell software for money."<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://manifested.ath.cx" target="_blank">http://manifested.ath.cx</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My argument is that the source code isn't really free if I don't have the freedom to use it without tracking you down and get a license. I do NOT argue that you have to give me all freedom, I'm just saying that the FSF definition of freedom is a bit odd.
<br/>
<br/>
IMO BSD-style licenses is much closer to "real" freedom, but even those usually limit the user in some way. Imposing a certain license is quite damn far away from free use, hence rendering the FSF-definition of freedom quite useless. Freedom is a mighty word, and it's often abused. I believe that the FSF is contributing to that, and their community is benefiting from it at the expense of other communities.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is nothing stopping ANYONE from making money using the GPL.  Nothing!  You don't even have to modify anything to make money.

You just have to make the source of what you put on it available.  Or, charge them $300 for the laptop, and $100 for installing Linux.. it doesn't matter.

I think it is all down to greed. Come on, you are getting someones code for free. They only reason why they offer you their code is on the premise that you will not make millions from something they made without giving them a penny. The GPL ensures that such a thing will not happen. It would be better that you quit the complaining and simply not use the freely available source.

It is limiting, but there is good and bad to it. What it means is that propellerheads - for example - cannot make use of GPL licenced code without their project being under the GPL.

My opinions here have nothing to do with money. If you don't want anyone to make money of your code, just state it in the license. I'm all fine with that.

No, you can not. GPL does not differ on static and dynamic linkage, and run-time linkage as used in normal plugin/add-on systems would be considered as normal linkage. If you make a plug-in to GPL software, your plug-in would have to be GPL as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You would think so, but consider these licenses as an organisation. When you look at it this way you see that GPL (and other such binding licenses) are organisations that allow anyone to use it's resources providing it adds its resources related to the license back to the organisation.
<br/>
<br/>
As time progresses each license will have a larger set of technologies which will allow more code to be provided under a single license. Now remove the license, and what you have is everything not GPL. Either live with it or without it (when you think of it that way).

I personally like LGPL best for libraries because:
<br/>
- People who want to do everything will have to publish their modified source-code
<br/>
- People who just want to use it (and thus indirectly promote my library) can do that without any restrictions.
<br/>
<br/>
This way, people who want to profit from using the library and building something around it(not modifying it) can just do that. On the other hand: people who want to profit from modifying the library and then selling the modified one as their own in a closed-source license can't just do that.
<br/>
<br/>
To me it's something like "give it to the public, but make sure they don't abuse your generosity".
<br/>
If you get something for free, you might expect restrictions when you're planning certain commercial implementations.
<br/>
On the other hand: if you're a hobby developper without commercial ambitions but you just don't like the LGPL license I provide, you're not having the same thoughts about free source-code and I, thus - in my opinion - you shouldn't be using my source-code.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://www.lifeisdigital.net" target="_blank">project website</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://www.kenvanhoeylandt.net" target="_blank">personal website</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

True, it has its limitations, but sadly I'm not experienced with legal matters, so I have no knowledge to change the LGPL license to my exact needs.

Plus, I'm not planning on sueing hobbyists when they statically link my engine to a DS application while their source is closed. As long as they don't claim credit of the engine themselves and as long as there's no profit-making involved, you won't hear me complain.

That one is simple to answer: absolutely.
<br/>
<br/>
I encourage writing open source software, but I don't disencourage filling my bank account :)
<br/>
In my opinion, open source software can perfectly co-exist with closed-source licenses, because that way, the open source developper gets the means to develop further on the open source application (or making a living from it, if ever).

I never mentioned this on my webpage, but I definitely will when version 1.0 is released.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a simple, BSD-like license for my programs. Essentially, if you use my source files, modified or not, those files have to be available. The rest of the program is something you made and you're welcome to do whatever you want with it. (I need to add something for copying pieces of my code into other files though.) The idea behind GPL and LGPL is good, but the idea that if you use this piece of GPLed code then you have to make your entire program open-source is just too restrictive and IMO doesn't make sense. As much as I support open-source, it's important to keep in mind that many people make a living writing and selling software, and they just couldn't do this if they had to release the source code. This frequently stops companies from implementing something in their program because all the code they can find to do it is GPLed, going open-source is not at all feasible, and writing such code from scratch would take far too long. Plus, why should I have to give out all of <span style="font-style: italic">my</span> code just because I used a piece of <span style="font-style: italic">your</span> code?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Loopy didn't seem to have a problem with it IIRC. he was happy that more people got to play old NES games.

Don't provide binaries, only provide source. Sell the binaries. Or, sell support (and perhaps a boxed copy), which is what a fair amount of OSS companies do. Or beg people to buy copies of the thing.

A lot of people won't go through the effort to compile something themselves, or in many cases simply can't (95% of Windows users...), so it might be another "incentive" to buy it.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Firon on Fri Jan 26, 2007 7:01 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Keldon, personally, have no idea what you are talking about when you compare it to a body...  But I agree, if it wasn't required to release the source, money hungry people would be snatching up other peoples hard work, make a few minor (or major) modifications, and then require people to pay for something they didn't create.  By having this requirement, a developer knows that his hard work will always be available to him, and if you make it better, he knows that he will also benefit from your hard work, not that you only benefit from his hard work.

Nobody is forced to use the GPL.  People CHOOSE to use it.  Now, your going to say, "but, if I want to use your code, I'm being forced to use the GPL.".. well..  Only if you CHOOSE to use my code..  Therefor, your not forced into anything.  Now, you may not like your choices, but they are still there for you to make a decision.

Well, I'm not going to try to list all the companies I can think of, but a couple of easy ones are IBM and Digium.  Both are hardware companies.. You'd be amazed at how much money IBM invests into Open Source..  But, if the new GPL comes out (with all the software patent BS), I think we might find open source die (as well as Linux) at the hands of it's "creators".  If you do enough research, I think you will find that a majority of open source software is driven by a company or market.  Once companies are forced to leave OSS, the developers left behind doing it for "fun" and not money will greatly dwindle.. but that is another thread all together.

Don't take this wrong, I'm not trying to be an ahole.. but it seems your sheltered from OSS in general.  A lot of companies sell support for OSS.  Not just "big" name companies like RedHat but your local computer service provider.  Any computer contractor/consultant that supports Linux/OSS is "selling support".  Any hardware company that provides OSS on their hardware and charges for support is selling support.
<br/>
<br/>
Even if you take your computer to a major computer retailer to have anything done on it, you are purchasing support.  If they use OSS to remove all your spyware you just paid for OSS support.  Now, of course the major guys aren't going to use OSS because they want to charge you $40 for a piece of software that does the exact same thing you could have gotten for free..  but the little guy down the block, who doesn't make much from selling you $40 software, but makes his money from the installation/support he provides, may use OSS to fix you up.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh.. btw, I'm making money from OSS.  Just not significant money.. yet. ;)

Edit: Just saw your baker post.. :)  You can always get your sugar from someone that doesn't want you to give the cake away for free.. But..
