A few things more under development but, evey function in it
<br/>

<br/>
Hope to get a good place ;)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I heard about the compo at about 2pm and coded until I submitted at exactly 11:59pm :-P.  It wasn't exactly buggy (well, a little), but the real disappointment was that the final "You beat the game" screen was pretty cheesy.  I wish I coulda made a cool animation or something... oh well.

I didn't really understand that post either.<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
ok, my english is not very good but in t3tsuo's post there aren't any
<br/>
reference to any entry...
<br/>
<br/>
if he had written something like:
<br/>
<br/>
"MY entry is clean and simple..." and so on that would be clearer :)
<br/>
<br/>
sorry for my misunderstanding!
