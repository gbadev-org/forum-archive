    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, here it goes.  This has got to be the world's stupidest question on what should be the world's easiest topic, but somehow it has confused me.  It is regarding Private Messages on this website (yes, I told you it should be the world's easiest topic).  My question is if a personal message is sent and it sits in your outbox for a day or two, has it actually been sent, or is it waiting to be sent?  If it was actually sent, shouldn't it be in your sentbox?  Is there something I have to do to send it?  When I was done typing it, I clicked "Submit", but that and Preview were the only two buttons, and I didn't want to preview it, so I clicked Submit.  For anyone who answers this topic, I thank you in advance, and apologize for wasting your time.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe that the outbox is for messages which haven't been read yet, but are in the oher persons inbox. You can edit messages in this box, so as long as the user hasn't read them, it is the only way such a system would be feasable. Once read, the messages go to your sentbox, and you can't edit them. Of course, there might be a delay in them being sent, for exmple all messages get sent at midday GMT each day, or something, but I don't think that's right, as I've had replies and replies to them more than once a day.

Perhaps I'm wrong, tepples/Simon?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, your spot on. There is no delay in the msgs though. As soon as they have been read they are moved to your sentbox.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That makes me feel better.  I wasn't sure if it was just sitting there waiting for me to send it or not.  Thank you for the help.
