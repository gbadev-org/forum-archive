Anyways, I was snooping around the Gamefaqs forum earlier, and it seems that there is some speculation about the DS launching early.  Personally, I think it's a little hoaxy, but several people have claimed to get a letter from Gamestop saying they will ship DS units to their pre-order customers on or around the 15th.  Here's a link to a relevant story from a fairly reputable site:

<br/>
<br/>
I personally don't think the DS will ship early, but I can't help but get a little excited at the prospect.  Your opinions are welcome, any official info to support or deny this rumor is helpful!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What that might be is what I've seen places do a few times before.  They'll ship it a few days before the release date so that it arrives for you *on* the release date. This way there's more reason to order online, otherwise people would figure, "Why order it online and get it a couple days late, when I can just pre-order and pick it up at the store on the day it comes out?"
<br/>
<br/>
Other speculation:
<br/>
1. Retailers are known for making up release dates (particularly when they don't have an official release date, although that's not the case with the DS)
<br/>
2. Maybe the people on gamefaqs are just bullshitting and IGN is just relaying what they said without much regard to reliability of the info.
<br/>
3. The emails they received may have been sent by someone pretending to be Gamestop.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Gamestop did have the release date as 11/15/2004, however they corrected this with a reply to everyone that pre-ordered them.
