    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, this has absolutely nothing to do with programming in any way shape or form that I know of.  I'm begging for information, and Google has let me down.  I need/want to know what NOINO means.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know if you spell it backwards it spells ONION, but that isn't what the real answer is.  A friend mentioned that she doesn't have to say "noino" anymore now that she has a boyfriend.  But I'm not allowed to know what it means.  That was the only clue she gave me.
<br/>
<br/>
So if anyone can tell me why a single girl would say "noino" and taken girl wouldn't, I would very much appreciate it!
<br/>
<br/>
(Yes, this really is off-topic... but this is the only forum I visit.  Probably a bad choice of forums really, considering the programmer types tend to know less about girls (which is probably why I'm hooped) but I'm hoping this is a stereotype!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have no clue.  The above words don't seem especially useful and the only women in the office right now are Japanese.  I'm sure I have a better chance of figuring it out than they do.

<br/>
Yes, I agree that it has something to do with relationships.  I think you're probably really close on this one.
<br/>
<br/>
I just had a thought... this is a long shot, but if anyone cares, tell me what you think of this idea... maybe it stands for something?  Maybe it's what a single girl tells her friend who's dating, like "<span style="font-weight: bold">N</span>ow <span style="font-weight: bold">O</span>nly <span style="font-weight: bold">I</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">N</span>eed <span style="font-weight: bold">O</span>ne" ("one" referring to a boyfriend)
<br/>
<br/>
I dunno, this just came to me as I was replying.  I still would like this thread to stay alive in the hopes that SOMEone <span style="font-style: italic">knows</span> the answer.  It drives me nuts when girls do these kinds of things...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Noyno

In this case, the Y can sound like a long E.

Do I get a prize?  :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have good news!
<br/>
<br/>
I grilled my GF about it (since her best friend started this NOINO nonsense) and I found out what it means.  Here's the skivvy:
<br/>
<br/>
At my church, the youth were allowed to paint the Youth Room.  Someone painted NOINO on the wall, most likely just spelling ONION backwards.  Then, some of the girls saw it, and decided that it needed to have a meaning.  Basically, saying NOINO means saying "I want a kiss" and the fact that you can't just go get one (like you can with a boyfriend) is implied.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I'm not allowed to tell anyone this.  I assume this just means I'm not allowed to let the other guys around here know, but just in case!
<br/>
<br/>
And thanks for the suggestions.  They actually did help, because making all these guesses got me sympathy clues.  Girls seem to like it when guys look clueless!
<br/>
<br/>
I wish there WAS an easy way to hand out prizes...
<br/>
<br/>
strager gets 1000 points for originality (sorry, but I don't recall "Y" sounding like a long "E" when it's a consonant)
<br/>
<br/>
sgeos gets 100 points for effort, 600 for confusing me with many random words, 500 for each Japanese woman he works with, plus another 1500 for having the same name as one of the guys ho works at my local EB
<br/>
<br/>
zazery gets 1000 points for an inciteful guess, plus 3500 for actually being right without anyone knowing it!  (It WOULD be rude to go around asking for a kiss)
<br/>
<br/>
Ultima2876 gets 100 points for effort, plus a bonus 500 for being the first to respond.
<br/>
<br/>
So we'll tally up the points once sgeos tells us how many Japanese women he works with.  I'll need proof... let's say, names, numbers, BWH sizes, and photos wouldn't hurt... :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There are pictures of at six of them on the company <a class="postlink" href="http://www.br2.co.jp/cgi-bin/snap.cgi" target="_blank">snapshot page</a>.  (As well as a picture of me.)  The seventh started last week.
<br/>
<br/>
2200 + 3500 = 5700, 5200 if you only count the people in the pictures. =)
