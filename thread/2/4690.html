    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently bought an MBV2 cable, and I'm having troubles getting it to work.  It was fun getting the giveio service to install AND run, but now it's in and working fine (or so it seems anyways).  But I have two issues:
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, when I have my SP plugged into the MBV2 cable, I turn it on and the power light is very dim and the screen and frontlight stay off.  If I unplug and replug the cable, it works fine.  Battery is at about 3/4 charge.  Not really an issue, but curious to know if it's just me, or if this happens to other MBV2 users.
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, and the issue I wish to address and fix if at all possible, is the fact the bleedin' cable doesn't work.  At least, not for me.  I get this when I try:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">Parallel MBV2 cable found: hardware=v2.0, firmware=v4
<br/>
Looking for multiboot-ready GBA...
<br/>
Sending data. Please wait...
<br/>
Return data should have been 0!
<br/>
Press any key to continue . . .</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the bat file I use to send the mb file (a modified version of the CMD file included on the original disk):
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">@echo off 
<br/>
net start giveio &gt;nul
<br/>
echo q &gt; %SystemDrive%\q.txt
<br/>
debug \\.\giveio &lt;%SystemDrive%\q.txt 2&gt;nul &gt;nul
<br/>
del %SystemDrive%\q.txt
<br/>
mb.exe -l 1 -n -s glib
<br/>
pause
<br/>
net stop giveio &gt;nul 2&gt;nul</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
And the glib.mb file I'm sending is also the original, un-modified file from the disk included with the cable.  I'm running Windows 2000, my LPT is 1, at IO 378, and I've tried EPP and ECP.  I tried using a virtual machine to run pure DOS (Good ol' MS Dos 6.22), but it sadly refuses to connect my LPT port, but I will get this fixed and try this...  but I don't want to have to use a virtual machine just to send MB to my GBA... that'd be useless to me.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any advice!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
