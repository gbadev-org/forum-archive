<br/>
For my part, I will submit a game. Not finished yet but it looks like I will be able to meet the deadline.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So does anybody want to share the *kind* of game they're submitting?
<br/>
<br/>
Our team (myself and sgeos/Brendan) is submitting a sci-fi, isometric RPG (or maybe it would be termed an "adventure game"). It's more conversation/story based than very "action-y", though.
<br/>
<br/>
I know that's not much of a pitch... I'll work on that (or better yet, let Brendan work on it ;)

Would Simon &amp; Co. consider putting the deadline forward about a year? :)<br/>_________________<br/>-pb</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been working (ever so slightly) on a game idea; but I never planned on even starting it before the deadline, so there was no chance I'll was ever enterring. That is why I never said anything in the topics about the competition, or even said if I was going to make anything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
