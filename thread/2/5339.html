    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it just me with this problem, or have others noticed this too?  When I decided to refresh the dsdev.org homepage (I keep all my windows open and refresh when I want an update), instead of the regular old dsdev.org news, I get a (what they call) "legal" underage almost-porn site.  Maybe something is wrong with my DNS, maybe the company hijacked DSDev.org to point to their site, I'm not sure.  I thought I'd bring that up so that it could get fixed.<br/>_________________<br/>Current high scores on Super Mario 64 DS:

But, I don't visit dsdev.org that much, and jumped over to gbadev.org instead..  but it was wierd.
<br/>
<br/>
I just figured I might have typed it in wrong, and it's one of those sites that registered a domain name "close" to the real one for people that mistype it.  cause it redirects the name so fast, you can't see what you may have typed by mistake.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got this too. It just randomly happened. Happened when I typed in the GBAdev url, and it came up. So I typed again, and it didn't. I thought someone had hacked my PC or something, so I did an ad-aware and virus scan. Rebooted, and it happened when I tried to click on the forums.
<br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear it's not my PC. (I'd hate for that sick stuff to just randomly pop-up). I hate sick tw*ts (like the person who's hacked GBADev) who use 'its art' as an excuse, when they're obviously just paedos.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

All of this is research. You are going to see theories come and go. Things you think can't be done, will be done. But because you are here, you'll be the first to know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
