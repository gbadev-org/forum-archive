I know that there are replacing batteries but they will not be on sale forever<br/>_________________<br/>l

If you are so concered, by extra batteries now, they're only $15 + shipping. Besides, there will be other Game Boy products which will have backwards-compatibility with GBA games. Even the DS has it, so there's no reason to think that your GBA will be ancient history.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo has said that the battery will last past the 5 years mark, even if they don't hold it up that far, i doubt people will really be complaining that much. It will have been replaced by then.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Rumor has it that like the Super Game Boy accessory, the Nintendo DS has no link cable connector, which means <span style="font-style: italic">The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords</span> is incompatible with the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Well, the DS isn't in the GameBoy line, I was really talking about the successor to the GBA.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What are the chances the GBA games will be able to use the wireless link without modification?
