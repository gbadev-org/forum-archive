<br/>
&gt;first, learn japanese. buy a dictionnary english&gt;japanese, and learn every word.
<br/>
&gt;A good way to learn japanese would be to learn chinese first. chinese looks like japanese, with all those drawings and weird signs, so, it's a good thing to learn first.
<br/>
&gt;Learn ALL THE DICTIONNARY. don't ask anything before. don't even try to make a sentense.
<br/>
&gt;Don't ask about japanese if you didn't learn chinese before.
<br/>
<br/>
etc...

I don't see a question.  I know Japanese.  What do you want to know how to do?  (Are you complaining about the FAQ?  Are you just plain trolling?)
<br/>
<br/>
Unless you are really good at memorization, attempting to learn every word in a dictionary is a horrible way to learn a language.  All you really need to know how to say to get by in a foreign country is "How much does this cost?" and "Where is the bathroom?"  Knowing "Yes", "No" and how to count are also good.  Everything beyond that is bonus.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to learn Japanese:
<br/>
<ul>A) Buy an introductary book on Japanese.  Learn basic grammar, greetings, hiragana and katakana.
<br/>
B) Spend three months in Japan.  You can sign up with Nova (the English teaching school) to do this.
<br/>
C) Although you are far from literate, you now know enough to get by in Japan all by yourself, forever and ever and ever.</ul>-Brendan</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I assume it was a satire of perceived attitudes on this board toward people who have never programmed in C before and want to try programming the DS. I assume that it was posted in Beginners because much of it appears to be a comment on the GBA beginners' FAQ.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Interesting things about Chinese and Japanese.
<br/>
<br/>
I've learned a little Chinese while living here, and found that I can make sense out of SOME japanese kanji, as the kanji meaning is very close to the chinese meaning of the same characters.   But then they start throwing all that hiragana in there, and I'm lost.    I saw a sign in Hong Kong translated into like 6 different languages, the Chinese having about 6 characters.  The Japanese had 4 of the same characters, the other 2 were changed into kana.
<br/>
<br/>
Funny story about it though, last night, we flipped on the TV, to what we thought was a Chinese movie.  Only what they were saying didn't match the chinese subtitles AT ALL.  It wasn't until I heard a "ka" when there should have been a "ma" that we realized it was a Japanese movie, not Chinese.  Confused the heck out of me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
(or, What are those curlicues after words in Japanese subtitles?)
<br/>
<br/>
Hiragana after nouns are usually case endings. If you know any Latin or Russian then you know how they work:
<br/>
<ul><li>は ha (pronounced wa) -&gt; topic, "as for" </li><li>が ga (pronounced nga) -&gt; nominative, subject </li><li>を wo (pronounced o) -&gt; accusative, direct object </li><li>の no -&gt; genitive, "of" </li><li>へ he (pronounced e) -&gt; dative, indirect object </li><li>だ da, です desu* -&gt; be</li></ul>
<br/>
Hiragana after verbs are politeness and tense markers. Chinese tends to use adverbs instead.
<br/>
<ul><li>ます masu -&gt; present polite </li><li>ました mashita -&gt; past polite </li><li>る ru, て te -&gt; present familiar </li><li>た ta -&gt; past familiar </li><li>ない nai -&gt; negative </li></ul>
<br/>
Unlike in Chinese, Japanese tends to put the verb at the end of the sentence.
<br/>
<br/>
* Vowels 'i' and 'u' between voiceless consonants or between a voiceless consonant and a word ending are often dropped.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
