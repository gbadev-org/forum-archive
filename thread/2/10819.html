What follows is just opinion... don't take it very seriously.

Btw... this post has been deleted 10 times already.

<br/>
I left blitzed.org already.
<br/>
The network move is just a way to reclaim and squat existing EFnet channel(name)s. Don't give into it! Stay with EFnet!
<br/>
There is/was no good reason. And blitzed doesn't seem more stable than EFnet (seems less imho). The whole "fresh start" idea failed imho.
<br/>
We don't want to connect to multiple servers. All our existing channels are on EFnet already and when a handful of people trying to move most platform development channels it's is not going to work out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nobody wants you around anymore, because all you do is cause trouble.  Rabble all you want.  Nobody's falling for it anymore.

Oh, and for what it's worth, you didn't leave blitzed.  You were evicted.  Banned by sgstair.  Deal with it.  (Amusingly, you're actually on blitzed right now.  Liar.)

The reason nobody's falling for it anymore is that everyone's caught you lying at least twice by now.  The forum's mostly the same people.  Give it up.  You've cried wolf too many times.<br/>_________________<br/>Quidquid Latine dictum sit, altum Sonatur

I don't believe you didn't tell sgstair to ban me again. After all, why would he refuse with that wifi bounty money.
<br/>
Aahh.. it's such a relief to see someone banned from "all" development channels with a single command, uh?
<br/>
Perhaps I should follow Liranuna and go to the "Sony-scene" instead.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, that "left blitzed" was a quick-edit after Wintermute deleted my post several times. I actually meant I'm not on any channels of blitzed and just haven't removed it from the BNC yet. Hence the 9hrs idle time. I will disconnect from it now. Hope that gives you a bit of relief.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway... I have cought you lying so many times already with such outrageous statements that I just had to put up that funny text about you. I would suggest ppl to stop falling for your (and the other ops') nice talks too. I remember your last few lies that you used while trying to regain #wiidev on EFnet all too well. Gladly you didn't get it in the end. (should I care? I don't own it.) But now you have your nice #wiidev on blitzed anyway and you can ban me out again. Jeez man. Wii isn't even out yet!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have now removed DarkFader's access to devkitPro CVS as a pre-emptive measure against infection with malware. Until this point I remained neutral and believed that he could be trusted and could be encouraged to behave as a responsible member of the homebrew community given the chance.
<br/>
<br/>
I moved the dev channels to blitzed in the hope that we could have a fresh start and put an end to the problems that have plagued our sojourn on efnet. Unfortunately certain people remain determined to cause trouble and ruin the atmosphere for everyone else.
<br/>
<br/>
As is clear from this topic and others across the internet DarkFader cannot be trusted to behave in any reasonable way. For those who still think the bricker was an accident I direct you to this site.

I would not harm your little CVS tree. I don't hate you nor most other developers. The only things that get infected now are the minds of the poor fellow developers and everyone else. Thanks a lot.
<br/>
What's next? Deny me access to this forum site? The lack of freedom of speech comes awefully close.
<br/>
You pushed me away a whole lot futher but I'm still clinging at the edge of your so called community.
<br/>
And the moment the atmosphere was ruined on the new channel was when SC came back and sgstair banned me again. I thought I was given a new chance but noooo...
<br/>
Anyway, there is still a chance that I start advertising for blitzed instead. You guys gotta start to treat me normally though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You were given another chance and you betrayed the trust of those responsible for that chance. Now here you are trying to stir up ill feeling on a forum committed to helping people. Ask yourself why anyone should ever trust you again.
<br/>
<br/>
You had your chance and you blew it.

<br/>
Freedom of speech carries a great responsibility. I've often noticed that those who cry loudest about it are those who abuse it and like to bend the truth to their own ends.

You've abused the trust of too many people too many times.

And when I hear "never", I think about "permanent = permanent" kickban note. That line kind of implies that I never would have gotten a 'real' chance anyway.

It's really not that interesting. It was the average random nick join and demand that StoneCyph be removed from channel.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I'm at the end of my tether with all this nonsense.
<br/>
<br/>
As many of you know I deliberately left the banlist in the new channels empty to give everyone a fair chance to prove that lessons had been learned and we could all co-exist in harmony. It saddens me greatly that the banlist was required so soon. The attack was entirely unprovoked and served only to teach me that some people are entirely undeserving of the right to free speech.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Seeing as how you've gotten on the wrong side of the mods and a few other people, while also alienating new people like me with drama queenish threads and persisting in reposting them 10 times due to deletion (I would think that even I would get the hint after the third deletion...), perhaps you are right and you should depart for the sony-scene.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
