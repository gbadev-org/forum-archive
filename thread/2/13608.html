    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The biggest thing that rubs me the wrong away about you is how you tout your own projects as superior to others. Case in point: Luminesweeper vs Gleam. Trolling on someone's posts for their own project to promote your own comes off a tad elitist.
<br/>
<br/>
I know people who have the same "uniqueness" who don't come off as abrasive as you do. It's all in timing. You have to determine when to speak, when to sit back &amp; listen and when to ignore all that's going on.
<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people work hard for what they do and become proud of their work. They then want to show it off to others. Do not take this as an opportunity to ride on their publicity unless you have some creative criticism to offer. Learn to support others and they will learn to support you. This in itself is the only problem I have with you.

Some posts, like the recent printf backspacing thread seem like a carefully engineered setup in order to air some criticism of other people or their code. Personally I've never used \r on a DS nor did I see the relevance of that code to backspacing.
<br/>
<br/>
In other places I've found your methods of promoting yourself a little on the distasteful side, best example was what almost amounted to stalking of the Gleam author. <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9272" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9272</a>

Somewhere I critcised you for phrasing feature requests as questions in barely related topics which resulted in you taking me rather literally with the "I suggest" thing. That was a bit annoying.

When all that IRC rumour "he said she said" BS was flooding into the forums, I was of the opinion to keep it on IRC and not drag down the forums with unsubstantiated hearsay.

It can, just refer back to my post on the attitude of the Internet. I stopped going to one forum for that reason, they were funny and had a lot of funny things to say. Long story short I just stopped using for no reason, then after a month or two I returned, making one post asking a person what she meant about "women being attracted to men who look nerdcore", saying that all the women magazines talk about it.
<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly I had an array of insults by the male members (clearly lacking female contact) starting a random argument about my questions. And everything I politely said was returned by more random insults. One of the legendary forum moderators personally felt to send me a pm to apologize in their behalf, explaining that this reception is the reason why many people left the forum and why many others don't stay.

Well flaming is an attitude, not just a mere occurrence. Some people are more inclined to flame; I prefer to immediately neutralize these situations by (a) demonstrating how they could have got the message across less aggressively, and (b) giving direct, but inarguable statements about their behaviour.
<br/>
<br/>
I even felt it necessary to let the topic occupy half of my sig, not just to say that I choose not to argue but that we should all choose not to argue. Surely you can disagree with me that's fine. Even tell me that I am unprofessional, that's fine - but only providing it is not in an argumentative tone ^_^ (if you get what I mean).
<br/>
<br/>
Long story short just have a strict message about no flaming in the forum, and when the situation arises you need only reiterate the common message about being more polite and less childish .. and so on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No tepples, I'm not sick of you.
<br/>
I respect you for your insight, knowledge, humor, and time committed to the community. I don't view you as a role-model. I don't really think I would ever go out of my way to meet you in person, but I wouldn't mind it if you lived much closer.
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I've noticed you make comments that are funny, yet off-topic. Sometimes they're jokes that are a little too off-topic and that don't make sense to me right away, I find myself more often not taking the time to see what the joke is, and I just ignore the post and continue on. I figure no one bashes you for this because you're a mod, and usually its you who does the bashing. I won't go as far as to call this abuse of power either, because I've done almost the same thing on occasion. And granted, some of the things you post are quite funny, just on occasion they're off topic when the person still needs help, or when they are too much of an inside or out-there joke.

Heh. I will say that even if there were past occurrences of the opposite situation, tepples' character through most of this mud-slinging has been overall mature. At least from what I've read on these forums, StoneCypher has been negative, overly critical, and occasionally hypocritical. I think he could have dealt with the situation using less remarks that were directed at a persons character, criticizing their achievements (or lack-of), and over exaggerating their mistakes.
<br/>
Regardless of who is to blame; who gave wrongful advice; who flamed who, I stand that tepples handled the situation better overall than StoneCypher. And for that he keeps my respect.

To forget past mistakes is to unlearn the lessons gained. And as such, most people will learn from their own experiences, the wiser people will learn from other's experiences. I'm not saying these threads should be stickied (lol) but once the flame war gets much too off topic, and repeating the same criticisms, etc. it should be locked, but not deleted, preferably by a moderator who's not participated in the flame war. (as I seen you've done already with one certain thread, wintermute) Granted, if the author of a post wanted to take something back, they should be allowed to.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

Do I agree with you, no..  that's what an opinion is for.  Do you do a good job of 'your job'? Yes.    Having 10,000+ posts, your going to make a few people unhappy.. that is life.  You don't agree with someone elses coding style?  Again, that is opinion.  You code one way, others code another, and even between "experts", people choose to do things different ways.  People need to get over it.  There are other people doing a lot more damage to the homebrew community than you.. yet.. they are still "in charge" to the point that they chase people away.  I really only have two things to remember about topics like this.
<br/>
<br/>
1) People use the internet as if it is fantasy.  Like an RPG, today they are a knight in shining armor, tomorrow they are a theif.  So it's hard to take anyone's opinion seriously.
<br/>
<br/>
2) Apparently I'm to old to remember more than one thing.. *ugh*
<br/>
<br/>
So, from the looks of the negative posters.. I'd say, "Welcome to our side?"<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
When I first started lurking here, I was AMAZED at how knowledgeable, helpful, and polite people were, particularly tepples.  So I must say thank you for that, and all the hard work you've done.
<br/>
<br/>
But over time, I also have been rubbed a little the wrong way by some of the same things that others have mentioned, mainly the subtle sounds of self-superiority, what I would consider plain trolling in threads that you didn't agree with,  and inappropriate self-promotion, like the luminesweeper/gleam thing.
<br/>
<br/>
So I didn't vote either way, as I'm not sick of you (you are one of the key helpful people in the scene), but I do wish you'd make an effort towards politeness and more mature tone.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Though it may sound like a novel idea you can run the risk of it becoming an unsociable forum where bad behaviour grows! In fact that is how the most unsociable forum community (I have heard of) grew. All pointless threads, or threads that could not fit into any category (including off topic) were thrown into the "Garbage Can". If nobody posted in a thread for 30 days then the thread would be automatically deleted; however a community grew within that forum exhibiting anti-social and unfriendly behaviour.

The problem is that it wouldn't stay out of the other forums, bad feelings spawned toward another person in the flame threads will show through in posts in the other forums.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

This goes back to a recommendation from behavior counselor who was assigned to me in high school soon after my diagnosis was changed from ADHD to Asperger syndrome.

I try not to criticize people, just their code.
