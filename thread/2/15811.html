<br/>
X-Bit BBS members: its been my great honor to offer you The X-Bit BBS.
<br/>
I can't even begin to explain how much enjoyment its brought me over the
<br/>
years building her for you.
<br/>
<br/>
In 1993 I created my first BBS named '32-Bit BBS'. It was a popular 1-node
<br/>
system in Oregon running Spitfire BBS software. I shut it down in 1997
<br/>
like most sysops due to internet popularity. In 2001 I was cleaning up my
<br/>
office when I ran across all my old BBS door game registrations.. BRE, LORD,
<br/>
Ext :) so I gave a quick internet lookup to see if there was any window or
<br/>
linux based BBS software available abd it didn't take long to find
<br/>
Synchronet software. The X-BIT BBS was born!
<br/>
<br/>
Close to 400,000 log-in later, I feel it's time to move on (for now).
<br/>
Thank you, the callers, so much for making X-Bit you home. Soon after X-Bit
<br/>
hit's 400,000 logon's we will close.
<br/>
<br/>
Your sysop, Rob [e-mail address omitted]</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
