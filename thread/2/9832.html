    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tetris? DS is not a homebrew game. Homebrew tetromino games such as DesktopMan's game are not supposed to be called Tetris?; they have other games such as Lockjaw or Quadra or Bedter.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, are you using the .nds version or the .ds.gba version of the game? And have you made sure to turn off "Use Loader"? After you write the DS game to the cart, does a GBA-mode menu appear if you insert the cart into a GBA or into a DS in GBA mode?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

If you're referring to that PicoDrive topic, I didn't see any links to ROM sites there. If I missed one, tell me.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Good point!  Now that you mention it.. I'm not the GBADev.org cop or rule enforcer at all.. I'll stop posting comments from now on.. If nobody else seems to care.. why should I?  I personally never commented on ScummVM because I don't own any of those games, therefore have no need for an emulator, therefore I haven't been following the post.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I'm just realizing that it's not my job to care about the rules.. and I have no reason to make your job (as moderator) more difficult than it already is.. Sorry for "whining".<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The ScummVM topic has probably been tolerated because it's easier to make a fair use copy of a ScummVM game than to make a fair use copy of, say, a Sega Genesis game.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
