    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was playing The Legend Of Zelda: A Link To The Past (Four Swords) (that I bought, well, a friend of mine bought it for me) on my GBA SP and I noticed something when I turned on the light. In some areas, where there is a bright colour (like white) and a dark colour (like black), the lighter colour seems to slightly extend to the darker area, especially at the top of the screen. It kind of looks as if it was 3D and that it's the shadow in the background. Oh yeah, and it's always towards the top (the overlapping I mean). Is this normal?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would say it's probably just a normal artifact of the LCD screen. Nothing to worry about.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, if you have an original GameBoy (the green-tinted screen kind before Pocket came out), try it out, that effect is quite visible on their LCDs. I guess it's just how they are.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.

Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
