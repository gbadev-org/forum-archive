    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For those of you interested in learning more about what working with Nintendo is like... I was searching for GBA stuff on the web and found this interesting <a class="postlink" href="http://cobrands.contracts.findlaw.com/agreements/bam/gbadv.license.2001.05.21.html" target="_blank">contract link</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how this made it onto the web. In any case, it is an interesting read to see what Nintendo requires and what they consider breach of contract.

Nah, if they didn't force Shiny to recall Enter the Matrix, they wouldn't force a recall on anything.  And if they *did* force someone to recall something then it would have to be for something bad enough that the developer would be nuts to not *want* to recall in the first place.

No.  That's why they said "to the maximum extent permitted by law".  It seems to be fairly common for legalese to claim all sorts of rediculous things like that and let the courts lay out their boundaries for them.

No, they'd just refrain from enforcing that point.  Their DS contract probably looks a little different.
