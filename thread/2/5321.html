Can anyone suggest an OSX app development environment? I'm totally new to mac programming, and I need someplace to start. Some sort of RAD environment would be cool.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,

I've never actually written a mac program, I just use them.

I assume you've looked at xcode which comes on with the Apple developer tools - it seems to be a fairly nice IDE.  Eclipse is another option although I'm not sure how well it works with Obj-C.
<br/>
<br/>
For RAD I've heard that Real Basic is good.
<br/>
<br/>
Now does someone who actually knows what they're talking about want to chime in...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
