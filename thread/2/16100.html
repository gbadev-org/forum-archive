I had to consider whether I'd be interested in buying a new one. As-is, my DS is in bad condition (don't leave it in your shirt pocket when you bend down to tie your shoe &gt;_&gt;) so I've got a good reason to replace mine, but I probably wouldn't bother if it weren't a new model.

According to <a class="postlink" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122295680182198263.html" target="_blank">WSJ</a>:</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">President Satoru Iwata said he sees room for further expansion. "In many households, family members are sharing a DS between them, so we are now aiming for one DS per each person," Mr. Iwata said at a press conference in Tokyo.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I think it's telling that Nintendo thinks that they can sell a DS to everyone who'd like to have one. In fact my first DS went to a friend because I wanted a different color, and to have more friends with DSes.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

From a hardware and software perspective, it looks like this is the equivalent of a GB -&gt; GBC upgrade.  Ie, basically the same hardware, but it is a little more powerful so high end software will not be backwards compatible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm interested to see the homebrew capabilities of the DSi. It's got two cameras built in, plus an SD card slot.
<br/>
<br/>
Although the question remains, will the firmware upgrades render flashcarts useless? Or will somebody pull something off similar to the Twilight Hack so that we could just use SD cards?
<br/>
<br/>
Aside from homebrew, this thing just looks FUN. I might pick one up if there's nothing else I'm saving up for (new computer &gt;_&lt;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
