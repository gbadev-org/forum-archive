    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a Verizon "Razzle" phone (the TXT8030 made by Pantech).
<br/>
After trying for a while to force feed it M3U playlist files, which it rejects outright, I finally try to create a playlist on the phone itself.
<br/>
Then I go to look at it.  It's just a bunch of 32 bit numbers.
<br/>
<br/>
Turns out that the numbers are the FAT32 cluster numbers for each file in the playlist!
<br/>
Leave it to Verizon/Pantech to design such an obscure playlist file format, where you need to know your filesystem's internal structure to make a playlist!  Or of course, make it on the phone itself...
<br/>
<br/>
At least they didn't use encryption.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have a Dare on Verizon.  What a PITA to get it to actually play albums in album order while also being able to sort by artist.  If I couldn't write software I'd still be carrying around a separate MP3 player.<br/>_________________<br/>It's not an illusion, it just looks like one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Finally finished the playlist maker tool.  Contains Chishm's GBA_NDS_FAT code to find out the cluster numbers for each file.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
