    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, guys. I really want to turn my old gameboy color into a midi synth module using this: <a href="http://variogr.am/latest/?page_id=31" target="_blank">http://variogr.am/latest/?page_id=31</a> . I am trying to consider the best way to go about doing this since I don't have a flash cart or programmer. I've been considering building a modified game cart ad this: <a href="http://www.reinerziegler.de/readplus.htm#GB_Flasher" target="_blank">http://www.reinerziegler.de/readplus.htm#GB_Flasher</a> , since I have an STK500 and have been wanting to get into AVR microcontroller programming anyway, but it seems like a lot of work for something I may only use once (at least in the near future. I don't want to sent a lot of money to do this either, since the idea is to use an old gameboy that I never use anymore. What do you guys suggest? Is there anyone on the forums that will load the file onto and old cart and sale it (just an idea to save me time and money)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want the GB sound, have you looked for any synths emulating its sound? I've seen a few emulations of old consoles, there's even a freely available <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellerhead_Software#Reason_ReFills" target="_blank">Reason refill</a> contains some C64 patches.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, there are also ways to manipulate a hardsynths to sound similar, but I just thing it would be neat to use the actual hardware. Also, I don't want it emulated as a softsynth. I am in a band an want ability to play it live (if I incorporated it into one of our songs), without a laptop on stage.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have an idea. How exactly does the the gameboy read carts? It is a small file. Instead of building a cart and a programmer could I just program say an eeprom chip with the information and connect it to the inputs to the cartridge input hardware on the back of the gameboy? Would that work? I believe we have eeprom programmers at school that I can use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, provided that you can get it wired correctly. But then how would you reprogram it?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

To fix discovered defects in the program.

Instrument definitions, perhaps?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
