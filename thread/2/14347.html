(ok, I'm way at the bottom of it, but still...)
<br/>
<br/>
And yes keldon, you should release something. Maybe write some tutorials? Especially if you like collision detection, that seems to be one of the hardest topics to find good information on.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

I admit it, I'm a freak with screwed-up priorities. I haven't done anything spectacular except a few puzzle games, a few libraries (including GBFS, which is still included with libnds; ironically it's a GBA library), and occasionally making a complete fool of myself on this board. I attribute some of that to spreading myself too thinly across web boards and across homebrew platforms (Allegro, NES, GBA, DS).
<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, I want to get the **** away from remaking Tetris over and over again. So what kind of GBA or 2D DS game would you like to see me attempt to develop next?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry to say it, but can we have TOD for the DS please ^_^ I think it's that your version of Tetris plays so well that it just <span style="font-weight: bold">has</span> to be done.
<br/>
<br/>
Tutorials, sounds like my area! As for collision detection, the best tutorials related to it are all in the Tonc tutorials under the information about vectors!!! Okay, so it doesn't mention collision detection, but if people go through that text first the whole thing is easier - but nonetheless I think I have a good way to get it across to a beginner.
<br/>
<br/>
So second to an app, tutorials seems like a good back up activity.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've never been this involved in a community. <span style="font-style: italic">I wonder what I could contribute...</span>

I am currently attempting to learn C++, although I kinda stalled out when trying to understand the windows API, none of those darn tutorials tell me what the heck I'm doing with all those parameters!

Well, the next choice is obvious! Pentis. <span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">No people, its not called pentris.</span>
<br/>
Just that, if you want to do an original 2D game, please don't do a fantasy/side-scrolling/anime-based/shoot-em-up/zelda/platformer/only-a-story-so-far-because-I-don't-know-how-to-program.
<br/>
But I really don't think I have any trouble with that; I see you coming up with your own original puzzle game, sadly for which I have no ideas.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

After that we'd need also a chart with finished projects per posts by user ratio. Just to see if the users posting less are actually more productive. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
