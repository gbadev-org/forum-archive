    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wasn't sure where to post this, but the Off Topic forums seemed general enough. Not sure anyone else has had any problems with Moonshell's DPG encoder, or wouldn't if you use a different DPG encoder, but I think having this info helps.
<br/>
<br/>
After using the DPG encoder supplied in the newer Moonshell (1.71?), I found that some of the videos I wanted to convert failed during the OGG conversion, making it crash. I searched a little bit on the converter, and found a website where  newer version of the encoder could be downloaded, which was v2.83 from v2.82 supplied with Moonshell. I've only tried a few files, but they converted fine unlike the previous version, and they play fine in Moonshell.
<br/>
<br/>
The website, although Japanese, has enough English on there to get you through it.

Download the oggenc2.83 file of your processor type, back up the old file, and extract the one you downloaded. Hope this helps anyone that was having trouble before.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
