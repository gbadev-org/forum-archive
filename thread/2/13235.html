    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
Is there somewhere I could learn deeper about the graphical specs of the Nintendo Wii? The official Nintendo website doesn't say that much...
<br/>
<br/>
How many polygons can be displayed on the screen? What about the resolution of the textures? Anything else I should know?
<br/>
<br/>
I will possibly work on a Wii project for a north american developer, so I would like to be prepared.
<br/>

(sorry if I didn't post in the proper section, since it's a comminity especially for handhelds I didn't know where to ask my questions)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The number of polygons that can be displayed on the screen is dependant on what is happening in the game at the time. There is no definitive answer for any machine, for example the 66Million polygon per second count that was given for the PS2 was a complete lie since no game ever got past [around] 12M. The Gamecube gave realistic in game polygon counts with effects on.
