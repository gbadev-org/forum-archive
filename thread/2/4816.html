    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do you mean 'has anyone found the <span style="font-style: italic">source code</span> for a good submarine sim'?
<br/>
Because of course, this is a development forum. Where people trade code snippets (and sometimes source code for entire games if you're lucky).
<br/>
<br/>
It's not a roms trading forum! Unofficial GBA developers get a hard enough time as it is, being accused of promoting piracy simply because the same tools are often used to rip off the big companies.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, go easy - he didn't ask for a ROM directly and this is the Off topic section. Granted, you're probably better off asking on a forum more specific to games, I've never seen any sub games for GBA.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">CanIKickIt(YES_YOU_CAN);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe The Hunt for Red October was released for GB mono as well, with one player controlling the sub and the player on the other side of the Game Link actually controlling the Soviet fleet.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
