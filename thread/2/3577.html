    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In general, headers give a program some kind of information as to how to interpret the rest of the file. They may state the size of the file, the size of each piece of the file (such as the size of each scanline), the order of pieces, the compression format, or any of several other things that affect interpreting the file into a machine-usable copy of the work that the file represents. Headers usually precede the data, but in some file formats, headers can come at the <span style="font-style: italic">end</span> of the file.
<br/>
<br/>
Or do you refer to header files in C or C++ code?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In C, when I say:</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">that is more or less the equivalent of find stdio.h, and copy/pasting the entire file in at that spot.  The advantage is that if you change the contents of the file, the modified file is used.  You can put anything you want in a header.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you meant to ask "What should headers do?" or "what should headers contain?"
