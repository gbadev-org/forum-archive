    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is something I just made up, I wonder if someone else thought of the same thing. If all three players know each other, they could conspire to win too much money by making continuous 3-way ties all the time. At Final Jeopardy, each player should bet the difference between their score and the lowest score of the 3 players (the player with the lowest score will bet zero). And then everyone will write down "?" as their response. Everyone will end up with the same score, and all will be on the show next time, and the next time after that, and nearly forever (until one or more players get zero or negative before Final Jeopardy, or if the host figures out the conspiracy).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah but the problem with this is that Jepordy most likely have people following the players around the place or even bug them.
<br/>
<br/>
I would go on knowing stuff personally then play Jeporday. It is not really that hard. Some the questions I tend to know. We would have to practice together and then do thing your talking about. We could study and then have our own network jepardy and fly down and play.
