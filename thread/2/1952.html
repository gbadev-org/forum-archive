    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What exactly does Nintendo provide for licensed developers?  ie.  Do they recieve a special compiler?  Special libraries?... Special Emulation environments?  IDEs? .. I am assuming all of the above... just curious.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as I know, you have to buy the Devkit after you have been promoted to licensed developer. You can choose to develope your game with other things that their kit, you can use DKA, ARM SDT or maybe even Dragon Basic (dunno).
<br/>
The Devkit should include a lib, a compiler, some examples, and some other stuff... I don't really know very much about it, but I'm sure about the lib thing.
<br/>
Basicly, the SWI function is a lib too...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know the exact contents of the devkit, but it contains a version of GCC (2.9x?), and a stack of libraries. Also, there is special test hardware available, really techie flash card (big green slabs with chips on 'em!;). And there is a version of the ProDG debugger available for the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
It will be a little more "official" than ie. devkit advance and will have an extensive help, but that's about it I believe.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What about the Nintendo GCC sources? Where are they? It seems like some licensed developers would release them... Or could Nintendo somehow revoke their license.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know what the libraries are released under? Do you get the source with them?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,

I'd assume that Nintendo's sources aren't very deeply patched; otherwise, somebody would have already leaked the source code, which is expressly permitted under the GNU GPL.
