    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been looking through quite a few historical posts on the forum, particularly in the Help Wanted/Offered sections. I was hoping to post my own request for help, but decided that it's still a little too early yet and there's plenty more to be done on my own game before including anyone else.
<br/>
<br/>
I wondered if this is reason so many games appear to dissolve into the ethers - is a big team assembled too early, people get impatient and move onto other projects, games are only half-done and presented to others to early etc?
<br/>
<br/>
There are quite a few posts along the lines of "this is a serious game and you'll get paid when we find a publisher" or "I've everything worked out and just need a coder and sprite artist to fill in the details."
<br/>
Yet none of these games have come to fruition - or have they?
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone completed a collaborative game yet?
<br/>
Is there a thread, charting the progress of development, and a link to a final game anywhere?
<br/>
<br/>
Just curious.......</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There was another one, I think. Some kind of driving game.
<br/>
<br/>
Projects going by the wayside is the standard for these sorts of efforts. It's no different than forming a garage band or a comedy troupe or a demo team. People grow up, get busy with other stuff, and move on to bigger, more exciting projects that never get done. 
<br/>
<br/>
I know, I've been there many times. ;)
