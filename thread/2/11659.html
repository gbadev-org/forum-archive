    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wrote this a few minutes ago partly as a joke, but also to spread the truth about chain mails. So if anyone here gets this message, please let me know and also smile at the joke of it.
<br/>
<br/>
If you do get it and choose to forward it, then please change it for this one because I just added, "(to one of their other accounts for obvious reasons)" and the end line. If not then I would just suggest not to send it so that you can have the chance of recieving it. You've got to laugh though, it is funny.

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>The email wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">This is a <span style="font-weight: bold">warning to all people who forward their chain emails</span>. Most people are unaware of <span style="font-weight: bold">why there are so many chain emails created</span> . There are so many about <span style="font-weight: bold">phantom msn users </span>who they claim will add you and send viruses to all of your contacts. <span style="font-weight: bold">None of this is true</span> , there is no way someone can do that just by adding you - and if it was true they can still log in with a different user name anyway(duh). And then there are those that tell you your account will be closed if you do not forward this message - <span style="font-weight: bold">again this is not true</span>. They know that you are using your account because you have logged in.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic"><span style="text-decoration: underline">So what is it all about</span></span>? It is just to <span style="font-weight: bold">get your email addresses</span>. What happens is that eventually the message gets forwarded back to the person who created it (to one of their other accounts for obvious reasons) - with <span style="font-weight: bold">a list of many email addresses</span> who it was forwarded to. Now you imagine that chain mail can come back to the same person countless times with different lists of emails - this is why they are created. Because of this they now have more email addresses to spam, including yours, and <span style="font-weight: bold">you don't even need to have forwarded or opened the message to get added</span>. Just having someone send it to you somewhere down the line, and from the same set of people it eventually gets back to the spammer, <span style="font-weight: bold">you are now on their list</span>. So beware when forwarding chain messages and know the purpose of them, and not to forward those phantom virus and account closure warnings.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Please copy and paste this to all of your friends (in a new email) to warn them of the truth of chain mails.</span></span> Do not forward as it will contain your mail address.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My one is just past 1000, but in the email it contains each of those, plus the 30 or so people that they sent it to. It is amazing how these emails can be used to collect email addresses.
