    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered a Datel SD Media Launcher 1GB (for my GameCube, sadly, I updated my Wii to 3.0, but I don't care, I'll wait for real Wii homebrew).
<br/>
<br/>
I want to know what (besides emulators) is available, one thing I'd like is a video/audio player that could play files off the SD card (or, when/if I get a Broadband Adapter, network shares), or a mini-DVD (but I'd really prefer SD).  And if miniDVD, it'd have to be +R since my DVD burner is a DVD+RW, not DVD+/-RW or DVD-RW.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else use Gamecube homebrew?<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

<br/>
There is a media player program that is able to launch Divx files threw the PSO thingy.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if this is correct but there is also the top lid loader where need to mess around with the GCN top lid. I think Gbatemp.net has a link to a store that sells the top lid kit but the origianl admin over there knows tons of info about this stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
I think you would need to upgrade your GCN with an entirely diffrent laoder chip. The GUI will give you the options to load 
<br/>
<br/>
DIvx
<br/>
DVD
<br/>
GCN
<br/>
dol
<br/>
<br/>
and so on. However the probelm with playing a DVD in a regular GCN is the GCN drive motor will be working it's brains out just to load and play the video.  
<br/>
<br/>
The SD thing basically replaces the PSO trick thingy.
<br/>
<br/>
Also the GCN has been successful running linux ( of course so has the dramcast that literarily states you can run Windows Ce on it ).<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I don't want to actually mod my console, just run stuff off the microSD.  Most of the emulators and the GC Quake port say they run from SD, but it looks like media players (the only I've found is the GC Linux MCE) only work from a network or DVD, though they said you could use a miniDVD without hardware mods.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, does DevKitPro work on the Cube?  There's some example GC projects in there.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

The devkitPro Updater allows the installation of devkitPPC, which targets the G3-derivative CPU in the GameCube console.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
