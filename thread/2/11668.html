    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm, that's an odd one. So they accept votes from people who have not seen the film. Well I guess we could rate it on it's trailer.
<br/>
<br/>
But whether or not we see the whole film, voting for one film more than another (i.e. voting for only this film) indicates that you think it is better than the other ones. So what difference is seeing it; what you are pratically saying is that I've seen this and like it, therefore it is the best.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it is odd. i don't believe in it as a system. it sort of says that, 
<br/>
a) you have to have seen all the films, which no one can do cos some of the program clashes, and 
<br/>
b) that all the cinemas have the same seating capacity. 
<br/>
so completely floored. 
<br/>
<br/>
it's the only festival i know that does it this way, and it's the first year at cardiff where they've ditched the panel and gone solely to audience votes. the panel system is better by a mile because they normally have respected industry members on them and you feel proud to win. this one everyones getting there mums, dads and grans to text in and vote.
<br/>
<br/>
what i'm doing is pr for our film - you can vote for any film on that list, all i'm doing is making you aware that they can vote for my film, or any other.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.holbrooksfilms.com" target="_blank">www.holbrooksfilms.com</a>
