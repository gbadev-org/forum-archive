    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do you post the source to your games along with the completed  games or do you just post the games, keeping the source and coding secrets to yourself?

<br/>
and why do you do it?

I'm just curious what's everyone's perspective on this, especially on the homebrew area where it's not like people are losing their jobs over revealing their code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I always include the source to demos and tools I make. It seems like such a waste to be so secretive if you're not planning to make any money off of it anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
If the source is available, then it provides an example for new people to learn from, or experienced people to improve on. New people means more cool demos to play with, and improvements mean I don't have to do the work myself :)
<br/>
<br/>
I guess the worst that can happen is someone makes a few changes and claims it as their own, but that doesn't cause me any trouble so I don't really care.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That depends on the project in my case. I have released two base libraries under OS: one is a core/system/tools library and the other is a simple portable graphics engine.
<br/>
I don't mind putting those available, but I wouldn't publish the source of games I make.
<br/>
<br/>
I have ported the first lib completely to the NDS and probably soon also to PSP(I just got one for free :D). I am 50% finished with porting the second library to the NDS and might then make a PSP port.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Why wouldn't you release the source to the games you make?
<br/>
<br/>
Don't want people taking it, changing it around a bit for their own game, then giving you no credit? :-)
<br/>
<br/>
As for my opinion, I'm more inclined to share the source openly if I really like the result of the program and it is somewhat readable, 
<br/>
otherwise I'd feel kind of embarrassed letting others see my sloppy work, or worse yet, have them comment on poor programming techniques.
<br/>
<br/>
But if someone asked for source or help, I'd let them go right ahead.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, that's one reason. Also, because people might be able to make hacks and cheats more easily and because the game becomes commercially unattractive. Of course I'm not saying that there are big commercial opportunities, but even if the chance is 1%, it's still worth keeping the source scret, considering the other arguments.

Ok, that's fair: If someone asks me parts of code of the game, I might send it personally(depending on who's asking what). Of course you can see the difference with just putting it all publicly availalble on a website :)
<br/>
<br/>
I like open-source a lot, as long as the benefit of the other people is bigger compared to the benefit for me keeping it closed source.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
