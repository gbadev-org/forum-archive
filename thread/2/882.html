    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been thinking about the word sprite for a while. Whatecver does the word mean? It being the actuall word sprite that in the dictionaries translates as fairy/elf seems rather far-fetched in my opinion, even though one could see a connection, with some imagination. Or is a short form for something?

Anyone who knows?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
