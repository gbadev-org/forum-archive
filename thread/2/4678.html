    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are so many ways to judge a game or demo. It can be cool because it's fun to play, it can be cool because of the technology that drive the game, it can be cool because you've managed to do an entire game by your self..
<br/>
<br/>
I think there are quite a lot of hobby developers like me that are really excited when they've managed to finish something and in the heat of the moment they really can't see the actual quality of their work. At least not the quality that the player can appreciate, because the developer is being so proud of the code that run's the whole thing.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Everyone has to start somewhere.  When one first starts, one is proud of everything they do and want to release all of it.  As one goes along, one realizes that he (or she) is actually the one most interested in what they are doing- hence he (or she) is the one working on it.  It takes some experience to objectively judge whether or not what one is doing is actually interesting to others.  I believe that much of what one does should be withheld so as not to bore people with things that are ultimately trivial or outright boring.

Given that TOD is my own production, I had to make at least a token appeal to a neutral point of view.

Assuming that you don't want to appear blatantly arrogant, yes.  I think that modesty is a good thing.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well speaking from personal experience we would all like to get rich and published and blah blah blah.  For me though, and I beleive a number of other developers on the forum, the draw in developing is more of a personal/ego thing.  To be able to do something and can say proudy I did that.  I browsed through the site listed above and I think they are looking at things in a differnt perspective.  A game may suck to them but for me if I was interested in playing games I really wouldnt be spending my time tryinging to understand DMA.  A demo may bore on the outside but what I really look for is Gee.. how did they do that; and then disect their code and see how I can learn from it.

Okay.. so I'm preaching to the choir.. just felt I had to say something in defence. :)<br/>_________________<br/>- Microsoft SpellChecker has ruined my spelling ability.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
