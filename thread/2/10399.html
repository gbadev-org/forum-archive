    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm translating a game that was only released in Japan, and will never be released in English. It was a remake of a GBC game, and had better graphics and stuff. Since you can't run GBC cartridges on the DS, I was thinking that once I finished translating it then I could burn it to a sort-of "write once" GBA cartridge like the official Nintendo ones, for a relatively cheap price. I searched around but couldn't find anyone who was selling anything like this. Any suggestions? (Besides Goomba and Goomba Color)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I remember the days of pokemon. My cousin somehow managed to get hold of a japanese import of pokemon gold in Japanese, poor thing. Me on the other hand had a 50% complete translation at hand, although by then had no more interest in pokemon. But I am all for translations regardless of what the law says (when it is not available in your language).
<br/>
<br/>
If they didn't invest in a translation then they really can't moan about losing money which they never aimed to work with. Come on, what could be more noble than translating a game for FREE when you clearly don't need a translation yourself? (Apart from not doing the translation because of the law, that is noble too, albeit not the desirable response in my opinion ^_^)
<br/>
<br/>
I have missed out on many great games because of a lack of translation and any will to learn Japanese - although I did figure out the japanese required to play the namek saga of dragon ball Z - I felt very proud as I needed no book. So with me it is personal.

Yeah, I quite liked your animation. And the thread starter seemed to have no (no pun intended) objection to it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
