    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A while ago I started a thread to get people to donate money to get Tepples a new DS. It worked out well and Tepples got a new DS.
<br/>
<br/>
After the DSWifi bounty I now think it's time we all showed our thanks to WinterMute's great work on DevKitPro. That's right if your compiling code on DS chances are your using the hard work by WinterMute's DevKitPro.
<br/>
<br/>
Check out <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/why-donate.shtml" target="_blank">why you should donate</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Then make a donation by clicking the "Make a donation" button on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">this page</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Time to cough up folks, I've started the momentum by donating $20 US which is enough for "Dinner for the girlfriend and me at the local fast food emporium". So lets show our love for the man who makes DS homebrew possible!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But then so is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=chinese+currency&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" target="_blank">20 yuan</a>, but maybe the average wage is low where the<a class="postlink" href="http://www.polity.org.za/html/govdocs/reports/poverty.html?rebookmark=1" target="_blank">"median monthly income was much lower at R200"</a> - which means he could have been giving you half of his weekly earnings!!!

Which again is about half of the average weekly wage. So he is unlikely to be on 200 rands a month, but that does not mean that he is earning enough to give $20 ( R140) which is still a lot in that currency. And having a computer doesn't mean he's on the latest apple mac with a touchscreen and neon lights, he could be running on some refurbished cyrix MII at the library or college for all we know.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides 50 people giving $2 is much better than one giving $20. That R20 could have got someone a weeks worth of shopping!!! Instead he gives it to devkit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Even PayPal aren't going to take $80 in fees out of $100 in 50 $2 donations :P
<br/>
<br/>
Fees are around 3.9% + $0.30 which comes to around $0.38 on $2 so fees for 50 $2 donations would be $19 leaving $81 in the kitty.
<br/>
<br/>
For one $20 donation the fee would be around $1.08 leaving $18.92.

I'd like to thank everyone who has donated so far, every donation is immensely appreciated and helps keep devkitPro alive and well.

<br/>
One of the things I've been looking at for revenue generation is affiliate links which aren't performing well at all. Probably something to do with most homebrewers being skint students really.
<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of affiliates that pay for leads such as paid survey programs and a couple of student resource sites - these cost nothing to join so if anyone wants to help out a bit but has nothing to donate you could give those a try. I have a few gmail invitations going spare atm if you want a separate email address for the survey invitations. Send me a PM with your email address if you want one.
<br/>
<br/>
The links for those can be found at <span style="font-weight: bold">[Affiliate link removed (mods must follow the rules too) - ADMIN]</span>
<br/>
<br/>
The page is a bit of a mess atm, I'm still playing around with a format for the links.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

I guess I'm just saying I would feel cheap for donating a mere R20, since the effort involved in SA to get that done would probably be tremendous (A couple of years back I got something on an auction via eBay. Since PayPal doesn't support SA I had to do a direct cash deposit. The cost of the transaction was a significant part of all the costs involved. Not cool.)

Doesn't that all depend on which part of south africa you work in. I know people from Uganda (central east) who said that for a pound you can get a very big meal.

South Africa and Uganda are different countries. They're in pretty different parts of the continent. They're in pretty different economic and social situations.
<br/>
<br/>
Look, I'm not judging so much as simply stating that the actual costs of donating R20 in SA are more than than the R20 itself. Which means that you have to be a pretty dedicated donater or something. Or nuts.
<br/>
<br/>
Or rather, to put it numerically...
<br/>
