If there's a couple of gbadev dudz, maybe we could meet somewhere and have a chat :-)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That pictures BIG; I'll look at it when I'm on my BB connection. Anyways I'll be going this year. I went in 2002, but missed 2003 because I had already taken too many days off of work.

Pity we don't get free entry to PS Experience anymore (I don't think) :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, if you're visiting the EGN you do get free admission to Gamestars live, which is similar, I guess...? 
<br/>
<br/>
I think I'll skip ECTS this year due to the lack of publishers that exhibit there. For those interested: yes, I'm going after the publishers at EGN to try and get my GBA game published. Let's hope there is some interest for it!
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!
