    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well it looks like DS cart dumping/wireless cracking is progressing very well so I thought maybe some people might want to talk about the type of demos and/or games they're going to create for this bad boy.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is one idea that I had in my head since my mom is such a freak of this stuff:
<br/>
<br/>
Bingo. You can have a full-featured bingo game being played with an actual program list and it would have voice recognition, the numbers would be marked/dabbed/stamped/whatever you call it..with the touch screen. You could yell "Bingo!" into the mic and voice recognition software would actually understand it and halt the game to check your card.. You could have virtual people who are playing bingo in the game as well yell at you if you're making too much noise into your mic.. The number of people could depend whether or not on how high some games' numbers are..it could also depend on what time of day it is...Etc. You could have a standing ovation for someone who might be playing this game on their birthday, ..stuff like that. With wireless, two people could be playing the same bingo game and like, uh.. hmm..could opt to get into a street fight with the other? :P I dunno. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if someone can figure out how to access the two extra buttons on their GBA program when played through the DS, one button could toggle the backlight, the other could toggle which screen the image is coming out of? That was a simplistic idea..and what not.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any other ideas for games they may be interested in making on the DS, utilizing any of the features the system has?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Until Microsoft finally makes the Xboy, I'd guess that Rare can probably still produce games for Nintendo handhelds. I'd like to see a race of squirrels in an RTS; call it "Command &amp; Conker".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
