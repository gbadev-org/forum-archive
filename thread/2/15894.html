    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">@ blue_fire:
<br/>
<br/>
I know from experience with other "members" of this forum, that the more experienced people won't help anyone (you're lucky yellowstar did), as long as they see that you don't care (in contrast to: you try and fail - that's being understood) about phrasing and spelling your posts in proper English.
<br/>
<br/>
Deciphering gibberish takes time, and even though it might not take <span style="font-style: italic">much</span> longer to understand such a post, it's annoying and some (around here I guess it's <span style="font-style: italic">most</span>) people consider it a waste of time. If one has to put effort into reading a post to help the "poster", instead of the latter putting effort into the post in order to be helped, then something's really wrong!
<br/>
<br/>
So, buy not caring about your spelling, you practically demand that others, whom you want to help you, first but that effort into your post, that you should have put into it in the first place. Because this is off balance, most notable members won't care about you, at all.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you understand that and take this seriously, otherwise you won't have much fun around here. This is just an advise, you are free to do what you want, as long as you don't break the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9484" target="_blank">rules</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
And I really couldn't care less. You're not that special, really. There's a lot of people who think that correct spelling and phrasing is just required in school, but the reality is, that school should prepare you for life and those skills are <span style="font-weight: bold">demanded</span> in real life. The more gibberish you write, the more you get accustomed to it and the higher the possibility of developing problems with correct spelling, due to "anti-training."
<br/>
<br/>
When people tell you to write properly, that doesn't mean they are too stupid to read and understand your posts (some h^z write nonsense with their nonsense 1337 spelling, too and that's even worse!), but that it simply looks as if you <span style="font-style: italic">couldn't</span> write properly and use that "style" to cover that weakness.
<br/>
<br/>
You know what they say "only stupid people do stupid things." I guess due to common sense (and logic), a rather intelligently looking post doesn't imply stupidity, it's the stupid one that does, right?
<br/>
The mostly intelligent man can adjust himself to understand the stupid man most of the time, but the stupid man will just be stupid.
<br/>
Please, don't try to look stupid.
<br/>
<br/>
Give it a thought. I'm trying to help here. If you have problems with spelling (which does not mean I do assume that), just write it and I am sure everybody will be fine with it, as long as you <span style="font-style: italic">try</span> and give your best to write clear and structured posts.

Anyway, silent code's got a good point. School is there to set you up for the real world - they're not doing it to be arsey. For instance if you have to write to your bank you're n0t g00n4 rite lik th!s are u? They'd drop the letter in the bin in a flash.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, please remember that for many of the people on this forum, English isn't their first language. You don't want to exclude them from helping you by obfuscating your question by writing like an idiot. If I have problems understanding you then what will they think?

No, most people on the Internet does not speak l33t - they are your mothers and sisters, watching youtube-videos and using Facebook.
<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I find trying to read your (other, non-"l33t"-speak) posts to be quite tiresome, as I constantly need to scan sentences to find where it's supposed to end. Punctuation gives the eyes rest and helps the brain grouping words into sentences, making it easier to grasp the context of each word. Ultimately, it just makes it easier for people to help you. You don't need to struggle to get everything correct, just try to put SOME punctuation in there and you'll see that people are more willing to help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, <span style="font-style: italic">maybe</span> in <span style="font-style: italic">some</span> web communities everybody writes like that.
<br/>
Though, one could imagine a sign in front of such places, saying "u h4v 2 b @ <span style="font-weight: bold">|v|057</span> d4t b16 2 n7r" (= "You have to be at most that big to enter." indicating that only kiddos are allowed. And maybe those poor mentally underdeveloped souls. Now I feel bad for mentioning that.) ... err, now I feel stupid... I even wrote stupid wrong two times after that horrible "string of internet lingo terror." Brain hurts.

No really, it depends on what dark corners of the net you go to, because most of the places I visit feature proper language use. Mostly, because typos happen to everybody and sometimes d3m h^z (= hexorz) and trolls will leave brain damaging comments. ;^)

Knowing when to use certain kinds of communication is the key here. Using web lingo as a regular mean of writing and speaking (HOLY ... POOP-op-op - HEAD SHOT!) is definitely not a sign of such knowledge.

Maybe it will be more like that: In order to defeat idiocracy, the few remaining intelligent human beings created the machines.
