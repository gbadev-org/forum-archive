Can I just burn a 8 cm DVD and use it in the GameCube?
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, with the help of a volatile firmware extension as the DVD Interface driver currently does. This extension makes the GameCube DVD drive interoperable with DVD-R media as of today. The firmware extensions are not permanent and disappear as soon as the drive is reset. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
What does it all mean?
<br/>
<br/>
Do I gather correctly that a "firmware extention" allows a dvd burning drive to write to a GC disc in the right format to be played?<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

This is nice; but at least with the PS2 it is partly supported by sony and has fairly good documentation; and even a system that you can buy with all of the extras that make it homebrew ready.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The PS2 Linux kit is sold out, and it requires an original form factor PS2, which is also sold out.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
