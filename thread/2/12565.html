<br/>
<br/>
If your program has both a GUI mode and a command line mode, then when the program is opened in GUI mode, keep a list of the equivalent command-line functions that the player can open and copy into a batch file.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Mac OS classic versions 7 through 9 supported something very similar. A developer would refactor an application into a front-end and a back-end, connected by high-level events routed through the system's event manager, and the back-end would expose an <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleEvent_Object_Model" target="_blank">event object model</a> to script interpreters. An app could call an event manager function to record high-level events, and the event manager would output a script in the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript" target="_blank">AppleScript</a> language that would generate the same high-level events. Running this script in the AppleScript interpreter would replay what the user did.
<br/>
<br/>
Mac OS X's Cocoa toolkit has even deeper support for back-end object models and AppleScript programming.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It depends on the object models that the apps support.
<br/>
<br/>
At one level, there is "Click at (x, y), click at (x, y)".
<br/>
At the next level, there is "From the first menu, choose the fourth item".
<br/>
At the next level, there is "Save the document". The existence of a "document" that can be "saved" is part of an object model.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
