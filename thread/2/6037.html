You have to be an old company in the videogame business to be considered by Nintendo?...

Plenty of publishers and developers will be interested in you if you can create quality GBA games and you know what you're doing and have experience.

They will be registered with Nintendo to create games on GBA, so you won't need to be.

Where did recent university graduate come from? Is funkaster one?

Anyway ... I guess it comes down to stratagy.

<br/>
Ensure you can survive on low income for a long period of time while you gain experiece developing games for yourself. Keep learning and gaining experience. Sacrificing short term benefits (like having a disposable income) for long term pay-offs.
<br/>
<br/>
Staying determined and focused on your long term goal but make sure you're also enjoying your time in the here and now.
<br/>
<br/>
That's what I think anyway.
<br/>

In reality however ... I think anyone would find it a hard slog and have moments when they question the wisdom of the path they've chosen.<br/>_________________<br/>Qwak - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk</a> | Forum - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk/forum/" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk/forum/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm in my last year of being a CS undergrad (finishing this Fall), and I've taken a good salaried position doing other software development and general IT work at a new company. In my free time I am advancing my game development skills. In a lot of ways my professional and hobbiest experiences are balancing each other out.
<br/>
<br/>
It is definitely easier to get a job and gain professional development experience in non-game dev areas. I highly recommend finding work if possible doing anything related to software development (or graphic design if you are an artist). You can work on your other projects in your free time. I have found that I probably want to stick with my present career path (I'm at a really good company) but I am still working on games because 1) they're fun, 2) it's great practice in low-level computing topics, and 3) you never know when you'll run into an open door at a good game company.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That blows, I wonder if it's an Indiana thing. Over here in Connecticut I have had my choice of jobs without much effort, and I have low grades at a public university, only network admin experience, but well-presented extracurriculars. I actually put one of my game projects on my resume, in addition to some other "fun" stuff; just listing all kinds of geeky things made me a shoe-in, I suppose.

<br/>
That's illegal in some states. It's only reasonable that you sign over rights to the work you do that meets the following criteria:
<br/>
1) On company time
<br/>
2) With company resources
<br/>
3) In an area of industry in which your company engages
<br/>
<br/>
IP laws and restrictions vary state-to-state, but no one should force you to sign over the rights to stuff you do in your free time, especially when it's unrelated to your company's business. I actually saw somethings at one interview that seemed questionable, and I made it clear that if I was hired I might need certain clauses of the IP agreement changed. Put your foot down on something like that and a smart manager will respect you. Don't work for the other kind.
<br/>
<br/>
That's too bad you've had less than receptive experiences. The other part about getting hired is how you find out about the job. I have never gone with newspaper listings, I only read them to gauge the hiring climate. I got my 2 of my last 3 jobs by meeting people by chance and seizing the opportunity to express my interest in their work. I'm not perfect, I also lost a few chances when I didn't present myself very well. I don't think you need to be well-networked either. I also got an offer that stemed from walking up to a company at a job fair, which placed me in a pool of about 50 interested persons. I noticed an A+ on my resume and it could only be from my extracurriculars, and I pointed my interview tactics on "being challenged" and "interesting work."
<br/>
<br/>
I have also tried professional organizations (ACM, IEEE, IGDA), and I haven't even been a member at some events, they still welcomed my attendance.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and as for getting turned down as a cashier, ouch. Over here you'd have to be really weird to NOT get a job in retail. I worked nights working backstock at Target one semester to pay the tuition. Truck unloading, climbing 15-ft ladders, lifting 80lb boxes off 20-ft stacks... Ugh.

That's how applying for a job goes.  I <span style="font-weight: bold">hate</span> job hunting.  Holding a job is easy.  Finding one is a royal pain.  Potentially more effort is needed than holding a job, and it's unpaid!

Read above post on this one.  A relative of mine is very fussy about the contracts he signs, but then again, he can be.  If this is your only offer, take the job because money and experience are good, but keep looking.  I'm not sure that clause in enforceable.  Chances are you can probably do your own thing in you free time and not worry about.
<br/>
<br/>
Is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.roberthalftechnology.com/" target="_blank">Robert Half Technologies</a> anywhere in your area?  I'm not sure how, but before I left for Japan a Robert Half recruiter managed to track me down.  I signed up with the service and then left the country shortly after, so nothing came of it, but it might be worth a try.
<br/>
<br/>
They might have something in your area, but in general, to get a good salary you have to be willing to go where the money- ie relocate.

Anything.  Try a simple platformer.  Try a simple zelda style game.  Forget graphics if you can't find an artist.  You can always add art later- pilfer or use solid colored blocks or simple shapes.

Can you sign up with Robert Half on line?  You'll need to show up once for an in person interview, but after that it's a matter of waiting (hoping) for a placement.  I'm not too impressed with job introduction services and temp agencies, but it's better than nothing.  If you are unemployed and living with your parents, it's possible that they'll drive you to Indianapolis if it might mean a job.  I have not met them, so I don't know, but it's worth asking.

<br/>
If unemployed how can you afford not to?  If you are lucky the company will pay for you to relocate.  If not, I think your first month will cost something like:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">2 * rent</span> (first and last month) <span style="font-weight: bold">+ greyhound_ticket + food * 30</span> (days) <span style="font-weight: bold">+ misc</span> (suitcase, if you don't have one, etc)
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what those figures will run.  You might need to borrow the money before you move, but chances are, you can pay off the expenses of moving after one or two months of working.  After that it's money in your pocket, or toward you student loans or whatever.
