Provided you copied them from a disc that you own, yes. Making and running backups is not infringement per 17 USC 117(a) and foreign counterparts; it just happens not to be what gbadev.org is about.
<br/>
<br/>
Provided that the games have been released as freeware by their authors, yes. But most of the stuff on <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_of_the_Underdogs" target="_blank">Home of the UndARRdogs</a> isn't.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

But mario bros is still being sold today. Many good games simply aren't available. I've even had trouble fishing around in shops for recent games, and store owners just turn around and tell me how rare that game is now. Having said that I did see a boxed copy of gunstar heroes.
<br/>
<br/>
But suggesting the availability of these old games is almost like telling &gt;<a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banned_films#Malaysia" target="_blank">these guys</a>&lt; that they can legitimately watch their movies <a class="postlink" href="http://www.skyscanner.net/" target="_blank">elsewhere</a> ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If the copyright owner wants copies of old games to become collectors' items, that's the copyright owner's prerogative under typical copyright laws throughout the world. Not that I agree with it or anything...

I can't remember if it was for the commodore or the spectrum, but there was a house phone released recently that featured much of the catalogue of that console by the manufacturers - at least I think it was a phone.

But nothing beats waiting for your game to load while the console performs its randomized synth orchestra ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On the title screen it says "capture the flanges, avoid the swirlies"
<br/>
The flanges are the blue stars, if you touch them, your capture count increases by one and they emit blue dots that are irritating but harmless. Great, now I need to play that again and try to break your records :P
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: 1 Minute 30 Seconds, 40 Captures. To get 80+ Captures in less than 2 minutes is pretty masterful (and probably very lucky on the flanges' placement).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Doesn't abandonware mean "I won't take you to court, but I could"?  The answer is that downloading and playing them is probably technically illegal, but nobody (or very few companies) are going to care.
<br/>
<br/>
If a company goes under, or an author dies, and nobody explicitly inherits their work, what status does it have legally?

Corporate author goes bankrupt: Copyright is sold at auction.
<br/>
<br/>
Individual author dies <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestacy" target="_blank">intestate</a> (that is, without a valid will): Next of kin inherits the copyright.

Joint author dies intestate: I'm guessing that the other authors inherit the decedent's share of the copyright.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
