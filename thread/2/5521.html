    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, I've got a dead pixel. It's near the center of the top screen. I see it in my dreams... mocking me.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, has anyone had any luck with getting a replacement DS if you have one with dead pixels? Should I return it to where I bought it (Best Buy) or contact Nintendo for support? Any ideas would be welcome.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just take it back, exchange it and check the replacement has no dead pixels before leaving the store.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got the same problem (including the nightmares part), A friend contacted nintendo of sweden and they told him that they did not want to have anything to do with japanese units. Bought mine at liksang...
<br/>
<br/>
My brother bought a unit at a localstore and it had ridiculosly 7 dead pixels, they gave him a new one though. 
<br/>
<br/>
I could probably buy another ds here locally swap the units and labels with the help of a hairdryer and then ask for a replacement ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Perhaps they can just change the screen for you?
<br/>
Would probably cost you a little, but probably less than the shipping to and from lik-sang.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you don't mind giving Nintendo your credit card number, their exchange policy is very nice.  They ship you the new DS immediately, then give you about a month before they make you ship the defective one back.  It's a great opportunity to try out Pictochat and other multiplayer games if you don't know anyone else with a DS. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo has a great replacement policy for dead pixels.  Even Alienware doesn't have such a generous replacement policy when it comes to dead pixels on their laptop LCDs.  The prior will replace your system no matter what the fault; the latter requires the pixel to be (what they consider to be) within the center region of the screen for replacement.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is definantly within the center region of the screen, its almost exact dead center. And it's wierd, when I first start playing, it looks fine, but over time it gets lighter and lighter until its white all the time. Bizarre.

Guess I'll be giving Big N a phone call...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
