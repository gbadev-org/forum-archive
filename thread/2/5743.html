Anyway, about 3 months ago i was surfing the internet, like you do and stumbled across and modded gba. it did not have a afterburner installed but instead the person used simple white leds in each corner of the screen. this is much cheaper so therefore a better option. does anyone know of this or similar sites as i seen to have missplaced the address.
<br/>
<br/>
does anyone who of any GBA mod sites?<br/>_________________<br/>.: I Create My Future :.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The result won't be as good as a real afterburned kit or even the GBA SP backlight...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>
