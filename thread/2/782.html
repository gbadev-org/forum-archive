    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Let me try to translate what spankmonkey is asking into coherent English, along with my best guesses at the answers:
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Would it be possible for a homebrew developer to publish a game commercially on the Game Boy Advance platform?
<br/>
<br/>
A: YES, soon. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.freelancer-games.com/services.htm" target="_blank">FreeLancer Games</a> will manufacture GBA ROM cartridges holding 1 to 4 megabytes of data, along with printing manuals and boxes and selling the games through an online store.
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Would it get on Nintendo's corporate nerves?
<br/>
<br/>
A: YES. Nintendo doesn't want to lose its position as the monopoly manufacturer of GBA Game Paks.
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Would Nintendo have any grounds to sue a homebrew publisher?
<br/>
<br/>
A: REPLY HAZY. Independently publishing a console game in the United States, including reproducing the header's logo data, has been ruled lawful in <span style="font-style: italic">Sega v. Accolade</span> (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.virtualrecordings.com/sega.htm" target="_blank">read the opinion</a>), but <a class="postlink" href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/1201.html" target="_blank">17 USC 1201(a)</a> has been enacted since then, and Nintendo may be able to claim in court that the logo check is an "access control measure". It depends to a great extent on how the <span style="font-style: italic">Lexmark</span> case (<a class="postlink" href="http://news.google.com/news?q=lexmark+dmca" target="_blank">Google News</a>) goes.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by tepples on Fri Mar 21, 2003 3:47 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This bugs me.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a software developer, and I've been playing games since my dad got a Coleco Telstar in '76, and a 2600 in '78. I've always wanted to have my name in a game on a console, but I'm in NO way inclined to be a game developer. It's something I'd like to do in my spare time. The only game I ever wrote was for the Atari 800 back in '84. That said, I've been toying with GBA programming the last few days and I have some ideas for games. I understand why game companies want to have authorized games on their systems, but I think that there's strong homebrew community for lots of platforms that put out quality products. A perfect example is the Xbox Media Center. There should be a way for Nintendo and other companies to allow homebrew users to publish games, or have a way for a publisher to pick the game up from a homebrew developer. Yes, I could develop it on the PC, but there's something special about writing a game for a console.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this homebrew distribution system works out.
