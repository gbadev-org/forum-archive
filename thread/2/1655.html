    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, i'm a native spanish speaker so you know there will be some things i may mispell (i think the word is mispell).
<br/>
<br/>
I want to mean, in a sentence, that if you want to get a cool job and therefore if you want to eat you must learn english
<br/>
So here we are:
<br/>
<br/>
"If you wanna eat, then english, you must learn it"
<br/>
<br/>
The finally "it" meaning the english language.
<br/>
Does that "it" screw up the grammar? does the finally comma so too?
<br/>
Isn't it how Yoda from Star wars talks like?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unlike Japanese or German, English doesn't really have a case system for nouns, so word order expresses most of the relationships among the nouns. Except for pat phrases ("This I like"), old-style exclamations ("What a good game this is"), and a few other exceptions, English rarely varies from subject-verb-objects order in main clauses. It's not really common practice to shift the topic to the front if the topic is the direct object ("English" in your main clause).
<br/>
<br/>
"If you wanna eat, then you must learn English."
<br/>
<br/>
And it's "misspell".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I was just talking about "wanna" with my father the other day.  (He is an ESL teacher.)  We use wanna when we talk, but it is not acceptable in formal English writing.  For example, if this is written on a piece of paper:
<br/>
<br/>
"I want to go to the store."
<br/>
<br/>
There is a good chance that I would read:
<br/>
<br/>
"I wanna go to the store."
<br/>
<br/>
Without thinking about it.  Technically speaking contractions should not be in formal writing.  (Contraction are things like "shouldn't", "I've", "couldn't", etc...)
<br/>
<br/>
One of my supervisors at work (from China) said that English follows certain rules with a hundred pages of exceptions.  Good luck in your studies!
