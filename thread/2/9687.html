    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My friend bought the MBV2 Cable form Lik Sang and no flash card, he read on the MBV2 FAQ page that it can load games into the WRAM or something like that stand alone with no flash cart.  Can some of you kind people out there on the net compile a list of games he can use standalone(he said he heard that PocketNES works standalone, but I'm not sure.) I made the same mistake too, it says so in my signature. HELP US!!!!!

Your Friend,

A_Username<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a cheepo, I sneek my own candy into the movies, I never buy videogames new, always used.  I bought the MBV2 cable without a flash cart, what are some games that are compatible with it without the flash cart?  Help a cheepo out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">These are called "multiboot games". <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#tod" target="_blank">Tetanus On Drugs</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/lu/" target="_blank">Luminesweeper (without music)</a> will work; <span style="font-weight: bold">[/yarr]</span>; anything else distributed as .mb or .mb.gba will work; a lot of programs under 200 KB should work; PocketNES will work with any .nes file that's 193 KB or smaller and uses a supported mapper.
<br/>
<br/>
Everyone else: This is your chance to plug your own or your favorite multiboot game. (EDIT: Or <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9722" target="_blank">discuss a possible multiboot competition</a>.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
