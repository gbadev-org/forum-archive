    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm in the process of starting a NES site (as described in the title). Just wondering if anyone is interested in giving me some suggestions of things to include in it?
<br/>
<br/>
My idea is to have a wide range of NES mods and builds like some of the NES-PC's and NES controller MP3 players etc.
<br/>
<br/>
The working title is 'NEStruction' (as in destruction, only with an N) and a slogan something like 'Why destruct it when you can NEStruct it'
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any ideas either about including things in the site, changing the title or slogan, then let me know.
<br/>
<br/>
You can see a simple version of the site <a class="postlink" href="http://nestruction.webs.com" target="_blank">here</a>. It only has my three builds so far, but others will of course be added later.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How about an online store where I can buy NES flash cards, even if they only support UNROM/UOROM? I'd love to have a SuperCard style device that takes CF cards and loads homebrew NES games into 256 KB of RAM on the NES cartridge.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have you ever seen a pre-JAMMA <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Vs._Series" target="_blank">Nintendo VS</a> (arcade) board?  The ROM chips are burnable and can be... burned and replaced.  (There is a custom chip that holds the palette).  The hardware is very similar to the NES.  (Excitebike was cool. =)
<br/>
<br/>
Is flash clearly the way to go?  Given that we are 20 or years in future now, what would it take to make NES carts with swapable ROM chips?  I don't imagine that we'd need more than one modern ROM chip.  How much would it cost to hire someone to design such a board?

Given the popularity of SuperCard compared to that of traditional GBA carts once SuperCard came out, I'd guess so.

You'd need to yank the (one or two) ROM chips off an NES cart, wire in sockets, and insert 8-bit NOR flash chips such as the 29F040. Anything 150ns or faster should work, but make sure it's 5.0 V compatible. You'd also need to build a programmer.

<br/>
The NES stored tile data in a separate ROM on a separate bus, which some cart boards such as UNROM and SNROM replaced with 8 KB of RAM. So you'd need one ROM chip for the program and one for the tile data.

You have to assemble it yourself though.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
