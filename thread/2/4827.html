    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't written a line of code since the Christmas break - nor written any more job applications, ho hum. I've been ill the past week so really didn't want to do <span style="font-weight: bold">anything</span> but am starting to feel better now and still can't bring myself to start coding again. I just know I had a slightly awkward bit of code to do that I was putting off to start with, I've forgotten a lot of the details of the code and just how I've laid everything out in the project. Sigh, I keep thinking that I'd started with quite a complicated project too and keep thinking of starting again with something like an R-Type style side scrolling shooter, which I might be able to turn out something playable more quickly - though I don't want to forget about the platformer forever.

So what do you all do when you're running low on motivation?<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">CanIKickIt(YES_YOU_CAN);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

S'true, I think I had sorta been doing that while I was putting off other stuff before Christmas. I've still got lots I could do to make my management of the GBA a lot better (Got some ideas for a class that will keep track of free space in VRAM and you just pass it what you want loaded). Unfortunately, even though I'm getting better I still looked through some code today and found it made my headache even worse and I just couldn't concentrate on it :(<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">CanIKickIt(YES_YOU_CAN);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sure.  Write libs to make things better.  Their scope is usually pretty clearly defined.

Unless it's for a job I don't do anything. If I'm not motivated to code I don't code. I've found it's much better to not actually write the code immediately when I get the idea. I just let the idea sit in my head for a while. Every now and then I figure out a new way to solve a problem for the idea, and if I find myself still thinking about the idea after a couple of weeks I'm generally so filled up with ideas on how to actually implement it, the implementation only takes a couple of hours, or days if it's something bigger.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I haven't played R-Type, but I have played Gradius. Most of those games take place in a long horizontal tunnel. The easiest way for enemy characters in one of those games to avoid walls is to look in its direction of movement, turn down if it sees ceiling, and turn up if it sees floor.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Because I'm sick (though some people could still take that to mean in the way I write my code). It's been a little worrying but the doctor said it was probably just a virus so I'll give it a while longer to clear.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">CanIKickIt(YES_YOU_CAN);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
