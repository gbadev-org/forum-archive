    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it bad form to let you know that, after Anguna, I've FINALLY released my next game? This time it's an Android game, Robo-Ninja, a difficult and twitchy metroidvania-style adventure.  <a class="postlink" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.tolberts.android.roboninja.android" target="_blank">It's free on the play store.</a> Give it a whirl and let me know what you think.

Maybe in another 7 years I'll come up with a 3rd game....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got the code all ready for an iOS port, but I haven't bit the bullet to pay Apple the $100/year ransom that they require.  (If the Android version ends up getting any reasonable amount of interest, I'll probably do the iOS version, but I'd have to charge for it probably).
<br/>
<br/>
I added a youtube video on the play store entry for the game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
