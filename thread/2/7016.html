<br/>
<br/>
i want to know if you have a gba game, developed using unofficial tools, VisualHam...etc what are the options of getting this into a publisher, hwta publisher to approach, or is approaching a publisher the best option? I know the game will not be released if not developed with  nintendo's SDK. what to do, what to do :) Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The same way you'd get anything to a publisher.  They could care less if make the game using Djinn's wish.  I suspect it's too early for you to worry about publishers.

Are you sure about this? Because that's not how I remember the Nintendo Guidelines. Although it was a couple of years ago I did any "professional" gba work.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For DS games you need to use the Nintendo SDK, as you have to use Nintendo's ARM7 binary because of FCC issues. But for GBA, all that Nintendo lot check is said to care about is that your game's .gba binary runs using Nintendo's flash cart, which isn't as tolerant of writes to ROM space as the chinese flash carts are. And the smaller it is, the cheaper it will be to manufacture (4 MBytes is better than 32 MBytes), and the more likely it will be that some publisher will consider your project.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
Touchstone, Im sure I read it somewhere that nintendo wants the game to be developed in official SDK, i could be mistaken. I am really not familiar with licenses. 
<br/>
<br/>
Tepples, Thanks for the tip that less space has its advantage in manufacturing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nintendo doesn't care all that muck (GBA) abotu SDKs or such, they care that you meet all their programming guidelines a cautions/warnings.  About the only thing you may have trouble with for not using their stuff is EEPROM writing utilities and RFU programming.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If your publisher wants the final build of your game to use a cheaper 64 kbit EEPROM instead of the 256 kbit SRAM more typical of homebrew projects, you'll probably get authorized as a developer just to adapt your program to use Nintendo's EEPROM access library.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
