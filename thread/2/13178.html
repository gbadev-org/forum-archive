The point is Nintendo hasn't censored games for age related reasons since the Snes days. On the gamecube, in fact, Nintendo was more open and allowing of violent/sexual content then Sony.  
<br/>
What did/didnt come out on Nintendo systems is purely due to userbase numbers. Mature titles actually normal sale a lot less then other games so the userbase of a system has to be large for developers to release them.
<br/>
<br/>
As for Games release, purhapes comparing Xbox360 to Wii or DS to PSP might be a better idea?
<br/>
<br/>
But, if you want to compare the DS to 360 
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 8px; line-height: normal">Xbox360;
<br/>
Bionicle Heroes
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Its very easy to make lists ""proving"" these things by selectively choosing games.
<br/>
One of the biggest saleing DS games is BrainTraining....which is appealing to the polar-opposite of the kiddy crowd.
<br/>
On the other hand, Nintendogs is a massive saler...so what does that tell us.
<br/>
<br/>
Bugger all :p
<br/>
<br/>
In reality game lists are nothing but userbase size and publishers whim.
<br/>
<br/>
Theres no such thing as a "kiddy" system unless the creator of the system is restricting releases or specifiably marketing it to make it so. (eg, Sega's old Pico machine).
<br/>
None of the big 3 are doing this, so there is no kiddy systems.
<br/>
<br/>

Every console maker since the NES has restricted releases using some sort of lockout chip. Nintendo specifically didn't want to see a glut of games published by smaller publishers take down the NES the same way they took down Atari's system.

<br/>
There will be a TON more games available on the DS that I can allow my son to play vs the 360.  I don't know about the PSP because I never looked at what was available as I would never spend that much money on "a toy".
<br/>
<br/>
When I went to the store, planning to purchase a 360, I looked over the games.. and I couldn't find anything for my son (2.5 years old) to play.  I've heard there are a couple of kiddy games available, but there are a lot more on the DS..<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. In the west nintendo advertise there systems as toys ( Since that is what it is )
<br/>
<br/>
2. In japan we make games for everybody or for children. Genrally we make the games fun enough for adults while children we have something challenging or vise versa. 
<br/>
<br/>
The rule is that you can't make a game depicting sex unless that is all there is and the meaning of that is we can't make games unless the sex is minimal ( then again this is not 1985 ).
<br/>
<br/>
3. The west especially Amerika is commercial games. Meaning stereotypes and controversy rule. Therefore Nintendo cut out things in there games fearing that people might label them something they are not.  
<br/>
<br/>
As with homosexauls, hatemongers, and even people who are misunderstood or who is victims. We all label them call them names, and try to find some reason to put them behind bars.
<br/>
<br/>
1.violence in videogames.
<br/>
2. People who play games get fat faster.
<br/>
<br/>
Short answer is yes. Nintendo promotes and make games gere towards younger audience but is also fun and respected by older auidence ven in the east. 
<br/>
<br/>
You can still go to Nintendo and promote your game idea reaurdless how crude it is but they might direct you to another studio that is under there name or is related to them.
<br/>
<br/>
Like with the Hellboy movie. The guy who created the ships in Atlantis was the creator of Hellboy ( I forget but is highly related to hellboy ) and he struck some sorta deal with them.
<br/>
<br/>
We all know Hellboy is not Disney material nore it is an original and I do not think Disney regaudless of his nature would aprove of Hellboy being under there name so Disney had a related studio work on this.
<br/>
<br/>
That does not mean you can also create games that could scambles a three year olds brain and create some sorta new slang. It just means Nintendo itself is towards a "younger" audience.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

    <h4>#132977 - HyperHacker - Mon Jul 02, 2007 10:24 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Comparing DS to X360 here is unfair for a few reasons:
<br/>
-Portables are generally expected to have fairly weak graphics and 2D games while consoles are expected to have ultra-realistic 3D graphics. The former is a lot less work, and companies just don't want to put a lot of work into a kid's game given its limited market. Handhelds always tend to get the silly kids' games, because they're simple games that wouldn't live up to the expectations of a console. DS is probably cheaper to develop for too, and I doubt these games have huge budgets.
<br/>
-DS is cheaper (and handheld, so it'll shut them up on long car trips) and Nintendo is known for durability, so a kid is more likely to have a DS than an X360. (This creates kind of an interesting spiral effect: another reason the kid more likely has a DS is that there are several kids' games available for it. This further influences developers to choose DS for their own kids' games, which further increases the number of them available, making it even more likely, etc etc.)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If people didn't know... basically it comes down to that it got an AO (adults-only) rating, and Nintendo refused to allow it to be published. I think it had something to do with the gruesome motion-controlled actions in the game.
