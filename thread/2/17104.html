    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a DS Lite and a DSi. I also have Mario Kart with practically all the cars/chars/tracks unlocked. I'm going to go buy another Mario Kart so that my son and I can play together. However, I don't want to have to replay the new cart exhaustively just to unlock all the stuff again. Ideally, I would like to copy my save info from my cart to the new cart. I found a couple obscure ways to do this (something about a blank GBA cart or the old GameShark product), but I was wondering about other people's experiences/knowledge on doing this. Can it even be done? If not, what about using Action Replay with some "unlocked" type cheat code and then proceeding to complete some simple level so the cart saves itself including the "unlocked" state?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by ritz on Tue Feb 09, 2010 5:50 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Got home from work and I tried Nitro Hax... exactly what I wanted. I picked the "unlock everything" type codes, put in the cart, played some random track to force the cart to save (and, as I suspected, all the extra stuff from the cheat codes saved too).

Perfect, thanks Chishm!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
