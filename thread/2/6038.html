    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndsdevkit.com/" target="_blank">NDSDevkit.com</a> have some nice kits at a cheap price, and I wondered if anyone had bought from them.
<br/>
<br/>
Are they safe? What shipping method is used? How long did it take for delivery?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would be careful of places that just popped up overnight. a bunch of people got burned when they tried to buy from alienimports.net who was just created to sell the neoflash, and then paypal froze their account due to 'possible fraud'. I think most everybody got refunded, but there's one guy who claims he never got his money back. I'd stick to retailers that have lots of good reviews in the Retailer Feedback forum</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've looked into it, and I got this from <a href="http://www.dspassme.com" target="_blank">www.dspassme.com</a> (the official PassMe homepage, am I right?)

<br/>
<br/>
So, that sounds as if they're certified by Lynx and Natrium 42, right?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm still a little uncertain, but the price is pretty damn good! $100 cheaper for the same kit!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are better quality carts than the neoflash/xg2, that are also cheaper. You can get a cart+passme for under 100$. <a href="http://kicktrading.ca" target="_blank">http://kicktrading.ca</a> has good feedback, and the EFA256 is decent, or look around for the EZ-flash 2 powerstar (another decent cheap one)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But what if I want to play the larger homebrew demos? I heard that XGflash/Neoflash carts were the only carts that allowed larger DS code to be played....
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I already have an F2A 256mbit cart, but I also heard that to run larger homebrew apps, you need at least a 512mbit card. Is this true?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm..  How to answer this.  Yes, I'm providing the PassMes to ndsdevkit.com.  Yes, it's basically the exact same thing as NeoFlash.  Yes, we all know why you want this combination of hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
No, you don't need that combination of hardware to play any HOMEBREW!  So, untill a hombrew program has been released that is over 256Mb, your current cart is fine.
<br/>
<br/>
I do have contact with the site on a regular basis as they have been ordering a lot of PassMes.  Last I heard, they were behind on orders, but they are shipping.
<br/>
<br/>

I didn't specify that I wanted to run certain code (wink wink) because of fear of the thread getting deleted.

That is, unless the limit on ROM size is holding someone back from producing a 31 kHz stereo version of GSM Player or something.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
