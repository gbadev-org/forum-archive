    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Living in the US, what is the best place to go (online, I imagine) to get a Flash Cart for the GBA (which I assume comes with the hardware to transfer images onto the PC and off).
<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't quite tell from the Feedback forum. :|</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've personally gotten hardware and related replacement cables through Jandaman's Import Videogame Accessories at jandaman.com. They've got a selection of different flash carts (most sites stick to one like glue) they ship anywhere, and stocks replacement EZFA cables when nobody else does!
<br/>
<br/>
99% of carts come with the hardware and software (some prefer to offer an online download for the most up to date software) required to flash your ROMs onto the hardware. Be careful though, from my experiences, cables and software aren't compatible between cards. Choose your card carefully, my son! o.o

<br/>
Failing that, you could try your luck on the old e-to-the-Bay.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Or, just move to China.  They're cheaper to buy in the stores here. :)
<br/>
<br/>
If I wasn't so lazy, I'd start buying them and selling 'em on ebay.  Of course, trying to deal with the post office here is another story.  It would help if I could speak Chinese.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
