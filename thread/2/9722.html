    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, if the GBA is dead in the eyes of developers and companys why do companys still make games for the GBA even thought the DS is out?  I, myself have a PSP but always notice the game commercials and it says the DS and GBA logo at the bottom. The good news is some people still make GBA homebrew I found like 9 people still finilizing their Atari 2600 emus.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a cheepo, I sneek my own candy into the movies, I never buy videogames new, always used.

Yeah, we should raise awarness about it, too bad you can't use MBV2 with DS. Let's host our own compo.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a cheepo, I sneek my own candy into the movies, I never buy videogames new, always used.

GBAMP v2 works fine with DS. A lot of people own a DS and a GBAMP v2 but don't own a SuperCard, M3, or NOR card. They can still use the compo results.
<br/>
<br/>
If we were to have a multiboot compo, would it be a good idea to have divisions for both CF entries (for GBAMP v2, SC, and M3) and non-CF entries (for MBV2, XBOO, NOR cards, and emulators)?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
