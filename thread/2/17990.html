Let's see, news about me. The wife is about to give birth to baby #3 in a week or so.  I'm finally getting around to making another video game (after taking a few years off after Anguna) I'm currently working on a cheesy little game for Android. You can read about it on my <a class="postlink" href="http://anguna-dev.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">development blog</a>.

2d game development on mobile phones is so easy compared to GBA, but I miss the smaller homebrew community. Those were fun times.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I still check in now and again :) And have a slightly active GBA project, too. I have such a hard time getting anywhere with solo game dev, I decided to make this one as easy for myself as possible... sort of FF1 style RPG. No strict technical limits aside from the GBA itself, but not going overboard on the production quality or length. And story written in the half-comedy style that comes naturally to me. Characters are based on my classic FF1 party of fighter, red mage, white mage, black mage :)

I am working full time on some interesting projects such as with the organization of the 2014 European parliament election. Only 4 months to go now! Also went back to university to finish a masters degree in Law at the same time :)

Awesome! It's been in the works for awhile, but I hadn't heard from them that they were that far along.  If all goes as planned, they'll be publishing the GBA version (now that I can't get blank carts anymore!), as well as doing a simplified SNES port (they've got somebody else programming it, so I don't know the details of how that will turn out).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I would note that the discussions of past years is a <span style="font-style: italic">great </span>treasure trove of knowledge.  Any ideas about making a comprehensive eBook about programming the GBA?  After all, the GBA is no longer the flagship console for Nintendo, so maybe they won't be too concerned?

Just updated my bASMic project yesterday, and probably should upload the update here.  It's handy if you're an electronics hobbyist, and want to control a small project with a self-contained development environment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Mainly doing html5 dev with canvas and javascript now, which also works on mobile devices. And sometimes I port a demo of such a project for the gba.
