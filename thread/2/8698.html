You need a Gmail account. Now that the Gmail invite spoolers have been shut down, how much does it cost to move to a supported country (which does <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> include Canada or the United Kingdom) and get a mobile phone in order to sign up?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had a shot at using that... seems a bit limited and pants... But if you're looking for <a class="postlink" href="http://mattcarr.googlepages.com/home" target="_blank">a quick project page</a>, it'll be dog-gone useful. And miles better than Tripod.
<br/>
<br/>
About the waiting list thing: I tried it from my GMail account, after accepting the terms, the thing burst into life straight away.

If anybody would like a invite to you-know-what so they can have a go with googlepages, PM me.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
