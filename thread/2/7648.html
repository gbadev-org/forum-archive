    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had an interesting thought the other day and was wondering how it would go over. You know how they have Open Source WikiPedias on the net? What about having one for GBA development? (If one exists already, let me know.) It would allow anyone with tips and things to add or reorganise a large and ever updating set of tutorials and information. I'm already looking onto how one sets a Wiki up, but I would like some feedback on the idea.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've had a jewel of luck. On my first searching attempt, I have found a very promising Wiki Space Rental Page. It appears to have no ads whatsoever, and judging my it's non-professional look was homemade. However, if I can get it to work easily and effectively, I'll use it. I'm thinking of making some guidelines to go on the frontpage, and then dividing the entire Wiki into sections such as getting started, Graphics, Audio, etc. My plan is to basically make it an archive of tutorials written by different people and compiler indifferent. That way, the information can stay up-to date with the latest stuff. Most importantly, if there's something not there that you would like there, you have the freedom to put it there yourself. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not touching it yet, not untill I've had about a week to think about it. However, if you think it's a good idea please by all means let me know now.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

<br/>
<br/>
The domain is gbadev.wikispaces.com
<br/>
<br/>
The site is brand new (obviously) so all the default stuff is still there and quite boring and useless. However, I've set it up so that only space members can edit the page. I did this so no one from outside would go there and f*** things up in the page. (pardon my asterisks.) If you want to be a space member and add stuff to the page, you need to do two things. (1) Sign up on their page. wikispaces.com . Then, PM me with your username and I'll add you to the space members section. I assume that if you have an account here, I can trust you not to like go in there and bomb everything. 
<br/>
<br/>
I ask only one favor: I want the front page. It will probably take me a little while to do, but I'll have the thing figured out over the weekend and put a nice front on the page.
<br/>
<br/>
If you PM me, I'll PM you back to let you know that you're added. Any objections or hate mail, this is the place to put it.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: BTW, I saw the nds page you set up. Nice job.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <h4>#62885 - thegamefreak0134 - Tue Dec 06, 2005 6:46 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have done some considerable adding to the site. Go take a look. One (1) member has been added to the site (keldon) and can begin adding tutorials/changing stuff. There is also a proper homepage, navigation, and instructions page. I have created General, Graphics, and Audio sections, and others can be added if necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to post in the sugestions section for an announcement to be made. I'll also see about adding images to the site, as this appears to be a black art of sorts. (if someone figures it out first, post here please.) 
<br/>
<br/>
Go check out the site. The service I picked is pretty dang user friendly, so it shouldn't be hard to figure out. Assume, when adding stuff and referencing to stuff, that all members will start out on the homepage. Also, please do not use the space for anything else. (IE, do not create "hidden" pages by not adding navigation and then link directly to them.) I <span style="font-style: italic">can</span> see a list of all pages, linked to or not, and will not hesitate to remove such pages.
<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to read the licence information and such. I think I put it under a free work licence, so make sure all the stuff you post is your own work, or is properly cited and such. Commen sense people.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to make any major changes, or feel anything needs to be added or changed on the home page or instructions page, please PM me first. A major change would be something to the effect of moving one tutorial to another more "appropriate" section.
<br/>
<br/>
Last, please do not change the bg color. If you really object to the color, talk to me. (like if you know the bg color of this site and want me to make it that.) We don't need a brand new color every time someone visits the site.
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun! I'll try to keep it organised as often as possible.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">EEEEEK!!! I am having serious issues here, and am very grateful for the holidays which allow me to post this. Our school has blocked this site from access. Worse than that, they labled it under the games category, and in my opinion if it's gonna be blocked it at least needs the dignity of being called a programming site.
<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, this presents a huge problem to me, seeing as how I can't allow more people into the Wiki without being able to check back here to confirm. I need to pass management of the Wiki over to someone else for the time being untill I can talk to our resident admin (small school and I'm on good terms with him too!) and get y'all un-blocked. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for volunteers. I'll give you organizer access to the Wiki (so you can manage users) and my username password so you can monitor. This should be a temporary gig, so help would be greatly appreciated. Oh, and one last note: I'm on vacation for 5 more days pending this post, so I need a response before then. Thanks!
<br/>
<br/>
One other possible solution: Look at the front page of the Wiki and you'll see the info for our netwrk filter. If you know how to hoodwink (bypass) this filter, please email me directions at my e-mail : <a href="mailto:thegamefreak0134@yahoo.com">thegamefreak0134@yahoo.com</a> . It's supposed to be the toughest though...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On a happier note, the first actual article for the Wiki should be ready to go after the christmas holidays. Since this is kind of a milestone thingy for the Wiki, I thought it should be mentioned. Keep an eye out for it in the graphics section.
<br/>
<br/>
On another happier note, the people at Wikispaces have updated their system, meaning that (1) the editor can do more and is hapier with pictures, and (2) you can update any kind of file to the Wiki. Those of you writing custom tools and such, you can upload them there. (go to a page, click the upload pictures link, and it will let you upload other files too.) I think the catch there is that you can't use it as storage, so it would be best to get them mentioned in an article first.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
