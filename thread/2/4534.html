Aha. I've been living on a narrowboat for a while (Tv reception is pretty poor, especially whenever another boat passes, or you get up and rock the boat while going to the lav/put the kettle on/stoke the fire).
<br/>
I moved back into the cottage with my girlfriend and have yet to get Sky working properly (and we don't get C5 on terrestrial telly. Dammit, we don't even get C4 - we get the Welsh S4C equivalent and it's rubbish) and when it's raining, we lose BBC2 as well!
<br/>
I guess that makes me more of a radio guy....

How dare they put 'Just a Minute' back on Radio 4, people have lives to live y'know (doesn't quite have the same ring to it does it??)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, Australia's especially bad for it ;)

Seriously tho, C5 is usually alrite through any cable service now, one of the better quality ones to be honest. Unfortunately I don't have cable.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">CanIKickIt(YES_YOU_CAN);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
