<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to thank the people who are responsible for this forum. it's just a really good idea.
<br/>
<br/>
Just a technical question : are the users' passwords encrypted on the forum server ? just in case it would be possible to use the same password on different forums like this one, without any risk ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">even so as I'm logged in, there is some times when I can't see what threads have new post in them, I don't get any kind of "orange file" icon, not a big neither a small with a arrow on...
<br/>
The only orange icons I get is in the forum index... but when I visit a section it doesn't say I have any unread posts!<br/>_________________<br/>*Spam*
