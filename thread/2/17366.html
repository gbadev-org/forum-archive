Well... luac worked and I feel really stupid.  I thought I tried that.  =P

I noticed that too.  They don't compress as well either.  Presumably the precompiled scripts are faster, but I'd be surprised if speed is your bottleneck.
<br/>
<br/>
Precompiled scripts can be really convenient.  You could compile your 100+ game scripts into a single precompiled bundle and load that.  Or you could compile common code into a base bundle and have a different control bundle for each stage.  Each of these bundles could have any number of source files.
<br/>

Presumably, with minimal fuss, you should be able to get all of this to run on iOS, Android, DS, PC, Mac and anything else you feel like porting it to.  =)  Also, Lua is a small language, so when it comes time to expand and utilize the division of labor, you should be able to hand your prospective scripter a book on Lua and then train them on the quirks of your specific situation.  /Lua rant</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
