    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was on the IRC channel tonight, and some StoneCyqh person starts tearing into we about being a 'warezer'.  Really ripping into me.  Kind of raised my blood pressure a bit :).  Funny how some guy behind a computer can do that to you.
<br/>
<br/>
Well anyways, he starts saying all this crap about how I steal from him and I'm a warezer and whatnot.  And I'm a pile of sh*t and all that. 
<br/>
<br/>
So he gets one of his friends who is a channel op to ban me.
<br/>
<br/>
I did get kicked out of there once about 6 months ago because I was in a roms channel.  I remember it almost to the day because I had just gotten back into GBA Deving and I was downloading commercial ROMs and looking at them in VisualBoy to see how they did certain things.  (Maybe that's a crime, but oh well.  I wasn't playing them.  I was doing research.  Besides I've got a bunch of GBA carts and PS2 games and whatnot if I want to play.  And who has time to play games anyways when you're making them.)  I learned my lesson, I guess, and don't do that anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
So anyways, that was like 6 months ago.  But this guy is on there telling all these lies, calling me every name under the sun.  Saying I was 'warezing' just the other day.  And he has the logs.  Well I said "show me these logs." and he says, "Shut up! We don't want your kind around here. I don't have to show you anything." Anyways, long story short, I got banned.
<br/>
<br/>
So I was just wondering, is that channel affiliated with this website?  There doesn't seem to be any attitudes like that around here, and I don't recognize a lot of the names from these forums in the IRC channel.  Oh well, I guess I can't go there any more.  But who wants to with folks like that there.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the rant.  Just kind of curious if anyone else has had any experiences like that on the #gbadev channel.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
PS&gt; I was in a really good mood too, because I had just gotten sound to work in my game.  So I went in there and asked if there were any public-domain sound effects that I could use in my game.  Oh well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You should have ripped those if you wanted to study them, rather than downloading random crap from the Internet.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is this guy named StoneCypher? For some reason I've seen that name before somewhere else, but I can't recall. He has an account on these forums, but he hasn't made a single post (taken from the member list as of this date and time).
<br/>
<br/>
Not to be rude, but if you're downloading stuff like commercial roms, then you would be considered a "warezer", even if it was for a good cause like studying them as you described. But since that was back in the day 6 months ago, we'll just push that aside and not talk about that.
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder...how would this StoneCypher guy know you were on a roms channel unless he were in it too? I've never been on any IRC channel before, so I don't know how it goes. If there is one thing I hate about people making such accusations like StoneCypher  made is that they are usually covering up something very similar to their accusations on others, plus I hate short, unintelligent, immature responses.
<br/>
<br/>
If you use the IRC for assistance in your GBA deving, just stay and post here. Although you won't get as quick a response as in the IRC, which I would imagine, we do try to help anyone who asks. All we ask for is enough information to go on to help solve the problem.

Does it make any difference? Besides not everyone at the time of wanting to rip their game has the equipment to do so.
<br/>
<br/>
I think people can take an idea a step too far in the wrong direction. I've bought a lot of games I did not like and returned them back to the shop by 10 day (mine allow you to do that). I <span style="font-weight: bold">really</span> cannot see the financial, or logical differences between me downloading them and erasing them after 10 days, especially if I was to rip the game while I had the cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course there are people who buy games and complete them within 10 days to return them, so that they end up with a free game. Those are the people who download games for free so that they don't have to pay.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In response to the subject, I believe BigRedPimp (BigRedPmp with EFNet nick constraints) heads #gbadev, but there are several other operators that have plenty of power over the bots.
<br/>
<br/>
StoneCyph has been on the GBA homebrew scene since the beginning; he's pretty respected in #gbadev. It's my understanding that he declined +o status to avoid all the associated hassles. Needless to say, if you quarrel with him in the channel, it's likely you'll be on the losing end. (BTW, DiscoStew, you may have seen his name on the Y! group or DS Wiki.) If your interested, his site was at <a class="postlink" href="http://sinistar.sparked.net/" target="_blank">http://sinistar.sparked.net/</a> but it appears that <a class="postlink" href="http://sc.tri-bit.com/" target="_blank">http://sc.tri-bit.com/</a> is his new home.
<br/>
<br/>
It is certainly the policy of the channel (and this site) to avoid all warez and stay strictly development oriented. Perhaps you could better sympathize with the policies of #gbadev if you understood the problems it has had with pirate channels and harassment. It's more than just a priggish avoidance of leechers.
<br/>
<br/>
NoMis and MumblyJoe, I guess you know about the two-strike rule? If not you can read about it in <a class="postlink" href="http://gbadev.tri-bit.com/" target="_blank">the channel rules</a>.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I am guessing by rule #13 that there is a way to check if someone is on a particular channel, like a warez channel, but isn't that going by a 2 strike rule? According to that, you'd have to be caught twice to be banned. How long do bans last? Forever? Or only a certain amount of time? If expos1994 had been allowed back in and hasn't been caught recently (no proof), why should he be banned from breaking the rules months ago? Unless you've been caught again expos1994, you shouldn't be banned again.

Perhaps some people go to such lengths to prove they are correct because they believe they are. As for you, I remember your "This conversation is over" attitude when you banned me a couple of times.

As for the length of the ban, the bans are cleared periodically, but if someone who bans you sees you again they will likely ban you again, hence the name/ident change.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

Even though ban evasion might not be in all server rules it is considered bad behaviour and many ircops will k-line you for it, which I fully support. Access to any channels on Eris Free is a privilege and not a right. If the operators of a channel doesnt want you in there FOR WHATEVER REASON it is their choice, not yours. If you dont like how a channel is run you should start your own channel (or /quit).
<br/>
<br/>
That being said, there is a reason why I am not in any IRC channels anymore :)
