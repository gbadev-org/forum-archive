    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Google only seem to let me upload certain formats, with a limit of 500kb.  The formats are .doc, .xls, and other office files.  That's pretty useless seeing as DS files are .ds, .ds.gba and .zip in sizes up to 3mb.  Thanks for the suggestion, though.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?cuyb10fzdz2" target="_blank">Strummer</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?71zxcztscix" target="_blank">Drummer?</a>.

Hmm interesting.. are you looking for a full site, or just file storage?  I can setup whatever.ndshb.com for your own site.  I don't know why you aren't receiving an e-mail from ndshb.com.  Let me know and I will do what I can.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I'm not sure what the problem with your Googlepages account is, but I'm able to upload tons of files to my Googlepages account, up to around 10 MB I believe.  I know you have a 100 MB limit overall, and I know there used to be a 100 file count limit as well, though I'm not sure if they removed that or not.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well my website I have on geocities is okay for now I will checkout the Googlepages when I get a chance. The thing is I need to link form mltiple storage points.

I think Angelfire has restrictions on hotlinking also.

If I was to start building and putting files up seriously I would go to dreamhost that has plans starting for 200 a year sometimes. I plan to move my webpage there to feature everything.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

For gba/nds homebrew I'd recommend either ndshb.com or dev-scene.com.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
