    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I realise this is a long shot but I'm wondering if anyone is aware of a GBA emulator which is capable of running on OS/2?  Are there any emulators with source available that might build succesfully on OS/2?
<br/>
<br/>
The reason I ask is that I'm submitting a GBA program I have written as part of an assignment to a lecturer who is a bit of an OS/2 zealot and I'm sure he would appreciate being able to review the assignment in his favoured environment.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by notb4dinner on Thu Jun 03, 2004 2:02 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

^ that is the page for a OS2 GCC compiler, but you would have to try out the source to see if it works on OS2, but there is no reason why it shouldn't - if the library is completely compliant.
<br/>
<br/>
But the emulator may use SDL, and I'm not sure what that runs on</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Or mabey even better; use the Boycott Advance Online emulator, which is an applet. I don't know much about it myself, but it just crossed my path... :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, when I used Boycott Advance (because of its great debugging features) I found out that it had some problems with, hmm, what was it... I think it didn't setup the stack pointers properly when switching between CPU modes in interrupts. Therefore I went to Visualboy Advance, which runs everything perfectly. So if you're using different CPU modes (with MSR calls) it might not work.<br/>_________________<br/>In a world without fences and walls you will never need gates and windows.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
