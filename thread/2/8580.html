    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, so I went to the Art Institute of Atlanta for visual and game programming. There I stayed for 3 quaters before deciding that the school was way to expensive for me. While at AIA I made a 3.9,3.8. and a 4.0. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now I have a full-time job and am atending night classes for 3d animation at a small technical college just for fun until I start my BS in CS. I am only getting a diploma where I am at now. It is by no means a good school and anyone can get in, so I just thought that I would learn 3ds Max and the school would be a breeze...... wrong! 
<br/>
<br/>
I am aceing my 3ds max class and my EMP100 class, but there is one that I am not..... freaking algebra. Now algebra was never that hard to me and I usually get math pretty well(had an A in geometry at AIA), but not in this class. You see, I haven't used it since early high-school and so I have to brush up on whatever the test is on. Well I studied and took the first test and got a 92, not bad. I studied and took the 2md test and got a 30.... wow how did that happen? Well the test was more advanced than the stuff she had us studying, so I told her that I couldn't have that messing up my GPA and was thinking of droping the class, but she talked me out of it saying that if I was a competent student then my grade would be alright. Well I studied and even went to my old high-school teacher to get tutoring for the next test which I took yesterday. I did fine in tutoring and got everything right, but low and behold I missed 3 out of the entire 5 questions..... that's right 5(who gives a five question math test?). Why? Because 3 of the 5 questions were stuff that we weren't told to study. To make maters worse the course is online and the teacher didn't assign us a book, we just use her notes.... which really suck at explaining anything and that's why I got tutored. Also, there are no homework grades only 5 test and a final all quater so failing 2 test is not an option. 
<br/>
<br/>
 Well I had to work and go to classes yesterday and didn't get home until after 11 so I planned on dropping the class this morning. Well, I just found out that yesterday was the last day to drop classes......... shoot me. I called the school and they won't let me drop it. DAMMIT! Now I don't know what to do. I am thinking about just not going back to any of the classes(the don't even have my transcript from AIA yet) and just starting my BS at a good school next quarter. I had to come consult with my online family.... what do you guys think? I feel better just talking about it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually I e-mailed the teacher and she is actually concerned so I retract any bad things I said about her. I just wish that we didn't get tested on thing what we didn't know to study.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
