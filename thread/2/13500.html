    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it really a GPL violation? I thought the GPL only required that if you distribute GPL'd binaries without source, the end-user has to be able to get the source through snail mail or the Web, as long as it is available for anyone to get.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm really "Anders1" but the forum would not let me register using that nick :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think I remember something similar.. Which was why WineX was being "sold" for $15 / month or something.. The source was available.. but good luck getting it to compile.  It met GPL because the source was available (in one form or another) but is/was basically useless.  So you "had" to purchase the precompiled binaries if you actually wanted it to work if you didn't have extensive programming knowledge to meet all the different (undocumented, if I remember) dependencies and manual settings.

Q - I want to distribute binaries without accompanying sources. Can I provide source code by FTP instead of by mail order?
<br/>
<br/>
A - You're supposed to provide the source code by mail-order on a physical medium, if someone orders it. You are welcome to offer people a way to copy the corresponding source code by FTP, in addition to the mail-order option, but FTP access to the source is not sufficient to satisfy section 3 of the GPL.
<br/>
<br/>
    When a user orders the source, you have to make sure to get the source to that user. If a particular user can conveniently get the source from you by anonymous FTP, fine--that does the job. But not every user can do such a download. The rest of the users are just as entitled to get the source code from you, which means you must be prepared to send it to them by post.
<br/>
<br/>
    If the FTP access is convenient enough, perhaps no one will choose to mail-order a copy. If so, you will never have to ship one. But you cannot assume that.
<br/>
<br/>
    Of course, it's easiest to just send the source with the binary in the first place. 
<br/>
My friend got a GPL-covered binary with an offer to supply source, and made a copy for me. Can I use the offer myself to obtain the source?
<br/>
    Yes, you can. The offer must be open to everyone who has a copy of the binary that it accompanies. This is why the GPL says your friend must give you a copy of the offer along with a copy of the binary---so you can take advantage of it.
<br/>
<br/>
Q - Can I put the binaries on my Internet server and put the source on a different Internet site?
<br/>
<br/>
A - The GPL says you must offer access to copy the source code "from the same place"; that is, next to the binaries. However, if you make arrangements with another site to keep the necessary source code available, and put a link or cross-reference to the source code next to the binaries, we think that qualifies as "from the same place".
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Note, however, that it is not enough to find some site that happens to have the appropriate source code today, and tell people to look there.</span> Tomorrow that site may have deleted that source code, or simply replaced it with a newer version of the same program. Then you would no longer be complying with the GPL requirements. To make a reasonable effort to comply, you need to make a positive arrangement with the other site, and thus ensure that the source will be available there for as long as you keep the binaries available. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

So basically, if jandujar did want to go this route, he would just have to have a copy of the source available for each version he releases.  But, I personally think this would be the least of his worries.  I think supporting something like this will be much more difficult than he thinks.  And if WinterMute puts a statement out that he will not support this project, and forwards all support e-mails to jandujar, I doubt it would be long before he closed the project because it would be to much of a headache.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
