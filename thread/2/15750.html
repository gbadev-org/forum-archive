    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was trying to add some stuff to my DS the other day, so I popped out the micro-SD I was using, plopped it into its adapter, and plugged it into my computer. As soon as I tried to add something to it, it displays:
<br/>
<br/>
"error, write protected. Please remove the write protection or use another drive"
<br/>
<br/>
or something to that effect. Anybody know what this is/how to fix it? I didn't (knowingly) do anything of the sort. My own pc is falsely accusing me of things! AAAAH! lol
<br/>
<br/>
-all help is much appreciated<br/>_________________<br/>w00</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The ?SD USB adapter I got with the M3Real broke after approx. one week... luckily I have a SD slot in my Laptop, so I can use the "regular" SD card adapter... &lt;sigh&gt;.
<br/>
I'll have to get it replaced, though.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, my problem is, that the USB adapter works "perfectly" just untill the ?SD is pluged in... pull it out again, and it's back in "My Computer"... Strange stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
So, maybe your reader is broken (in a different way), too? I tested mine with like three systems, all FAIL. :^(
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The microSD writer that came with my R4 eventually broke, to the point where two different PCs running Windows 5.x (one 2000, one XP) wouldn't recognize it at all. I used a microSD to SD adapter for a few weeks until I bought a new microSD adapter at B*** B**.
<br/>
<br/>
You might get a write protection error even with a microSD to SD adapter. Most SD cards have a little switch on the left side; one of the positions causes conforming devices not to try to write to the card's sectors.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. What is "RICS"? Google is no help.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

haha...i saw "RISC" too.  All I could think was "yes...ARM7 is a RISC processor....but what's that have to do with microSD?!"  haha
<br/>
<br/>
on Alpha's note..."write protected" usually means you've locked the device.  Some cards have that little switch on the side that "locks" it.  Buuut...I have yet to see a microSD with one of those lock switches.  I'm not even sure where they would put one...or how it would be possible to toggle it if it was on that tiny little thing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
