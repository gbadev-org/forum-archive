It would have its uses.  If Moore's law is sustainable you could eventually put homebrew demos up on your website, playable in the browser.  (I've never actually used any flash emulator.)

Several years ago (or maybe even more) I remember Intel saying they can uphold Moores law until 2008! However, with the advent of multicore processors, the multi-threaded nature of many applications and the physical limits we are reaching in microprocessor technology,  Moores law may become a thing of the past (processor wise) within the next 10 years (or at least the exponent should change).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I generally don't like it either.  But there are uses.  Mainly what sgeos was talking about...the ability to put a playable demo of a homebrew game on a website.
<br/>
<br/>
The nes flash emulator that I've messed with is slightly slow, but completely playable.  I would expect a gba one to be a good bit worse, if one existed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I know this is a bit... unfocused, but I think it's important to think about this, as the initial question is a substantial part of this post. Also, I'd like to have a question answered (below).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why not use Java instead? <a class="postlink" href="http://bytonic.de/html/benchmarks.html" target="_blank">Java applications can run at over 60% of native C implementations</a>, which I expect to be a <span style="font-style: italic">monstertude</span> of times more than action script.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I really don't care about flash, although I <span style="font-style: italic">do</span> see its <span style="text-decoration: underline">legitimate</span> uses. What I meant this morning, but couldn't write any more (got to get to work), is that I don't like to see flash abused:
<br/>
<br/>
E.g., tell a blind person how cool and <span style="text-decoration: underline">informative</span> that colorfully animated new flash page is, which contains 0% html... get it?
<br/>
<br/>
Or how cool it is to browse with you CPU at 100% usage, just because your three year old computer just isn't cutting edge any more (but still good enough for most games) and thus too slow for all the "cool" flash ads.
<br/>
<br/>
I say that's BS. Flash should just be used as an extra, an <span style="font-style: italic">optional</span> visual upgrade to HTML content, not replace everything. And I am aware of the fact that <span style="font-style: italic">some</span> sites offer an <span style="font-style: italic">alternative</span> (in contrast to <span style="font-style: italic">primary</span>) HTML site along with the flash site.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as I understand, flash / action script wasn't meant to be (ab)used in many ways that are quite commond these days.
<br/>
Why use it when there are "better" (in many ways, like efficiency, performance etc) solutions? Just because it can be done should not be the excuse to do it on the scale beyond proofs of concept. Please continue reading.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have seen some gba demos running in the browser some years ago. I think it was on dovoto's page. IIrc, he simply ported them to Java.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I suggest, that if you want the users to have the best possible experience enjoying your demo embedded in your web site, then port it to Java!
<br/>
<br/>
But I still fail to see how on earth it's a problem to supply a link to a .zip containing no$gba, which could run the demo a whole lot faster?
<br/>
<br/>
Please, could somebody explain this to me?
<br/>
<br/>
I fear the net becomes an amusement park more and more and there's less relevant information available every day. Abuse of technology is not the only cause, though.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

Which would require rewriting all the game logic, all the input, all the graphics code, and all the sound code in Java or ActionScript, and introducing translation defects in the process. Not to mention redesigning the levels to work around the fact that most PC keyboards can't accept as many simultaneous presses as a gamepad.

Three reasons: <ol type="1"><li>If you are a minor, or you are in the break room at work, or you are in a computer lab at a library or university, you don't own the computer you use. This usually means you can run SWFs and JARs in a web page, but the owner of the computer has every right to prohibit you from adding EXEs. </li><li>SWF and JAR work on all major desktop PC platforms. NO$GBA, on the other hand, requires PC DOS or Windows. How well does NO$GBA for Windows work in Wine or in the equivalent of Wine for Intel Mac computers? </li><li>It's a lot more work to click the link to download, minimize the browser, find where the browser put the executable, click the executable, click past the "publisher hasn't paid $200 to Comodo for a certificate to digitally sign this app" screen, click through the installer, and finally run it (whew), than it is to click one link and bring up an SWF or JAR inside the browser window. </li></ol><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

A java applet would be fine as well, although I originally mentioned flash because it is more likely to be installed and working correctly for non-technical users.  I'll have to check out boycott advance online.

You didn't disappoint me. Very well. Answer(s) accepted. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
Writing about "better solutions" I actually had  Java based emulation in mind. ;^D
<br/>
<br/>
Although I still think that, if you want "the best experience" for browser games / demos, then make a port with all implications that come with it. 
<br/>
And after all, you don't have your gamepad hooked to the library PC, so you'll have to go with standard keyboards anyway, right? Also, don't expect that PC (or Mac, if you like) to be fast enough to actually make the experience worthwhile (talking about emulation.) ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Flex SDK: You are right, but then again, how old was falsh as that happened (2004)? No answer needed... and yes, you've got a point there and I'll "step back." ;^)

I find actionscript far easier to work with than Java.  Programmer efficiency is just as, if not more, importantant than execution efficiency.  Afterall, if a project never gets finished it doesn't do anyone any good.  Even if your computer isn't cutting edge any more, you are expecting to upgrade sometime in the next 10 years, right?

Now or ten years from now?  To the best of my knowledge SWFs can run on cell phones.  I think the flash player will become more efficient to the extent cell phone internet usage is popular.  Even if there is little effect on multicore PCs, when you get your next computer I suspect you will have a ~3+ GHz machine.

All "low-quality mode" did was disable full-scene antialiasing, which was a speed win on older PC hardware when playing scripts that used more graphical tasks and less ActionScript. An emulator wouldn't necessarily be one of them.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I don't think most people actually use a whole lot of actionscript.

If you give up support for V-blank effects, the tile based modes would not be much different from tile based flash games.

I've released the source to my C# GBA emulator here: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.forwardcoding.com/projects/gbaemu.html" target="_blank">http://www.forwardcoding.com/projects/gbaemu.html</a>.  Now that Silverlight 2.0 is out, it would be very easy to move it over to Silverlight.  I'm not sure if there is a good solution for dynamic sound in Silverlight, so it might have to be a no-sound version for now :).
<br/>
<br/>
Speedwise, it hits 60fps easily on my cranky old Athlon 1.0Ghz.  Native emulators are still quite a bit faster, but your computer would have to be pretty old to have trouble emulating the GBA at full speed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Having a web-based GBA emulator would fundamentally change the homebrew scene for the better. The barrier to people playing our games is way too high for it ever to be more than a fringe hobby.

<br/>
If anybody could go to a site and play right there, we'd have an order of magnitude larger audience.
<br/>
<br/>
Silverlight doesn't have the ubiquity of Flash or Java, but if it's a path of least resistance, that would be SWEET. I think that if you did that, gladius, you'd very soon find your emulator to be the #1 used GBA emulator in the world. The power of web-based distribution is hard to overstate.
<br/>
<br/>
The only ugly thing you'd need to consider is how you feel about stolen, commercial ROMs running on your emulator. There might be an argument for turning the project closed-source and implementing something that keeps commercial ROMs from loading.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway... I'd love to see this idea happen. I'd contribute if I knew more about emulators... If there's anything I can do, let me know.

Well, boycott advanced online technically does qualify, although I can't find any source for it, and the defaults for it don't make it easy to set it up to automatically just run my game (the user still has to pick what game they want from a list, and you have to manually adjust the emulator speed).  But those things are enough of show-stoppers that it basically is unusable for me.
<br/>
<br/>
But yes, I agree...I'm trying to make as many easy ways to play my game (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.tolberts.net/anguna" target="_blank">Anguna</a>) as possible.  An easy integrated installer for windows that installs vba and my game together, and runs them with one shortcut was a good start, but playing in the browser would be even better.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
