Details...
<br/>
<br/>
Umm... let's see.
<br/>
<br/>
My library can do a series of basic functions easily, such as setting up backgrounds and sprites and things like that.
<br/>
<br/>
It specifically handles:
<br/>
<br/>
Background functions (Initializing, scrolling, etc..)
<br/>
BIOS encapsulation functions
<br/>
Blending functions
<br/>
Character Text Based functions (modes 0-2)
<br/>
Basic Collision functions (still confusing to others beside me though...)
<br/>
DMA Functions
<br/>
Miscellaneous functions (random number generator, GB Player logo)
<br/>
Various Graphics functions (modes 3-5)
<br/>
Easy Interrupt setup functions
<br/>
Input functions
<br/>
Commonly used math functions (sin, cos, div tables)
<br/>
Multiboot functions (search <a href="http://www.devrs.com.gba" target="_blank">www.devrs.com.gba</a> for original code)
<br/>
Mosiac functions
<br/>
Multiplayer functions (www.sgade.com)
<br/>
Palette Functions
<br/>
RTC functions (not thoroughly tested though...)
<br/>
Saving functions (SRAM and EEPROM, but not Flash ROM, if anyone has info on that one, PM me. I would like to have it)
<br/>
Time functions
<br/>
Basic Screen manipulation functions (changing modes turning of the screen, sleep)
<br/>
Window functions
<br/>
<br/>
Basically the goal of my library was to write a wrapper in which I would never have to directly write to a register in order to accomplish something. It makes for clean(er) code in almost all cases.
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, I can only send the library as it is small. The examples compressed would take at least an hour to upload on my 56K connection. So, if anyone with a high-speed connection would like to download it from me, and then redistribute it to other who want it, please PM me again.
<br/>
<br/>
Those who PM?d me before, don't worry, I won't leave you in the cold. Simply do it again and I will send you the source code and release files. You will be able to get the examples later, hopefully. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
