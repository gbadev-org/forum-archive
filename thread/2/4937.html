    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I was wondering if anyone could give me the power specs for the GBASP (and hence DS's) power cable... Also Could you give me the specs for a usb extention cables voltage?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx. I need this information because i moded my recharge cable to plug directly into usb power ports on the computer and recharge that way. However i want to make sure i'm not overloading or burning anything up. The setup is this (sorry i don't have a camera or i'd take a pic).
<br/>
WIRE 1:
<br/>
[DS OR SP]&lt;-[ds/sp power/sound port]-------------[usb plug]
<br/>
<br/>
WIRE 2:
<br/>
[usb port]-----[DS or SP AC Adapter Head]
<br/>
<br/>
In this way the ds or sp can plug into a computer and charge, or plug into the usb port attatched to the AC Adapter that came w/ the ds/sp... It says it charges when i plug it into the ac current or the usb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Only in as far as charging it up from the proper power supply will. It's not as though you're doing anything different. Either way you're just connecting a nominal 5V to the DS. But rechargable batteries don't last forever!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
