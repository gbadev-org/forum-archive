    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thats really neat.  It took me a while to figure out how it works.  I wish I had more time to mess around with it.  Here is my feedback:
<br/>
I have no problem with the death on dimension change, but the character sometimes seems to get him/her/itself stuck inside walls while falling or just walking around.  Then he dies.  That just sucks.
<br/>
The BGM seems to have a short loop and could get annoying after a while.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Concept is nice, should be polished a bit (a bit too annoying that you get stuck on places when switching dimensions), sound is awful (sorry, it really is!)<br/>_________________<br/>If everything fails, read the manual: If even that fails, post on forum!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks for the replies.
<br/>
<br/>
I fixed the bug where the character dies when he isnt suppost to.  My collision againts the map was off by a few pixels.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the music, i havent finished writing all of it yet.  I like the sound... i'll see what other peple think.  If enough peple dislike it i'll change it.
<br/>
<br/>
And as for getting stuck in the dimensions that is part of the game.  It will be explained better in the final version.  The game is a puzzle type game and you have to know where to switch dimensions to get around.  
<br/>
<br/>
I'll keep checking here to see what other people think.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I like the concept it's really interesting. I think you have a good concept going and should improve it. Maybe have moving platforms to try to align yourself on. Movable blocks, explodable blocks. The ability to create a platform and then switch to the other dimention then jumping on it it etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I think if you stepped up the gameplay even more it would become more fun to play.
<br/>
<br/>
The sound as you said wasn't finished. I think it is a bit annoying at the moment. I would suggest having 2-3 tracks for different levels.
<br/>
<br/>
It's looking great keep on improving it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
