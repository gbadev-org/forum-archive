    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, i've never posted here before and i just dropped in because you seem like a knowledgable bunch of people who would know the answer to my question.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically i'm interested in dabbling in programming for hand-held things. However, i'm really not able to go into the whole thing about getting "PassMe" things in order to "hack" the consoles to program them.
<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to ask, do any of you know of any cheap hand-held entertainment devices that i can program some applications for!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid last time i asked this anywhere my only response was "The ti-89 calculator!" which didn't really help. I think it's probably unlikely that theres a simple answer to my question, because i suppose it isn't that likely that theres a "cheap, easy-to-develop" hand-held entertainment console.
<br/>
<br/>
However, anything you guys can tell me is really appreciated! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GBA flash cards, GP32 systems, and GP2X systems are not sold by mainstream retailers in North America. If you're worried about having to pay $130 for the system and $70 for the SuperCard+SuperKey, get a Pocket PC.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">gba is still alternative to ds.
<br/>
it goes usually for 24$ at ebgames (that's mainstream), and in the flashcard forum someone is going to make some combine buying with other members here to get a 16 MB flash card for like 16 $ shipped - makes 40ish, maybe some tax.
<br/>
sounds cheap to me, and if you have a parallel port and a pc you should be ready to go.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well that's fair enough. Thanks for all replies.
<br/>
<br/>
I've already got a GBA, but i'm not sure how much it costs to get the necessary hardware to be able to program it, however i daresay theres a topic around here somewhere that i can read and find that out myself.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot :)
<br/>
<br/>
( P.S: I considered the GP2X but it's something like ?125, which is a bit too expensive )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well you have got to be one of the first people to come here and spot the beginners FAQ before being pointed out to it!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, i understand that forums like these tend to have FAQ threads. I also understand how frustrating it is for people when new members just ignore them.
<br/>
<br/>
So i always make sure to look for an FAQ thread first ;D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm thinking of waiting till Christmas when i get an NDS, and considering getting some stuff i need to code for that...
<br/>
<br/>
At th moment i've only got a GBA, so i thought i might as well wait to get the NDS as opposed to spending money on both.
<br/>
<br/>
(Although wouldn't that be nice? ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Those dual screens and touch-pad are just TOO tempting ;D
<br/>
<br/>
Although, i'm still not in the know as to what i need to do this. After reading all the FAQ's and such, it doesn't really seem to clue me in on what HARDWARE is required. So i hope i don't sound too stupid when i ask: what hardware is necessary to code for the NDS? If it is actually in an exhisting FAQ, i'm sorry and please point me to the relevant FAQ :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can buy a gba slot device now, and use it to develop for your GBA while you wait. What you need for the DS is something to put in the gba slot, usually with some kind of memory card, and something for the DS slot that points execution to the GBA slot (a NoPass).
<br/>
<br/>
I would buy a GBAMP CF. It has great compatibility with most homebrew, but it lacks ram so some old and big games are not supported. The downside is that it sticks out a lot from your DS, especially if you have get lite (which you should, they look wonderful). The Supercard MicroSD fit perfectly in the DS Lite's gba slot, but can't be used with the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
There are tons of different devices, most of them work well, just make sure you do some research so you don't end up with something that doesn't run homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
