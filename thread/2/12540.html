I could add command line options. Would that allow it to be integrated into the current NDS dev tools?

I haven't tried making any homebrew yet so not aware of the tools available or how to integrate RomeR in with them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It would allow it to be integrated into makefiles.
<br/>
<br/>
Imagine you have 1000 files.  You have to muck with all of these files.  If you spend one minute on each file, it will take 16 hours and 40 minutes to finish dealing with all of them.  Image you have to deal with some or all of them everyday.  Imagine that everyday lasts for multiple months.
<br/>
<br/>
You need to be able automate this or you'd never be able to do anything else.  This is one of the reasons command line options and makefiles are important.

Any suggestions for commands that would be useful?

Was thinking just a command to feed an image path, nds file path and then the header patching options.

By adding command line options, people can add the icon/title to the build process and never have to think about it again.

The reason isn't a lack of software to do it, ndstool has options for this. It probably has more to do with the lack of icons and descriptions in the examples than anything else.
<br/>
<br/>
If you wish to have your tool linked in these forums I suggest you host it somewhere else and remove the swashbuckling features. There are many free web hosts around and <a href="http://www.dev-scene.com/" target="_blank">http://www.dev-scene.com/</a> allows for downloads without forcing the user to sign up.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
