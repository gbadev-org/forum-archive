In the sentence "The majority of everyone that has heard the whispers _____ frightened." does is or are go in the blank?

You have to consider context and tense in which the scene takes place. The fear occured when they heard the wispers, therefore they 'were' frightened as opposed to are frightened, which implies the present.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It all depends on your style of text. Do you regard it as a constant update of the present or a recollection of a past event?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try reading the entire article.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Usage Note: wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote"> When majority refers to a particular number of votes, it takes a singular verb: Her majority was five votes. His majority has been growing by 5 percent every year. When it refers to a group of persons or things that are in the majority, it may take either a singular or plural verb, depending on whether the group is considered as a whole or as a set of people considered individually. So we say The majority elects (not elect) the candidate it wants (not they want), since the election is accomplished by the group as a whole; but The majority of the voters live (not lives) in the city, since living in the city is something that each voter does individually. ?Majority is often preceded by great (but not by greater) in expressing emphatically the sense of ?most of?: The great majority approved. The phrase greater majority is appropriate only when considering two majorities: He won by a greater majority in this election than in the last.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Fear is something the people do individually therefore the majority <span style="font-weight: bold">are</span> afraid.
<br/>
<br/>
It's also whispers not wispers and rumours may be a better word in this context.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks guys. In the context of the writing as a whole(which this is just a part of) 'whispers' seems better. Sorry I spelled whispers wrong. As I have said in another post, I am a horrible speller, but I am working on that. I have never been good at it for some reason, but thanks for correcting me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm bad at spelling and grammar by nature.  To make up for it I frequently use dictionaries.  When I'm not sure, I check.  Google is good for quick checks.  I checked "grammar" VS "gramar" using google.  (The former was correct.)  I also double checked "dictionaries".

There are a bunch of English FAQs and tutorials on the net.  They are worth checking out when you have questions.
