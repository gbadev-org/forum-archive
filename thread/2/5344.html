There is so much that is completely wrong with that statement that I have no idea where to even begin. Lemme try and seperate it into easier and TRUE statements.
<br/>
<br/>
The Genesis CPU has twice the MHZ speed of the SNES CPU, but featured less effects.
<br/>
<br/>
The CPU of the Genesis was inferior to the SNES CPU in terms of color output, sprite output, resolution, physics, rotation effects, etc. The SNES may have had a slightly slower CPU, but it had more girth.
<br/>
<br/>
Ports of SNES games to the Game Boy Advance are dependant on the skills of the people programming the port. When it comes to an emulator, it is entirely dependant on the person programming the emulator and their grasp of the workings of the system they are emulating.
<br/>
<br/>
The SNES and Genesis would both need specialized chips to be able to do some of the games on the Game Boy Advance. The Game Boy Advance can do -with hardware alone- what the SNES required the SFX, CS1, and SFX2 chips to do.
<br/>
<br/>
The Game Boy Advance can output more colors, and more sprites than the SNES and Genesis.
<br/>
<br/>
In short, the GBA could emulate the Genesis.<br/>_________________<br/>Evilish!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You're comparing PPUs, not CPUs. The PPU doesn't have to be emulated at full speed because it can be frameskipped. The CPU, on the other hand, is a lot harder to frameskip without affecting gameplay.

<br/>
Super NES had 32^3 = 32,768 colors. GBA and GBA SP have about 24^3 = 13824 usable colors due to the wide difference in gamma between the GBA display and the Super NES's sRGB display. Both the Super NES and GBA have 128 sprites, though the GBA does have more flexibility in sizing them. The Genesis can also output more pixels (320x224) than the GBA (240x160), and PocketNES style scaling works only in one direction at once.

Write an MC68000 core that runs on the ARM at 1:1 cycle ratio, in order to save time for the Z80, and I'll believe you. Remember that when you're emulating a Genesis, you're not just emulating one system; you're emulating two because all the Sega Master System hardware is present <span style="font-style: italic">and in use</span> unlike in the GBA.

The GBA specs are from GBA Tek. Anyhow, I was looking at those and then I noticed something interesting.
<br/>
<br/>
In the specifications about the Genesis it has this bit: "Co-Processor: Z-80 running at 4 MHz (not included in Genesis 2 or 3 models)"
<br/>
<br/>
So, why would you have to emulate the Z80 which is only used for Master System compatability at the same time as the main Genesis chip? Especially since the Z80 was REMOVED from the Genesis 2 and Genesis 3. All of which, can play the more important games on the Genesis. Those being Streets of Rage, Sonic the Hedgehog, etc. I own a Genesis 3 model, and aside from one racing game which had a weird cartridge shape, the Genesis 3 plays everything. So, no. The Z80 is NOT in use, especially when it ISN'T there.
<br/>
<br/>
The GBA and GBA SP screens are GBR. The Micro and the Nintendo DS Top screen are RGB. So, the GBA can use it's full range of 32,768 colors. Just, it won't look good on the antique GBA, or GBA SP.
<br/>
<br/>
A trip to a Game Faqs.com documnet on the Genesis stated that the Z80 was used for sound only. Which is weird and I have not run into any audio glitches between the Genesis 1, and Genesis 3. What's odd, is that it stated that some Genesis games, like the Genesis version of Phantasy Star, ran exclusively on the Z80 and not on the 68,000.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, isn't the Motorola 68000 just a slightly modified version of the same chip used in the Atari ST. Commodore Amiga, and the Apple Lisa?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I said the GBA could emulate the Genesis. I never said well. :-P<br/>_________________<br/>Evilish!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Just a technical note, the usable range of colors on the GBA vs the DS/Micro has nothing to do whether the pixels are BGR or RGB. It's because of the low intensity of the old GBA screen and the existence or lack of backlighting.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.

<br/>
The Z80 in the Genesis was not removed from the later versions as a lot of games used it to play music and some even rely on it to work at all.
<br/>
My Z80 cpu core for SMSAdvance uses up allmost all of IWRAM, the M68k is even more advanced which means you'd probably have to run it from ROM as most of the EWRAM will be needed as RAM for the Genesis, not a pretty sight if you ask me.
<br/>
The Genesis version of Phantasy Star is the exact same game as the SMS version just in a different cartridge, it runs in the SMS compatibility mode (on the Z80).<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
