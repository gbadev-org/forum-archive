    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
 I like avatars and smiles because you can show a little bit of you on them, also it's very good, as they make the forums much more colourful and happy. Then I want to suggest the administrators to activated the checkbox that they is unchecked on the Admin CP. ;)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It doesn't really matter to me, but I do think that alot of people are overreacting a bit. there are billions of forums that have images enabled without them being distracting, and I doubt that people here will use distracting images.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure that you can only enable still avatars, so no animated stuff can be used. and having avatars can help keep people apart more easier than names can.
<br/>
<br/>
unless I'm mistaken and there is a whole groep of 15 year olds just waiting for a change to upload anime boobs to the forum...<br/>_________________<br/>my blog:
