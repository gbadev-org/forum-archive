    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is called POWER X Y. Here are the specs:
<br/>
<br/>
Multimedia PC with Linux installed.
<br/>
Main unit: Buttons: Cancel, -, +, Accept. 2-digit (or possibly 4-digit) display. Light: Power, HD, CF, X, Y. On side: RCA jacks Video in, Audio in, Stereo in, Video out, Audio out, Stereo out. Auxiliary port, parallel port, serial port. Front: 4 slot to connect game controllers, keyboard plug, compact flash card slot, system logo.
<br/>
Game control: Buttons: + pad (up, down, left, right), Select, Start, A, B, C, L Shoulder, R Shoulder. Joystick. Lights: Power, X, Y, Player indicators (1, 2, 3, 4). Extension slot.
<br/>
Software can be loaded from CF card, AUX port, serial port, or video and audio casette tapes, or you can connect a keyboard and enter a program in. The software can be software developed for POWER X Y system, or software written in BASIC, or emulated software: GB/GBC, GBA, NES, PokemonMini, QGA, and possibly C64.
<br/>
Built-in software: Linux (operating system), main menu, emulators, BASIC interpreter, pictures viewer, terminal to serial port.
<br/>
<br/>
It may come with one or more manuals describing all the functions.
<br/>
The AUX port can be used to connect CD-ROM drive, infrared port, or possible many other thing as well.
<br/>
Extension slot on game controller can be used to put a rumble pack or memory card, maybe also more things as well.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
You can not only run old games (if someone makes a adapter to connect to AUX port then you can play directly from the original cartridge), but you can also play new games designed specifically for this system (it is basically a PC running Linux, it shouldn't be too hard to program it). I don't know, maybe someone will make a game using a tilt sensor plugged to extension slot, or audio input or maybe even video input.
<br/>
<br/>
You can make a game for this system without a license, but is recomended you do get a license then you can write "OFFICIALLY LICENCED SOFTWARE" on the box and the software can be copy-protected.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That may be good as well, but that is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT thing from the device I am describing.

<br/>
Also: Maybe the name "POWER X Y" isn't very good name. Does anyone have more idea what name I could put? And what open-source emulation software for Linux could I use? I need to modify it to make it work with the game controllers.

That isn't the only things it does, it also does a lot more stuff such as view pictures on CF card, and run software specific to this system (possibly using all the features of the system and maybe some new ones). There may be some homebrew and commercial software available for this new system. Commercial software in this case won't need a license or any special equipment, so some companies may do it. Even if no companies do it, maybe some people will just start writing software for it anyways, and then later they will decide to sell it and nobody will stop them from doing so. And if they make it free, just download it from a web-site and copy to CF card and it work!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I plan to make the price double the cost to make it for the first few units, then lower the price so that I can make only a $2.00 profit (or something near that) on each unit. I could also make it expensive but then you can fill a form for mail-in rebate to get some money back so it isn't too expensive.
<br/>
<br/>
I am going to use the least money possible to design the unit, such as using sheet metal to make the game controllers, using an existing computer as a base, making extra PCBs by hand (I'm not going to hire someone else to do it, I mean I will do it all by myself), and other stuff. This will not be sold in stores, only by mail-order to us. Although stores if they want can buy many units at once for a discount and resell them.
<br/>
<br/>
Licensing will be available anyways to rich people, then they can put the "official seal of quality" on their games and they can make their software to be copy-protected, and a few other stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
This system does have a few things that other system does not, such as: Linux, 4 game controller slot, buttons and display on top of unit (maybe to display time), companies can make  extension to controller and AUX port, and it definitely will have more things than just that.

You do realize that Microsoft (and Sony IIRC) make something like... -$200 on every console they sell.  That's right, they lose money.  They make their money on software.  If you don't buy 4 or 5 games a year, they've lost money on you.

I will be careful to not make more units than I can sell +1 (for myself). The more often people are buying, the more I make at once. I be careful not to lose money, even if this method will not maximize profits.

I cosign. There is some scientific research that proves this, and gives good reason as to why.
<br/>
<br/>
There is an interesting experiment they do to identify a self-made millionaire amongst a group of 15 people. They basically give them a game where they have to throw a ball in targets each with a score. Every point gives them a pound. So they have a bunch of easy ?10, ?20 and ?50 targets and one difficult ?1000 target. Everyone tries once or twice for the ?1000, taking careful shots; but the millionaire will throw all 10 balls frantically at the ?1000 basket hoping he will win it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
