    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just bought an used GBA at a really good price, and I wanted to install an afterburner kit, but I couldn't find any... is there a store that still sells it? (anywhere in the world?)
<br/>
I found this stick-on "Halo Light" on success-hk.com... does it worth it?
<br/>
thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"Halo" light kits (no connection to <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_%28video_game_series%29" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Inch_Nails#Official_NIN_releases" target="_blank">NIÐ˜</a>, or <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/halo2/" target="_blank">April Fool's Day</a>) are probably your best option for adding light to a GBA Classic nowadays. They'll probably work even better than the Afterburner mod, which I attempted and which gave a rawther washed-out image. But actually, by the time you've bought a lot of alkaline batteries for a lit GBA Classic, you could probably have bought an SP.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

well... I use rechargable NiMh batteries, but I think I won't buy any light, instead I'll spend my money in a multiboot cable to do some coding :-P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
