    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, I have just created the wierdest glitch I have ever seen in my life and am quite pissed at myself for it. I went out and bought myself a wireless controller today, and it had a turbo button on it. I decided to try out this feature playing super smash bros brawl on my brother's wii. After about ten minutes of playing around with the feature, I used it to turbo the A button for kirby's punch move, and guess what happened! It worked fine until I tried to turn off the turbo, and then the characters all started glitching if they had a rapid punch move, like fox or kirby... even though I had stopped using my turbo controller. Anybody know how to fix something like this without kissing your gamesaves goodbye? My brother will be quite angry if I have to delete the saves, so any help is much appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
-also: the "glitch" I mentioned before involves rapidly repeating the beginning part of the punch. I think my controller double turbo'd the A button or something... I am so confused right now!!!!<br/>_________________<br/>w00</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That shouldn't be necessary. Have you tried completely "desyncing"/disconnecting the turbo remote? Taking out the batteries in it? This glitch only happens with characters being controlled with this remote, correct? Does strange things happen on other games? Does the glitch disappear if you do those things? The remote might need reset. I don't remember the buttons needed, but I remember you need to press the Home button, I think.(I don't actually have a Wii where I live, it's a relative that has it)
<br/>
Check any game's manual near the front for how to reset.
<br/>
<br/>
Whenever you load a channel, start/boot the Wii, start a game, ect, the Wii makes the remotes reconnect. In this process, the positions of everything on the remotes is set to neutral. So if the Nunchuck stick was being moved around, not being in the real neutral position, that would cause problems. And if any buttons were to be held down at the time, that might be a problem too.(Well, maybe not. I don't know, that's probably not an issue)
<br/>
But, it might not be a reset-related issue, if the glitch doesn't go away, despite doing what I mentioned at the start of the paragraph.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">not like this... Your char stutters back and forth when you hold it (does the first half of kirby's punch over and over super fast), and this is even without the turbo controller. It is like there is some sort of beat within the game that has been thrown off. This only happens with A attacks on certain characters too... I have reset the wii, turned off the controller, unplugged the wii, tried a reg controller... everything short of deleting the save. It isn't that big a deal, but pretty much makes it really cheap to use fox or kirby or any of them. You hold A and it is like auto pwn with double the "normal" turbo. I have tried to replicate the initial glitch, but with no success. Anything else I can do? I would have moved the save onto an SD card, but it isn't copy-able. If there is a way to move the save or just fix it some other way, plz tell me. All help is appreciated =).

-If nothin works, we will either live with it, or I got some serious brawling it up ahead of me to get back everything... I guess its the same as my bro has done to multiple of my games in the past tho..... lol<br/>_________________<br/>w00</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try going through all the settings/options for everything, including the controller options for all of the profiles. If you don't find anything, well, I don't know what else to tell you, other than E-Mailing Nintendo support about this problem. What kind of turbo controller did you get? If you E-Mail them, you should tell them the name of the controller/the model too. I had to contact Nintendo support before, and the customer support was great.(In my experience with Nintendo Of America customer support)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
