    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm currently making a new naruto game on the PC. Naruto Battle for life and death PC is the time after the Chunin exams. Naruto finds himself into a serious of training by fighting other Ninja, and as a added bonus, Naruto finds himself into fighting the Kyubbi withen him. If you beat him, you gain ultimate power to beat basicly anyone. The game is not 3d, but yet I can add 3d objects to the game. The game is side-scrolling so you can run, jump,duck, and do other types of stuff to fight other ninja. My game supports right now, but I'm working on it. Here's the support list.
<br/>
<br/>
Support list -
<br/>
<br/>
Naruto can do the following so far - Walk left, and right, move up into the air (this will be for jumping, I need to add it), duck, and throw a shurigan.
<br/>
<br/>
Naruto's kage bunshin no justu - I have added a fake naruto to experience fight simulation. He doesn't move, but he throws a shruigan in the begining of the game. 
<br/>
<br/>
Tile's = I'm currently looking for naruto tiles, anything that's ethir ground or air tiles I will be axcepting from Naruto.
<br/>
<br/>
Backgrounds - I currently have one backgrounds, but not from Naruto, if you have any, please submit them to me. Also, tiles you can send to me to.
<br/>
<br/>
Rooms - I have one room, this current room is for part of level one. There's will be at least 10 rooms per level. Also in bonus levels, there's a time limit to kill all of the enimes, if you kill them in time, you receive a special weapon.
<br/>
<br/>
Naruto animated .gifs - I have made animated naruto .gif images for better action.
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE - People who submit Naruto work to me will be inducted into who made the game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
