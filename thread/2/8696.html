    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe this happened a while ago, and I missed it, but I have been working on my coding chops lately, getting ready for GBA dev. I noticed gbaguy's asm tuts on his web site, which now seem to be gone !?!? Is there an alternate location for his tutorials ? Is he gone ? Eaten alive by koopas ? 
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know, assembler is not totally necessary for game dev, but he explained it in such a way that people who had general knowledge of another programming language (such as myself) could understand him. I bookmarked the page, but my bookmark stopped working....
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT : I have just found parts of his website using Google cache and the Wayback machine, but still, I would like to know where his current site is.... if any....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.

-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I?m also searching for some ARM assembly tutorials for a long time now and maybe gbaguy?s tut?s where not the best tutorials, but they where the only ones I could find on the www, is there a good source?
<br/>
<br/>
I really like to learn some asm!       (devkitPro's assembler)
<br/>
<br/>
I found some nice little asm demo game on <a href="http://etk.scener.org/" target="_blank">http://etk.scener.org/</a> with sources, but no info on how to assemble them or what devkit or assembler was used.
<br/>
<br/>
I really hope that some gbadev genius can point me/us in the good direction ;)
<br/>
<br/>
thank's and greetings xampi</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well your best bet might be to learn assembler if you have not already. For that I suggest using <a class="postlink" href="http://betov.free.fr[/url" target="_blank">rosasm</a> - as it is a true one click asm environment.
<br/>
<br/>
In all honesty it is too late in the evening for me to google for the best tutorials for you to learn assembler - especially since I have no idea of your experience and understanding.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">@keldon - that's cool, I sort of did that already as well - nothing quite like the gbaguy tutorial. If you are interested, I have posted an introduction of myself in Announcements, but basically I have coded for the Apple IIe, and I also know VB, Pascal, Javascript. Of course, I am new to the GBA side of things, but hey, thanks for the link !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I got the asm tutorials from devrs.com/gba. In general you will need gbatek as a reference, and those tutorials should guide you into setting up an environment, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
