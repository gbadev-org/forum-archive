Wait until the GBA patents run out and then design and sell your own GBA clone.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The big logo (the upper one) cannot be over-written as far as I know(I have recently studied some stuff about the GBA core, if editing this was possible then I'd have found some text about it) The lower logo Can be edited, but it is used to verify the game is a legal gameboy game. If you notice, some games you make and port to a flashcart will have corrupted junk in that position. However, there are 2 bytes in that image which enable some various debugging modes which really aren't worth using. However I don't know much about exactly what the BIOS is... GBA carts cannot write over this image(it's blocked out intentionally) but I assume that by taking it apart there are some things you could do to edit it.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a bomb technitian.
