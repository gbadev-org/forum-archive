    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm new and I was wondering -  is there a GBA Indie gaming scene? What sorta things are people working on? Unfortunately, evenything I've found so far seems to be technical in nature - and the PD lists on emulation sites just seem to be photo albums and eBooks. Are there any cool games for the GBA made by hobbists and distributed for free?
<br/>
<br/>
On that note, what are everyone's "favorite" indie-GBA  games? 
<br/>
<br/>
(I figure that's as good way as any to find out what's worth downloading :))<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.distractionware.com" target="_blank">http://www.distractionware.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Make a complete game is difficult.  Very few indie games can be considered complete.  Promising people probably get absorbed by companies before they complete anything big or really "cool".
