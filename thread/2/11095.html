Hi, I run a game development studio in the San Francisco area called Humanature Studios.  We\'re building a game for the DS and I\'m looking for an engineer who knows the Nitro system and is familiar with working on the DS.  If you would like to see our job posting you can go to humanaturestudios.com or to the job section of gamasutra.com.  Are you interested in considering a move to California?  Do you have the skill set we\'re looking for?  If so I would love to talk with you.

Not really, but it is a very damning judgement you are making that you publically gave about the integrity of the company. And 'yes', we are all entitled to our own views, and you may assume that what you said was implied by his own statement.

He may have been shocked by the statement.  As they say, two wrongs don't make a right.  If you violate a rule/custom (or whatever), that doesn't make it appropriate for me act to unprofessionally.  Depending your values, profanity may be completely 100% unacceptable.
<br/>
<br/>
I think that in principle, profanity should be avoided.  There are plenty of words in the English language.  Real profanity can be replaced by placeholder fake profanity- "fudge" and whatnot.  The next best thing is not listing any letters.  "What the )'*#!" could stand for "What the nutfudder!", although I think that is a weak argument.  Hiding two letters is really no better than listing the whole word, unless you are dealing with barely literate children.  (And they may be.)
<br/>
<br/>
For what it is worth, I don't really care one way or another.

<br/>
In Lynx's book (and other's who share his value set), profanity is *never* acceptable in a professional environment.  If the environment is professional, any other circumstances are irrelevant.  End of story.  Those are his values.  (Lynx, correct me if I misread you.)
<br/>
<br/>
In your book, profanity can be acceptable (even in a professional environment) in response to extreme circumstances.  Those are your values.  (keldon, correct me if I misread you.)
<br/>
<br/>
No value set is right or wrong, and you are going to have a hard time getting someone to change their values.  The best you can do is nod and say, "So that is how you think?  Interesting." and then deal with the person on those terms.

My book is not black and white. I am not quick to judge people. He could be the most vulgar person, yet the most professional. George bush said, "stop that sh*t man", and although that was not meant to go on air it is the *real* language he speaks.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sgeos, I agree with what you are saying.. and maybe it's just _my_ misunderstanding of is acceptable in professional-ism..  But, I think you will find (if you do any research at all) that using profanity is unprofessional, no matter what the values involved.  Don't get me wrong.. I don't really care what this company posts on their site.. I don't care who the members are and how they represent themselves at all... But, no matter WHO is looking at it, that _IS_ unprofessional.  Agree with me or not.. it doesn't matter!  It's unprofessional.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you want me to go over the rest of the site.. and point out all the VERY unprofessional stuff on it, I will.. But, it would be a waste of everyones time if they aren't willing to bring their reputation to a professional level.  That's it.. done.. If a corporate "stooge" came across that site..  It is almost certain that they would not be hired just due to the comments alone.
<br/>
<br/>
We are talking about a professional reputation.. How much experiance do you have in a professional environment?  If you want to stand around a water cooler and spout profanity, that may be acceptable in your environment.. but is still UNPROFESSIONAL!  It's all about sales!  SELL, SELL, SELL.. and every word on a web site is an "advertisement" for your services..  So if you went to dspassme.com and it said "buy a F$#cking PassMe from me".. would you?
<br/>
<br/>
Now.. if it said "I stopped reprogramming cause I got screwed, so F#@ck off" would you buy a PassMe from me?
<br/>
<br/>
Of course not.. who want's to deal with someone that unprofessional?  Specially if there is money involved.  
<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line.. Maybe they (as well as anyone else reading these posts) will realize how unprofessional profanity is (even if it's acceptable) and will refrain from using it.  Even "censored", it's not needed.  You want to represent your company/group/whatever in a professional way.. think before you post.. it's that easy.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I did not mean to imply that you are.  Clearly I need to work on my wording. =)  You and Lynx disagree, but you don't seem share <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postulate" target="_blank">postulates</a>, which means that you can both argue until you are blue in the face, but you will not get anywhere.
<br/>
<br/>
Because I doubt that neither you nor Lynx will change your default postualate set (or absolute value set), the only way for your arguement to have any meaning is to establish an agreed upon postulate set.  If that can't be done, a meaningful argument can not take place.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think that you and Lynx disagree.  I think that you are actually arguing different things, and have interperted the situation as a disagreement.
<br/>
<br/>
So far as I can tell, this is what you are arguing:
<br/>
keldon - taking a quote out of context painted an unfairly unprofessional picture
<br/>
Lynx - profanity is alway unprofessional
<br/>
<br/>
These arguments don't conflict.  I can and do agree with both of you. =)
<br/>
<br/>
Debating whether "taking a quote out of context paints an unfairly unprofessional picture", could go somewhere.  You may well disagree on that point (and I suspect that you do.)
<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, you might disagree about whether or not "profanity is alway unprofessional".

I don't know what we are discussing and the quote can't be misleading, as the only REAL thing I needed to quote was the swearing..  I guess I should have just quoted the swearing.  Since my point about professionalism has NOTHING to do with the context of the post at all..
<br/>
<br/>
Tepples.. I wouldn't buy a ticket to that movie because I have kids.. and wouldn't be able to take them along.. I'll admit.. My movie going experiance isn't what it used to be.. My last 2 movies were Ice Age 2 and Cars (awesome, for kids or not)...
<br/>
<br/>
But, I would put movies in the same respect as porn sites.. as swearing has become the standard with them as well.  In that profession, swearing is expected..  But, in software development, swearing isn't the standard and therefore depicts an unprofessional manner.
<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line (and final thought)..  quoting the entire post or a single word is irrelavant as it has nothing to do with the purpose of my post.  If you go back and look, I quoted a part of the post on the main page of a site.. and said, they look professional in a sarcastic way.  The fact that the initial post reguarding the group (in my opinion) was done very professionally, I was shocked to see the site itself representing the group so unprofessionally.  So, if you are "friend" of the group, and think I am trying to "bash" the group because of a post on the main page, then I am sorry you feel that trying to justify the unprofessionalism of the site will help somehow.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Fair enough, the purpose was only to show their unprofessional manor, but the outcome of your method <span style="font-weight: bold">drew</span> a picture that is not the same as what the whole post gave.
