Which do you prefer? prefix, postfix, infix. Please give the reason if you have one.
<br/>
<br/>
I like postfix and the reason is because: First you have to compute the value of what is being multiplied, <span style="font-style: italic">and then</span> you have to tell it to multiply those two numbers together. Right? It makes sense to me!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I like infix. That's how regular math is taught, so it feels more familiar when learning programming. Also it just seems more natural to me to put an operator between the two things it's affecting, and it requires less parentheses too.
<br/>
<br/>
Prefix is not bad either though. It matches better with calling named functions, and gives you more information about the purpose of the values upfront.
<br/>
<br/>
Postfix seems backward to me. "Here are some values, now do this with them." It doesn't really matter on simple expressions, but it seems like it would take more re-reading if you have a few nested operations.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And that can depend on the user's native language. I know Welsh tends to be prefix (verb subject object), and Japanese to be postfix (topic subject object verb). German is circumfix for main clauses (subject-or-adverb helping-verb subject object participle).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
