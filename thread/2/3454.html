I made the stupid mistake of doing a cut-and-paste to my new HD, rather than copy-and-paste. I lost all the stuff I copied, even though it was only a quarter of what I meant to move over. I thought I was ok, until I rebooted my computer, only to find an error preventing the HD from booting, or being accessed. I did manage to find some old versions, which are 1 1/2 months old.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I did manage to recode about half of what I lost out of my main GBA program this morning, and hopefully will be able to recode the rest of both programs soon. I'm glad I remembered what exactly I updated and where the code was updated.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well I had it like this before. Only I was able to access the hard-drive through a boot up disk and used <span style="font-weight: bold">xcopy32</span>. BIG MISTAKE. It copied only a fraction of my work, and I lost EVERYTHING. I'm talking every project I ever did, all my programs I've spent years getting hold of, about a Gigabyte of downloads in the 56kbps days - - and I didn't even NEED to delete it.

<br/>
In retrospect, if only I had borrowed my dads CD writer, I could have done this a long time ago. So ALWAYS BACKUP</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lesson learned: Always back up your files :)
<br/>
<br/>
I've had this happen a few times to me. Although I haven't lost too much yet I still am overly worried. I back up my files usually every month or 2 and my coding/documents/art every few weeks. It's a good idea to keep a partition with a copy of all your files on it. However, that's not always the most secure. I almost lost all my work because of hard drive failure but later found out it was my CPU fan that just suddenly broke off.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck recovering everything, I know it can be a hassle sometimes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I mean, how can you put a price on thousands of hours of love and sweat?

Just remember to reburn every few years...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I probably should have thought of that in the first place, burn a CD or DVD. It's just one of those things where when you've never had a problem with the last dozen upgrades, so what could possibly go wrong? Then it does. I've learned my lesson. I've now burned a backup of my precious stuff..... my precious...... (LotR: RotK out today)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I guess it all isn't too bad. I've remembered most of what I coded on the GBA, and the VB editor I was making totally needed to be redone as it was.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
