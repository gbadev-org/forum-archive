<br/>
<br/>
It looks so amazing!
<br/>
<br/>
Except Hellfire (which I might just play through today), I have played all official Diablo games (there are just four, right? ;^) ) starting from number one.
<br/>
D2 (especially LoD) had some slightly different gameplay when compared to the original, even though it may seem not to differ that much, and I think, that this iteration will be rather different again.
<br/>
<br/>
That's a good thing! If done right (I'm saying this as a person that has a lot of trouble adjusting to new situations most of the time), the game could turn out even better than the first two combined!
<br/>
<br/>
Let's hope Blizzard keep up the good work they showed in the gameplay trailer!
<br/>
<br/>
So, what do you guys (and gals) think?
<br/>
<br/>
Let's dream about an NDS port (which is so unlikely to be made, I don't know how to describe it with words) ...

if you've never played Diablo, download the shareware demo.
<br/>
it's probably one of the best rpg games ever made.
<br/>
due to the freedom and the different ability's you have.<br/>_________________<br/>God  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.freewebs.com/jrohtmltesting/loveshack.htm" target="_blank">Speed</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, I (personally) don't see it as an RPG... It's a very lightweight RPG at best, but it's definitely hardcore H'n'S (Hack And Slay). Also I don's see any freedom in the game at all...
<br/>
<br/>
BUT: The characters' skill trees, the massive hordes of monsters and the core gameplay element: the loot, make up for any lack of story, quests, real NPCs etc! Really! If you like WoW, try Diablo. (After all, it should be called "Diablo: World of Warcraft") ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
It has something very special to it - and a very dense atmosphere. It's like PacMan: simple, but entertaining, times over and over. And if you like sporting competition, the online ladder is for you. If you like to spend an afternoon slaying monsters with your friends, the multiplayer is perfect.
<br/>
<br/>
And I'm, talking about both games. The original had something, the sequell didn't: Virtually no skills, but all characters could learn all spells. Epic!
<br/>
<br/>
I must admit, that I am a little bit excited about the new game (although it's possible it looks like a lot more in this thread ;^) ) - something that happend the last time, they've announced StarCraft2 ... Damn, it's so sweet, my teeths start to hurt!

The formula worked for Diablo twice (so far). It worked for Animal Crossing twice (so far). Both sold millions.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Games that win awards typically do not sell millions, so the endless cycle of sequels and licensed drivel continues.  For what it's worth, Diablo III ought to be the best in series, but I suspect Diablo IV will be pure recycled drivel and not worth the disc it is printed on.  (Let's hope I'm wrong.)
