    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think I have figured out the true purpose of hoax chain mails such as the ones warning you about phoney viruses and stuff and to start petitions to save people.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically what happens is that mail servers find it even more difficult to differentiate between meaningful emails, chain mail and junk! That's my hypothesis, anyone else got any?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, I've always suspected that too as I have seen plenty of forwarded emails with thousands of email addresses attached. It's like the email providers haven't learned enough already; a forwarded message does not need to:

 - (a) show the previous senders email addresses
<br/>
 - (b) put the previous message into a quote and add a signature
<br/>
 - (c) add "FW: " to the beginning of the title
<br/>
 - (d) be forwarded -_-

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, even if I'm just replying to a friend, by habit I remove all the extra information. My friends never believe me when I tell them that spammers use these specifically to farm email addresses. They get particularly mad when its one claiming each forward will get some little girl 5 cents for her operation. And sometimes I like to think I make friends with the smarter group at school.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">C'mon!  Everyone knows that Barbara and David Mikkelson of snopes.com personally author every chain-email and urban legend ever made.  Then they send them to their friends, who proceed to massively spread the message all around the Internets.  Finally, visitors go to snopes.com to see whether the myth is true or not, and this makes Ad Revenue for snopes.com!
<br/>
<br/>
So it's all one gigantic ad-revenue scam!  Boycott snopes.com!<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
