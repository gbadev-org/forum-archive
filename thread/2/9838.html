    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok I need help on what to do with my PC and my Set-top box (Sky +)
<br/>
<br/>
Ok I have this media centre pc in my room, I want my Sky+ box connected to my PC wirelessly but I want to record and rewind etc using Media Center. I would think I would need to use wifi for this.
<br/>
<br/>
The Sky+ box is in my living room connected to the tv, but the Sky+ is also connected to another tv in my dining room using the TV Link.
<br/>
<br/>
So basically I need a TV to PC sender that allows me to use media center to record, rewind etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I do not want a TV Card because I won't get the Sky Movies etc. Thanks<br/>_________________<br/>It's so easy to be wise. Just think of something stupid, then dont do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you get an analogue tv card(I have one of these) you can get any tv station that your tv can get.
<br/>
<br/>
I dont know what functions a mediacanter PC has, im not sure you would be able to control your sky box from your pc. You could set up mirrors around your house to bounce the remote control off :/
<br/>
<br/>
back to the tv card thing, if you tune your tv card to your sky channel you should be able to record things from it. You can also set it to recieve the video signal, but youll have to plug the video cable into the tv card and the audio cable to your soundcard.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure any of that will help you.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

I dont follow... There should be NOTHING to stop a signal (converted to analogue) being received by the tv card. When recording analogue to analogue (detune the output signal from one vhs, and tune a chanel on the other to the new output signal of the first). the only drawback would be a slightly poorer signal. I used this when recording old C64 games to show friends.
<br/>
<br/>
Trying to copy a DVD through the video output of your DVD player will not work, I assume there is a whole bunch of scrambling stuff going on. But doing it analogue (through the tuner) should work every time, I assume this is tru from the digital tv box, I'm willing to stake my non-existant reputation on it.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, but it is a lot cleaner than the tuner signal, wich as far as I know isn't ever encryipted in any way.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
