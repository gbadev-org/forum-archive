Anywho, I need to know (quickly) if there are any pending member requests for gbadev.wikispaces.com . You can just post here if you want to join, since that's easier than using a PM. Thanks!

Also, If you would like to post an article/tutorial on the site, you do not have to be a member. The wiki is unblocked here, so I can put it on there for you if you'd like. I just want to see some worth put onto the site before our admin catches on and does block it. Thanks!

Good to be back. Hope it lasts. If anyone knows of some un-popular annonymizers they can point me in the general direction of, I'll try to be back for an extended period of time. Thanks!<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
