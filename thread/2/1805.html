Do you think the GBA is dead? with a lot of GBA developers going down, is it worth the effort making demos/games on it ???

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the GBA will live on.  For those of us of a certain age computers like the Amiga and SNES hold special memories. The GBA is the last thing around that's like those old machines - 2d acel'd gfx, tracker tunes, hw sprites, tile modes and so on.
<br/>
<br/>
The next generation of handheld consoles will be something completely different - just look at the PSP - 2.6GFlops vector engine, 3d hw gfx accel, 1.8 GB disks, MP3 music, 802.11 wireless!!!!?!?!?! The thing plays 2hrs of DVD quality video with 7.1 sound???

<br/>
Drool if you like - but when you've got that sort of built-in power, it's beyond most of us who code the GBA for fun to code anything cool in a few evenings a week.  So I imagine they'll be a group of us who keep playing with the GBA for a long time.  I know I will - I want to make something as cool as the Amiga demo 'Jesus on Es' one day...<br/>_________________<br/>---

Or a 2D gamer's dream.  I dislike 3D games for the most part.  I have an SNES (and an NES) in my room and the only current system I own that came out after it is the GBA.  Looks like I'll need to move on to cell phones next...

I'm sad to hear that cell phones are heading down the 3D path.  Clearly somebody needs to make some awe inspiring 2D games for cell phones.  The better games will make money, if there is a market, that is.

Neat.  I couldn't find the "grid" that is mentioned in the FAQ... so much for instructions. =P  It looks like the games use the arrow keys and mouse.
<br/>
<br/>
From what I've gathered, cell phones would also be great for high content games (as opped to special effects games).

    <h4>#9745 - davidwilson - Fri Aug 15, 2003 10:03 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Let me tell you a little bit about the cell phone industry...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm an independent game developer, have been for some time now.  I've been working with a mobile publisher from the UK for almost a year now.  I've done 3 games and I'm in the process of a 4th one.  From my experience, the mobile industry is not really ready yet for those who really want to write good games.  It's possible, but it's much harder to do well while doing it.  There are two main reasons for this:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  The hardware on the cellphones SUCKS.  The functionality of the game has to be pretty simplistic for it to run well.  Also, you have severe restrictions in the amount of artwork you can have in the game.  The general average of the size limitation for J2ME apps right now is around 100-128 KB.  You have to really optimize your code and the imagery for space.  Also, there isn't any standard key setup for the devices.  J2ME has a "game action" feature set up on most devices which allows it to be a little more portable, but you still have to recode key actions for some devices since they don't support things exactly right.  Also, different manufacturers have different ways of handling sound on their devices.  The easiest brand by far to do sound for is Nokia.  Nokia is the best brand to do mobile development for, hands down.  They've got a great forum to get help, plus they've got plenty of SDKs and documentation to make your development work easier.
<br/>
<br/>
2. There is a lot of complete SHIT out there right now.  The industry is still in its infancy right now, as far as I can see.  People see that this is a budding industry and they want to try to cash in with whatever kind of droll they can write and release in a week.  There are some really good games out there, but they're few and far between.  Macrospace is a good developer, I know a guy who codes for them, nice people.  Also, my artist has done contract work for them in the past.  The worst thing is, there are a good number of shady distributors out there who won't think twice about ripping off small developers in a heartbeat.  The first game I did with the UK company got released through a distributor in the UK probably 3 months ago.  We haven't gotten a revenue report from them as of yet.  Hell, they won't even reply to our emails or phone calls.  Doesn't really represent their company well, in my humble opinion.
<br/>
<br/>
Doing mobile development for hobby purposes right now is fine.  It's pretty fun in the beginning, and I imagine it would continue to be fun if you didn't have the pressures of commercial development.  That was very hard on me, especially since I was expecting to see some revenues to help me pay bills and such.  I haven't seen any revenues as of yet, and it's been a year.
<br/>
<br/>
Mobile development is a challenge.  If you like that, then go for it.  That's just my synopsis of the situation.

I'm not convinced that low specs ought to indicate poor games.  Low specs will not lend to special effects games at all, but there were a lot of great games on the C64, Atari and NES.  Some of the better ones were content games-  games sold on their content as oppose to high budget special effects.

The GBA is basically the best a 2D programming could wish for!! (it could be a little better, like sound, cool graphics go good with nice sound, but i am not complaining, at least nintendo allowed us to do more than *beep* *boop* *beep* *beep* as a crude substitute for sound.)

I have never seen a better developed portable. While i am here, the N-Gage is a cell-phone/portable gaming system. God must have been on an off day to let that happen.

A reason why programmers still program for consoles like the Atari and C64 etc is because they like the challenge of hardware limits. They have to use some creativity in their code to either make it fit, run smoothly etc.
