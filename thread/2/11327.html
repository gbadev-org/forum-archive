    <h4>#104742 - Kirby - Mon Oct 02, 2006 7:28 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi! It's me again, Kirby! Now, as you may know, I'm making a game called The Kirby Revolution! Now, I've just implemented a feature into the game called Kirby's Journal, which is basically a journal that Kirby adds to every once in a while. I got the idea from Kirby Warrior RPG 2: Dream Edition (a really good game). Anyway, it just starts out as a title page. But later on... more pages would appear and you would just press R to view them. But quite frankly, I'm not good at writing journal enteries like the one in KWRPG2DE. So I decided to create a contest.
<br/>
<br/>
As I make more to the plot of the game, I'll post the story onto this post. Then, anybody who is interested can post a possible journal entry that Kirby may write during that period of time. I'll just have one post with the story in it which I keep editing as I make more, so then the posts underneath build up. For every new section of the story I post, there may be more than one journal entry if the period of time is big enough, and enough happened.
<br/>
<br/>
So then, after I get all of these posts with journal entries, what do I do? I will select the best journal entries, and put them in my game. The posters' of those entries will have their name in the credits, and will be sent a free version of the game after completion.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">*EDIT* This has changed.</span>
<br/>
The format for a post about a possible journal entry would be:
<br/>
<br/>
Name: [name]
<br/>
Chapter: [chapter]
<br/>
Entry: [entry]
<br/>
<br/>
Chapter is the chapter of the story you are writing in. I'm doing it this way so that people can write Journal Enteries at the ends of different periods of time. Yes, you have to include your username even though it is automatically in the post. I'll be parsing through this with a progam. Entry may be up to 25 lines, and each line can have 25 characters in it. (if the line contains a \, and therefore you have to type \\, the \\ will only count as one character.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone thinks this is a good idea, please post and say so. If even one person posts "Yes, this is a good idea.", I will automatically start the contest.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">And once again <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="text-decoration: underline">SORRY</span></span> about the abmyssal first chapter. It will get <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="text-decoration: underline">MUCH</span></span> better.</span><br/>_________________<br/>Knock-knock.

This is an excelent idea. Good way to get the community involved, and to keep your project going.

I will see if I can write any, seeing as how I am a particular kirby fan myself.

lol, trying to sell a game based on someone else's copyrighted characters? good luck with that. (unless I misunderstand, and this is not HAL's Kirby we are talking about here. )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Well, alrighty then! I have some takers!</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>hello world wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Do we get a prize ;-) ?

Just wondering, it wouldn't change my decision (which is maybe).</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">Well, as thegamefreak0134 said, isn't a free game a good prize? Oh, and don't forget, you get your name in the credits. (I always find that that is a way to get people to want to help: name in credits)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">*EDIT*</span>I've also decided to add another prize, if you're so minded. The winner of the BEST post can (if they want) have either themself or a character of choice placed into the game either as a NPC, or a secret character. Hope this motivates more people!
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, so I've started actually writing the story for the game. It will be improved, so expect to come back here some day and find chapter 2 has changed a little or something. So the final idea is that, because there will be many chapters, there will be one or two entries a chapter.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, yes, this is a platformer with a story to it. Very strange, I know. This game will be split up into many chapters, each with a boss at the end.
<br/>
<br/>
But OK. Here we go. (if the story doesn't seem to go well, don't worry, it will either get better, or be changed.)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Story</span>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Chapter 1</span>
<br/>
One day, Kirby was in his house, doing something... when his friend <span style="font-weight: bold">Waddle</span> called. He asked to Kirby wanted to go to his <span style="font-weight: bold">house</span>, and Kirby agreed. (Insert usual going through a few maps with enemies in them.) When Kirby gets to Waddle's house, he sees lots and lots of <span style="font-weight: bold">Plops</span> jumping around right inside Waddle's house. But before Kirby can attack them, they scream "Hey! It's Kirby! We have to run away!", and... they run away. Waddle, your friend, is on the floor. He askes you to go to Whisper Woods, because his friend Waddle Doo went there some time last year, and hasn't been seen since. "I also heard the Plops saying that they were going to bring me to Whisper Woods, if you hadn't saved me." So you venture off into Whisper Woods. (Insert more maps, battling, a cave, more battling, until...)... Kirby finds Waddle Doo sitting inside a cave. He says, "Finally! You're here! I've been trying to escape for ages, what year is it anyway?". Kirby askes why he hasn't escaped. "Whispy Woods did something to this cave! I can't leave, there's a barrier that appears if I get too close!". Kirby decides to use the conviently placed staircase to go upstairs, where he find the mob of Plops. He fights the miniboss. After a few more maps, he finds Whispy Woods. *BOSS FIGHT*. Kirby is back at Waddle's. "Thank you Kirby!" says Waddle. Waddle gives you a ticket to Rainbow Resort for helping him.
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Chapter 2</span>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Day 1</span>
<br/>
(Kirby goes through a few levels to get to the dock) He shows his ticket to the guard, and gets on. He then falls asleep in his cabin. But he wakes up in the middle of the night, because he heard a strange noise coming from outside the cabin... Kirby leaves the room, and sees a surprisingly large amount of enemies! (Maps and levels here) He then reaches the captain's office, to warn him about the invaders. "Captain, Captain! Something's...", but before Kirby could say "wrong", he noticed that there was no captain. The ship was on autopilot. "Great.", Kirby said. He then went off to do it himself. Before long, he found the connection hatch. An enemy boat had connected itself to the ship! Quickly, Kirby fought off the baddies and closed the hatch. He then went back to bed.
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Day 2</span>
<br/>
(This day Kirby just goes around doing side-quests, and the day ends when Kirby goes back to bed)
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Day 3</span>
<br/>
Kirby has a nice time on the ship. Later, when it is time to disembark, Kirby gets in line. Looking ahead, he sees a disturbance ahead. "Hey! It's Kirby! The boss said I had to..." said the figure, and Kirby saw that it was Paint Roller. "You'll never get to Rainbow Resort!" yelled Paint Roller. *BOSS FIGHT*
<br/>
<br/>
*EDIT* By saying this is a bad beginning, I mean it is not soo good... well... It's just not that original of a beginning. I just needed a way for Kirby to get to Rainbow Resort. Also, this dialouge is not exact, it''s just a way to convey the story to you, the reader.
<br/>
*EDIT2* As I said before, each chapter will have one or two enteries. UNLESS differently specified. For this instance, Chapter 2 will have 3 pre-defined days in it.<br/>_________________<br/>Knock-knock.

How does talking with no mouth work? Or is it like the <span style="font-style: italic">Dilbert</span> animated series, in which a small mouth appears whenever the character talks, implying that the lips are just too thin to be seen in most frames?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
