    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to start a post looking at the next incarnation of Nintendo's hand held console .. the DS2? The purpose would be to petition Nintendo with compelling argument for a more open development platform .. something similar to the GP2X.
<br/>
<br/>
It could be argued that if Nintendo opened their platform for modders and developers their user base would grow exponentially and so would their sales ... Case in point; Quake .. where modding and community development was actively encouraged &amp; supported by id software and the end result was a phenomenon much greater than the sum of it's parts .. it certainly didnt do anything to dimish the sale of the game .. and from this modding community spawned Half Life and Counter Strike .. 
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo is obviously fearful of IP issues and encouraging pirates etc  However any DRM technology is circumvented sooner or later ... Nintendo should ask what are actually protecting by locking down the console? Their real IP is in the applications and games .. so my suggestions to them is to move the DRM into the official game cartridges and leave the console open for homebrew apps ... 
<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts/suggestions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They're protecting their revenue stream that comes from manufacturing Game Cards at overinflated prices. Charging publishers per copy for each deployed copy has been the console business model since the Nintendo Entertainment System. Nintendo doesn't want another Tengen making and selling games without a license.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

This is the problem.  As far as I know, I've never seen a GP2X for sale except from the official site, and I've yet to even see one in person.  It might sound good to you, but you are one of a few thousand people interested in modding their system out of a couple MILLION people that have bought the DS just to play with it.

It could also be argued that if Nintendo opened their platform, people would pirate like mad.  There is already a bunch of piracy, but it's very small compared to paying users.  Take, for example, the Dreamcast.  While not "open," its loophole that allowed piracy out of the box was its biggest downfall in the US because noone wanted to buy games anymore.  A system that comes out of the box just begging for piracy will not do well.  Also, your example is invalid.  While Half-Life used the Q2 engine (IIRC), it was an official game developed by Valve, not a modded version of Quake.

They are protecting themselves, the game makers, and YOU.  Remember the Atari 2600?  Yea, that was an 'open' system.  It had no protection, and the mass of shitty third party games virtually KILLED the video game industry.  Look up the ET game, they actaully buried it in mass graves it was so bad.  You also contradict yourself by saying that moving the DRM into the official game cartridge is good.  If it's circumvented sooner or later, like you say all DRM is, then wouldn't it be trivial to play dumps once the code was found out?  And, keep in mind how easy it is to dump a DS cartridge even though we don't know the signed key.
<br/>
<br/>
While an open system is a dream for many on this forum, it is not feasable for Nintendo to do on almost ANY angle.  Sorry.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

I would argue that the level of piracy would remain consistent ... PC's are open systems [ unless you run Vista ;) ] ... game makers in the market are still publishing, still making enormous profits ( World of Warcraft ) .. even though pirating is still a major problem

That is true .. I was thinking of Team Fortress .. ( who where head hunted up by Valve at about the same time of the Half Life release ) .. there are still many other examples of individuals/groups who started out modding quake eg the guy who developed reaper bots went onto work on Unreal

You might care to do some research and maintain some consistency.
<br/>
<br/>
Atari's demise was long after both the c64 &amp; the Amiga and I doubt if either had a major effect. I worked for Atari indirectly during the time when they were busily killing themselves with poor marketing of the Falcon and the Jaguar and putting all their eggs in the wrong basket.
<br/>
<br/>
The demise of the Atari VCS console itself was probably helped along by the poot quality of the games available for it.

Video game DRM has more to do with quality control and licensing of developers than protection of game IP so, yes, it is necessary to lock the entire console down.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

From what I understand about it, the flood of poor quality games (both origonal and remakes) put people off buying video games in general, not just Atari ones, Atari helped crash the entire video game maket by haveing their system so open.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes. There is a lot of piracy going on on the PC, but the casual consumer buys their pc with bundled software and therefore has no need to pirate their software. There are few packages that are not available for pirate downloads at the click of a button; even Maya is available on pirate. And in the past the casual consumer would not have had the same amount of access to pirate software/games as there is today.
<br/>
<br/>
You could give pokemon as an example of a product that was the most pirated, and one of the most successful of all time(I know I usually do). I think it is an ongoing debate with no clear cut answer; many factors go into what effect these attributes have. Maybe the dreamcast had no real appeal to casual gamers and the entire audience who bought it were a demographic with knowledge of the availability of pirate games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As I recall, it was moreso Atari being suddenly overtaken by a bunch of jokers who didn't know (or care) a thing about video games, and proceeding to release a mass of shitty *first* party games.

I think saying "open platform is bad for games because of piracy" runs dangerously close to saying "the RIAA's recent tactics are overall good for the music industry". Now I'm not saying we can't make that argument, but I think if you're going to argue that an open format and low DRM is bad for games, then you must also be prepared to to argue the same for music (or at least provide an explanation of what causes the difference of it being good/bad for games versus music).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.

<br/>
<br/>
I get so sick of this popular "ET sucks, it was buried in mass graves" silliness.  Just because some video game magazine listed ET in its list of worst video games ever with this story doesn't make it entirely true.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it was dumped, but not because it was such a bad game.  The industry was already on its way to collapse.  People weren't buying games like they were before.  Atari hyped and advertised ET, making a huge deal out of it, hoping it would be the killer game that brought everyone back.  And it wasn't.  Partially because it was a mediocre game.  Partially because people didn't care as much anymore.  
<br/>
<br/>
But Atari, thinking it was going to be so huge, massively overproduced carts for the game, which is why they ended up throwing so many away.  
<br/>
<br/>
If you had been a big fan of the 2600 back in the day, you'd know that ET was MUCH better than many of the games that got released in those days.  It just was rather mediocre, and thus wasn't the salvation for the games industry that they expected.
<br/>
<br/>
But alas, now it's cool to think that it's the worst game ever, and single-handedly destroyed the 2600.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Music is a completely different industry altogether. You might be able to play a game at a friends, with a magazine demo, through borrowing or in the shops; but music is constantly played on radios and TV channels everywhere you go. They are completely different industries with different reasons behind a purchase. You buy a game because it is the only way to play it exclusively with the intention of 'clocking' the game; why people buy music that is rotated 24/7 on the radio is possibly down to being able to control what they hear for the 30 or so minutes on their train journey to school/work.
<br/>
<br/>
For example I <span style="font-weight: bold">don't</span> buy CD's because I will never carry round a chunky CD player and most CD's make it impossible/too difficult to make mp3's. Buying mp3's makes much more sense, but why?

As an extension to the idea of people putting music from their CDs onto HD/Flash players (I hate calling them mp3 players, because the mp3 format blows monkey nuts): I submit the fact that I have a HD with HDLoader for PS2 filled <span style="font-style: italic">with games I legally own</span>, and I *LOVE* the convenience of it (plus the fact that it saves wear+tear on the irreplaceable-without-buying-a-new-license discs). So much so, that I'm thinking of doing the same with my XBox (1).
<br/>
<br/>
Devils advocate: From what I've seen, most of the game industry is well aware that everything (worth playing) gets cracked. The big reasons why they still do copy-protection anyway are (not in any order):
<br/>
<br/>
1. Making it non-trivial keeps honest people honest (of course, the ethics  and effectiveness of this part have often been debated).
<br/>
<br/>
2. Most games make most of their sales in the first few weeks after release (although it's debatable whether this is because of the customers or the retailers). So, by the time a game is cracked, it's already made most of its money, so the crack's potential for damage (however little or much that potential may be) is minimized. Of course, this applies mainly to game-specific protection measures, and not platform-wide protections (since systems don't usually get most of their hardware and game sales until after the first year or so - although I suppose you could argue the lack of cracks in the first year or so helps the system gain a foothold so it's already going strong once the cracks do hit, making it less likely to go the way of Dreamcast (of course, the actual reasons for the Dramcast's demise are debatable)).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just been doing some research on this ... and it is an utter fallacy to say that DRM would have protected the games industry from the crash in 1983 ... infact it was the total opposite ... it was the open nature of the new affordable home PC's .. particularly the Commodore 64 and the birth of PC gaming in the early  80's helped kill off the Atari and the console game industry ...  when the Atari ( and other ) systems stopped selling, so did the games and the whole house of cards fell flat on it's face ... but from it's ashes the C64 took off . It is no small coincidence that the C64 was released in August 1982 and the video games industry collapse, which was largely focused around the Atari &amp; other consoles , occured in 1983 .. indeed the aggressive pricing &amp; marketing of the C64 eg a rebate where you could trade in your console systme for $100 against the C64 certainly sealed the console industries fate at that time ... simply put, less consoles in homes = less sales of console games
<br/>
<br/>
Also the Atari and other consoles cartridges where harder and more expenisve to pirate when compared to systems like the C64 ... I remember ( now I am showing my age ) when all you needed was some blank cassettes and you could get oodles of games and apps from friends .. infact the wide availability of games and commercial software and the open nature of the system that fostered a vibrant homebrew scene was one of the major reasons for the C64s success ..</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by binarystar on Tue Apr 10, 2007 1:37 pm; edited 4 times in total</span></div>

That doesn't mean in any way that the homebrew scene will help the DS2. Windows are leading because of consumer identity and stuff like that. Maybe there was a time where shareware games played a part, but they don't any more. Do a short survey, most people use their PC for browsing the internet and writing the occasional word document. In work they use Excel for spreadsheets, Powerpoint for presentations and Access for their databases. Sage would [often] be used by their accountants. The homebrew market is very very small; look at the GP32! Nice and open, better technology than its competitors (at the time). In fact just look at the GBA!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So you don't think a community of developers creating cool mods and ports that can be easily and freely shared amongst DS2 owners would have any bearing on the DS2's market share? Interesting perspective .. 
<br/>
<br/>
here is a scenario ... imagine if you would, that Nintendo did the inconcievable and opened up their DS2 to developers ... on the way to work/school you bump into a friend who has a DS2 system as well ... she has an awesome piece of software that she has written that you would like to run on your DS2 .. say a media player ... you link up ( wirelessly of course ) and transfer the program ... you take your DS2 to work/school .. show your mates and they too get a copy of the program and their mates also get copies and so on and so on ...  the friend who has bought the iPod/PSP is starting to regret his purchase ... and now wants a Nintendo DS2
<br/>
<br/>
This is the kind of marketing that you can not buy .. where advocates of the product ( which include the mod scene )  are out there actively promoting and improving the product for you ... and as the mod community around the device grows, so does the number of mods and apps which increases the number of users, which in turn increases the number of consoles and games sold ...

Shareware games have not really been a major player in the PC world since the days of Doom ... it takes some serious rescources to build a high quality game from scratch these days .. something that a couple of friends sitting around on their weekends cant really do ...
<br/>
<br/>
But if you look at the modding community .. it is alive and growing ... people are creating maps and add ons for the games all the time ... the game engine etc becomes the vehicle for the mod community .. and in general the better the tools and more open the game is to developers .. the better the mods that are churned out by that community .. that being said you still need to have a great product (eg game engine ) to start out with</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by binarystar on Tue Apr 10, 2007 9:36 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

That is true ... I am just trying to illustrate a big picture scenario .. albeit a little idealised .. and I agree there would be a lot of fine details that would need to be worked through ... it would be far easier to work through these details with Nintendo's official backing

Q. What is Nintendo's core business?

A. Consoles, games and accessorries 
<br/>
<br/>
All of the sales in these segments would increase under an open platform ... although as a consumer you could concievably run homebrew games ... I dont think many gamers would be content with them .. homebrew  games just cant compete with the quality of official titles ( as you pointed out .. look at the shareware games currently available on the PC ) .. mods of offical titles may be a different story .. but you would still legally need a legit copy of that game title to run the mod

No, the <span style="font-style: italic">import</span> market is very very small. There's a vibrant homebrew market on the Windows Mobile platform. If any Game Park or GPH product were available in United States retail chains where potential customers could try it in person, it would likely have sold many more units.

-Both screens touchable.

-Faster wifi.

-Xbox 360-like ability to pull up the system menu and play your own music during games. (Hell, every console should have this, it kicks ass.)

-Media player in firmware (or sold on game cards using the MicroSD slot) supporting MP3, OGG, FLAC, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, AVI, MPEG.
<br/>
-PDA software available.
<br/>
-Faster wifi.
<br/>
-FPU, MMU and (obviously) faster CPU and more RAM.

The Xbox360 is running an OS in the background, so games never have complete control over the system. 
<br/>
<br/>
I say that homebrew on the DS is fun because we have complete control over it. If you don't like the wifi or file system libraries you can write new ones. Linux is running because it can get dedicated access to the hardware. Quake is running because the hardware can be pushed to its limits without the restriction of an OS. 
<br/>
<br/>
As Lynx said, what you seem to want is less like an upgraded DS and more like a portable PC.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I'm not going to go out and replace my SD cards with MicroSD cards plus adapters. And there's no regular SD to MicroSD converter. Even if there were, it would be clumsy. And I'd still rather get a device that just uses regular SD instead of getting something that uses MicroSD and then have to also buy an adapter.

Most of the reasons I didn't get a PSP are no longer valid (high price, lack of good games), or I realized I don't personally care about (low battery life - Don't care 'cause I never play on the go). The only thing holding me back right now (other than the fact I really shouldn't be buying a new system right now) is the insanely slow load times.

It's easy to list all the things we would like in a system, but not mention price.  I think Sony is great at that..  Look at the PS3..

Of course, buying a DS with homebrew equipment isn't all that much cheaper.  Consider that for the best homebrew support for both GBA and DS, a slot-2 device with RAM is recommended.  So we'll be generous and say $130 for a new DS, $40 for a non-Rumble Supercard (mine was $50), a $20 NoPass device, and a $10 media card, and you're up to $200 right there.  
<br/>
<br/>
You can probably shave off the $10 if you already have the media card, or the $20 NoPass device if you buy an Action Replay DS, flash your system, and return it, but still, the fact remains that it costs money to enable homebrew support on the DS, which must be factored into the price.

That's good to hear. I guess I'll have to take another look. I did already know the wrestling game was an extreme case, but the one's I've looked at in the store kiosks still seemed to have agonizingly slow and frequent loads: ATV, some interesting-looking blob or ball puzzle game, and I think some baseball game. Even if most games do have good load times, I think I'll still wait to see if the rumored new model shows up.

I've seen used ones for as low as $140. And that was before the official price drop. I wouldn't be surprised to see ones around $115 or less now. Also, a PC doesn't have Crush, the new Lemmings game, the new Ghosts and Goblins, the new "Dracula X", etc. Exclusives are the only reasons I ever buy handhelds.

Other than the "# of good games vs. price" (which I would have agreed strongly with a few months ago), I'm completely with you on those complaints. But, annoying as they are, they're not dealbreakers for me, personally. Don't blame you for not getting one though.

But if you don't need GBA compatibility (just like the PSP isn't backward-compatible to Sony's previous PocketStation or CLIE handhelds), and you don't need to back up save data on your DS Game Card, then you can get away with a $130 DS + $40 R4 (incl. microSD writer) + $15 microSD card. All this is still cheaper than a $200 PSP, which can't even play homebrew because it comes with a version of PSP firmware out of the box that is not yet downgradable.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

That's true if you want DS and GBA support and a fair bit of storage space. You can get away with a DS and a Slot-1 card with a bit of built-in flash memory, or a small MicroSD card, for a lot less.

<br/>
But again, you have to decide on your market prior to design.  I personally have no idea what Nintendo was planning.  But, they snagged me.. I'm not a gamer by any means, and if it wasn't for the touch screen and wifi, I wouldn't have givin it a glance when I walked buy it on display.  But, I saw the hardware used and though, "Damn, that's slick, better then my $100 PDA for only $50 more!"  Of course, it's not "corporate" approved for meetings like a Palm, but still.
<br/>
<br/>
PSP = Portable Games, Portable Video/Audio Player.. that's it.
<br/>
I don't care about portable games, and I already have a portable DVD player that cost a lot less ($80).
<br/>
<br/>
As for the DS, I'm still not sure why I like it.  I bought a crap load of games I never play (I should auction them) for reasons I still don't know.  I guess Nintendo did a great job of sucking in the middle age technogeeks.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You might be right, but I think Nintendo is actually profiting from hardware sales. They get the stuff for a low price, because they're mass producing/ordering the parts.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

With the VIA Luke .. the CPU, GPU &amp; north bridge are all on the same silicon .. so it might? make a good choice for a hand held gaming device ... especially if it doesnt have to shunt too many pixels .. not sure how well the 3D core will perform .. but surely it should be able to handle games like Quake 2?

No. Sega, Atari, and 3DO licensed the Sony/Philips CD-ROM patents for their systems. Nintendo used carts for the N64 because an optical drive with the kind of access time the first party developers wanted was prohibitively expensive to manufacture until 2000 when Panasonic showed its mini-DVD-ROM drive to Nintendo.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The game includes a plastic sheet covered with large colored circles, which is spread out on the floor. Any number of people can play, though more than four is a tight fit.

<br/>
The game has one spinner, divided into quarters by color; each quadrant specifies left foot, right foot, left hand, or right hand. After spinning, the combination is called; players must move the part to a matching location. No two people can have a part on the same circle (rules are different for more people). Due to the scarcity of colored circles, players will often be required to put themselves in unlikely or precarious positions, eventually resulting in someone's fall.

I like that. Not only would it be good for DS compatibility, but it would be great for over-head shooters like Ikaruga, while still retaining widescreen ability for other games.
<br/>
<br/>
Only potential problem I can see though, is the inability to close the clamshell while in vertical mode. People might end up trying to close it anyway (perhaps out of habit) and break the screen off the hinge.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.

People earlier were talking of open development, I can't believe no one has mentioned Microsoft's XNA Game Studio Express, which allows homebrewers to code for the 360. Similarly, I found this awhile ago: <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_homebrew#Official_Avenues" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_homebrew#Official_Avenues</a>
<br/>
<br/>
As for people saying, "why not DRM games, my DVD player can play DRM'd movies, but if I wanna play my own content I can just burn a DVD and pop it in..." First of all, I challenge someone to find a recent DRM effort that hasn't been broken within the first 6 months of release, secondly, where talking about CODE, not media content. So through homebrew'd code, people could exploit security holes to allow piracy, and the like, not to mention viruses...
<br/>
<br/>
Some of the things that I think would be probable that I would suggest for DS2:
<br/>
More power (obvious) most of all more ram, and more processor capability (FPU etc.)
<br/>
Cut down on the power cycles (quit to main menu without power cycle.)
<br/>
Firmware updatability (while this would would squash us homebrewers, its always nice to be able to improve a console after its been released.)
<br/>
Virtual console for DS (most likely is GBX, less likely is third party (game gear etc.) least likely is NES, SNES, and ...n64? with the ability to use ones you've already purchased on the Wii (Mac:iPod::Wii:DS?)
<br/>
analogue stick (anyone who is calling the PSP schtick an joystick can... do something bad.) at least make it work better than the PSPs...
<br/>
<br/>
Internal flash memory (please no whirring hard drives.)
<br/>
<br/>
Less likely wishes:
<br/>
TV-out
<br/>
non-proprietary external memory (microSD etc.)
<br/>
someone beat me to the OLED screens (no cracks!!) but i will take it a step further and say... FLEXIBLE OLED screens! (at least the top, who knows, maybe this could be applied with some hip tech to detect what the heck you're doing to the screens and apply that to the game...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When I first saw PSPs analog stick, I thought it was made of Supermansuit-fabric and it would feel like a "button". I thought it would be really sensitive (like a nipple) so when you apply pressure from the left side, the "button" would not move to the right, but more like sink in at the left side.

<br/>
<br/>
I think we should let the lame brain people at whatever corp decided this and not us. Whatever it will be I will not be playing crazy or barely. I could imagine a 99 year old man waiting in line in Japan for the NDS and then going to the Wii thing saying  ( when are they going to show us the mother ship already? )
<br/>
<br/>
While HD loaders are great the problem is the games are built for discs and a HD loader is no diffrent then a flashed Atari cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you something. These systems hand held and even consoles of today is out of our leage and is not of us. We will never be able to do the impossible as what they did before us. Only features on top features.
<br/>
<br/>
CC64 is a computer like an Apple but a Apple is like a game system. In fact the development of Sega Saturn games was on Apple PC computers. 
<br/>
They have perfect emulators for the Saturn that could run on a old Apple PC ( most likely G3).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Real Developers, creators, designers, engeniers, or whatever could give a rat patute about features like RGB or Pi scale nonsense. If it can go threw Analog it is good enough for the so called developers.
<br/>
<br/>
A GBA CAN PLAY PORTABLE WMV, MOV, MPEG, and even if I am not mistaken DIVX files. You can even convert movies to such type.
<br/>
A portable DVD player is too big to carry on the train ( unless it is split like a cassete tape player ).  
<br/>
<br/>
GP32 is a PDA design to be a game system.
<br/>
<br/>
The PSP is used mostly for emulation like any other handheld or PDA from 199? thank god that people are doing this or else we would probably the umpteenth release of pac-man fever. Still there is good enough populus to create such games. If you grew up in the 90's ( but I literially grewed up in the 90's ) buying a PSP loaded with roms is the best thing for you right now ( unless your thing is not playing games while your outside).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Neo Nintendo is just a bunch of sick twisted punks now. They have no heart not anymore and not forever. The last time Nintendo had a heart was before they realize that they were going to give sony the rights to publish games. They let the FX chip go to there heads which lead them to the stagering N64 years that held up with there domination of the handlheld market and pokemon.
<br/>
<br/>
The Wii is like a SNES but with no challenge and the NDS should have been the gameboy 3d.
<br/>
<br/>
flash devices can play Mp3. Mp3 is the standard qaulity unless you want to count SPC and GCM along with FM qaulity. There is other formats also but mp3 is the standard.
<br/>
<br/>
The bios is a game systems OS. There is billions of OS, Bios, programing langauges, and formats out there. 
<br/>
<br/>
This is not a Nintendo fourm. It is a game creating community towards GBA development. Mostly people who understands programing 
<br/>
or wants a 2d game on the most respected handheld is posting on the forums.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo only had the gameboy regular size cart and cut in half. They could go back to the regular size carts anytime they want to. In fact if nobody like the gba carts they where ready to this and some games are just as big as the original gb carts.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

Your wording is very confusing but what do you think Nintendo has been striving to do since forever? Revolutionize. Nintendo has proved time and time again that there is always a way to redefine gaming. There is still original material left and we haven't hit the point where all we can do is better faster technologies.

How is Wii like a SNES? Well they're both gaming systems. So according to you an Apple PC is like a GP32... oh wait I forgot, GP32 is a PDA.
<br/>
No challenge? My skill level on Wii tennis is over 2100, that took effort, and overall gaming experience and strategy. Sure anything is easy if you spend enough time at it. (not to mention the 'challenge' of a game system is 99.9% determined by the game developer, not the system.)

But it might be useful on the DS with some optimization. The DS ARM9 runs at 400% the speed of the GBA ARM7, and if parts can be rewritten in ARM9 assembly language to work around limitations of GCC's optimizer, it might produce 12 fps, or enough for cel animation and non-action movies, with more quality per kbps than DPG.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The Wii is along with the PS3 and 360 is overkill for 3d gaming and the SNES is considered the overkill for 2d gaming. It is considered an overall and multiple usage system. So is the Wii. The only diffrence is with the SNES it was a challenge for you to create a 3d game or 2d and have realistic motion and figures. There is no Wii challenge.

there still is a challenge when developing games; it has a lot to do with creating and organizing tons of resources that are being displayed throughout the game... oh, yeah, and coming up with a game (story, design, game play), that too.

Yes, I know Nintendo didn't invent any of the technologies and some of them they obviously weren't the first to use them in games, but nintendo put them to good use, of course maybe a few of them flopped. (virtual boy, IR capabilities for GBC...) But look what has happened:

First of all I've changed your post a bit, because I've never heard anyone else say anything like this. You're entitled to your opinion.
<br/>
Are you saying its a bad thing that its easy to program for a system? Why don't we just all focus on programming entirely in binary just because its a challenge? Game systems are made to sell, not made to be a challenge for developers, the challenge should be making the best use of the hardware possible.
<br/>
I do believe that graphics don't make a game, but they can break a game, (look at far cry for Wii...) for one thing there is more going on here than better graphics technologies, from NES to SNES there is more buttons on the controller, allowing for more versatile games. If the only difference between generations of game consoles was processing power then I don't think very many will have sold.  (picture state-of-the art graphics with an atari paddle controller) Also, even though there are a lot of games that look pretty, graphics can have a huge part to play in gameplay, remember playing a NES game when too many sprites where on the screen? Lag and flickering graphics effect gameplay, so what do you do? You bump up the technology and no longer have that problem.

A great example is Shenmue on Sega Saturn which is the eqaul to Vice City or Zelda but the diffrence is that Shenmue was on a much lesser system and if released would have broken down barriers of what we can and can not do on 32-bit console. 
<br/>
<br/>
Instead it was released on the Dreamcast which pretty much overkill and thus the game has no long term effect besides details and realism.
<br/>
<br/>
My point is if you make a game on a system like SNES or Saturn and it was good. Your work would be even more respected then creating anything for any of these new systems.
<br/>
<br/>
Like me trying to revive a dead plant even when it has be turned to dust. People would be dazzled by my achievement rather then the person who grew the same plant that looks perfect over my rebirthed plant.
<br/>
<br/>

It is called a feature not an invention. Me making rumble devices for my controller or system would do no harm as long as I do not make it for there system. This problem is dumb since you have toys that rumble or use the ball thingy or whatever.

I understand what you're getting at here, but not upgrading the game system just for this cause is definitely not worth it. The XBox 360 has a bunch of new games that are small and in 2D on the Xbox live arcade. To run these small games on a big powerful system can be considered 'overkill' I guess, but these are cheap games made with a low budget, and there are plenty of other high performance games for the system out there, much more of them that are available on the Xbox 360 arcade. What would you have Nintendo do? Continue to support the NES and SNES while they make Wii games up to their full potential? Easier than that would be to let everyone chuck their old decrepit gray plastic systems and release all their old favorites on the new system, as an added bonus there are no cartridges to blow on! The fact is that the majority of average gamers out there can't stand ugly graphics. (one of the specific reasons none of my friends want to bother playing Quake 1 with me...) Nowadays, the NES is "cool" because retro is "cool". The same could be said about the SNES and the Genesis to a point. But the N64... its got ugly 3D graphics and was <span style="font-style: italic">sooo middle school</span>. So me, the average gamer, goes and spends a fortune on an XBox360 and buys up all those crappy games with "realistic" bouncing anime boobs. Considering thats what the majority does, you can't blame Sony, Microsoft, or even Nintendo for wanting to upgrade their systems regularly. Business is business.
<br/>
And considering the last statement of the above quote, just because a game is difficult to pull off on a system doesn't mean it sells well. It all boils down to gimmicks, back in the day when a game was advertised as <span style="font-style: italic">3D!</span> people were eager to see it in action, but many of those doom clones had <span style="font-style: italic">nada</span> in the way of gameplay, which is usually a must for a best selling game. On the flip-side, take a game like Wii Sports, my grandma, parents, and even some of my pre-WWII era teachers played it and enjoyed it. In the way of graphics this game doesn't stand a chance to anything else, even many games on the Wii beat it in that department. Games like Red Steel achieved great lengths in the way of graphics on the Wii, especially for a release title. But go to your local new and used game store, and see how many used copies of Red Steel are gathering dust.

My point wasn't that Sony borrowed tech from nintendo, but that after Sony saw how excited everyone was getting about the Wii Remote, they decided to try to give Sony fanboys another excuse why they didn't need a Wii. Well, lemme rephrase that. I said earlier that Nintendo obviously didn't invent or pioneer any of this technology for games, but they put it to quality use in the mainstream market, how many of those Sidewinders actually sold? Where they still no where to be found on the shelves 5 months into their release? (btw, it was completely coincidental that all the examples off the top of my head are Sony borrowing ideas from Nintendo...)

All Nintnedo ever did was nothing but mass produce playing cards. It was Gumpei Yoko with his idea to move into the video game market and his light gun game idea that is still in effect.

Gumpei Yoko saved the company since the inheritance who went into all kinds of venture with the business failed eventually.

The point is when Nintendo released the Nintendo in Amerika they used advertisment schemes to push there games. Nintendo in Amerika is just a front and barely did anything besides the VHS Nintendo Home Entertaiment advertisment.

Most US items is just really good advertments. Like the God Auwful place I had to work at.

Nights was just a simple game and more important was the Saturns Show baot game. The game itself is fun and had great graphics but that is what most show boat games are about.
<br/>
<br/>
The same could be said for Sonic Adventure, the original Sonic on Gen, Super Mario World,
<br/>
<br/>
The thing about Nights it could be displayed in 2d and would barely be affected by the transition. The game had an entirely diffrent atmosphere from the last system, and plays like a shooter and was an adventure but you never did any real shooting, adventuring, or anything negative.
<br/>
<br/>
Nights is more like a puzzle game that is extremly simple and extremly fun. Night have no boundaries and was just there to show boat. If we was to make a Nights sequel it would just be more of the same original game.
<br/>
<br/>
When I say ground breaking game. We are talking about something that is 
<br/>
completely diffrent and new. The thing is you can never make another game like Nights because it would still be Nights. 
<br/>
<br/>
The sad part about Nights is that Sega did make a couple of games that is using the same system and those games are Panzer Dragon and Ecco.
<br/>
<br/>
So the correct ground breaking game in the Nights class would be Ecco. Since Nights is just Ecco with no gravity and fights with simple movments rather then charging and talking.

So you are calling what took over two years from 1994 to make on the Saturn only to be ported to a system that could probably do ten times the amount of work barely using any power a cheap game and low budget?
<br/>
<br/>
The thing is these new sapposive Back To The Future systems is cost effective and the technology is cheaper then rain water. Saying that a 2d game is low budget is a horrifically wrong thing. Back then the big thing was Animation and it cost alot of money to make. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now everything is 3d made by people who could never draw for there lives. It is super cheaper then before. The fact I could recycle the same characters over and over again as many times as I want and is clearly is what they are doing now.

A great example is how HAL at Nintendo suddenly forgot Kirby flies in Kirby: Crystal Shards and instead gave us Super Smash Brothers Kirby and 2D view point that is slightly upgraded.

There is many FPS besides DOOM. The main aproach of DOOM was to creep out the player while putting miles and miles of so called demonic

(which there is no such thing ) creatures. Also while 3d was new this was the style of DOOM. There has been many other FPS games besides DOOM.

So now we are going to have a whole generation who is going to try and mug people Red Steal style. I could just see somebody holding up a store with a Wiimote and then trying to knock out the store manager at the same time.

Red Steel ( give me a break ) is terrible in graphics and while it does okay the characters are still deformed. The Graphics in Red Steel barely went threw a conversion of any sort.

I am sure Red Steel is lying in stacks somewhere gathering much dust like many games. You could use the most cheapest graphics in 2d or 3d and still have the greatest game ever made.

Pokemon never broke any barriers it was a one hit wonder that could have been around for ages but then porky chorkies and Nintendo said lets build a cheap battery and then dump the original game.
<br/>
<br/>
If Pokemon did something great ( but not the first to have ) it was the most recognized monster battle system game on the face of the planet. While there was Digi-Mon, Meta-Bots, Robopon, Custom Robo, Robot Treck, and Power Bots there has been many of these games out there.
<br/>
Pokemon was a good thing for the world of gaming that should have been put out of it's misery long time ago. 
<br/>
<br/>
Tony Hawks Pro Skater just looks nice in graphics and they would promote the living daylights out of the games. The last good skating game was Skate Or Die. Tony Hawks Pro Skater was just a cheap attack at implusive buyers parents wallets. I never brought one of these games ever in my life

What the heck is wrong with something being cheaper and better? Also, do  a little experiment. Drop a game cartridge from 2 stories on top of a piece of ply-wood. Do the same with a disc.

Although many people impulsively bought Doom because of what you refer to, it continued in popularity because of John Carmack's genius. He was and excellent programmer for the PC, so therefore the Doom engine could run on a large part of the systems that were around at the time. He also does wonders with gameplay, another reason the <span style="font-style: italic">original</span> Doom games are played online to this day.

Nobody demanded anything it was just cheaper to use discs. The NDS is still a gameboy and carrying around a disc in your hands is stupid. Just look at the thingys PSP games come with.

Also with carts you could install 3d accellerator chips. Do you think people would put up with buying more save batteries but now for pocket?

Again the cart system use flash which is fast enough to load while being still. If you check the prices out Solid HD cost thousands of dollars compared to standard record moving HD we have in our PC's.

<br/>
Lastly Nintendo only switched over to the disc system since it was starting to cost more to produce carts then sell them.

You standards is way to high and you have been playing Back to the Future too many times. Sit down and break open a can of Starfox, VerTrix,  Sega Saturn, or even better 32X. I rather not look into the looking glass anymore. The GameCube was and is good enough for me.

A great example is that Virtua Fighter is just Fighter and the whole game never changed one bit. You could play the 32X game and it would be just as good as the VF4 on PS3. The Saturn game is perfect to it's PS3 counter part.

What does HD have to do with making a Videogame. Those are just fancy words. You do not need to use entire resources to make a game. You just need to know how to program, have a little music and art talent, and be able to make a convincing script.

No Final Fantasy VII was on the PSX instead of the N64 the fact they wanted to use FMV scenes which practically an entire disc. Then when they wanted to load the sound and sprite data but they would have to reprint the same data to all three discs.
<br/>
<br/>
It is like having three of the same discs with FMV taking up most of the room and the true game data is a small portion of the disc.
<br/>
<br/>
This would be a really great project to work on. We just need to remove the load disc and replace the FMV with real 3d and maybe use an alternative media format.
<br/>
<br/>
All PSX Final Fantasy games could have been on the N64 with proper care but they never went to that extreme and decided video was better over the true graphics of the system.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You seem to think less powerful systems are better because when you make a nice-looking game on very limited hardware, it's a challenge to code and people say "wow, you did that on such weak hardware?" whereas with powerful systems it's easy to pull off the same effects and people say "what, all this powerful hardware and that's the best you can do?". You're thinking from a coder's point of view, not a game designer's. Why don't you code for some older systems yourself?
<br/>
<br/>
When someone has an idea for a game they want the final product to be as close to their idea as possible. Take for example Super Mario 64. On the N64, it's not pushing the hardware to its limits. It's not impressive from a technical standpoint at all. But it's a damn fun game. If it had been for the SNES, it would have been amazing that they pulled it off, but I doubt the game would have looked as nice or been nearly as fun, and the cartridges would have undoubtedly been more expensive.
<br/>
<br/>
To make a long story short you seem to want people to say "wow, look what this guy did with such weak hardware", while most people want people to say "wow, look how fun this game is". Otherwise, I suspect a lot of Nintendo's games would have had better graphics. ;) I suggest you get into coding for the Game Boy or Super NES. Game Boy is a weak system but its nice design lets you really push the hardware far beyond what people would think was possible. Super NES is surprisingly powerful for its age, and you can use the nice things like Mode7 and tile priority to pull off amazing effects. (Not to mention with homebrew, you don't have to worry about the manufacturing cost if you want to add in an SA-1 or use a 6MB ROM. :p)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A few portable DVD players include NES emulators that have very low compatibility: they're good enough to run a few commercial games, but that's about it. I once <a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.parodius.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1179" target="_blank">tried writing a book reader for NES</a>, but the emulator that the requestor tried to run it on didn't like the mid-screen VRAM bankswitching required to fill a screen with text.
<br/>
<br/>
Does your console's NES emulator emulate the color artifacts of NTSC, which the graphics in games such as <span style="font-style: italic">Blaster Master</span> depended on to create a richer palette than the NES's own 4 colors per tile? That might be hard to do unless your console allows for creating a non-standard composite or S-video signal using 227.333 color subcarrier periods per line rather than 227.5, or unless it has a component output to allow programs such as Nestopia to emulate the NTSC artifacts in software.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I'm also sick and tired of files passed off as 'NES ROMs' that only work in Nesticle. Almost any other emulator works better. You could, of course, write for GBA instead, because GBA will also run on PC/GBA/NDS. You don't have to though (it is easier just to write a program on PC).

<br/>
<br/>
Which portable DVD players have NES emulators?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know a lot about color artifacts in NTSC, but this game console system is still in the process of being created! (Eventually I will create a message board to discuss things about this new game console system. Part of it will be private until finished. If you want access to the private section (including some files that I already have) you must tell me sometime). (I am still waiting for a shipment from China!)
<br/>
<br/>
My console can use an NES emulator loaded from a DVD or USB (if the DVD/USB contains a file indicating how to start), or if a NES emulator is installed into the internal programs menu, then you can use the file manager to load *.NES files. Software written for this console will be similar to standard Linux software, so it can be compiled with GCC or similar, although the source code will still need to be modified to work with this console system (if it isn't written specifically for this console system, it probably just won't run at all). An open-source NES emulator for Linux will probably be ported to this system.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Are you saying windows is 'Open' or it has a wide gap for development because of SDKs
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo DS is a console, meaning it uses its own hardware, SOFTWARE/FIRMWARE and EVERYTHING IS ITS OWN.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo DS is NOT comparable to a Windows. One is a OS, the other, is a Console/firmware unit. One is a piece of software compatible to many systems, the other, is closed up and based on only its own hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS doesnt use data storage devices openly availible and editable. They are manufactured with factory equipment, not card readers with PCs.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS isnt a OS, which is why it doesnt offer open development of software. However, if we all paid an extra 100$ whenn we bought our DS, and we got a dummy card, a card reader, and a SDK? Would it worth it,
<br/>
<br/>
Ask yourself this, and you'll know. 
<br/>
<br/>
the Gains for Nintendo. Doesnt need to License its software etc. and just can watch people make free and proprietary software (However, wouldnt this oxymoron that trial that saved Nintendo's ass <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Galoob_Toys%2C_Inc._v._Nintendo_of_America%2C_Inc." target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Galoob_Toys%2C_Inc._v._Nintendo_of_America%2C_Inc.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a limited market due to the DS's Limited power.
<br/>
<br/>
The Losses, No Licensing money, no control of the market, they have total control over how things sell, prices are almost ALWAYS the same, they have all games licensed, meaning if they dont prefer of it getting on the DS, it doesnt have to go through.
