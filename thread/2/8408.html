    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hullo, I've talked in the past about developing for the GBA. I've visited a few development channels on IRC, but I've only recently decided to check out these forums.

Really I have nothing to offer this community, and am kind of wary about making this Hi I am new thread... but I must have missed any mention in the FAQ about these sorts of things.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, hi, I am here to hope some of the stuff rubs off on me.<br/>_________________<br/>[ <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dakedesu.info" target="_blank">Main Site</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://krfp.dakedesu.info/" target="_blank"> Kid Radd Fan Project</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.dakedesu.info/" target="_blank">Forums</a> ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Good luck with your gbadev!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When I first came here, all I knew about programming was a bunch of stuff in Pascal (which doesn't really transfer over to anything useful on the GBA), and a few things in C/C++ (like how to create a variable, store a value in it, some basic math).
<br/>
<br/>
But thanks to these forums, I have learned quite a bit.  (I've forgotten a lot since it's been over a year since I've seriously programmed)  That aside, I can pretty much guarantee (as long as you stay away from Piracy-related topics) that you will learn here.  May I suggest downloading a good emulator if you haven't already (I like VisualBoyAdvance), then going to the Demos section and finding something that includes source code.  I learned a lot from there.  And The Pern Project has a gret GBA tutorial.
