<span style="color: #e0ffe0">I that grammar has a lot to play in this aswell. If you use poor grammar it is sometimes difficult to read when the words are written properly. Apart from that and a few unfamiliar words, a lot of what tepples was saying was understandable.
<br/>
<br/>
And as slang has shown, context can allow you to fully understand a sentence with key words removed or replaced with a word never heard before. </span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And then there's the "fcuk"(French Connections UK) clothing range. I can't tell you one time when I've looked at it and thought of it as f.c.u.k; especially when their tops have sentences on them like, "I just love to fc...".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
