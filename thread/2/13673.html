    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here is some ideas I have for new devices/software of Nintendo Wii that I would like to see:<ul>
<br/>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Wii SuperModChip:</span> Does things that a normal modchip can do, GameCube homebrew on normal DVDs, region-free GameCube/Wii games, USB to connect drive data, flash memory read/write by USB, and ability to use Bluetooth, SD card, USB ports, internet, and other stuff in GameCube mode if the switch is set.
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Wii Macro Recorder:</span> Has some buttons and display, and bluetooth, audio input, audio output, SD card slot, can be used to record/play macros on Nintendo Wii, copy files to/from SD card, possibly even connect a keyboard. You could even record a macro to auto-start the GameCube or Wii software. Or use a real keyboard on web browser channel. Possibly even upload/download files on web browser channel, even trial web browser channel. Download by pushing RECORD button and send data to audio, macro recorder will receive file and save it, to upload you can use PLAY button and upload using simulated presses of Wiimote, writing javascript on the web-site to read and recognize it and upload. It can even run any program on SD card to do whatever you want, and even display the time when it isn't being used. Does not require opening up or modifying Nintendo Wii or Wiimotes.
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">WiiPay.php:</span> Lets you use the payment function of Nintendo Wii on your computer. You can pay any amount of money for anything on Wii shop channel, without requiring download. Maybe even things that they don't sell. Even using Wii point-card numbers to pay for it.
<br/>
</li></ul><br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
