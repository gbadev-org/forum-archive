    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This idea crawled up my mind when someone said
<br/>
that you should port Counter Strike: Source (note the
<br/>
"Source") to the PSP. Then someone said that It'd could
<br/>
be possible to convert CS 1.6 to the NDS and I must admit
<br/>
I like that idea. So my question is:
<br/>
Is it possible to convert, not remake, a HL1 based CS for the
<br/>
Nintendo DS?
<br/>
<br/>
With convert I mean, the engine is the same for NDS as for CS in working
<br/>
with the game but I guess differences in the way it works with
<br/>
the hardware are necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: If it's possible, would anyone do it? :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not without the source code. Or you could try writing up a detailed proposal (including a proof of concept port of Quake 1, which the original HL is based on) and submitting it to Valve.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Keep in mind that PC development is still a long, long way from handheld.  I'm sure that the original source code has local statck arrays that are bigger than the entire RAM area of the DS.  PC developers just don't have to worry about the constraints we do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
HL1 is the engine that's the source code and binaries,
<br/>
could it be possible to at least make a CS 1.5 based version with it?
<br/>
Because 1.5 is a mod version for the non steam hl, I mean.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by DerRidda on Fri Jul 29, 2005 7:30 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A CS style game came to my mind as well althought I don't think a straight port is possible. I guess an engine has to be written from scratch.
<br/>
<br/>
Considering the wifi features of the DS this game would definitly rock.

<br/>
NDS Online-Multplayer FPS' to be
<br/>
announced even if it's limited to 4 players
<br/>
there are some games out there which could
<br/>
be ported from the N64 to the NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
Like a Turok Rage Wars port! Would be great to see that.
