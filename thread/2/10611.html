Let him touch you with his noodly appendage!
<br/>
<br/>
I like Pastafarianism (Ramen), although I don't publicly support it (it's more difficult to wear a pirate costume all day then you think).
<br/>
<br/>
Seriously I like to think there is something or someone watching over us all, but really I think science is the way forward and religons are nothing but trouble.
<br/>
<br/>
They've caused more pain and death than things like politics and they end up surviving because people are indoctrinated at a young age (ever remember you parents asking if you wanted to be Christian/Muslim/Atheist/etc?) without being given a choice.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

Not that there's really any way to prove anything, but the statement that you wouldn't care given proof is a pretty brave one.
<br/>
<br/>
I, for one, would think that if it was proved without a doubt to me that I would be tortured for eternity if I didn't live my life here a certain way, I'd be pretty dang quick to try to live that way.  (I'd posit that you'd be stupid not to).  You'd have to be a fool or incredibly brave to NOT care about eternal reward/punishment, IF it were a proven thing (which it probably never will be)
<br/>
<br/>
I think for most people, it comes down to the fact that, whether you are religious or don't care, it's pretty much impossible for us to prove or disprove most religious ideas.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Humans are arrogant.  Many if not most religions have this human centric view of the universe that just seems silly to me.
<br/>
<br/>
Consider:
<br/>
There is not designer.  The universe just is.
<br/>
<br/>
In this case, life is what you make of it.  You can be a saint.  Cool.  You can wage wars.  Sucks for them.  In the end, everyone is going to die and that is the end.  Feels kind of... empty doesn't it?  That is the reason why a whole bunch of people don't want believe this.
<br/>
<br/>
Consider:
<br/>
There is a designer, but humans are insignificant to the designer.
<br/>
<br/>
A divine designer made the universe.  Why?  Bored maybe?  Science fair project?  Who knows, but it wasn't made *for* the current dominant species of one planet in the universe.  We were just a side effect.  The designer may have glanced this way once or twice but there is so much more to see.  When we die we're certainly not going to have to answer to the designer.  We are not the point of the universe.
<br/>
<br/>
Consider:
<br/>
False gods that collect followers and break promises.
<br/>
<br/>
Who says that divine beings can't lie.  Holy books?  Fiction?  The divine beings themselves?  What if divine (or least superhuman) beings prop themselves up as gods and collect followers.  Then they promise eternal happiness to get people to sign up.  After you sign up and arrive in the next world, you find out that it is nothing like what was promised.  Politicians trick hopeful people all the time.  Who is to say that supernatural beings can't and don't do the same?
<br/>
<br/>
Consider:
<br/>
Heaven and hell don't exist.  The love of the One True Creator is actually unconditional.
<br/>
<br/>
They say that you can rule by love or fear.  Heaven and hell sound like scare tactics to me.  God loves you, so don't do bad things doesn't pack much of a punch.  Ok... ruling by love didn't work.  Let's try fear.  If you do bad things, you will go to hell *forever*.  You will suffer for an eternity.  Think about it, 60 years as a good person now, or an eternity of eternal suffering in the flames of hell.  Much better!  I think people will pay attention.  That doesn't sound like unconditional love to me.  It sounds more like something that people made to keep other people in line.  If there is One True Creator, I'd like to believe that this creator loves the diversity of universe, and doesn't make arbitrary judgements based of morals of any given society or religion.
<br/>
<br/>
Consider:
<br/>
Heaven and hell exist, but the divine standard is completely different from the human standard.
<br/>
<br/>
Who says that the criteria for entry into heaven or hell can even be understood by humans?  Alright, why do you believe them?  The divine standard might be so simple or so complex or so odd that humans couldn't even make sense of it.
<br/>
<br/>
Consider:
<br/>
You keep replaying your life until you get it right.
<br/>
<br/>
Same scenario, you lose your memory each game.  =)
<br/>
<br/>
Consider:
<br/>
Life is score based.
<br/>
<br/>
Who knows, longest life?  Actual life span over potential life span?  Most offspring?  Most interesting life?  Least percentage of time sleeping?  Some other really complex algorithm?
<br/>
<br/>
Consider:
<br/>
When you die, you are born again as all the people you ever met.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll break out of a reincarnation loop when the planet dies.
<br/>
<br/>
Given these possibilities (some of which do not conflict) and whole bunch of others I could list or invent (some of which I did), how am I supposed to decide what to believe?  Even given proof, can I trust it?  It might be the divine word of the One True Creator.  A demon might be tricking me.  A benevolent supernatural entity might be trying to help me.  I might just be insane.
<br/>
<br/>
You say I'm brave?  I don't think so.  I don't see any other reasonable response.  Worrying about such things now is silly.  I'm going on a trip in two days.  I'll stay in a hotel for two days and worry about where to stay the last day when I get there.  I'll worry about the next world, if there is one, when I get there.  No point worrying about something that might not exist.  If there is some judge who is going to punish me for that, I can't see it is a good and positive entity.

Some things to think about here, mostly said by sgeos.
<br/>
<br/>
Unless you think on some level that there is something out there, that we do have a purpose, you'd feel empty and worthless.
<br/>
<br/>
Religon is a way to explain things that happen, or at least it was before science.

Thats just insane. So because we're here, then there has to be someone ruling us(god(s))?
<br/>
<br/>
Religions teach us to be better people, to get on with eachother, to behave. But dispite (or because of) the thousands of religions we still missbehave, we dont get on, we wage wars, we kill for no reason, we torture people and animals. 
<br/>
<br/>
If there were no religions, we would be closer to civilisation. It will be many hundreds if not thousands of years (if we last that long) before humans will be civil to eachother. So give up religion now, then there will be thousand less reasons for people to hate eachother.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides there are squillions of stars out there, most of them with planets, some of those planets with life (estimated by scientists that about .002% of planets in the univers will have life, and like bill gates' bank account, .002% is a realy realy huge number) then why do these holy books, some apparently spoken by a god him/herself, no mention any of these? and even refuse dinosaurs? could it be because all religions were made up by people, perhaps as a way to controll them?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

<br/>
<br/>
If you want a scientific analysis of the universe and of our own planet (history, pre-history, et al), in a religious light, look up anything by Michael Cremo - all his knowledge comes from books FAR older than our contemporary textbooks.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, all I can find right now is a book on evolution (Human Devolution: A Vedic Alternative to Darwin's Theory), and its predecessor, a catalog of anomalous findings that don't fit in with the contemporary view of history (Forbidden Archaeology). There's another one I'm trying to find about astronomy, but I'm having a difficult time locating it. (you can find the other two easily at amazon, or barnes &amp; noble.)<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

Because they aren't true believers. Once we know where they are, we can convert those nasty heathens into honest, God fearing Christians. And only then they'll be worthy to be included in the Bible.

For the same reason they didn't speak about crickets, sparrows or elephants. They were a common sight for humans 3000 years ago, so they didn't feel the need to mention them. Too bad they went extint after the Flood, but God needed place for his other Intelligently Designed creations.

I don't think you read my post completely.  No, I don't say you are brave, because nothing has been proven about religion.  Nor will it likely be.  My point was that IF it COULD be proven, then you'd be brave to ignore it then.  (as your previous post mentioned, you wouldn't care even if it was proven to be true).
<br/>
<br/>
All of your counter examples are further example of how things AREN'T proven, which is a point I"m not arguing :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
