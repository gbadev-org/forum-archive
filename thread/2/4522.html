<br/>
Seriously, why would you want an afterburner? Aren't they about as expensive as a new SP? Or am I thinking of something else?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Afterburner was about $35. Triton Labs made it. Buyers installed it into a GBA. Lik Sang sold pre-modded GBAs until the SP came out.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

-- You know, the human.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, the SP is damn nice (i have one) but is is a  little to small for my hands. My girl friend also prefers the GBA over the SP because of the size.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Or buy a DS. It's more expensive, but it's easier to hold and the screen is brighter than an SP or an afterburner.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In your defence, I can see why you want one, I always found the original GBA nicer to hold, damn shame I couldn't see a damn thing on the screen however. If <a class="postlink" href="http://www.lik-sang.com" target="_blank">www.lik-sang.com</a> doesn't have one then I'm sure that there are several other importers etc that have them.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>
