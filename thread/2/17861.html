I've been reading about Windows 8's UEFI Secure Boot policy and thought I'd ask what others thought of it. For those who don't know, UEFI has a feature using TPM chips that checks bootloaders against a database of trusted signatures. This would help prevent rootkits and other malware which loads itself during the boot sequence. However, Microsoft has stated that while x86- (and x86_64)-based OEM devices must have Secure Boot enabled by default and must have an option to disable the feature and add custom signatures, OEM devices (such as tablets) running on ARM must explicitly not have the ability to disable these features.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I find it a slightly worrying trend, the feature in itself is useful but having it forced upon users is not so useful.
