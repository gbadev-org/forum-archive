    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is definitely off topic but I think this community has enough overlap with my interest (composing on the Gameboy) to make a posting here worth a try. So here goes:
<br/>
<br/>
I recently picked up a second hand copy of Oliver Wittchow's Nanoloop program for my Gameboy. After playing around with it some I've decided I need a way to save my work in an editable format. After checking the Nanoloop forums I learned that the cartridge is pretty finicky about what sort of back up hardware it will function with. The only system that Wittchow or anyone else has been able to recommend is something called the Xchanger by Bung. It?s a discontinued backup device for the original GB and color GB. I?ve been poking all over the net for the past few days and emailed numerous importers but every dealer I have contacted is out of stock. Ebay has also been a no go, though I did find some Xchanger compatible cards up for auction.
<br/>
<br/>
I know it?s a long shot but what I?d like to know is: Does anyone on this forum have one of these devices that they would be willing to sell, someone who has moved over to GBA development perhaps?
<br/>
<br/>
In addition to backing up Nanoloop tracks the Xchanger is also recommended for burning the $15 downloadable version of LSDJ, which I am also very interested in. So I'm planning on really putting the little guy to work once I track him down.
<br/>
<br/>
Any direction you guys could give me would be very much appreciated.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i am almost positive i have one at home w/ a 16mbit cartridge.  i wish i'd read this yesterday, bc i just came back to school today.  if you want it, you can have it, if you don't mind waiting a few weeks.  i'm going home on the weekend of the 7th, and i can grab it then.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Still very interested. Even if I am able to obtain a system from gametz.com which I am in the proccess of doing, an extra 16MB cart would be extremely useful.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to go ahead and send you a PM with my email address. Hopefully we can set something up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i have a xchanger and 64mbit cart, but im not sure it either of them work. i've been trying for the past couple days to get it working under windows xp but it can never find the linker, even with different giveio etc drivers. i'll try later today booting into dos and see if it works then..
<br/>
<br/>
btw how much do you think its worth (how much are you willing to pay :p) i dunno myself i got it a looooong time ago, it was expensive then but its probably not worth much anymore :p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">okay i tested it and it appears the xchanger itself works fine, but the 64mbit cart doesnt. it keeps saying 'no flash memory present' i opened up the cart and looked around it looks fine, i dunno what could be the problem, might be fixable i would have no idea how tho. anyways i still have the xchanger itself, it works great under pure dos (6.22) if you have anything cool to trade (anything cool really, just to cover shipping costs) i can send it to you, but with no cables, as i need the psu for my visoly linker and the parallel cable for the same.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
