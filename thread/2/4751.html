Although the graphics look great, it'll be cost and practicality that win the war. It's like the Commodore Vs Spectrum all over again!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But have you used it yet dj-ceejay? I see you're from the UK (as am I) so chances are you haven't. I travelled to the States recently (got back yesterday), and picked up a couple of DS's, and they're much better than I expected. It all works so well, it's not gimmicky at all. The only complaint I have is that there is such a limited choice of software available at the moment.
<br/>
<br/>
The touch screen is brilliant, the two screens work suprisingly well (but not suited to all games), and the little thumb strap thing is a stroke of genius...

Sorry if I'm a little cynical regarding handhelds - I bought a GP32 and was disapointed with the games available. That got ebayed quickly.
<br/>
Ultimately the games will sell the console - for example Halo on XBox. I suppose it's how the developers take advantage of the hardware.<br/>_________________<br/>Fruit Machine Games:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the GP32 is a different market though. It's more like a developer system, whereas the DS is a mainstream console. It'll have lots of software (as will the PSP), although I get the sneaking suspicion that the GBA2 is on the way. The DS is like a patched up GBA sent out to battle against the PSP. It works really well, but it could have been so much more... I assume they're saving the entirely new setup for the new GBA...

I think Nintendo were brave in releasing a handled like no other. It seems like Sony just took a PS2 and put it in a little box with a big screen - looks like a screen cover/case is a must?

GBA2 - Who knows? Screens on the back and front? Controlling it with your feet and hands at the same time in a Donkey Kong 'stylee'.

I can understand how some people can perceive it as a gimmick, but it's really not: video games on PDA's have already been using touchscreens as game input devices for many years.  The dual-screens could be more easily considered a gimmick, but after using the DS, I have to say that I've come to see the two screens as merely as substitude for a single big foldable screen - which wouldn't be feasable at the moment.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the touchscreen isn't intended as a replacement for an A-Stick.  It's intended to be used to allow different styles of games.  Games certainly can use it as a psuedo-A-Stick, such as Mario 64 DS, but if they all did that then they'd be overlooking the whole point of the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Assuming that they really are sticking to the whole "third-pillar" idea, then I'm sure the GBA2 would essentially be Nintendo's PSP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The big screen and the good graphics are the things i like on the PSP. 
<br/>
<br/>
But there are some isues with it. The most important is the battary life. Wich can be come down to 2 hours wich is really a problem since the PSP should be a mobile gaming device. 
<br/>
I'm afraid that with the PSP you end up playing the same games as you do an your PS2 and you play them at home, connected to your loading adapter, since the battary lifetime is so short. 
<br/>
So I'm asking myself. Why sould I even play PSP if I can play the same things on my TV with a much bigger screen?

The DS is selling for a "mere" 2000 RMB ($250).

But the shopkeeper wouldn't let me try out either of them.  The only thing they let me try out was the iQue.
