EDIT: Or has this been released? But anyway, I agree that in comparison the GBA game looks better.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have fond memories of playing C64, Atari-2600, NES, and SNES as a kid.
<br/>
I prefer 8-bit graphics to the over-the-top 3D-ish ones.
<br/>
<br/>
It seems with this <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_%28seventh_generation%29" target="_blank">console generation</a>, that Nintendo is looking to please people like me who remember playing the older consoles.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="color: blue">Blue NDS v4 (FlashMe v7) - GBAMP V2 CF</span>

I prefer the bold line look, but I don't have many mainstream views.  Who knows what the most marketable look is?  You can't please everybody.

Try asking that question in an animators forum.  They'll look at you like you are from another planet. =)
<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you personally, but I play things like ADOM.  I'll argue that more people are visually oriented than not.

And when I put on bomberman at work(youth club), there was no mention of tekken, gt, pro evo or any other recent 3d game we had. Just wait till I bring down bubble bobble ^_^ I'll have the kids coming home with square eyes, twitching thumbs and the inability to close their eyes without seeing animated visuals from the game backed by the theme tune.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Some people will.  The graphics snobs won't touch it.
<br/>
<br/>
I think ADOM is fantastic, but the author mentions on his website that games can't be sold commercially without graphics these days.  Ie very few people would buy it.

Ever beaten it?  I haven't =P  YASD in the water dragon cave =P  (There are other reasons why it wouldn't sell mainstream.)
