    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are there any good resources about homebrew development on the original Gameboy/Gameboy Color?
<br/>
<br/>
It seems tricky to find anything on Google since it turns up a lot of links to GB emulators on other systems, and none of the flashcard retailers seem to go that far back.
<br/>
<br/>
For some reason I have a desire to at least <span style="font-style: italic">be able to</span> develop for all my handhelds, even if I don't ever actually get around to doing anything. :-) I currently have the technology for the GBA, DS, PSP, GP32, WonderSwan, NGPC and Pokemon Mini, but have so far only written anything for the last. Oh, and I can do (and have done) my cellphone and PDA, too. That leaves the original GB, the Game.com and the GameKing, and the latter two are not really high on my list.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That is one of my number one nags with the current state of the net; and then some people are so uptight about allowing you to mirror their stuff. In fact when writing one tutorial I asked someone if I could repeat their material, and they declined insisting to link to them. So I wrote my own and linked to theirs anyway, guess who's is still online!
<br/>
<br/>
But anyway where are you stuck? Do you have a compiler and enough documentation?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not stuck so much as I haven't even started. I just had a sudden and inexplicable urge to investigate the subject. I do now have a compiler and documentation, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think I also have a solution to the flashcard problem, but I'll have to wait until my new part turns up before I can test it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
After that ebay or another shopping service like Alibaba.
<br/>
<br/>
If not then try Assemblers or Retrogaming round table. They collect the stuff but never really use it.
<br/>
<br/>
Assemblers have alot of people in our situtation or current position. Sometimes they will share there "attianed" software or finds.
<br/>
<br/>
I forget this other place. It is called the Sprite museum where you can make your little sprite houses to promote your work. You can try there also if they have a community.

Then agian most of us who want to do anything of anything is poor, confused, busy, or have some kind of excuse( pointless reason ).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My GB Bridge arrived today, which allows me to use my old Flash Advance GBA flashcart as a GBC flashcart, after some considerable messing about with the files. I have tested it and it seems to work, although it looks like it needs all 128mbits to be flashed, which takes about six minutes on my parallel port linker.

I'm not sure I have the time to delve into GB Classic development at the moment, but it's nice to know I have the technology.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
