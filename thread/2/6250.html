    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all! I'm a computer science student at the University of Manitoba and my main focus of study is Software Engineering, although I am taking some courses in the realm of Networking and OS design.  I was wondering what all you other computer scientists are taking or if you have a degree, what was your main focus of study shortly after graduating?
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I am most likely missing and/or repeating sub-sections of computer science, but vote anyway! :)<br/>_________________<br/>Nihongo o hanasemasen!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't really say I've specialized. I seem to have taken a well-rounded set of electives, probably one for everything you listed. If I were in grad school I'd certainly specialize in something either graphical (interactive computing == games), distributed computing, or robotics.
<br/>
<br/>
Courses I've taken:
<br/>
Typical CS Cores (data structures, computer architecture, assembly, etc.)
<br/>
Calculus I &amp; II, Discrete Math, Linear Algebra
<br/>
Algorithms
<br/>
Distributed Computing
<br/>
Artificial Intelligence
<br/>
Operating Systems
<br/>
Intro to Software Engineering
<br/>
Computer Game Engine Architecture
<br/>
Robotics
<br/>
Computer Graphics (this fall)
<br/>
Senior Project ( this summer, in NDS dev ;-) )
<br/>
<br/>
We don't have a large CS dept so it's not like I could really go into too much depth in anything. I actually find so many CS topics interesting that I'm glad I have taken such a diverse set of electives.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
