A further benefit of the worse-is-better philosophy is that the programmer is conditioned to sacrifice some safety, convenience, and hassle to get good performance and modest resource use. Programs written using the New Jersey approach will work well both in small machines and large ones, and the code will be portable because it is written on top of a virus.
<br/>
<br/>
It is important to remember that the initial virus has to be basically good. If so, the viral spread is assured as long as it is portable. Once the virus has spread, there will be pressure to improve it, possibly by increasing its functionality closer to 90%, but users have already been conditioned to accept worse than the right thing. Therefore, the worse-is-better software first will gain acceptance, second will condition its users to expect less, and third will be improved to a point that is almost the right thing. In concrete terms, even though Lisp compilers in 1987 were about as good as C compilers, there are many more compiler experts who want to make C compilers better than want to make Lisp compilers better. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

He never seems to reach a final conclusion, but it does make for an interesting debate. Audacity [for example] does not do everything I need it to do; but every little it does it does well. I know that I can use Audacity if I only need to chop up a wave.

Then you have the element of reality. Sure requirement-x would be great if it is completed; but doing so puts a strain on the rest of the project, and being a project held together by loose commitments the last thing we want is to see no result after the first few months of work. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder so developers will be quick to revel at their new inventions and be encouraged by it. Now you have them and you can reel them in which is not as easy to do if you have no previous outcomes as bait.

I've been using linux (aside windows) for almost 10 years now, and I reboot my linux-systems way more often than my windows-systems. Yes, you CAN get away without rebooting for a long time in linux, but it's not productive. Often, just doing a quick reboot is way quicker.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think that the examples matter.  He has some insight.  Nothing is perfect; being imperfect by design is an interesting strategy.  I can see streaming for simplicity, time to market and chance of making it to market.  Does that imply market success?  No, not necessarily.

I take it they are not in a production environment where downtime is frowned apon?  And if you "need" to reboot a linux machine, something is setup wrong.  A properly setup/maintained system should easily see this:

I don't see why rebooting is such a holy thing. It's an easy fix for whenever -something- isn't running like it should for -some- reason. We'll never have perfectly stable systems where it isn't strictly required. I'd say you're the brainwashed one ;)

I don't see how development environments are different from other systems, with the exception of kernel level development. A user-space program in development is no different than any other user-space application from a system-stability point of view - at least for modern PCs with memory protection and the lot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As for rebooting Linux: Stale NFS handles are the bane of my "no need to reboot Linux" professional life. It's faster to reboot than wait forever for the damn system to get its arse in gear (sadly <span style="font-style: italic">/etc/init.d/nfs restart</span> does not always do the trick).

<br/>
<br/>
As for production vs development.. I hope you are kidding when you say there isn't much of a difference.  How long have you been developing?  These environments are night and day!  If you have a production environment that developers even have access to.. well.. I feel for that company, and I understand now why you feel the way you do.  Apparently stability isn't a goal with your projects.  Kernel development or just apps, they have the ability to do bad things.  Even if they don't have full control over the system, they can still have a huge impact on processor, memory, HD, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
When I say production environment, I'm talking systems that have hundreds of users on them all day long.  When you take a system down, they are unable to work.

It's a quick and dirty fix that might be appropriate on single user systems.  Sometimes reboots will make for a better time/productivity tradeoff than the real fix will.  Sometimes they won't.
