I recently found a source code and i learned it was made with a program called Blitz 3D 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Blitz 3D is on this page.<a class="postlink" href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Products/_index_.php" target="_blank">http://www.blitzbasic.com/Products/_index_.php</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possabile to make a Blitz code work for DS? 
<br/>
<br/>
for example could you use the D-pad to move player touch screen to move aimer and L Shoulder shoot, A switch weapons, X buy weapons stuff like that.
<br/>
<br/>
Can this be done?  or is this the same this are trying to convert a gamemaker game.<br/>_________________<br/>God  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.freewebs.com/jrohtmltesting/loveshack.htm" target="_blank">Speed</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've played this game, and i'm sure if you re-wrote it on the DS, then it would definately be possible since it's basically using simple 2D tile graphics. I don't think there would be a problem with processing power, but the resolution of the DS might be an issue. (ie not being able to see far ahead!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
because i opened up that source code using the Blitz 3D demo and it's really simple stuff. it just has to have all the right things in side of it.
<br/>
<br/>
not only would this be a cool port but if you kept it the same as it is on pc in a way then people could still customize there skins and play custom maps.
<br/>
<br/>
-edit- 
<br/>
<br/>
yeah seeing would be a problem...<br/>_________________<br/>God  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.freewebs.com/jrohtmltesting/loveshack.htm" target="_blank">Speed</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is there a way just to convert the Spanish to German?
<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, though it would be be possible to write a precompiler that takes some BASIC dialect and makes C, just as the first C++ compiler ("Cfront") took C++ and made C, that might be a bigger project than porting one game.

If the original was for 640x480 pixels, you can start by shrinking every graphic by a factor of 2.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

it is in 640x480, so how can this be done?

<br/>
like can a new guy like me do it?<br/>_________________<br/>God  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.freewebs.com/jrohtmltesting/loveshack.htm" target="_blank">Speed</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Scaling screen output is not difficult; 640x480 divided by 2 is 320x240; the DS is 256x192 (x2 screens) but first thing to do is to get the code to target the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
As for a "new guy" doing it, that seems most unlikely as it requires an understanding of what is going on in the code in the first place. Having said that you might be surprised how simple it is to get a basic "something" up, like a player in a room that can swing a knife or something.
<br/>
<br/>
One of the first things I did on the GB was figure out how various games work. I still remember the yellow pages in my head (I had a stack of coloured paper and made my notes on that). Before I began coding I figured out that there is probably some sort of basic language involved in games like Zelda - i.e. a script.
<br/>
<br/>
I actually recorded these thoughts on my <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dkauk.com/klogic" target="_blank">little website</a>. Getting started isn't as hard as it may seem! Of course I wasn't just starting out then, but in terms of what I know now my thoughts were very basic.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is the conversion flawless, and does it offer the most efficient way of saying what was said in the previous language?
