I'm trying to dynamically load additional code for my app but for some reason the host app just terminates when I do the load. The code look like this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">NSBundle* bundle = [[NSBundle alloc] initWithPath:fullBundlePath];
<br/>
if (bundle != nil) [bundle load];
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Now, my application will simply terminate on [bundle load]. No error messages or anything. I don't get any errors when building either the host app or the plugin.
<br/>
<br/>
For another ten points, and this is really tricky. I've accidentally written a plugin that load correctly and behave just like expected. If I load the working plugin before I load any broken plugin the [bundle load] on the broken plugin seems to work fine but the plugin doesn't behave as expected. If I don't load the working plugin, just trying to load a broken plugin, the host app will terminate on [bundle load]. I have a singleton class in the host app and my accidentally working plugin can retreive the singleton class instance just fine but the broken plugins will create a new instance of the class.
<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say I've compared the working project settings with the broken project settings and they seem identical. I used FileMerge to compare the WorkingPlugin.pbproj/project.pbxproj with the BrokenPlugin.pbproj/project.pbxproj and the only difference between them was the name if the sourcefiles and target.
<br/>
<br/>
I have also made sure that the host application, the plugin framework and the actual plugin are supporting weak linking.
<br/>
<br/>
So if anyone know what might cause [bundle load] to fail I'd really like to know.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.
