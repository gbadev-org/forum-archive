This thread fits just fine in the "off topic"-forum. As for the question itself, I have no clue. I'm running OS/2 Warp myself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">On the site of sylphAMP they said to post any bugs here. So I thought this would have been a good place to look for help too. I also searched the forum and there have been other help threads about SylphAMP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm looking for a way to stream the music to my Nintendo DS, using sylphamp on my NDS. When you download Sylphamp, it has a WinAMP plugin file included, which you should use to stream it to you NDS. Unfortunately I'm currently using Ubuntu on my laptop and my Vista computer uses way to much power(thx to a Radeon 2900XT) to just leave it running all day just to stream music. So I'm looking for another way to stream the music to Sylphamp, a way that works in Ubuntu. Another program for my DS would be fine too, but I haven't been able to find one yet.

In what I take to be official phpBB parlance, gbadev.org is a "board". A board contains categories (such as "Nintendo DS"), a category contains forums (such as "DS Misc"), a forum contains topics, and a topic contains posts.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, apperently you can use the sylphAMP plugin you get from the site within Linux. The trick is to download the lite version of winAMP(full did NOT work here), install that in Wine(windows emulation software) and then just put the .dll pluginfile in the usual directory.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
