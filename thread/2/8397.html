    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm curious how much spam people here get in their e-mail, if you use filters, and how successful they are...
<br/>
<br/>
I've had the same e-mail address for something like 6 years now... it was never diligently protected from bots and whatnot, although I don't personally believe that it's even possible to defend an e-mail address anymore... if you're in someone else's contact info then a worm is just as likely to harvest it from their computer as it is likely that it'll get scavenged from the net somewhere.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, things have never been <span style="font-style: italic">too</span> bad with it, but lately it's on the rise. I'll typically get about half a dozen spams overnight, and maybe a dozen more throughout the day. A lot of the time it's the same one over and over again... "Doctor" keeps sending me "The Ultimate Online Pharmeceutical", sometimes two or three times a day.
<br/>
<br/>
I use Mail on my Mac at home, and its junk filter is pitiful... it sometimes misses as much as 50% of the junk mail, and gets frequent false-positives as well. But when I'm at work I check mail through a web client, so there's no filtering happening there.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm starting to get annoyed with it, though. What solutions do people here favour?

Now that I think about it, I don't like email all that much.  Can anyone suggest a linux spam solution?

No spam on my cell phone anymore. =)
