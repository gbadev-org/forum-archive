    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My computer seems to have to work a lot harder than it used to while running. It jumps around on the memory usage anywhere from say 1% to 60% or more. It used to run fairly quite, but no it runs loud all the time. Is there a program that can help me target and fix the problem files or should I just start deleting progams? In the 'windows task manager' I check out the processes, but I don't know what some of the files are. My computer is virus free as far as I can tell(scanned in just now). Anyway, I am going to continue to work on it; I just wanted to ask you guys incase there is an easy solution.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Uninstall as many applications as you can.  Use the msconfig utility and uncheck as many things in the startup section as you can.  (It's almost always safe to uncheck everything in that section, and you can always turn it back on if you have to.)  This obviously assumes you're running Windows.

High memory usage is healthy.  Modern operating systems will happily use extra memory to cache filesystem data.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And to make sure you don't have malware on your machine, use <a class="postlink" href="http://housecall.trendmicro.com/" target="_blank">housecall</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaware/" target="_blank">adaware</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.safer-networking.org/" target="_blank">spybot</a>. Also look at task manager to see <span style="font-style: italic">which</span> program is using most of your CPU time, and look its process name up on Google.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, through. It seems to be running a lot smoother and I unchecked everything in the startup tab. Thanks guys. Oh, and I found spyware with ad-aware, spybot, and housecall, but no viruses. Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
