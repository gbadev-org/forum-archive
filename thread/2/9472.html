    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Open Source Initiative maintains a <a class="postlink" href="http://opensource.org/licenses/" target="_blank">list of free software licenses</a> (called "open source licenses" by OSI).
<br/>
<br/>
Free Software Foundation maintains <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html" target="_blank">another list of free software licenses</a>. Each license in this list has a description that briefly explains on the pros and cons of each license as well as its compatibility with FSF's own GNU licenses.
<br/>
<br/>
Which license to use depends on what you want to let others do with your software:
<br/>
<ul><li>For a permissive license, allowing use even in proprietary software, use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib_license.html" target="_blank">Zlib license</a>. Libnds itself uses this license. </li><li>For a weak copyleft, allowing use in proprietary software as long as source code for any modified module is published, use the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/boilerplate-1.1/" target="_blank">Mozilla tri-license</a>, which consists of the disjunction of Mozilla Public License, GNU General Public License, and GNU Lesser General Public License. (This license is very similar to the "License of Netscape JavaScript" described on FSF's page.) </li><li>For a strong copyleft, requiring publication of source code for any module linked to your module, use the GNU General Public License. </li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am just wondering how ROMs fit into the GPL. I know that with Perl and Java, due to how they include all source into one file (rather than other langauges where if files still remain seperate), then all source must be made available.
<br/>
<br/>
This mostly done because of how Perl and JDK handle compile code, and have compiled code as one "binary"
<br/>
<br/>
So what I am asking what is FSF's and Gnu's stance on ROMs are.

<br/>
Just figured it was relevant.<br/>_________________<br/>[ <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dakedesu.info" target="_blank">Main Site</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://krfp.dakedesu.info/" target="_blank"> Kid Radd Fan Project</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.dakedesu.info/" target="_blank">Forums</a> ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GNU GPL does not prohibit commercial use. For instance, Fedora Core is a collection of free software including a Linux? kernel, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a commercial distribution of Fedora Core. RHEL satisfies the GNU GPL by including source code and allowing redistribution of all covered components. But anything linked into an executable with GPL covered code does have to be GPL compatible free software, which destroys the proprietary software business model that many commercial distributors (such as Microsoft) rely on.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The GNU GPL and all other free software licenses permit licensees to distribute copies of your software for a fee, although the copies that users get are still governed by the license. In the case of copyleft licenses such as the GNU GPL, this means that a distributor cannot make your software proprietary.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
