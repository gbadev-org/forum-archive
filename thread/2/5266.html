Hi Alex
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I seem to have a stalker ? is there any way that I could find out who it is!??
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Basically someone has guessed a password of mine on hotmail because I had a stupid secret question and seen all the mail in my inbox ? I had an inbox folder directly for membership for passwords and online profiles and some geek has hacked into all of them and changed the profile settings. Its really starting to piss me off!
<br/>
<br/>
I need a way to be able to catch whoever it is as they seem to be in everything. They have accessed my online library of Vodafone pictures and are using them to doctor them up etc ? 
<br/>
<br/>
Cant think of a clever way to catch them out ? there probably isn?t but just wondered if you had any good ideas!???
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I realise that - I was just wondering if there was anyway to view logged IPs or something. I have already suggested new accounts tc, but what I would really like to know is if there is a way we can get back at the person who did this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You still have access to your Hotmail account, right? If so, then just change the password. If you think that you don't need a secret question to figure out your password, then make some question up with a completely irrelevant answer, just to throw him/her off from getting back in.
<br/>
<br/>
As for trying to catch the perpetrator, I really have no answers for you. Perhaps if you contact the people of MSN about the situation, and how the person got in, and what they are doing, maybe they can give you a suggestion. My own brother is having to deal with credit card fraud, or worse than that, identity theft, and I wish I had answers for him too.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
