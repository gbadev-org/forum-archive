<br/>
<br/>
I just became fed up with using a batch file to compile, and editing files one by one in VC.
<br/>
<br/>
I've followed the tutorial at gbajunkie.co.uk to make a makefile project in VC that will compile with DevKitAdv, and I've got as far as writing the makefile and... I don't know where to include it or place it in etc. (In other words, I've created a makefile project, set the DevKitAdv path now... ??)
<br/>
<br/>
This is most likely a very silly question, but I've scoured the menus, tried adding a new file and making it a makefile.. etc. Can't find anything!
<br/>
<br/>
Any help much appreciated ;) Also, I realise this message makes little sense as I've been ill all week and can't think totally straight.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,
<br/>
Sam.<br/>_________________<br/>-<span style="font-weight: bold">Sam</span>
