    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Its been a good while since I have posted here.   And I'm sorry that my the post of my return has to be so off-topic..  but I am curious, nonethelss.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way to develope games for the Nintendo GameCube?
<br/>
If so, please let me know where I can find some sources for this.
<br/>
I cant seem to find any, and hope that they do exist.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GameCube "uses" GCC, so getting the compiler for it shouldn't be a big problem. What is a bigger problem is that official developers use a lot of the libraries that come with the SDK. Basically instead of coding all the chips and registers yourself, it comes with a big bag of libraries so you don't have to access all the hardware directly. The graphics library is very similar to OpenGL...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as these libraries are copyrighted, you can't use them legally (if you'd get your hands on them). And even if; then the second problem arises: Testing. In theory there are three ways of testing. An emulator, which to my knowledge isn't made by anyone yet, a full devkit (which you cannot get your hands on, or an NR reader which is similar to a PS2 test station. And I believe an NR reader is also impossible to get when your not an official developer for Nintendo. 
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, there is a way of cracking a normal Cube with a mod chip which in combination with a boot disc would enable you to read data via USB (if a normal cube *has* a USB port that is...)
<br/>
<br/>
Too bad as it is quite a nice console to develop for!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How is this for a goofy idea?  Create a boot disc that sets the system up for a GC &lt;--&gt; AGB data transer?  Then put a transfer program and the GC binary on the flash cart, transfer the binary and execute it on the GC side.  I image the transfer would would be really slow... =P

Umm, why not just use the LAN adaptor?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because I'm programming on the GBA right now and did not inspect the bottom of the GC before I posted.  In other words, the LAN adaptor sounds like a superior solution to me.
