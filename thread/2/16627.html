    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know if a service like that exist.. but an alternative would be cheap fire linker from the seller reviewed there: <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=14429" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=14429</a>
<br/>
would still end for something like 750$... and some manual work from you to flash them all... and i'll first ask my country if I have the right to buy that to burn my own homebrew... not sure they are legal everywhere...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I might be able to get close to that many, but I'd have to do some wheeling &amp; dealing with a past client. However, the carts that I have are very precious to me... I always think that maybe I'll do something with them at some point.

Care to tell us what you want to do with 'em? Might soften my heart to your cause, or suggest some kind of agreement... ;)
