</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">SEATTLE -- Aug. 13, 2006 -- In the 30 years of video game development, the art of making console games has been reserved for those with big projects, big budgets and the backing of big game labels. Now Microsoft Corp. is bringing this art to the masses with a revolutionary new set of tools, called XNA Game Studio Express, based on the XNA platform. XNA Game Studio Express will democratize game development by delivering the necessary tools to hobbyists, students, indie developers and studios alike to help them bring their creative game ideas to life while nurturing game development talent, collaboration and sharing that will benefit the entire industry.
<br/>
<br/>
During his keynote presentation today at Gamefest 2006, a Microsoft game developer event hosted by Microsoft in Seattle, Chris Satchell, general manager of the Game Developer Group at Microsoft, announced details of the new technology, which will be broadly available this holiday season. XNA Game Studio Express will be available for free to anyone with a Windows XP-based PC and will provide them with Microsoft's next-generation platform for game development. By joining a "creators club" for an annual subscription fee of $99 (U.S.), users will be able to build, test and share their games on Xbox 360 and access a wealth of materials to help speed the game development progress. This represents the first significant opportunity for novice developers to make a console game without a significant investment in resources.
<br/>
<br/>
During his keynote, Satchell talked about academic institutions that are lining up to include XNA Game Studio Express in their course offerings. Also showcased was the work of key XNA supporters Autodesk Inc. and GarageGames. Through the Microsoft XNA relationship with Autodesk, the leading provider of 3-D authoring software, game developers and enthusiasts can now more easily incorporate content into XNA Game Studio Express via Autodesk's FBX file exchange format. Joining Satchell on stage was Mark Frohnmayer, president of GarageGames, who showcased ports of its next-generation Torque tools and technology over to the XNA Game Studio Express platform.

* XNA Game Studio Express Opens Up Game Creation to the World
<br/>
By providing an integrated, seamless development environment based on Visual Studio Express and .NET that simplifies the integration and use of game content, XNA Game Studio Express makes game development easier to accomplish for smaller projects, strongly increasing the chance for great game ideas to make it out of the concept stage and into the hands of gamers everywhere.
<br/>
<br/>
The XNA Game Studio Express beta will be available Aug. 30, 2006, as a free download on Windows XP, for development on the Windows XP platform. XNA Game Studio Express will give anyone with a Windows XP-based PC access to a unified development tool that liberates the creation of great Xbox 360 and Windows XP-compatible games, providing a new alternative to the existing multithousand-dollar development kits that many console games require. The final version of XNA Game Studio Express will be available this holiday season.
<br/>
"XNA Game Studio Express will ignite innovation and accelerate prototyping, forever changing the way games are developed," Satchell said. "By unlocking retail Xbox 360 consoles for community-created games, we are ushering in a new era of cross-platform games based on the XNA platform. We are looking forward to the day when all the resulting talent-sharing and creativity transforms into a thriving community of user-created games on Xbox 360."
<br/>
Not only will XNA Game Studio Express turn the community into creators, but a second XNA toolset geared toward game development professionals is scheduled to be available in spring 2007, fundamentally changing the way commercial games are developed.
<br/>
<br/>
* The Beginning of the Game Developer Revolution
<br/>
From students at colleges, universities and high schools of the future to the proverbial "guys in the garage," Microsoft XNA Game Studio Express will liberate anyone with a great game idea to create titles for Xbox 360 and Windows XP simultaneously. More than 10 universities and their game development schools -- including University of Southern California, Georgia Tech College of Computing and Southern Methodist University Guildhall -- have already pledged to integrate console game development and XNA Game Studio Express into their curricula for the first time, and Xbox 360 will be the only console at the center of all coursework.
<br/>
<br/>
"Great game ideas are incubating in the minds of students everywhere," said Michael Zyda, director for Gamepipe Labs at the University of Southern California. "With XNA Game Studio Express, Microsoft is investing in these next-generation innovators, creating the canvas for dreamers to express their powerful game ideas. In incorporating XNA Game Studio Express and Xbox 360 consoles into our Gamepipe program, USC will be able to better provide game studios and publishers around the world with a newfound wellspring of talent and opportunity. It's ingenious."
<br/>
<br/>
In addition, GarageGames, technology provider and developer of one of the most successful Xbox Live Arcade titles, "Marble Blast Ultra," has migrated both its Torque Shader Engine and new Torque Game Builder 2-D visual game designer over to the XNA Game Studio Express platform.
<br/>
<br/>
"The GarageGames mission has always been to provide top-tier technology, tools and community to independent and aspiring game developers," said Josh Williams, CEO of GarageGames. "We are excited that Microsoft is demonstrating leadership by taking the revolutionary step of opening up game development for Xbox 360 to hobbyists and students. In aligning our tools and technology with XNA Game Studio Express, we're helping even more individuals with the creativity and drive to make video games bring them to life on both Windows XP and Xbox 360."</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
<br/>
The program will seek to complement a trend that has seen videogames becoming more like film blockbusters, costing up to ?20m to produce.
<br/>
<br/>
Users will need a PC running Windows XP - or Vista in the future - to operate the tools program, called XNA Game Studio Express.
<br/>
<br/>
The tools will be available in trial form from 20 August and there is a $99 (?55) annual subscription.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
Either way, I am probably going to pass on this one, as I am still staying clear of MS whenever I can (although I use Windows XP, but that's just a necessary evil).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am not sure I buy that explanation - even though I am sure you have something to back it up... ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I think the subscription is for a couple of reasons:
<br/>
1. They have positive identification of you, you are the age of majority, and you no doubt have signed/accepted some agreements and any malicious code that you develop &amp; distribute will come back to haunt you...
<br/>
2. Only true enthusiasts are going to shell out the cash - which should reduce the number of junky homebrew games that get pushed into the system... although I am an enthusiast and my games are junky! :D
<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a fantastic idea - and while I don't think the majority of the gaming community will care (until a homebrew hit appears I suppose) I know that it will interest some developers that may not have been interested in the 360 before. 
<br/>
<br/>
I really hope Nintendo follows suit especially with the remarks Iwata made a long time ago...which I mentioned in this <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=81249&amp;highlight=#81249" target="_blank">thread</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
