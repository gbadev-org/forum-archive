    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, for some time ago, i realized the potential of a Sony Handheld, if they could only make it compatible to the Ps1. They then could tap into this already huge amount of Games already developed that would only needs minor modifications.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I doubt it will be compatible though since the discs are going to be completely different.  
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think the PSP will really take off though, to me, it sounds like another Xbox-type thing lol.  Good graphics, bad games.
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how much it will cost?<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So developper could easily port their game if it was to be Ps1 compatible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Very nice indeed, but should nintendo be shaking in their boots if their is no prototype untill late 2003/2004? I should expect nintendo to have n64 qaulity gameboy by then, as the president has said in a meeting.. unless hes bluffing, at least sony has come out and announced something for people to drool on. If this device sony is coming out with is as good as its seemed to be, and nintendo isnt coming out with the supposed new gba2 then we might not see nintendo. They totally lost GC, and wether or not they say if ps2 came out later they would have done better, they lose that.. arent they somewhat living off gba? I mean they are releasing SP with such minor changes to support themselves.
<br/>
<br/>
I really want to see this new PSP, I hope it is flipable, and not like the Sega handheld of what 1996, that has a nice screen and everything but the thing was big in depth. I find it hard to believe they have a what 1.2GB in a handheld.. and have it even less than double the size of gameboy advance. Anyone find some pictures of the prototype when it comes out be sure to post them... I usually dont get to see things untill a few months after they are released, I never find out or forget.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

EDIT:  And who cares about a cell phone?  Whatever idiot came up with the idea that a cell phone and a portible console should be the same device is an idiot.  Games != Phones.  Now if you want to hook up an online multiplayer type of thing, then ok...

<br/>
I don't want to take sides or anything, but I've seen the first demos of both the PS2 and XBox, and I was disappointed. Both showed how much graphic power each could do, but there was no demonstration on all the other things that actually make a game, such as AI. I remember Microsoft's claim that the XBox could pump 3 million polys/s, but since it's release, it's games seem to only get around 1/3 of that.
<br/>
<br/>
If Sony plans on showing demos of what their new handheld can do, let's hope that they do more than graphics, because...

By that, does it means the 4 direction buttons or the single controller stick ? If it's the later, then the Psp picture don't match.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am pretty sure that once the PSP comes out, the GBA will be treated like the NES was in 1989 when the Genesis first came out stateside, and GBA fanboys will counter with useless excuses like "If you ignore the top 24 lines of the GBA screen, it's 16x9 as well" that smack of NES fanboys of 1989. But then, Nintendo could still have something up its sleeves, as it had with the pre-rendered sprites of <span style="font-style: italic">Donkey Kong Country</span> and the Super FX chip, both as a response to Sega's new hardware.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The will also need a good battary technic because the mechanic of the disk spinning will use lots of energy. I think the price of this thing isnt something they already thougt about.
