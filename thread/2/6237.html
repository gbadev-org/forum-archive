GameCube discs are burned from the outside to the inside, unlike normal discs that are burned from inside to outside. Also the Discs are encrypted, that's right. Any normal PC is not able to read or copy a 'Cube disc, this was the main purpose of Nintendo to prevent hacking and roms etc. But there happin to be this bug in Phantasy star Online wich made streaming possible from PC to GC or GC to PC.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.picfront.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold">www.picfront.com [ Upload your pictures ]</span></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

it would make since because it has a CAV drive and the outside of the drive would give faster read speeds (I think the range is 3.2 MB to 2 MB)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks for the corrections. I wasn't sure myself, that's why I said "did you ever hear" and not "this is how it is." It seems we'd rather go back and forth about the nature of Gamecube discs than respond to this guy's outcry about our good behavior.

Commerical games get pressed from a glass master. (Erm, at least I think it's glass, correct me if I'm wrong and they actually use something else)
<br/>
Therefore, all of the data is written at once.
<br/>
<br/>
Recordable discs get burned. If you're burning something for GC, such as a disc full of files that would be readable by GC linux, it's burned in the same way you burn any other disc on your PC, from the inside to the outside. I don't believe you can get a firmware upgrade for any drive to do the opposite.
<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, the gamecube reads ANY disc, official or not, from the inside to the outside, like any normal DVD drive.
<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, I have no idea which way the copies that are made into the masters for pressing are burned, however I don't think it's very likely that they would burn a copy to be used in creating a master the opposite way that the drive reads the disc. Unless someone here works for one of the pressing plants that manufactures GC discs, or Datel (since they produce their own GC compatible discs) I guess you'll really never know.
<br/>
<br/>
I dont know of any evidence proving that the discs are recording from the outside in, especially since it contradicts how the GC reads the actual disc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hm, well, if you're ever looked at the data on a Datel disk...apparently it has something do with some kind of NHL Hockey game.  I have a feeling they aren't QUITE kosher with how they made their unlicensed discs. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As far as I know, masters are made of solid nickel. At least, they are for CD-ROMs. I don't know if DVD-ROM requires a different material for the masters.
<br/>
<br/>
It has to be a material hard enough to withstand slamming into the blank discs and imprinting the pits a few hundred times (if I recall correctly, the masters have to be replaced fairly quickly, since they get damaged so much during pressing).</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by TJ on Thu Jul 07, 2005 4:33 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

They're correct under a definition of pixel that treats everything drawn in NTSC's overscan as "video noise". In fact, a lot of games such as <span style="font-style: italic">Astyanax</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Super C</span> have garbage in the overscan areas, even on NES hardware. They're also correct for those games that turn off the screen early to create more vblank time.
