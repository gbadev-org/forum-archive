I'm looking for a decent web host that is Windows, but also has support for PHP and MySQL. A solid web console for managing the site is essential. I'm averse to paying more than $10 a month. Any suggestions?
<br/>
<br/>
Lately, I've been a fan of godaddy.com, but they're not Windows, so I'm looking elsewhere. I used to use m6.net for windows projects, but I had a few problems with performance (perhaps because they are located in Australia, or at least my shared box was.)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

Especially since the most common web server on the internet is Apache, and Apache runs on any operating system.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I need a Windows host because my business partner in this new project is a Microsoft developer. We thought it would be good to leave the door open to ASP.NET development on IIS, since that's what he's familiar with.
<br/>
<br/>
And since PHP/MySQL runs happily on a Windows box, I really don't mind.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestions! I'll check 'em out.
