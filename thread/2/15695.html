    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Really we need to fix this. FAST! Are you Canadian? Did you send the letter? I did already. Certainly the license in my new combination computer/game-console system my company will be selling must fix it, which prevents me from suing you for copying it privately and allows you to sue anyone who tries to sue you for this kind of copying that the DMCA is supposed to allow the author to sue you for such things. Now they can't! My new company will fix everything!

I alslo suggest a compromise: Simply disallow pure circumvention devices from being sold in retail stores (like disallowing pure police scanners). But still allow building your own, selling devices with multiple functions, using them for private usage (as long as you don't break other laws while doing so), mail-ordering them, etc.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Because suing your customers is a fantastic long term business strategy.  Clearly after this is passed, Canadian should business plans based on aggressive EULAs.  (sarcastic, btw)

The problem with DRM, is that it is like taping a key to the bottom of a locked box, and then telling people not to open the box.  If the box were unlocked to start, and you told people not to open it, some people would and some people would not.  If you tape the key to the bottom and lock it, the same people who would open the unlocked box will use the key to unlock the locked box.  There is no change in bahavior.  The whole thing is silly.
