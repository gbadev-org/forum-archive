Even when a lot of us are not pirates. We need to let them rethink their image of us. We need to put an end to software piracy! Sure, most flashcarts are made to play romz and if you took those devices away we would have really only three ways to play homebrew. We need to ask the companies to stop supporting piracy. So far the only one close to stopping support piracy is SuperCard as they ask to 'Only play Freeware &amp; Personal Backups'. That is not enough though. Nintendo will just keep building up security to prevent roms from being played. This will also prevent good wholesome Homebrew. Homebrewers should not be punished for criminal's mistakes. Just like people are not
<br/>
<br/>
punished if someone around them commits a crime. Something must be done about this or homebrew could end up being a thing of the past.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The ratio of DS pirates to DS homebrewers is huge.  The only reason companies that produce these devices stay in business is because they gain enough sales from people who wish to use them for piracy.  Personally I'd prefer having a commercially available solution available at least rather than having to build my own homebrew device.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not disagreeing with your principle, just mentioning that it wouldn't really apply too much in the real world.
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I'm aware of the GBAMP, which was homebrew-only for quite some time (and is still horrible at DS piracy even though it's possible now), but keep in mind the same company was also producing the M3 and G6 (I think?) and continues to sell the M3 Simply.
<br/>
<br/>
The Datel Games N' Music would be good if they ever released a DLDI file so that the majority of homebrew would actually work on it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok.. first.. I think many will agree, that I am totally against piracy.  But, I think your blog post is full of holes.  Let's just say "ZAP" all piracy has ended now and forever in the future.  If you read any of my other threads on this topic, you would have realized that there would no longer be "mass" homebrew.  If the "ZAP" happened before the DS released, we would have 3 people that could run homebrew with their expensive dev kits, and a handful of people that would build their own PassMe devices.  There would be no reason to mass produce them as most people wouldn't own GBA Flash Carts because manufactures wouldn't spend all the money to design and produce something that they "might" be able to sell to another handful of people.
<br/>
<br/>
So, where would we be now?  We'd probably have 20 or so people that actually write homebrew, and maybe another 10 or so that could run the homebrew.  Unfortunatly, without piracy, we wouldn't have ANY commercial homebrew devices, as companies aren't looking to spend thousands of dollars to try to sell something to an extremely small market.
<br/>
<br/>
You'd probably find that we wouldn't have nearly as many homebrew devers as we do now because people wouldn't be willing to spend hundreds of dollars to be able to run them, as well as have the skills to build the devices needed to run homebrew.  All you would have is the ones competing to be the first at doing something with the DS before anyone else.  You definatly wouldn't have WiFi, as nobody would be willing to donate to a bounty because they couldn't run it anyway, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, if we didn't have piracy, we wouldn't have mass homebrew.  Piracy is the only reason we have access to the devices we have today.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But if that were true then you wouldn't have successes like Pok?mon, the most readily available pirate game; in fact I completed the game before it was translated to English!

I'm not entirely sure I agree with this assessment. Piracy may be the main reason we have access to cheap mass produced devices which make homebrew affordable but without the ability to run unsigned code in the first place these devices would never exist.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

But that is a whole different topic.  That is the thrill of the challenge.  The only question is who will be the first to run unsigned code, not if.  Of course, if the product isn't popular, the thrill is decreased.

Like I said, if it wasn't for piracy, there would be 6 people who could run homebrew games right now.  Maybe less.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, but their pirated games are not necessarily as easy to for people to find and download. I'm not endorsing piracy, but try this. Pick a few random Pocket PC games and see how long it takes to find cracks for them. Now try the same with DS or GBA games. Unless it is a top selling Pocket PC product there probably is not one available.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Perhaps, but recommending Windows family platforms as a hobby development target does eliminate homebrew on Nintendo platforms as a substantial non-infringing (exc)use for selling piracy-capable hardware for Nintendo platforms.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

When you put it that way, it looks like they are pimpin' the scene.
