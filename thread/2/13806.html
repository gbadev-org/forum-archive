    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it's a better layout, and more functional, and very simple. I would widen the main body a little more, make the blue bar on the left a little less wide, I'm using 1024x768. maybe put the words "pin eight" next to the logo instead of underneith it, to crunch up the banner at the top, even more room for news! just some suggestions, take them with a grain of drugs, I mean lockjaw, I mean I love TOD.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree, its more functional but the menu graphics etc. need just a little work, the blue bar seems to just stop at too hard of an edge, and that yellow bar at the top is... what? And I agree with maybe putting the pin eight words larger and next to the logo.
<br/>
The whole page seems too... eh, pinned down :P or flat. Add some shadows to some of the graphics or better yet, put the whole page in one table cell, with the shadow effect, excluding your copyright statement at the bottom. And maybe you could change the background behind the table slightly, for a little variety.
<br/>
Another thing, I like the font used for the Pin Eight logo, but the text font doesn't seem to fit along with that too well. Experiment with different font families.
<br/>
Just my suggestions, I'm really no graphic artist though ;)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

Headings (Welcome, New system, Projects, Sections) also use Cooper Black if you have it installed; otherwise, it falls back to any other serif font on your system. Body is generic sans.

Are there other extra-bold rounded-serif fonts distributed with common operating systems? There is a fallback to the system's basic serif font, as the linked page recommends and as you point out in 4. But I'd take that with a grain of salt, as not only does it recommend a &lt;font&gt; element, but it also recommends an <span style="font-style: italic">empty</span> &lt;font&gt; element in XHTML.
<br/>

<br/>
Higher <span style="font-style: italic">resolutions</span> should be fine, as the column width is defined in terms of the user's base font size, and usually a higher-DPI screen will have a bigger base font size. On a 19" or larger monitor, you can usually have two web pages side-by-side anyway.

I'll try 0.2em instead of 0.3em.

Possibly, I mean what I think is actually happening is that the "pin eight" text connects the logo to the navigation (because of the text) so it makes it appear to be structurally connected with it. Having said that it's not really anything to worry about too much, just a small thing I noticed.

Ah yes, I never noticed that. There is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/design/browser_compatible_fonts.php3" target="_blank">another browser font compatibility site</a>, 'Georgia' is a serif font designed for the web, although I think there are any serif fonts as thick as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.identifont.com/show?I8" target="_blank">Cooper Black</a> installed on most computers. With it being a trademark choice to coincide with the logo maybe an image wouldn't be too wrong to use!

What I'm picturing is something like this: <a class="postlink" href="http://dood77.googlepages.com/table.htm" target="_blank">http://dood77.googlepages.com/table.htm</a>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the 100% width for the table excludes the 15px margins, so its just a little too wide. Also, the border I was envisioning was more like the drop shadow one <a class="postlink" href="http://threeplusone.com/code/shadow.html" target="_blank">here</a>, and using this one would solve the margin issue, as it wouldn't need a margin. Oh, and obviously the menu graphics edges would have to be changed slightly, since they aren't the very edge of the page anymore. IE6 has a drop shadow filter, but I'm 99% sure you don't want Microsoft proprietary features on your site. <span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">Why does MS make all these crazy changes to their DOM thinking every one will start using IE or the new feature will become mainstream!?</span>

<br/>
Not that I disagree with things needing to be changed about, well, a lot of things in CSS/HTML, but I'm not sure how much of a choice you have. I would leave the font, but change the next available font to something more common that fits better with Cooper Black. You could also add a small link somewhere to a page suggesting the best viewing specifications, and provide a link to the font on that page. (Or write some nifty server-side script that would parse your heading text into images? I guess that makes it too hard to deal with, making it non-highlight able)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
