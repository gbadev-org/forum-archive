Regardless, it means on computer if you want to play keys right next to each other the vi keys configuration is logical for the order of arrows on the screen, please.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not aware of any reliable source connecting DDR to vi, but vi got HJKL from the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM-3A" target="_blank">ADM-3A terminal</a>. When DDR clones such as Dance Factory by Codemasters came out with arrow orders other than LDUR, the conversation on the forum at bemanistyle.com would go like this:
<br/>
<br/>
- The order of the arrows doesn't match DDR.
<br/>
- Probably because Konami must own some design patent on that order.
<br/>
- But vi is prior art. [photo of ADM-3A keyboard]<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
