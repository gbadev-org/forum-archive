Power is relative. The PSP can't even emulate the NES (yet). And sometimes, if you are going to be away from 120VAC or 230VAC for extended periods of time, you want a less powerful system so that its battery will last longer.

It is about as "weak" as comparing two cars by their fuel economy.
<br/>
<br/>
The point of a portable console is to be able to use it out of the home for extended periods of time, not to keep it plugged into the wall.
<br/>
<br/>
To do that, you need a system that lasts a long time on it's internal power alone. The PSP (as have nearly all of the rival handhelds in the past) simply doesn't measure up with Nintendo's device in this regard. It is a fact that cannot be argued.

but, I digress,

<br/>
I do love the DS, I am just starting to get into development for it, but my point was not to start a kiddie console flame war, but to say that we need to be objective and not claim either is better,
<br/>
<br/>
one thing that is prevelant with pro "x"-console people is to compare a certain game to some similar homebrew rip-off or PC flash game (i.e. lumines) but that in itself defeats the purpose of the protable console and why settle for something less than the real thing, it is just as easy to say the same for another console..., is it not?

Even Sony doesn't rate the PSP for 8 hours under realistic situations, and I have never heard of anyone getting more than 6 hours with acceptable brightness and volume on the system. Even PSP biased sites will admit that 3 to 6 hours is the normal operating time.

If the PSP were cracked to the extent that the Nintendo DS was even a month ago (I am not paying big bucks to import a Japanese unit with 1.0 firmware), or if it were more affordable to try the system's commercial games before buying it (I am <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> paying $290 to play a game that I may or may not like), then forum regulars might warm up to it more.

Being objective means coming to your conclusions through valid reasoning instead of bias. Being objective does NOT imply avoiding any claims that one is better. Not making any claims about which, if either, is better is being indecisive, not objective.

<br/>
Standard rule of thumb for emulation is that the host platform must be about 10x faster than the emulated system for full-speed emulation to be possible. The PSP is faster than the DS, but certainly not 10x, so the only hope it would have of fully emulating the DS would be if it's CPU was a faster ARM9 - which also is not the case. So "the thought that the psp could possibly emulate the DS" is not compelling, it is misinformed.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Abscissa on Wed May 18, 2005 5:46 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Standard rule of thumb for emulation is that the host platform must be about 10x faster than the emulated system for full-speed emulation to be possible.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Assuming interpretive emulation and similar graphics architectures. With just-in-time recompilation, high-level emulation (i.e. static recompilation of standard library code), and graphics hacks, this requirement of a 10:1 ratio can be overcome to an extent.

Given that Nintendo is the exclusive author of the ARM7 code for official games, the ARM7 can likely be HLE'd. This leaves a 5:1 ratio for the PSP's MIPS to the Nintendo DS's ARM9, which might be good enough to run games that don't use 100% of the ARM9 CPU time or which use libraries that can be HLE'd.
<br/>
<br/>
Emulate the touch screen the same way that ports of light gun games do: with the PSP's analog stick.
<br/>
<br/>
But still, I'd suggest emulating the GBA on the PSP before emulating anything else.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a PSP and its a bitch to put hombrew on it... Heres why and yes I own a PSP, sony is updating the BIO in the PSP with newer ones, either dowloading content from the net via Wi-FI, newer games that upgrades the bios, or when linking with another player via wi-fi, the PSP with the new BIOS will upgrade the PSP with the old bios...
<br/>
<br/>
If the PSP gets downgraded it will break certain boot files wich could make the PSP work impropertly..
<br/>
<br/>
If you flash the BIOS, chances are high of having a DEAD psp, meaning turn it on and boom black screen...
<br/>
<br/>
why does sony do this?
<br/>
to prevent people from making homebrew stuff on their hardware and playing PSP ISO's</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by GBAJAY on Wed Sep 07, 2005 2:07 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Isn't that kinda the whole idea of emulating? :-) You are emulating a NES system, which you can get for less than $10, on a computer that'll cost you $700. Altough the emulation is probably pretty good, but without the piercing noise and the incredibly uncomfortable NES kontroller it's still not a perfect emulation. :)<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
