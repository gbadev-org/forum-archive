I've always wondered what research could be done and what it would find, and although  I expected it to raise awareness, I did not expect the people who downloaded illegally to be the ones who spent more.

Well this is coming from the BBC, and they - as the primary government funded channel, and first channel in England - must retain their credibility.

It does not take much to conduct a confidential survey asking about their illegal download activities and their spending activities. To say that this is impossible to attain implies that questionnaires have no reliability, implying that nearly all of the statistics we have are 'BS'.

Many statistics are intentionally misleading.  OK, misleading is a bad word.  They are just intentionally leading.  At times leading can be misleading.  Anyone wanting to support a point can find statistics that support that point.  If the statistics were made to support a particular point, there is good chance they are moot.  Especially if the person funding or carrying out the data collection has a (hidden) agenda.

I'll admit that I'd rather base my decisions on something rather than nothing.  Good data collection can be done.  I've seen it done.  Not everyone does good data collection.  (For what it's worth, I trust that the BBC does, or at least tries to do good data collection.)

Your results might not paint the complete picture- assuming you want the complete picture.  Where do you get your sample?  How can you assure me that your sample isn't biased.  I worked on one survey where apartments were under represented the first time around.  They had to go back and fix that.

Can't you create MP3s from cd tracks with winamp?  (Programs have become very fancy.)  That is probably the least amout of trouble.  It sounds like you are optimizing for cost though.

"It's encouraging that many illegal file-sharers are starting to use legal services," said BPI spokesman Matt Philips.
<br/>
<br/>
"But our concern is that file-sharers' expenditure on music overall is down, a fact borne out by study after study.
<br/>
<br/>
"The consensus among independent research is that a third of illegal file-sharers may buy more music and around two thirds buy less.

Well I think that there may be something misleading about the study. Even if the statistics are 100% accurate for the entire world, the BPI gives the impression that the reason for this figure is that the people who download are the people who were already paying for their music. But adding the opinions of critics who say that the quality of good music has dropped, and that a lot of artists are releasing tracks for figures and not for the good of music is also another candidate for the drop. I myself do not want to pay $15 for 4 tracks in an album. I bought the obie trice album when it came out and it was ok, but I was bitterly disappointed. What I have found is that I tend to make my own playlists and cd collections using tracks I like, which is most likely what downloaders are doing.

I've been unsuccessfully looking for another report I found some time ago which correlated several characteristics of p2p users with music piracy. That report showed no overall impact in the general case but when several other variables such as technical ability and access to broadband then a significant reduction in spending on music was found.
<br/>
<br/>
There are also some other reports which suggest that the revenue share of music is dropping because consumers are spending their money on other things such as DVDs - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5281272.stm" target="_blank">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5281272.stm</a>

Personally I find DRM to be a complete pain in the neck. My girlfriend is quite fond of her Zen Micro and I usually rip our CD collection for tracks she wants to listen to on the move. We've looked at legal download sites and purchased some tracks from Tesco's portal but found that the licensing then prevented us from copying said tracks to the Zen Micro :/ I'm pretty sure that I did something wrong when activating the license but I was definitely put off purchasing more by the experience.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

There are going to be two things to change that. Firstly there will be a site that allows completely free mp3 downloads via advertising, and [possibly if memory serves right] an alternative to i-tunes that allows mp3 downloads.

Well that's another question on its own. What effect has the internet had on music from all angles? File sharing has made music more accessible to some, given others much more recognition thab they would have had, but could also have the knock on effect of reducing sales. This is where I think we would find nothing conclusive - there is no way to measure this. There were plenty of other things that were going on at the same time, and the costs of other media, increase in music channels, quality of digital television, availability of internet radio and poor quality of albums could all have contributed much more than piracy. And I always think of pokemon, vs the dreamcast. Did the dreamcast fail due to its lineup (no way), advertising (doubtful), sony (very likely), or piracy (the #1 culprit)? Was pokemon successful because it was anime (quite possibly), it had 'cute' animals (quite possibly), because it was the most distributed pirate game gaining recognition (maybe, just maybe), marketting (very likely), or gameplay (very likely).

Let's say I'm playing a board game with my friends.  I spend basically everything to get a nifty upgrade.  Somebody hits me with something.  Not very damaging, but given that I just got a nifty upgrade I can't really cope very well.  On my turn I draw something particularly unlucky that puts me out of the game.

You could argue that.  The industries certain won't listen though.
<br/>
<br/>
The "industries" employ features that are not meant for (ie, not being sold to) the end users, so certain end users remove those features.  I think that makes sense.  The "industries" are still going to be upset by the removal of those features.
<br/>
<br/>
I have no sympathy for pirates that live in rich countries.  If you live in a country where you only make a dollar a day, piracy makes a lot of sense.  You couldn't really buy those products even if you wanted to.  If you live in a country where you can make seven dollars an hour, there are very few products you can't save up for and buy.  If you make more than that, all the less reason for you to be involved in piracy.

(This is the real first note: Probably the industries are making many people not want to pay, because of DRM and other stuff.)
<br/>
<br/>
(Even before first note: Why not do both? Pay for and download the same album? If you get the CD and then give it back to the person who made that album without asking for any money back, it not only increases revenues but also reduces expenses because they don't have to make so many CDs, and of course it will also prevent you from having to deal with DRM! (Just don't tell anyone))
<br/>
<br/>
(First note: I agree with that, and Nintendo Wii Virtual Console also uses DRM (Digital Rights Management, but a more accurate name would be Digital Restrictions Management, because it manages restrictions, not rights) and probably doesn't even have everything that I may want. Anyways, $5.00 is a good price for a NES game (is this United States money? If I am Canadian do I need to convert to Canadian?) but I don't want the DRM version. Of course, I probably also cannot play homebrew or Japanese games using that (of course, it is even less likely to run European games, which uses PAL, on a NTSC TV) (which is one reason I don't like the Virtual Console), that is why I am making my own game system (you can use homebrew NES/GB/GBC/GBA game on Linux, as well as any other software specifically designed for that system) (I already started building the controller!))
<br/>
<br/>
(Another note: I have played one PAL homebrew game (The Masmix), it asks you to set your emulator in PAL mode before it starts, but all that it does if set to PAL mode is it runs too slow), so I keep it in NTSC mode (and I cannot see my score very well in NTSC mode, but the game works fine other than that).)
<br/>
<br/>
(Even more note: I am not paying for TV service, but I still get full TV service half the time (but only on one TV, not both), which is probably a problem with the service provider, does that make me a thief? You can also record a show and then fast-forward or delete the commercials (there is a software to automatically delete commercials before playing it back, look at PC Magazine for details), does that make you a thief?)
<br/>
<br/>
(Another even more note: Is it possible to live in a country where you can earn $7 an hour, pay your rent &amp; bills, eat properly and still manage to save up for luxury items? How much does the rent and stuff cost? I still live with my parents because I don't want to pay for a new house, to me it is unnecessary to pay that much for a new house. Or do people that make DRM also attempt you to be forced to buy a new house?)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmmm. I was just thinking about pirate albums and DVD's. They sell pretty well, and that says a lot. It means that people are willing to pay for DVD's (at the cost of quality) for a reduced price. If retail stores had the same price then pirates would have less ground to stand on whatever price they offered.
<br/>
<br/>
A song in the UK topped the charts with its download sales alone, so the legal download market is really picking up. But they need to take their figures and make sense of it. If downloaders are spending ?5 a month on music media, and those who don't spend ?2, then maybe you can bridge the gap and have a service like KaZaa for ?5 a month. It's cheap, but if it can capture the rest then maybe it will work.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there is technology to be developed that can cater for it. I think that a combination of p2p, internet radio, and customer profiling will form part of tomorrows technology. But how it will all glue together will be what detirmines how successful it is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Eat properly?  At minimum wage, sacrafices must be made to save up for luxury items.  =)  Privacy (roommates) and food come to mind first.

<br/>
If you can pay your rent, bills and eat properly at minimum wage, you can find a way to save up for something that costs $30.  I'll even go out on a limb and say that you could probably do that every month.  I'm fairly sure that most people spend this much on nonsense anyways.
<br/>
<br/>
My point is that, in a country like the UK, you should be able to figure out how to save up for what you want to buy if you have to be creative.  If you live in an incredibly poor county, you either don't have that option, or creative == piracy.

They didn't sell enough commercials.  Clearly nobody wants to see those programs.  Or, there is some other reason to believe that there isn't a market for the product.

Right.  Certain (less than working age) year olds download a lot of things they couldn't buy even if they wanted to.  That makes sense.  I think that the child labor laws in the US are silly.

Do you know anyone who has been denied?  What was the reason?  I think the hoops are silly, but in my experience the high school students who really want jobs seem to find them.  Many of the high school students I've worked with would rather go home early than earn money.  I think their parents want them to have a job.  Either that or they want money and don't enjoy work.
<br/>
<br/>
I know at least one student who claims to want a job, but doesn't like any of the jobs available to students.  This person can't be bothered to look for a job because "none of the jobs are real jobs".  Needless to say, when this person complains about wanting money, I'm not inclined to feel sympathetic.

Do you want to talk about if or how piracy helps sales?  Piracy helps sales.  It also doesn't affect sales.  It alse hurts sales.  All at the same time.  There are different types of pirates with different reasons for stealing.  The relative proportions of each determine the overall effect.  Knowing why people commit piracy and how these groups interact can help you figure out what to do about it (if you care).
<br/>
<br/>
I think that the results of any study are going to be very region specific.  Does this matter?

<br/>
I agree with you completely.  My point is that I understand why certain people are pirates and I don't understand why other people are pirates.
<br/>
<br/>
Does piracy help sales?  I think before this can be answered, two questions have to be answered.  What causes piracy?  What causes sales?
<br/>
<br/>
What causes piracy?  I can think of six types of pirates.  Commercial pirates.  Providers.  Experimenters and crackers.  Unable to pay.  Unwilling to pay.
<br/>
<br/>
Clearly commercial piracy hurts sales, and the motivation is obvious.  The damage is double when customers think they have real products.  Commercial pirates steal sales.
<br/>
<br/>
Providers.  People with download servers.  People who give CDs to their friends.  Motivations vary.  Are sales lost?  Certainly.  To what extent?  Depends on who the products/data are given to.  Publishers hate illegal distributors.
<br/>
<br/>
Experimenters and crackers.  These people may have no interest in the product itself or they may already own the product.  This category probably applies more to software than music at this point, but when new formats are released, these people pop up.  They want to see if they can copy something, or if the encryption can be broken, so they try.  They may be working with somebody who has other motivations (like commercial pirates).  They might know that they are doing something wrong.  They might justify what they are doing.  They may not actually be doing anything illegal, but they certainly pave the way for everyone else.  This category probably has a small direct impact on sales, but a huge indirect one.
<br/>
<br/>
Unable to pay.  Will this person ever be able to pay?  If not, no sales will be generated.  Ever.  If so, the next question is, is this person willing to pay?  If so, sales are generated.  If not...
<br/>
<br/>
Unwilling to pay.  People have all sorts of reasons.  Less cut and dry, I think that this is the category to talk about.  Why are they unwilling to pay, and what would make them willing to pay?
<br/>
<br/>
For example, pack rats.  Some people collect pirated material for the sake of collecting.  They probably won't buy something they already have.  If they can't get it anywhere else, they might buy it for the sake of having it.  Some of people just enjoy doing illegal things and probably enjoy bragging about the value of pirated material they have.  (No sales.  Ever.)  If they don't give it away and they don't do anything with it and they never would have bought it, then they are harmless (but odd).
<br/>
<br/>
What causes sales?  Exposure certainly causes sales.  Piracy increases exposure to something.  So does the radio.  Both are forms of free marketing.  The difference is that after you listen to the radio, the music is gone.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interesting categorisation. When I was first introduced to internet piracy, it was when kazaa was new. First people just downloaded comedic clips, there was no mention of music. Then people started floating around music of people I never heard of, papoose, 50 cent (before aftermath), unreleased material, and were introducing us to new music.
<br/>
<br/>
My first introduction to fat joe (and his twin brother) was a tape my cousin recorded (before the downloading days). My reintroduction to him was a guy in college who gave me a copy of one of his albums - and that *honestly* got me into hip hop more seriously. So some motivations for people sharing is simply ..... sharing. Later a friend of the guy gave me a list of artists I never heard of, artists that you will never hear about in shops, artists who probably cannot distribute their music. So I was puzzled, how do I get this, and he pointed me to kazaa. I had a modem so I never bothered, but in those days most peoples gateway  to kazaa (that I knew of) was like that.
<br/>
<br/>
Pokemon was the same. Before it was released my friend with broadband introduced me to emulation. I'd go to his house after school, play playstation, and then we'd play pokemon. This eventually led me to delve into homebrew ^_^
<br/>
<br/>
And DRM is a scam to publishers - with music anyway. You cannot stop film or music piracy, it is impossible without introducing 24/7 surveillance in peoples homes. And you can bypass the anti copying technology quite easily, some devices by default filter out those lines anyway [for some reason].
<br/>
<br/>
But with the figures showing that pirates spend more, it makes you rethink how everything effects everything else. Internet piracy is just a new form of piracy. High speed dubbing, minidisks and cd writers were around long before everyone had p2p and broadband - and records can be easily bootlegged. Half of the music I had as a kid were copies of stuff my friend bought, high speed dubbing allowed us to share music and hear something we had never heard before. I'm sure that whenever something that is not highly publicised will have their own set of 'promoting' providers who want to expose the track for any reason - be it to simply share your experience, or to identify yourself as the latest source. I remember my aunt recording Destiny's Child's 'bills' from the TV and watching it non stop before my uncle bought her the CD. That [until the CD was bought] was ancient piracy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What is okay and not okay to do is usually a question of law and moral. No one has denied the legal barriers in theft. I always enjoy when people come around and define moral for me. I'm not saying piracy is okay, but I don't think the picture is as black and white as Mr Lynx here is painting it. No, it's never legal to steal, but in some situations to some people it might be morally acceptable. And I don't think there's much difference between luxury items and other items in this respect either, it's up to the person doing an act to decide if his or her moral finds it to be right or not.

Sharing is probably the most common case.  To split the costs of a CD, you have to either have some or sort of ownership arrangement or copy the CD.

I'm not convinced that sharing is the only reason, especially for people with download servers.  I think that ego extension can be a factor.  I'm also sure that some people who run download servers are collecting money from ads and affiliate programs (ie, quasi-commercial).

I wasn't talking about an end-all solution that makes piracy impossible, but the end-all solution that provides a complete system for accessing money for a fee.
<br/>
<br/>
I think that the ideal solution will involve some sort of profiling that takes into account what you listen to, what type of person you are and who you are likely to share interests with. The complete solution will also identify those who tend to hear the music first to quickly spot the latest tracks that would be of interest to a particular group. Songs can then be presented to the user in some sort of *spanking new music* fashion along with some mechanism for knowing whether or not they like the track - possibly by either an immediate rating that benefits the user by automatically managing the playlist.
<br/>
<br/>
But there is more technology to come, technology to allow mobile phones and mp3 players to be constantly connected to a wireless internet connection, which will make this much more fesible and effective. The research can tell you whether or not there is any point in going into a system like this.
<br/>
<br/>
We already have a portable system with fairly good battery life (the DS) that can be connected to wireless internet access points (I believe) that could eventually benefit from such a system. So this discussion can be more relevant to US than we might first have thought. It does not just stop at music, what about films and games? We all want to make money, and we need to know what effect piracy has, what attitudes these people have to paying, and how we can benefit from the knowledge that these bodies have researched.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: And it appears that kazaa has a similar mechanism, well that is how I interpreted his statement - although he could have just been speaking about what would be good and not necessarily anything that was or may be implemented in kazaa's system.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok.. so can you clearly post in quotes exactly what you want to discuss if it has nothing to do with morals (aka: is stealing ok?), has nothing to do with piracy on the market, as that topic has been beat to hell in the other post, with plenty of "research" provided for both sides of the issue.  We've all heard the "Pirates buy games" and "Developers need to get paid".. what is left?  I think YOU are completely missing my point as to why this topic is useless.. Is it because you don't want to reread the thread I linked?  
<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a question or idea that hasn't been covered in that thread?  Do you have any points you would like to discuss specifically?  Because if you look that the first post of this thread you are only stating that you don't believe that pirates are the ones spending more money.. And rightly so.. as it is complete BS.

In regards to what this was originally about, I simply come across the article while searching for legal mp3 download sites. Now that I have found it, I think that understanding piracy, and seeing how it can be tackled could do quite a lot for us. We live by the premise that we can never make money from our homebrew work, but I believe we are wrong for believing that. I think we are wrong for believing pirates don't want to pay for their media, I just think we go about the wrong way of presenting it to them. They do pay for it, they do pay for pirate DVD's so what are the rest of us doing wrong? It's not just down to price, pirate DVD's aren't much cheaper than retail DVD's, or the old CD-WOW.
<br/>

I know how you can encourage results, and I doubt that the British Broadcasting Channel (with their 50 years of experience, and the other body mentioned in the article) would be stupid enough to not know that.

I would assume that the thread was meant to discuss interesting news reports and statistics relating to piracy as a marketing tool.
<br/>
<br/>
It has been suggested that some part of the success of the Pokemon phenomenon could be attributed to the widespread brand familiarity generated by piracy of the games.
<br/>
<br/>
In other places I've seen suggestions that the number of playstation and xbox consoles sold could be due in some small part to the ease of piracy and or modding on those platforms. The fate of the dreamcast would perhaps refute that theory but weren't there more Playstation games? Perhaps piracy on the Dreamcast was <span style="font-weight: bold">too</span> easy.
<br/>
<br/>
The success or not of a console is probably due to many factors but probably relates most to publisher support. I know that some publishers basically pulled the carpet from under the ST and it's derivatives by deciding to put their money into Amiga games. There was one particular incident I remember well during an ST/Amiga project where the lead coder had written some specific STe optimisations which made the game faster on that particular platform. When the publisher discovered this we were forced to pull the code because the ST was a secondary platform and they didn't want to denigrate the Amiga version ( their words ).
<br/>
<br/>
In the "good old days" it was possible to build a reasonable income from games written in a back bedroom, selling tapes via small adverts in the magazines of the day. Some people even made their fortune back then, building some of the giants of today. With the advent of the internet and the widespread uptake of broadband some people predicted a return to those glory days where single programmers or even small groups could make a fortune cutting out the middle man with digital distribution and online payments. Since fast broadband and P2P services are now widespread it would seem that the majority of net savvy users are doing everything in their power to avoid paying for anything that can be distributed digitally it seems that the new digital economy thrives on providing services to those users and selling them things which are difficult to copy through affiliate links and pay per click advertising.
<br/>
<br/>
This all brings up quite a few questions -
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>Are modern consumers honest enough to make software a viable market?
<br/>
</li><li>Where do we find those consumers?
<br/>
</li><li>How do we get them to buy our particular product?
<br/>
</li><li>Can we make software cheap enough to be worth buying or should we be looking for alternative revenue sources to allow us to give away our software?
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
I can probably think of a few more but those are probably enough to generate an interesting thread for now.
<br/>
<br/>
As the maintainer of devkitARM I find that support questions and website maintainance suck more of my time. Personally I like the fact that devkitARM is probably one of the most widely used set of tools in the homebrew scene today. I even get a kick out of the great software are producing with the toolchain but it's rapidly becoming a victim of it's own success.
<br/>
<br/>
I find myself wondering if there is any way I could use the devkitpro.org traffic to build a reasonable income which would allow me to spend more time making it better. It would be great if I could generate enough revenue to pay people to take care of support requests and buy some decent prizes for a competition or two. Unfortunately adsense pulled my account for alleged click fraud so that's not an option. I know several other people with homebrew websites have experienced similar heavy handedness from google and I suspect that relatively low traffic combined with some users trying to "help out" by clicking multiple ads is probably the primary reason for setting off alarm bells at google.
<br/>

If anyone has any experience with monetising websites I'd love to hear from you. I'd even be prepared to offer such a person a cut of any revenue that they could help generate.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Personally, unless it is sitting on the shelf at Best Buy or another store that sells software, I don't believe so.  Being that it is just as easy to download pirate copies as clicking an order button on a web site.

I can't help but bring up Asheron's Call.  Not only did consumers pay $10 per month to play a game they paid $20 (which should have been free), but the game was addictive enough for individuals to have 2 or 3 online accounts at $10 per month.  Now that is just rediculous marketing skills right there.  You want to make major money?  That is it.  Now, can a homebrewer do something like that?  I think so.. but of course.. it wouldn't be something one person does or it happen overnight.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, the only ideas I can come up with on how to make the most popular dev kit for the DS profitable would be to branch off a "professional" version that you have to pay for.  Negatives is that you have to manage two branches of the software.. OR, if you compare it to PHP Nuke..  It is free, but if you pay $10 you get the newest version, where for free, you can only get one version behind the latest.  Being that $10 isn't much, more people are willing to do it.  Now, if you can take the number of downloads you get per new version, multiply it by $10 each.. does that look pretty good?  Of course, not everyone will purchase the newest version but it couldn't hurt.  So, with that method, you could generate a few dollars and not have to manage branches..<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think any smart company wouldn't depend completely on their actual sales. If you really want to make money you have to explore other income streams as well.
<br/>
<br/>
But if sales are really important to you, then I would suggest offering them more than just a product. Give them full service and personal support if they need it. Having a community around your software does help.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
