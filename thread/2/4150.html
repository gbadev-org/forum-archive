I'm immediately looking for the save type of Sword of Mana.  (I'd be curious to know what media my other carts use.)

The flash ram in my tactics ogre cart died.  I bought it used and have read other cases of this (gamefaqs board).  The save seemed to worked fine a year ago, I set the cart aside and when I came back to it everything was gone.  I know flash has a lifespan of X flashes, does it also have a lifespan of X monthes?
<br/>
<br/>
I did muck about with reading/writing to "SRAM" with my visoly flash linker.  Could this have shortened the lifespan of the flash ram or even destroyed it?

No. Flash does not have a expiry date.
<br/>
You sure the game is flash based?

Extremely unlikely (one in a billion or so), but technically possible if the flash has a "write protect sector" feature (far from all flash memory models have this feature).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No.  The <a class="postlink" href="http://releases.pocketheaven.com/?system=gba&amp;section=release&amp;rel=0432" target="_blank">page listed above</a> lists the save type as FLASH_V126 (512Kbit).  I'm assuming that that means this game uses a flash based save. O_o

In theory could not the write protect feature be deactivated again?
<br/>

I think I managed to move saves from the cart to the PC and back to the cart before the save died.  Interestingly enough, I dumped the ROM and ran it in no$gba.  When I tried to do a mid map suspend, the message "Failed to suspend data."  pops up.  Of course, VBA did not give this failure message.  Neither does the cart when run on hardware.  The game saves and loads properly on hardware, but all the data is lost when the unit is turned off.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I somehow suspect that the people who posted on the gamefaqs boards did not 'subject' their carts to flash linkers. =P

No. But as I said, it is extremely unlikely to accidentally activate write protection. And not all flash models have the feature. I'am not even sure Nintendo use flash memories with write protection features at all.

This is exactly what happens when the battery dies in a SRAM based cart.
<br/>
Perhaps there are two versions of the game? One with SRAM and one with flash.
<br/>
The fact that it saves without complaining tells me that the flash is not write protected. The fact that it loads fine indicates that there is nothing wrong with the memory.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Two versions makes the most sense.

Thanks for the info.  What is the typical lifespan of SRAM?  Are there different grades?  I have NES games that still work.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The lifespan of SRAM is unlimited.
<br/>
It's the battery backing the SRAM you have to worry about.
<br/>
Typical lifetime of the batteries in GBA carts is 5-10years. But if you are really unlucky and got a bad battery, it can die much quicker.
<br/>
<br/>
Take a small screwdriver and open the cart. If there is a small lithium cell battery in it, then the savegame is SRAM based.
<br/>
Check the battery solderjoints, it could be just a bad solderjoint, and it that case you will solve the problem by fixing the solderjoint.
<br/>
Otherwise you need to replace the battery. (Desolder the old one and replace with a new one)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
