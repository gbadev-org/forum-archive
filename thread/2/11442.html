You need to buy a headphone splitter and an 1/8 inch stereo male to 1/8 inch stereo male audio cable. You can find both at any store that sells stereo equipment (I won't name names per forum policy). Plug one end of the cable into the headphone splitter and the other into the "line input" jack on your sound card. Now unplug your computer's speakers from your sound card, plug them into the other jack on the headphone splitter, and then plug the headphone splitter into the sound card's audio output jack.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Set up Audacity to record</span>
<br/>
Download and install <a class="postlink" href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Audacity</a>. While it is installing, start Volume Control (the speaker icon in the taskbar notification area) and make sure that the Mute checkbox in the Line In column is checked; otherwise you'll get horrible feedback. In Options &gt; Properties, select Recording and click OK. The window's title changes to Recording Control. Now make sure that the Select checkbox under Line In is checked. Keep Recording Control open for the next step.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Set your levels</span>
<br/>
Press record on Audacity. Start playing the song in iTunes. If the waveform looks too small or too large, change the level in the Line In column of Recording Control until the largest peaks of the waveform just barely touch the top and bottom of the channel.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Continue using the Analog Hole</span>
<br/>
Once you have passed these steps, read Audacity's manual and <a class="postlink" href="http://audacityteam.org/wiki/index.php?title=Recording_Tips" target="_blank">Audacity Wiki:Recording Tips</a> to see how to record your audio into a .wav file. Then download <a class="postlink" href="http://www.rarewares.org/mp3.html" target="_blank">LameDropXPd</a> and read its manual to learn how to turn your .wav file into a .mp3 file.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What about just recording from the wave output? And no it will not 'really' lose any sound quality at all. There may be a very small amount of noise added but at line level I doubt it will be anything near audible through line in/out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As I understand it: <ol type="1"><li>not all sound card drivers have that capability (called "What-U-Hear" on some Creative sound cards), </li><li>this method applies equally well to recording music from a GBA, DS, or iPod, and </li><li>some DRM systems are capable of designating specific audio streams as being mixed into the "Secure Audio Path", which by Microsoft's decree shall never be mixed into any cleartext digital output such as What-U-Hear. </li></ol><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
