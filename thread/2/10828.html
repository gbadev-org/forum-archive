    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys,
<br/>
<br/>
Where can I find information about GBA cartridge <b style="color:#FFA34F">manufacturing</b> costs. For example, I would like to know how much it cost for 5000 32mb, no-EEProm cartridges. I would also like to be able to compare those prices to bigger and with EEProm cartridges.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anybody know where the carts for the 2004Mbit Compo came from? Surely 32Mbit and SRAM (32KB?) would be enough for <span style="font-style: italic">most</span> homebrewers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">IIRC they came from a "dishonest" source, and no more carts are available at this point.  What ever happened to freelancer?
