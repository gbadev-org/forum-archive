You have to book by tomorrow, but its dirt cheap. Not sure if they have offers for other countries though.

I found London Stanstead -&gt; Bratislava return on 4th Apr -&gt; 8th Apr for ?0.02; and found some cheap hotels in bratislava; which is a beatiful city with many decent shops and people. And alcohol is better and cheap; got some russian brandy, sweeter than sugar for a fiver from there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
