    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looking at that thread about what people think about the DS got me thinking about the touch screen. Since it is claimed that the two screens will offer new gaming options I thought we needed a place to discuss them; or at least air our own opinions/ideas.
<br/>
<br/>
For a start you can now have flight sims with immediate access to rudders and pedals. You can play war sims in a new light with better control than any mouse could. But these are all obvious ones centred around mice that we have wished for in a console, and aren't exactly new/innovative.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">My new concept</span>: Sword of the dan
<br/>
You are an elite ninja assasin, assigned to attain swords to arm your fellow ninjas. You will first remove a samurai's sword before fighting off a feat of armed and armoured soldiers. After this you have to quickly collect their swords before leaving quickly.
<br/>
<br/>
As I have not thought about how to disarm members, or a fun way to collect the swords, the battle against the armoured soldiers is where the gameplay happens. To fight them you must swing your sword along a given path. Failing to follow this path closely enough will result in energy loss, while hitting the wrong target completely may result in death depending on where you hit by accident.
<br/>
<br/>
So basically a guy may come from the left while your sword is raised in your right hand. A path from the sword to a target is given and the player will then attempt to follow this line on the screen. Eventually only targets will appear and you have to use your own intelligence based on previous paths given, to detirmine an effortless path to hit them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I almost come to that conclusion myself writing that post. Then again having a touch screen gives you a slight speed and accuracy advantage over a mouse, which is why you can easily have rudders, etc. acting better than if it was a mouse.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure there are plenty of new challenging things we could do with it. For example take that old "line" game where you shoot at the falling lines. Called "command defence" or something of a similar nature. Anyway mix that with after-burner and you pretty much have "Sword of the dan", which would be no fun on a mouse, not even an optical one.
<br/>
<br/>
I see a touchscreen as something in-between a mouse and eyetoy. Or would it be better to put eye-toy on the same level as touchscreen, and the mouse? Whatever way you put it, the eyetoy has given birth to pretty interesting games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nope, and I'm kind of glad.  I can just imagine hundreds of horror stories about styluses (stylii?) deeply embedded in the lower screen. ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A touch screen is a pointing device.  I'm not big on the PDA virtual keyboards, but they beat the old school way of putting in character names.

Not downward force, but you could use an algorithm that determines force based on the period and distance of a given "sweep" motion.
<br/>
<br/>
So for a boxing game a short jab could be communicated with a quick upward sweep or tap. A haymaker could be communicated with a slow pull back and then a fast, sweeping arc across the entire touch screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Boxing would be a pretty cool DS game, actually... You could show the opponent in the top screen and a top-down view of your boxer on the touch screen.

The touchpad is an enormous improvement over the GBA controls, but better than a mouse? I can't see it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is a huge difference between a <span style="font-weight: bold">touch pad</span> and a <span style="font-weight: bold">touch screen</span>.  A mouse and a pad?  Maybe not so much.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First, I need to find a tiny balloon. It should be the size of a pea. Next, 
<br/>
I'll need to fill the balloon with mineral oil (or proprietary isoelastomer
<br/>
fluid) using a teeny tiny funnel. After sealing the neck, I would place it
<br/>
on the touch screen of the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Rolling the balloon left and right would define the X-axis. Moving up and
<br/>
down would define the Y-axis. By applying finger pressure, the balloon
<br/>
will deform. The amount of spread is proportional to finger pressure.
<br/>
This spread, on the surface of the touch screen, can be calculated by 
<br/>
software. This would define the Z-axis. 
<br/>
<br/>
Another parameter can be derived by measuring the delta, or change, 
<br/>
of time versus size of spread. This would yield finger velocity. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now, does anyone know where I can find tiny balloons?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Balloon Fight for Game Boy Advance. You can get it officially through Animal Crossing, e-reader, or Famicom Mini, or you can get it unofficially through PocketNES.
