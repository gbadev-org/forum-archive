Well, you could cycle links with the dpad and then activate them with the a button... Only someone would have to code that first I guess... ;)

Tab-cycling links sucks. I can only imagine how DPad-cycling them would be.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm working on a browser. It's pretty retarded right now. It only recognizes &lt;b&gt;,&lt;i&gt;,&lt;p&gt;, and &lt;br&gt; tags. But I pulled a book from the Gutenburg project and it scrolls through it at decent speed.
<br/>

You can download it at <a href="http://www.thingker.com/gba/gbaBrowser.zip" target="_blank">http://www.thingker.com/gba/gbaBrowser.zip</a> , if you're interested in taking a peek 
<br/>
<br/>
Right now only two buttons do anything. "DOWN" scrolls. "A" switches through three subpixel display modes, which can make the text more clear, depending on your LCD.
<br/>
<br/>
In the next few weeks I should have a much better version done, along with a little tool that allows you to package up a directory of HTML files and create a .GBA file out of them. Should be cool for reading eBooks and the like. I'd love to hear any other suggestions on what this might be useful for.

<br/>
How about entering the browser into the GBAX2005 competition?
<br/>
<br/>
As for what the browser can be used for: Do you know Plucker or AvantGo? They go through online websites, save them up to a specified link depth, simplify them and then pack them up so that you can read them on your PDA. This way you can sync your PDA with a PC and then read all the CNN news etc on your bus ride to work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Strange! Being a web dev I thought about doing this on the GBA too, but concluded that it would be pretty pointless as the HTML would have to be so controlled and limited I'd only be able to use my own.
<br/>
<br/>
To pack Mozilla or Internet Explorer into a GBA just isn't going to happen. I did write a stupendously simple "eBook" text viewer so I could have a novel or two on my flash cart for long, boring train journeys, as well as games.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the DS could well change my thinking. I love my DS already and I've only had it a fortnight. It's got enough oomph to run a reasonable HTML parser with moderate error handling and the touch screen means super user friendly scrolling and hyperlinking, but best of all if we can work out how to write out own IPv4 stack routines then it'll connect to internet anywhere there's a public WiFi spot. Sweet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
