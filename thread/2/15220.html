    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, today I got myself a copy of Zelda Twilight Princess, installed devkitPPC and compiled the "Hello World" template. While these forums have been extremely useful with getting started with GBA and DS development, I wonder if there's anything similar available for Wii? From Google I found gcdev.com forums, which have lots of Gamecube talk - I guess this is the closest one to the subject there is, or not?
<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone else over here trying out Wii development right now? Would be nice to hear about your experiences and tips on how to get started.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Went through some Gamecube examples last night, GX seems easy enough to start with and it's nice that everything seems to work also on Wii. Just rebooting the console, loading Zelda and the gamesave every time is really painful, but I couldn't find yet how to reboot the elf-file from the SD card.

I don't think it will always need Zelda. Notice the Channels button in the video when he goes to the Data Managment section. I haven't checked this yet on the Wii I have access to, yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So how long do you guess it will be before Nintendo issues a new revision of Twilight Princess that includes proper bounds checking, just as MechAssault and GTA:LCS were updated when hackers used corrupt saves as tools to hack the console? Or before Nintendo issues a new revision of Wii firmware that detects and rejects Twilight Hack saves, as Sony did with PSP firmware 2.01 (plugging GTA:LCS) and PSP firmware 3.51 (plugging Lumines)?

On March 21st, Nintendo added a new version of the Wii firmware -- IOS37 -- to the Wii update servers. This version of the firmware has a fixed signature-checking function.
<br/>
<br/>
When a title (game, channel, etc) starts, it tells the system menu (using a field in the TMD) what version of the IOS it needs to run on -- to support this, the Wii stores all previous firmware versions. (For most Wiis, this will be IOS9, IOS11, IOS13, IOS15, IOS17, IOS20, IOS21, IOS30, IOS31, IOS33, IOS34, IOS35, IOS36, and now IOS37).
<br/>
<br/>
As of March 22nd, no software uses IOS37 -- the System Menu currently uses IOS30. An updated System Menu will likely use the new IOS37.
<br/>
<br/>
What does this mean?
<br/>
<br/>
    * Until the system menu is updated to use IOS37, it will have no effect. 
<br/>
<br/>
    * Once the system menu is updated to use IOS37, "Trucha-Signed" discs -- or channels -- will stop working, as will the Freeloader disc. 
<br/>
<br/>
    * At that point, "homebrew channels" would be considered "invalid" by the system. The consequences of this are unclear, but that could potentially prevent the Wii from booting. 
<br/>
<br/>
    * Other versions of IOS are not affected. 
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
That says there's a field in the titles, to tell the IOS which version to run. But, after that, it states that when the system menu is updated, the homebrew channels will be invalid. How can they be invalid if they attempt to tell the IOS to use a version without the bug fix?(Or wouldn't the system care about that field, and only use the latest IOS version, which would invalidate hb, in the future?)
<br/>
<br/>
Other than this signature bugfix, does anything really change in the IOS signature-verification between versions? So, would a channel with that field set for a newer IOS, work with our old IOS version?
<br/>
<br/>
They say the Zelda hack is unaffected. So, this update only affects the homebrew channel(s).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When the system menu is updated later on it won't be attempting to load an older firmware, it will have the newest firmware stored in the field in it's title. Just like at the moment, the current system menu has the older firmware in it's field and doesn't use the newest firmware. I think!
<br/>
<br/>
Does this mean that since the Twilight Princess disc has the older firmware stored in it's title and is always loaded with it, that the Twilight Hack won't be stopped? (By newer firmware anyways)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If the system menu checks the signature on a homebrew channel using IOS37 then it will notice that the signature is invalid.
<br/>
<br/>
The system menu will check that the signature is valid before switching to the IOS used by the channel.
<br/>
<br/>
The signature verification done when installing a new IOS version has the same bug, so it is theoretically possible to install a modified IOS37 that still has the bug.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

actually no, what you really want is exit(0); This is currently dependent on current CVS libogc but will be shifted into stable fairly soon.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
