How are you? Where have you been?

<br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone else is too busy to post in here because they are working on their compo entries =)

<br/>
How about yourself?

Good call SimonB, I wish I had bothered to put in an entry for the comp but I just kept putting it off :P Thats the downside of homebrew development, it takes place at home and not at a 9 to 5 office so it moves slowly.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

My wife and I are in the midst of putting together a big ol' holiday party for friends. Turkeys are in the oven and the house is starting the smell good... 
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I'm trying to squeeze in as much content development as possible for my compo entry. Drawing maps, animating rogue security bots, and all that.  The usual.
<br/>
<br/>
How are you?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dead tired.  I stayed up all night last night reading <a class="postlink" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0571202284/qid=1102199721/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/104-8286560-8826352" target="_blank">The Animator's Survival Kit</a>.  I read it cover to cover... all 342 pages.  At least I think it was 342 pages.  (I'm trying to change my sleeping schedule.)  Fantastic book for anyone interested in 2D animation.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After all the bad press that EA has gotten online lately, I'm being offered a job there.  They're supposed to get back to me on monday to discuss terms.  If I take the job, we'll be moving from Toronto to Vancouver.  I've never worked at a video game company, so this is potentially the fulfilment of an extremely long-term ambition.  
<br/>
<br/>
My wife is pregnant with twins, still 5.5 months from their ETA.
<br/>
<br/>
I actually haven't done much GBA dev lately - haven't been able to really get in to the headspace.  Still like reading the posts in the forum though.
<br/>
<br/>
So I've got some pretty major excitement going, along with significant trepidation.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm actually kind of glad to hear that everyone else here is tired - makes me feel in touch with my peer group.
