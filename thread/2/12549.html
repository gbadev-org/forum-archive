Google PS3 region coding and see what comes up!<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The three regions of the PS2 (NTSC J, NTSC U/C, and PAL) stored the disc's boot sector in three different formats, meaning that publishers who wanted to release one disc for all regions couldn't. But as of the PSP and PS3, region coding is specified by the disc. Publishers on PSP and PS3 are encouraged to make their games all-region, but they can opt out if there are overriding issues. For instance, a game may be based on a literary work or motion picture, and this underlying work's copyright status may vary between regions. <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#Copyright_status" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: italic">Peter Pan</span> is notorious for this</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
