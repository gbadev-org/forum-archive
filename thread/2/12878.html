    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've found that when you are given too much options that you often do not have much choice. Take the hundred different distributions for Linux as an example; sure there are hundreds to choose from - now I need to make a decision.
<br/>
<br/>
But what do I base my decision on? I want Linux, what am I choosing between? Each distribution does the same thing (with my current knowledge); but what I am getting at is not just Linux, but everything where you have a big choice that will change everything about your operation.

I have many of these deep-philosophy-rants too. What I've learned is that it is <span style="font-weight: bold">useless to complain about things you cannot change</span>. I experience this almost every day, and I think you have this feeling very often as well. It might be the effect of a slight depression, or the cause.
<br/>
Anyway, the world works this way and I know you don't feel like adapting but you <span style="font-style: italic">have</span> to. Try changing your mindset. Look at things from another perspective. Please don't stay in this I-don't-like-this-reality-situation because there is no one who will take you to a reality where you find things "your way".

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm just one of those people who don't like to commit to a choice without being informed of why. With Linux I simply tried them all to see what the difference was; and there are differences. I found this amazing website that will ask you a set of questions and guide you to choosing the right distribution; but for win32/mfc and so on; I found the information a little biased.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a little biased to starting with win32 because that is what I started with. I love the way you can arrange windows in Java and winForms too; although Java is far more developed and the best way in winForms is to use the J# library ^_^

These are just some observations, part rant, part wondering what the solution is. I am thinking very much of going back to uni for a Masters; and after looking at the books on offer for learning 'things' I think there is a much better approach. This can be a really good research topic as my previous topic was on learning and I know what books (as they are in my bibliography).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">lol, no research on learning theories. In the last year of my bachelors we did a group project on learning/genetic algorithms, and both topics interested me a lot. So for final year projects there are a few related choices:
<br/>
 - GA for poker AI
<br/>
 - applying advanced learning theories to teaching programming (with gui's etc)
<br/>
 - completing my theory of the 'Image/Learning theorem' where ones knowledge is considered to be a set containing reflections on subsets of a set containing all knowledge. All knowledge contains all truth, plus all beliefs (which may contradict the truth), etc. Also where truth exists, such as the contours of a dog, ones can use his knowledge of what it looks like from the side to figure out what it looks like from the front. In that same way one can take their learning of one subject from a particular angle, and figure out the existing information. Many books support this concept but never have it as part of a single theorem.
<br/>
 - combining searching with theories of AI and learning (was far too complicated for a master)
<br/>
 - GA for music composition
<br/>
 - studies on the application of genes, fitness functions and chromosomes in GA's
<br/>
 - a study on communities and linking the information together in a more ideal fashion. For example there are plenty of links more relevant to this community, so a search within the domain of games programming would yield different results to a general search. Search engines do not take this into consideration although have mechanisms for this</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I disagree.  With a little bit of money there are a whole bunch of crazy life changing things you can do as long as you don't aspire to the norm.  In general, societies are happy "as is" because the people on top are happy on top; the norm aspires to keep people in their place.  Normal people don't travel through Africa.

If you own a house (that is paid for), one or two buildings for your business, vehicles, a few other miscellaneous assets, you are probably a millionaire.  This may amount to house and store; done.  (If you don't mind being leveraged, you'll have a bunch more.)

A billionaire has 1000 times that much.  There really is a huge difference.

Options are decisions, but in many cases less is more. Maybe another context can illustrate it; Gameboy Development. Quite simply you go out and give DevkitPro; on the other hand you give them a choice of 1000. Much better to have the one solid environment and direct them to the tonc tutorials.

I think you completely miss what I am getting at. You get windows, you get windows. The only choice is XP/Home! So if buying a computer do I get Mac or Windows. Add Linux to the list and it is Mac/Windows/Linux(Gentoos/Suse/Mandriva/Ubuntu/Kubuntu). But between that nothing is clear cut; no single answer, unless you use that wizard.
