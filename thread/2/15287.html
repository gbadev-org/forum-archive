<br/>
I'm not too bothered by mine (I rate it 4/10) but I just went to the doctors about my dodgy knees and I've been prescribed these tablets which may give me a dodgy stomach as a side effect! To counter this, he's given me some other tablets  (lansoprazole) to balance it out but I'm kinda worried about defooding...
<br/>
<br/>
For the interested, lansoprazole belongs to a group of medecines called proton pump inhibitors which reduce the amount of acid your stomach makes.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here goes! I'll report back if I refund.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i didn't drink ("the good stuff") for years and i'm really happy with it. had some really painful days after overdoing it just "slightly"... after that i got the urge to throw up whenever i just *thought* about alco-hole (it *is* a hole you can fall into and never come out again!)
<br/>
about the second med: i find that suspicious whenever one needs to take a med and the other meds that will cancel out the side effects but have their own side effects, that again are canceled out by other meds that...
<br/>
i know some people that need only one (if any at all...) pill, but then take a cozen others! that's crazy!
<br/>
i especially hate anything that distords or alters my perception (like meds for calming down etc.) i can't stand it!

We spent *so* many evenings in the boss's house (he lived upstairs) it was untrue! I even had a wine rack at home because I was given so much free stuff to taste! Hell, I even ran a wine-tasting event at a hotel once...now that was a funny evening :-)

don't waste yourself. a bit of wine does no harm to you, even if it's a bottle from time to time. ;^) but if you're not feeling comfortable and develop strange drinking habbits (i am speaking in general here, not to you simon) and you're dringing very often, go and see a doctor. well, as usual, the first step is the hardest: admitting to yourself you have a problem.
<br/>
<br/>

and about mixing multiple meds with the vitamins "a" "l" and "c" - not good. hope you have someone caring around you today. :^)

Haha, it's like you were there when I was in India! We went to a really expensive club where the likes of Bollywood actors go and cos we were 6 guys and a girl, we had to strike a deal with the owner that we'd spend ~?250 on drinks (usually they only accept couples). Cheapest thing was wine so after a couple bottles each along with the spirits I was vomiting, can't smell it anymore!
<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing is that I got a really good job offer from someone opening a branch of his really successful IT consultancy company in London, but I was so drunk the next morning I forgot where I put his card :S</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyway, funny story: when it came to graduating from uni you've often got a black-tie party to accompany the occasion, right? Well I bought my ticket and forgot about it for a couple of months. I was also learning to drive at the time and took the written test and booked my practical test.
<br/>
<br/>
When bumping into some friends a week before the ball we're all like "so are you going, who's going, ok - see you Thursday night!" etc etc and as I was walking away...I'm thinking "<span style="font-style: italic">this</span> Thursday night? That can't be right! My test is on Friday morning!" And it so was :-(
<br/>
<br/>
So yeah - we had the graduation ball on the Thursday night and I had my driving test at 9am the following morning! I figured that I could take the test as many times as my pride would allow but I could only graduate once so decided to prioritise the ball but get blotto pre-ball in the hope that no drink at the actual ball (which is gonna last like five hours, right?) would sober me up enough to be in a fit state for getting up at 7am next day! Surprisingly this plan actually worked, but all the posed pictures which are taken before the thing kicks off weren't very flattering!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm tempted to show some comical pictures ;-)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A friend of mine happens to be a Wine dealer and drives around to clients, opening the odd bottle of wine for them to sample.  From time to time he has a few sample bottles left over and invites me round to drink them.  I went round his on Saturday evening and from then on in it gets hazy.  I remember mixing cough mixture with red wine 'to make it taste better', I then remember paying to get into the wrong night club (all my friends had gone next door) and having to blag my way in to the right one.
<br/>
<br/>
The next thing I remember is picking myself off the floor whilst everybody around me is advising me quite strongly to go to the hospital.  Luckily the local A&amp;E was only about 5-10 minutes stumble away and along the way a group of girls took interest in this shambolic bleeding figure and decided to tag along with me.  
<br/>
<br/>
I had a nice long wait from 3:00am until 7:30am which is when I finally got a doctor who promptly stuck a load of stitches in my face.
<br/>
<br/>
I feel like an idiot for smashing up my face although I wasn't too bothered about the long waiting time.  I felt quite sheepish as I was the atypical 'Pissed up person damaging themselves on a weekend' and I had some interesting people for company.

Of course I went to wake him up by knocking on his window, scaring the shit out of him, and then I went home and woke up wondering how the hell I got there.

Talking about expensive drinks though, I went to Sound last night in Leicester Square for a mates bday, ?58 for 5 Godfathers! (1 shot Whiskey 1 shot Amoretto, so 5 doubles)...~?5 for a single! Good thing my bro was buying drinks last night and I forgot my wallet at home...

Lol yep, except I'm a tube man myself (with said drink!) Although you meet some funny/weird characters on the night bus home from central!

Nope, but I won't be going there now! Actually I probably will end up going there, my almost-new job is in Clapham Common. Joys of spending an hour on the Northern Line! :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah that wedding was in a pub on Clapham Common! The Windmill Hotel?
<br/>
What do you think of the night bus system in London? I really hate doing it as you've got to often take a two or three of them, you've got to get off in weird areas to hunt for the next one which may or may not show up. Plus you're probably half-cut at the time so that definately doesn't help! I used to live very near to Crystal Palace and luckily there's a depot there and it's end of the line so if you fall asleep you're not completely stuck! Good TV reception there.
<br/>
<br/>
At Christmas after a work do I just couldn't be arsed to bus it and the tube had shut. Took a taxi home for ?48! Luckily the company subsidised most of that ;-)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Haha, that's a taxi number to keep! Can't say I've heard of that hotel, tbh the interviews were the first ever time I've been to Clapham!
<br/>
<br/>
For me the night busses are great, one straight bus from central (Leicester Square/Oxford Street) to a stop 1 road away from my house (lucky for some eh!) Only problem is trying to stay awake and look sober so those damn weird people don't jack my wallet!
<br/>
<br/>
Can't be as bad as my friend's journey home one time though, he caught the last tube from mine to central, but missed the train from King's Cross towards Isleworth. He caught a bus to Shepherd's Bush only to find the bus from there stopped running, so he bussed it back to King's Cross. His phone battery was dead which meant he couldn't call me, so in the end he walked to uni labs, facebooked for 30 mins before knocking out!
<br/>
<br/>
Makes me miss uni though, my halls were in Waterloo for 2 years so the journey home just meant stumbling across the bridge, don't know how a bridge can be so interesting cos sometimes it took around 30 minutes :S</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
This whole saga has now come full circle as the two hangovers in this thread so far (#1 going to Devizes, #2 going to a wedding) have culminated in #3, the birthday party of the girl I took to #2, to wind up the girl from #1!
<br/>
<br/>
I spent today feeling ill, then soaked by immense rain whilst crossing Clapham Common, sleeping and finally watching You Got Served. A complete waste of a day!

(oh and flashbacks of pulling birthday girl...she was like "what are we doing - ten years of friendship down the drain!")
