    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would want to know what you think of the DS, if you own one and if you are going to buy one. I know this can be an endless discussion... but i want to collect some facts.
<br/>
<br/>
Pro:
<br/>
- A lot of functionality like wireless port, touch screen, voice...
<br/>
- Two Screens
<br/>
- Organizer/PDA functionality
<br/>
<br/>
Contra:
<br/>
- Weak hardware (CPU and GPU)
<br/>
- Two Screens (i think using the 2nd screen as touch screen to control the game can be somewhat unpractically)
<br/>
- System Dimensions
<br/>
<br/>
This is meant as some kind of review after the DS got released.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

Surely you can't own one yourself.  Once you own one and have spent time playing the games, you can see that the hardware isn't limiting it at all.  The games run smoothly and look great.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the CPU has something about 166mhz, the PSP CPU has 333mhz... The GP32 had a 133Mhz CPU and there were some GP32s that had a 166 Mhz CPU (i think at gbax.com or something...). The GP32 of course didn't have a GPU but if you just compare the CPUs the DS has almost the same hardware as the GP32 and the GP32 is a quite old device...
<br/>
<br/>
From the screenshots that i saw the games don't look good, well they are 3D but it looked like texture precision is not very high (blocky textures) this is also because of the storage of the games (PSPs UMD will be able to store up to 1.8 GB and it has 32 mb RAM so there will be enough room for high resolution textures).
<br/>
<br/>
Just compare these 2 screens and you will know what i mean:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, graphics wise the PSP smacks the DS over the forehead with barb-wire laced knuckle dusters. Maybe we will see a repeat of the N64, with Nintendo sticking to cartridges and Sony using CD's. The N64 suffered from having carts that couldn't store a great deal of data, which lead to some awful effects.
<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, ridge racer with a portable steering wheel sounds nice. Maybe car games might offer controls similar to what Bond had in "Tomorrow Never Dies". So the second screen might offer some good gameplay, although the public would probably just see the PSP's flash graphics and go for that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I still don't think the graphics matter as much when at such a small size. When I first saw metroid hunters moving I thought "no way" as I thought it looked as good as MP almost. It's only when you look closely at static shots you can recognise that the textures aren't bilinear filtered. When you're playing something that is constantly moving, on a screen probably not as clear as a PC screen, at arms length.. well you wouldn't find me complaining at least. I think nintendo have made a sensible decision in reigning in the graphical power a little to hopefully allow for innovation in other areas than graphics.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus, as is shown anything* that can be done on the PSP can be done on the PSP at lower graphical quality but you'll be hard pressed to convert anything made specifically for the DS to the PSP.
<br/>
<br/>
*I'll concede on something that requires huge amounts of data and streaming off the disc for example. But games that use constant streaming are going to be outlawed I think as it will eat your battery alive.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">CanIKickIt(YES_YOU_CAN);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1. A 166MHz dedicated games processor is not necessarily weak - it's just not as fast as a 333MHz one! 
<br/>
<br/>
2. My car is ten years old, but does 40mpg and will happily sit at 85-90mph all day, every day. It's older than my colleagues Audi TT. But for me, it's a better car - it has a bigger boot, four doors, better mileage, cheaper to insure etc.etc. Hardware is not necessarily better for being newer.... if the hardware is good for the job required of it, it's good!
<br/>
<br/>
3. How does the PSP compare to the DS on things like power, battery life, screen clarity? Is this a direct comparison between the DS and PSP?
<br/>
Shouldn't the statement 'weak hardware' read 'weaker hardware, when compared to the PSP'?

You can't rate a product without looking at its competitors or without considering the current technical development, if you would you can also say that a 6502 is everything you'd ever need because it can do everything that an x86 4ghz CPU can do (just not as fast)...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

But it does it smaller!

<br/>
6502 code is rather elegant and packs more "stuff" to the byte. :)

<br/>
Also, comparing the GP32 to the DS is a bit off, the DS has all the funky GBA style graphics hardware too (sprites, layers, etc etc without overhead).

Very true. I thought that the original question was what do people consider to be good/bad about the DS rather than how does it compare to other games machines.
<br/>
<br/>
(in the same way, you *could* take a poll on the +ve and -ves of a ZX Spectrum, even though by todays standards, it wouldn't score very highly when compared to its competitors.)
<br/>
<br/>
e.g. a few people have mentioned dead pixles on the LCD displays.
<br/>
If the PSP had 10 dead pixels on average, and the DS only two, would you say "pros- low dead pixel count" or "contra- screen has dead pixels"...
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a DS yet, but am watching this thread with interest. I'm not considering buying an alternative, but would like to know, on the whole, if it's worth getting one after Xmas. I'm not really interested in the alternatives at the moment, just do the PROs outweigh the CONs?
<br/>
<br/>
PRO - it fits in your (coat) pocket
<br/>
PRO - backwards compatibility, allowing you to code your own games
<br/>
PRO - thriving community for support and advice.

Ah ha ha ha ha!  Brilliant Sony engineering at work ;)  It's sad how far their quality in a lot of things has fallen since the times when their quality actually was top-class.  Have you heared about the broken analog-nubs and UMD-discs popping out?

Nah, Nintendo always makes it a big point to never release anything that has a low battery life.  The non-SP GBA's lack of a screen light and the Wavebird's lack of rumble support are good examples.  Once they're able to get something to last 8 hours or so on a couple of AA's (or whatever built-in rechargable might be used) then that's when they release.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Good lord!  Keep it away!  I was just up from 2:30 AM to 5:30 AM playing GBA because I couldn't sleep.  I didn't realize that 3 hours went by, but if the battery ran out half way through, that would just be silly!

Maybe Sony will make some changes until the european release of the PSP (i guess they will definately fix the issues with dead pixels/air bubbles in screen/PSP falling apart).

When I got my DS, the calibration was absolutely perfect.  But, I stupidly tried calibrating it and I've gotten it to about 95% perfect (I'm a perfectionist at times), so I guess (a) Yes.
<br/>
<br/>
I've played Feel the Magic, a mini-game game (like Wario Ware, but the games are longer) which uses the touch screen for most of the game.  At the end of the game, you need to rub the screen madly (to the point where your arm hurts) in order to win, and that's on normal mode.  I've made it through normal, hard, AND hell modes.  On hell mode, the boss at the end is freaking hard, I had to play him about a dozen times before I won, each time rubbing the screen madly until my arm hurts.  The only "wear and tear" on my touch screen is dust, which I could fix by blowing on it... or wiping it with my shirt (which is what I usually do).  And I've used my finger (gets grease on the screen) and my fingernail (needed precision, but couldn't bother with getting the stylus out for two seconds then putting it back).  And for one of the mini-games you unlock in Mario 64 DS (shell smash) you have to slide a shell to make it hit a bunch of other shells.  The faster you move the shell, the better score you can get due to momentum, so I stab the screen at high speeds to get maximum velocity.  My roommate cringes when I do this, but the screen is still mint condition.
<br/>
<br/>
The screen is old-school Nintendo quality (Remember the NES controller?  Those things were invincible!!), so (b) No and no.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But it's not until Hell mode that it's that difficult.  In Regular mode, it's not all that hard (did it on my 1st try), in Hard mode it's... well, hard... but still manageable.  It's only Hell mode that it really started to piss me off.  And since the only thing beating the harder modes give you is some extras to unlock (costumes), you can play on regular mode and get the complete story, so it's not bad.

Overall, Feel the Magic is a really fun game!  And I love the music for the very final stage... it sets the mood perfectly.  I get tingles thinking about it sometimes...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

'Cause really, the DS doesn't waste space... much.  The only really wasted space is right above the speakers.  Two options I think Nintendo should have considered more closely:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Two more speakers.  16 channels in hardware = 4 channels per speaker = cool surround effects.  If the ones on bottom aimed a little down and the ones on top aimed a little up, then the audio could be more immersive.
<br/>
<br/>
2) Indicator lights.

In these spots could be four bars on each side.
<br/>
<br/>
On the left in [-1-]: battery power (last bar turns from green to red when down to 15%)
<br/>
<br/>
On the right in [-2-]: could be wireless reception.
<br/>
<br/>
The lights at the bottom could then be used for power (Red = Charging, green means power on, flashing means in sleep) and wireless (blink-blink-pause would now mean snooping for other DS's, steady blinking means that other DS's have been found, and it blinks every time a packet is sent or received, ie network traffic indicator, and off means that the wireless feature is not in use ).

I've found that to be a problem with almost all D-Pads built after the 16-bit era :( .  The only ones that don't seem to do that are the ones by Sony.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nobody needs idea men.  They need hardware and software engineers, artists and the like.  One needs to be able to do something else to have input.

That depends..would you have ever let them release the product onto the market with a mandatory health warning screen displayed at startup every time without any internal option to disable it?
<br/>
<br/>
If you can't gauge the customer's annoyance reaction to blatantly stupid flaws in the product, it's probably not a good idea to work at a company Nintendo.  Which makes me wonder how that health warning ever got in there.......</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, Nintendo *has* engineers and artists etc.  But they obviously don't have people that want to buy the hardware and play the games 'cause there are so many things that so many companies do that can so obviously be changed for the better with almost no increase in price.  I don't claim to *know* how things work, but if they had someone play the DS and say "I don't like the buttons, they're too small!" don't you think they might have considered making them slightly bigger, especially since they re-designed the entire case to look sleeker?  Well, that's just me I guess...
<br/>

<br/>
No.  Here's what I probably would have done.
<br/>
<br/>
First time turning on the system, the user must read an agreement saying he or she has read the health warning and click on the "Ok, I want to play now... not that I actually read the warning" button... I mean, "Agree" button.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, on every boot, the exact same screens would show up, but when the DS is finished playing it's little opening chime, it'll just... go.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, a little off topic of the health warning, I'd add something to the startup screen.  If the DS detects a DS and a GBA game, it would display a message "Hold Y to play GBA game", unless the user has selected to always boot to the main menu.  Also, I'd add an option to choose to default to play GBA games on bootup if it's found, then the message would change to "Hold Y to play DS game".
<br/>
<br/>
But, that's just me...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
You want to know about the DS resistance?  I'll tell you a story, and I swear it's completely true:
<br/>
<br/>
Just now, as in not even five minutes ago, I turned to check where my DS was because I hadn't played it all day.  In the month that it's been out this is very unusual as not a day has yet gone by that I haven't spent several hours playing it.
<br/>
<br/>
I realized that I couldn't see it sitting in any of the usual spots like my desk or the table near the couch.  So I got up and started looking around the rooms, and still couldn't find it anywhere.  That's when I tried to remember when I played it last, and it hit me.
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when I'm working really, really late at night on the computer, I end up crashing on the couch not having the strength to drag myself to bed.  And last night that is exactly what happened.  Except that, evidently, I was playing my DS before I fell asleep.
<br/>
<br/>
So I search all around the couch, and that's when I saw it: wedged inside of the couch, open faced.  You have where the seat cusions meet the back of the couch; the bottom touch screen part of the DS was under the seat and the top part was between the side of the cusion and against the back of the couch.  And that's how it was all night while I slept on it and all day when I never knew.  At this moment I can't even remember playing it last night, yet that's exactly what happened.
<br/>
<br/>
So I just got done wiping it off with my eyeglass cleaning cloth since some dirt and loose hair had collected on it, being inside the couch, and it's still brand new.  No scratches, not single a trace.  It was even still on since the game I was playing had automatically entered sleep mode.  I pressed the start+select combination to wake it up, and there's my game from last night and the battery light is still green.
<br/>
<br/>
I hate to admit but I freaked out when I saw it under there, since I'm the type of person who hates for devices like my DS to show any sign of wear.  I don't plan to, but if I ever repeat this I want to be beaten severely so it never happens a third time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
