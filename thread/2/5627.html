    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok I have a couple of questions:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Where were the carts manufactured? Did you buy blank carts and use a special writer? If so, could you email me where you bought it?
<br/>
<br/>
2. Where did you get the labels?
<br/>
<br/>
3. The white box inside the game box that holds the cart. Where did you get that?
<br/>
<br/>
4. Where did you get your boxes made? And where did you get the "only for gameboy advance" logo?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to anyone who will take the time to answer.<br/>_________________<br/>~ian~</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry, I can't answer that myself but I've got a related question: Do you think it's a good idea to use the official GBA logo? What about copyright? Just wondering, if you are going to tip of Nintendo on this you should be careful to do everything right...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, it's not a good idea, but whoever made the Compo Cart box art used it. Did they get permission from Nintendo?
<br/>
Well, OK, I don't need the answer to that anymore, but can I know what writer and what company gbadev got the carts from? reply or PM if you don't want anyone else seeing.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If they don't want anyone to know (which would make sense, given the obvious source of such things) no offense, but they probably won't tell a guy with 2 posts. (or a guy with 200 for that matter). The first carts they got, at least, were with a standalone copier, obviously made to copy original games. The kind of thing a shop in hk would use, for instance.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the (c) boxart. Given that they've already sold out, it probably would've gone just fine to simply send them out like that. When they're gone, hey, they're gone. But it might not be the wisest thing to post it a month in advance, IMO. I suppose it's still much better than posting it before sales. False advertising and all...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
