<br/>
Hidden in a fluffy press release for Nintendo's new Revolution console device is this notice:
<br/>
<br/>
    Freedom of design: A dynamic development architecture equally accommodates both big-budget, high-profile game "masterpieces" as well as indie games conceived by individual developers equipped with only a big idea. 
<br/>
<br/>
Not much detail, but if Nintendo makes good on that promise, they're poised to kick the competition's ass: a world of consoles that only ran signed code was a nice racket while it lasted, but at the end of the day, needing to get permission to run software on your own device sucks and devices that let anyone write software for them get more valuable as more people write more code for them.

<br/>
<br/>
I thought another press release that talked about reduced production costs sounded promising but this one has got me stunned.  Could Nintendo really be opening up to amateur developers?  
<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the DS I'm doubtful but anything is possible..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
