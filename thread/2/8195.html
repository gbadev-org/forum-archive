    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How the DS and PSP compare in terms of specs and hardware features?  What can the DS do that the PSP can not and vice versa?  How do the sofware libraries (titles on store shelves) compare?  Which is easier to develop for?  Which has more units in circulation?  Which is selling more software?

I have a DS because it has more games that I am interested in (AW:DS, MK:DS, SM64DS, MP:H, etc) and I saw it as an upgade to my GBA (original).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I know.  I'm only mildly interested in opinions.  I'm mainly interested in any facts anyone has stumbled across.

Same here. + Sonic Rush, Trace Memory, etc
<br/>
<br/>
PSP has exactly 0 games I want (at the moment).
<br/>
<br/>
As I understand it, PSP has better specs in terms of GPU, processor, memory, but the DS has the obvious touch screen, longer battery life, less expensive, microphone and GBA games library.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
As for my DS , I only wish my 1gb MS Duo could work in my SuperCardSD instead...
<br/>
<br/>
Been hooked on Mario 64 DS , Mario Kart DS , Lost in Blue , Trauma Center , Animal Crossing Wild World , Super Princess Peach (Japan title) , and some others

<a class="postlink" href="http://forums.gamewinners.com/forums/showthread.php?t=466942" target="_blank">It's a USB device</a>, much like the PS2 headset. It's definitely not built-in like the one on the N-Gage or Nintendo DS.
<br/>
<br/>
As for software library, the GBA had the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/lu/" target="_blank">clone of the PSP's non-M-rated killer app</a> before Europe had the PSP itself.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
