Bumping old topics might as well be creating new ones, just that if its a long old topic that I've likely never seen, don't have to take the time to read the original information, or skip to the last page of a longer thread.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

Amen to that. Besides why create a new one to link to an old when you can just reply in the old one. It all depends on the context, if you've got 20 pages of chat then surely create a new thread and link to the old; if it is just 1-3 pages then post in the old one!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
