    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am tired of my 9600 Pro churning only 40 fps with occasional drops in the heat of action when running CS:Source. So, I'm considering a deal I found at CompUSA that runs tomorrow (and for a week thereafter).
<br/>
<br/>
ATI Radeon X800 XL 256MB AGP: $249.99
<br/>
ATI Radeon X800 XL 256MB PCI Express: $259.99
<br/>
Both retail from ATI.
<br/>
<br/>
I pricewatch'd these items and came up with $308/$299 for PCI-E and AGP cards respectively, from better dealers like NewEgg.com.
<br/>
<br/>
I had been planning on doing an upgrade in Q1 2006, for case, PSU, mobo, cpu cooler, ram, video card....sata drives, almost everything. I don't think it's a good idea to grap the AGP if I want a current-gen mobo (w/ PCI-E)... and I don't feel like upgrading the mobo/CPU just yet. I'll have the budget to do so 6 months from now. So at first it doesn't make sense to grab the AGP model, because I'll have a PCI-E mobo in 6 months, and I can't get the PCI-E without a mobo/CPU upgrade that I want to hold off on. Still, I would love to kick my 9600Pro to the curb.
<br/>
<br/>
Something crossed my mind, though: perhaps I should buy the X800 XL AGP and hand it down to my brother or best friend in the Spring? My bro has a decent HP desktop but no video card, so that might give him reason to game again.
<br/>
<br/>
What I'm really asking is, for $265 (after taxes), is there a better card I should be getting? Other considerations include noise (don't want it, would replace stock cooling if necessary though).
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
