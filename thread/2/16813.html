    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You might have heard a while ago about other projects I work on, some of them now have IRC channels. They are all on IRCNET (us.ircnet.org:7000) currently, and logs are at <a class="postlink" href="http://zzo38computer.cjb.net/irclog/" target="_blank">http://zzo38computer.cjb.net/irclog/</a> and you can submit links to backup/mirror logs at <a class="postlink" href="http://zzo38computer.cjb.net/chrono/zzo38/1249616045" target="_blank">http://zzo38computer.cjb.net/chrono/zzo38/1249616045</a> It is recomend for other people to create and host logs of these channels too.
<br/>
<br/>
The new game-console system I am working on is mostly it (I don't have much time because the other people who are working with me on it right here are too busy at the time being, hopefully in a few months both of us will have more time and equipment), so other people can also collaborate and ask question and stuff on the IRC channel. I also have informations about the things I am working on it, I will give it to people who ask on the IRC. The channel is +POWERXY (it's a plus-type channel, not a hash-type channel).
<br/>
<br/>
Some of my other projects also have IRC channels there (check my gopher site for more information).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
