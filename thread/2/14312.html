    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/FlashMe" target="_blank">I noticed this a few days ago</a>. I've tried to save the article, but I keep facing the "RELIABLE THIRD PARTY SOURCES" problem...
<br/>
According to the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Sandstein" target="_blank">Wikipedia admin</a> who deleted the article, </span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Homebrew websites are not reliable sources under these policies. If there are no reliable sources for a topic, we should not have an article on it at all.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
which is something I really don't understand...
<br/>
And it brings me to the question : what is Wikipedia ? A repository of "reliable sources" or an encyclopedia where anyone can bring their knowledge? So, according to this admin, homebrew sites aren't "reliable", until an important newspaper write something about it?
<br/>
<br/>
Just for fun : the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_homebrew" target="_blank">NDS homebrew</a> article is now "protected from editing"...
<br/>
Wikipedia nonsense....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ideally, according to my interpretation of Wikipedia policies, any claim in an article should cite a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" target="_blank">reliable source</a>. This pretty much includes mainstream news media, peer-reviewed scholarly journals, and other sources that have established a reputation for checking facts. Subjects that reliable sources have not covered, such as most homebrew projects, are deemed <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability" target="_blank">non-notable and therefore unsuitable for Wikipedia</a>. But if a magazine covers, say, LMP-ng, it would appear to qualify.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're trying to promote your own homebrew project on Wikipedia, that's not what Wikipedia is for. <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#SOAP" target="_blank">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a> for editors with a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest" target="_blank">conflict of interest</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

So, according to Wikipedia, if something isn't already covered in a magazine, it shouldn't have an article. Even if most of the time, when a mainstream media talks about homebrew, there are a lot of mistakes, wikipedia still believe it is "reliable source"....

I exist. Is there a Wikipedia article (not a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User%3ADamian_Yerrick" target="_blank">user page</a>) about me? Should there be?

<br/>
Obscure things like most individual DS homebrew applications are generally not suitable for inclusion in a general encyclopedia. But feel free to describe them on a wiki dedicated to comprehensive coverage of homebrew on handheld platforms or on Nintendo platforms.

If you can demonstrate that none of the magazines in question have succeeded in their fact-checking in articles about a given subject, then the magazines are not a reliable source for information about that subject.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've made comments on the discussion about it, but his actions are fully justified. It may appear like he is bashing the community, but the rules are clear. I have provided links to notable entities, such as distributors for sources mentioning "homebrew". I have also suggested that the article simply state what homebrew is, which is more likely to have sources.

I think that is pretty safe to say.  Most print magazines tend to have something wrong in their articles as they don't have dedicated people eating, sleeping, and breathing the article topic.  I believe it is a rare occasion to find a fully researched and thought out article in a print magazine.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
