    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have come into the possesion of a GBA bios file. (assume by legal means.) I want to open and run the bios file in VBA (or any other emu, if you know of one that can do this and link) so I can try to get a multi-boot game up and running with it. Does VBA have a "run bios" option?<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've done this, and it does a great job or running the intro sequence before starting the game. However, I don't want it to do that second part at all. I want <span style="font-style: italic">just</span> the bios. (thus, I would link and do single-pak games. I'm using vbalink at this point.) Is this possible?
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about maybe loading the bios as a ROM file, but it comes back at me and says that a .ROM file type is not supported. Grr...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the bios does many different things. you want to run the bios file, that's what its doing when you see the gameboy logo. if you want to use the link functions in the bios, you need to make your own gba rom, set up for a link, and the bios has a few functions you call. the bios isn't a game, it's a set of functions, like multiplication, dividing, and multiboot transfer shit.
<br/>
<br/>
look up bios calls for gba. the bios itself cannot do whatever you're trying to do, you must code something your self, and the bios has a few handy functions to help, especially with multiboot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, and I just had a thought. When you turn on the GBA with no cart, there is no pak to be run, correct? Meaning, no code, and most importantly no header? If this is so, could I not just run an empty ROM and let the logo stay on-screen?
<br/>
<br/>
I'll try this, but it may not be what I need. Yes, I am trying to emulate a single-pak transfer, thus requiring the bios (the intro "GAMEBOY" logo) to be "run".

<br/>
And yes there is a way to go back to the intro from within an ISR:

On each slave GBA, trigger the ISR, then hold Select+Start to make the "Nintendo?" go away.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Start+Select did it. It allows me to get into the single pak mode now. I can't use my testing game, mariokart, because the link function still apparently isn't that great, but at least the idea works. It should allow me to do some simple testing anyway.
