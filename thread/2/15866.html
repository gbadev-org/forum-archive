It's out in Japan already. I'll probably wait 'til it's released in NA to buy it even though it doesn't really need localization.
<br/>
<br/>
Funny story: supposedly a couple of developers or designers from different companies were out, drunk, when one of them thought the DS looked like an MS-10 and decided to make it.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I thought the same thing, but in the commercial world, homebrew does not count.  =P

Honestly though, I don't see NitroTracker and the others I've used as being complete enough to be considered, i.e. DS-10 managed to "arrive" first, even if it embarked much later. It might sound harsh, but I mean NitroTracker isn't at 1.0 yet and hasn't even implemented effects. (Hopefully 0xtob feels more complimented by the high standards I'm holding him to than insulted.) The others that I've used are minimal and they just seem like miscellany.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It helps if you are developing for a company that has access to DSP libraries like Korg has.  Most trackers (at least the ones I used) didn't have much in the way of 'effects' anyway.  The only ones I remember using were sample offset and pitch in FT2.
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully the wireless protocol for DS-10 will be cracked so the two can work with each other.  I can't see any reason why Korg would obfuscate it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, I totally agree, except I'd say that effects are extremely important to trackers. Without things like porta, offset, volume slides and retrig, there's a lot you're missing out on. Some people also have a strong need for the arp command.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
