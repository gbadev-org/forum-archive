...all on an Enermax 330W PSU that came with the case. Not sure whether that is a good or bad thing, but I never had to deal with power issues this whole time. Now, I've got everything to upgrade except for the PSU. My upgraded parts are...
<br/>
<br/>
Intel Quad-Core Q6600 2.4Ghz
<br/>
ECS 671T-M (for now, because it was a combo deal on Black Friday with the CPU)
<br/>
BFG 8800GT OC 512MB
<br/>
2GB PC6400 OCZ Memory

The HD and DVD drive/burner I'll continue to use, as they are within my means, and the sound card will most likely get ditched unless the on-board audio isn't as good. So, all I'm looking for is a PSU that isn't too expensive, but accommodates my needs. One that will handle what my system will have, plus the possibility of another HD, maybe overclock the CPU (it has G0 stepping) as well as going SLI. Hopefully something not to expensive, but not so cheap as it could destroy my stuff on the first power-up.
