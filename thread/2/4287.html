In fairness, those images are phpBB defaults and very small. Your browser should be caching them, so it's not requesting them from the site very often (if ever).

Most boards have things like smileys and avatars going on... there is something to be said for the plain and simple elegance that is gbadev.

<br/>
HOWEVER...  I agree wholeheartedly that this site does just fine without them.  I've gone to some other sites in search of more DS info, and I've run into some gaudy av's.  As for images, they've let people put huge pics as part of their sig, I'm talking 600x150 or something like that, bigger than most banner ads.  The site looks rediculous, and the conversation follows the lines of... (yes, this is from an actual forum!)

It goes on like that for another 2 or 3 sentances, which is roughly 1/4 screen.  AND... it had been edited.  Edited?  Ugh...

Please!  Keep this forum sane!  I have to applaud Simon and the moderators (I see tepples is a moderator now) for doing a good job of locking out forums that go nowhere ("I want to make illegal copies of games.  Any help?") and kicking out people like Pirro who want everyone else to do their work for them (wouldn't shut up about making that damn Harvest Moon game).

Yes.  I find it amusing to note that the people on this board from non-English-speaking countries have *far* better grammer than many Americans on other boards. :)</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Heheh, good point. People over here slowly keep replacing every word in the language with acronyms and initials...and misspellings in order to make their products and brands sound "trendier".  I feel like 10 years from now we'll all be speaking in letters. Arrgghh!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can have old grammer with new vocabulary:

<br/>
"Thoust startup code shall be placed near to thine Advanced Boyhood of Game ROM's header, thus to not hearsest one's self denoted as 'heathen'."

Not "trendier" but distinctive. Trademark law has very specific requirements on what constitutes a distinctive mark.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
