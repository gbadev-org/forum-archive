How about a trojan application that checks for known commercial rom headers and wipes the card if any are found?

And have your reputation tarnished like DarkFader's was when he released the r0mloader and taihen trojans. If you want to be a vigilante, you can get in less trouble if you just delete the roms from the card.
<br/>
<br/>
And depending on how you define "header", the header might not be enough because both a DS Download Play demo (probably fair use) and the corresponding full version rom (probably infringing) might have some of the same identifiers. Besides, how would you pack the entire set of 1482 scene releases into a file small enough to evade detection, and how would you recognize the various headers that flash card patching programs prepend?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Because we'd need to store a separate SHA-1 for each rom times each version of the patching software. Especially SLOT-2 cards use patchers that run on PCs instead of patchers that run directly on the DS when you start a "clean dump".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

As I understand it, it's not warez if it's not illegal. But this forum bans discussion of activities that are not clear infringements, namely acts of copying or adapting certain game media that might fall under the copyright exemption of 17 USC 117 and foreign counterparts.

Well, DSOrganize is meant for reading/writing text files and stuff so it is different but what I mean is not including trojan software and stuff like that. But if you have a software that is meant for deleting illegal files (instead of another function), then you can do it, but otherwise you shouldn't touch things that aren't part of the program. (Anyways, I don't have any commercial NDS/GBA files on the CF card, other than some official demos.)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
