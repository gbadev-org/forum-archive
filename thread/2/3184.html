    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been offered an interview by the VP of a GBA game development studio, but I have been instructed to turn down the interview if I cannot relocate to the area.  However, I've never been employed before, let alone relocated.  How does relocation work?
<br/>
<br/>
How much would it cost to relocate a person from Indiana to Washington? How would one finance this cost?
<br/>
<br/>
How will a GBA programmer's typical pay compare to the cost of living?
<br/>
<br/>
How can one learn how to survive on one's own without the support of family?
<br/>
<br/>
Without a job, how can one learn to drive?
<br/>
<br/>
Are employers willing to wait a year while I gain experience in a work environment in order to become comfortable enough to live on my own without family support?
<br/>
<br/>
Some claim that opportunity knocks but once. If I cannot solve this problem, then I fear that I will never again be offered a job in the video game industry, and the sixteen years I have spent in school and the tens of thousands of dollars I have spent on tuition will have been wasted.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
I doubt they're willing to wait a year, the game industry is fast paced and they probably need someone now for a particular project.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll need some money to start of, but you don't need everything at once, you can go gradually. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you are selected for the position you can :
<br/>
1- Find a fully furnished place that you can rent on a monthly basis. (There are websites for finding rommate too, might be an interesting avenue.)
<br/>
2- Make sure you can carpool or use public transportation from that place.
<br/>
3- Start taking driving classes. 
<br/>
4- Put some money aside 
<br/>
5- Look into a loan for furniture and shop for furnitures.
<br/>
6- Look for a used car if you NEED a car (those are real money drain). The best cars to buy are 1-2 years old, since they're still in good shape and under they brand warranty. New car are not really worth the price, they drop value by 20% just after getting out of the car dealership.  With gaz price, be careful to go for fuel efficient too.
<br/>
7- Once you know the region more, find a nice new appartement in a neighborhood that you know you will like, take you time since you already have a temporaly place, and this one will be more permanent.
<br/>
8- Now that you have your new place, buy the furniture you shopped for.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll learn the rest by experience. 
<br/>
<br/>
A game programmer should have a decent salary, even if just starting. I'm trying myself topurdue a career in it, but have yet to land a job. I think in Canada, I can hope to start at around 40,000-45,000$can while the average salary is about 30,000$. A good cost of living indication is that a rent should be about 1/4th of your salary. 
<br/>
<br/>
With your level of qualifications, I think that even if you were to pass that offer, you'll be able to find something else. But will probably require to move to a gaming hub region.<br/>_________________<br/>-Inside every large program is a small program struggling to get out. (Hoare's Law of Large Programs)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It would be expected for the company to provide you with some kind of relocation assistance. This would typically consist of a reasonable allowance for moving expenses, and perhaps an advance on salary if needed for renting purposes.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with it, tepples. You've earned this.

Dan (just got offered a job in NYC... it's not doing games programming unfortunately - mostly Internet and database stuff in C++ - but with any luck it'll be a shot in my career's arm).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I'm currently a programmer, but still pursuing a career in gaming. It's hard to land a job in it without major projects to back oneself up.
<br/>
<br/>
poslundc : I'd say you are amongts the top too, your RPG Engine/Mode7 is truly impressive.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, asking the company for relocation support is certainely a good idea, but if it's a small one, their means will be limited.<br/>_________________<br/>-Inside every large program is a small program struggling to get out. (Hoare's Law of Large Programs)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can't provide all the answers as I'm not a US citizen and therefore not aware of the way things go over there. But I have moved from the Netherlands (living with my folks) to the UK, so I think I can say something...
<br/>
<br/>
If the company wants you, they should help out with your relocation. If they only offer minimal support then I'd say don't go there.
<br/>
<br/>
It'll be tough living without your family's support the first months, but if you want this job (badly) then you'll make it. Takes a while to find new friends inside and/or outside the company.
<br/>
<br/>
As it will be your first job, the employer should realise this and help you getting up to speed in the production process.
<br/>
<br/>
Last thing; I doubt that someone like you will only get one chance of getting into the industry!
<br/>
<br/>
If you like the challenge; go for it!
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>_________________<br/>If everything fails, read the manual: If even that fails, post on forum!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure I can offer any practical help as I'm not from the US either.
<br/>
But just consider the options, what have you got to lose to try the job?
<br/>
I don't know everything that can go bad because you have to relocate, but if you have more to win then to lose if you take the job, I say go for it.
<br/>
I don't know how binding the contracts are, but if it doesn't work out you can probably move back again right?
<br/>
I worked 1 year in spain and then got tired of it, moved back to sweden and had gained a lot of experience =)
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
