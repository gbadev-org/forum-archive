    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's only Thursday and I've had a pretty crap week. Anyone else had a poor-performing week?
<br/>
Here's mine
<br/>
- Weekend, went away for the weekend and it went so quickly that it felt like I didn't actually have two days off work!
<br/>
- Monday, not enough sleep - too much Quake the previous night :-)
<br/>
- Tuesday, spent all day feeling awful, as if I had been dumped after a great time out with a fantastic girl the previous night went sour; a completely unproductive day at work
<br/>
- Wednesday, still feeling a bit peeved about Monday night, generally bored at work
<br/>
- Today,
<br/>
  a) more job-related pressure has been piled on due to a pending game show,
<br/>
  b) I've fucked up my version control setup big-time and spend ages pissing around with that, in the end resorting to email to send a single file to someone
<br/>
  c) I smacked my knee into the door/wall this morning before leaving for work
<br/>
  d) I realise later on in the day that there is a weird movement within my left knee
<br/>
  e) slightly-pregnant woman on the tube giving me the harsh eye for having a seat whilst she didn't, despite my knee hurting so much that I can't stand
<br/>
  f) get home, food I left defrosting has actually cooked itself - score
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, it doesn't sound too bad but the thing from Monday night has just left me feeling a bit down!
<br/>
On the flip side, I've been playing Heavenly Sword at lunch times this week, and I am VERY impressed with it! The animation is stunning (in places).
<br/>
<br/>
So, anyone had a good week? Need...general...cheering...up...
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: ooh, g) spend ten mins rebuilding all my code, only to find that I rebuild the code from wrong depot! Grr...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dear gawd, I have such a week too :/
<br/>
<br/>
It's one of those weeks where I just can't be bothered with people coming to my desk at work (especially game designers). I just want to get some work done and don't deal with people.
<br/>
<br/>
For the first time at home at my hobby project, I found myself browsing the web, because building the libs and executables took too long. That continuously happens at work and I hate that, since you're just blocked from doing anything until that's done.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have gone swimming this week. It had been a few weeks since the last time, so now my muscles hurt in such a way that it feels like I've been kicked in the nuts.
<br/>
<br/>
There's more to say, but I don't want to put it all on the internet. I just want to say that you're not alone ;)<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://www.lifeisdigital.net" target="_blank">project website</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://www.kenvanhoeylandt.net" target="_blank">personal website</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wrist pains, eh? Describe!
<br/>
The reason I ask (not to take the piss) is because I've had computer-related wrist pains for many years now - if the problem persists, get it checked ASAP!
<br/>
<br/>
One of the only advantages of having knackered hands is that if someone uses my computer at work, they just can't hack it - I've got a weido keyb and use a graphics tablet (left-handed). My boss has a go for a moment and is like "nah, YOU do it!"
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I used to have this really hot physiotherapist :-)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
And all I have to do is go to the doctors and say my wrist hurts &gt;_&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
Well it's quite like a burning sensation on the top joints of my wrists. Sometimes throughout the year I get a pain on my tendons. With my joint it will eventually swell where it is visible when bending my wrist.
<br/>
<br/>
I ought to get it checked out though!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
