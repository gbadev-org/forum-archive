I've just signed up, I've been hanging around for a while, but am pretty active at <a href="http://www.dslinux.org" target="_blank">www.dslinux.org</a> (Yes, I am the Lattyware that made the homepage). I am a SysOp on the wiki there too, so I'll take this chance to remind you to contribute!
<br/>
<br/>
My site is <a href="http://www.lattyware.co.uk" target="_blank">www.lattyware.co.uk</a> and it contains my blog and projects etc...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Enough advertising. I don't have a GBA, but I do have a DS and am big on modding it and homebrew. I don't know C++ (well enough, yet) but I am good at web development and BASIC languages, especially Blitz Basic.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, That's me.
