    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have you tried recalibrating your DS's touch screen in the firmware settings menu (boot without a Game Card, then click the "drawer" looking icon on the bottom)? In addition, some of the older homebrew touch code wasn't that good; have you tried newer homebrew?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The problem is with early homebrew code, Some stuff coded in previous versions of PALib dont work well with the R4. You could ask the coders to recompile their code with a later build.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
