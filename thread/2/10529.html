    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sorry if this is in the wrong place, but is there a program or could someone make a program or would it be possible to use you nds as a wireless gamecube controller using the wavebird wireless adapter? like, the touch screen would be the D-pad, c stick, and the place where u change the chanel. and then the top screen would just say, Gamecube controller. but is it possible or not?

I think you'll find it does use wifi.
<br/>
Otherwise, how could you play without wires?<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's called Microwave frequncies. Not all wireless items are wifi. Microwave frequncies are used it cellphones for receiveing a wireless signal. But since the wavebird adapter is using chanells, the cellphone wouldn't receive any signal. Anyways, DS uses LAN settings for wireless. So you would one, have to write you own downloadable software that uses microwave frequncies for the ds, then be able to change the channels on the ds to fit the wavebird's wireless beacons.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
