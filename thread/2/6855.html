    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To put it in rough PSP equivalent terms:
<br/>
<br/>
Most Nintendo DS systems ship with the equivalent of 1.50 firmware; you just need a PassMe and either a GBA Movie Player or a GBA flash card. The "iQue DS" (China only) and the red Jump Super Stars DS (Japan only) ship with the equivalent of 1.52 firmware: it's been cracked, but just barely, and not publicly nor in an idiot-proof manner, and the likely form in which the crack will be distributed is through a downgrader to 1.50 (i.e. FlashMe).
<br/>
<br/>
Biggest difference is that unlike PSP games, Nintendo DS games can't force a firmware upgrade on you before they'll run.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The new unreleased version of PassMe does work with the new firmware, but it requires a GBA cart with SRAM (<span style="font-style: italic">not</span> a GBA Movie Player), so it's likely to be used primarily with FlashMe.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
