I have a gamecube lying around which may or may not work (no cables) and I wondered if I should do something with it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought the kit with the intention of doing this but have actually done FA with it so I'd be interested in what you do if you buy the stuff! It's not like it's expensive and it's pretty easy to get code going so that's not an excuse!
<br/>
<br/>
What put me off was
<br/>
a) the hardware is complicated, and I'd forgotten how long it took to learn the DS hardware - I can't be arsed to go through that again!
<br/>
b) the GC equivalent of <a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm" target="_blank">that awesome gbatek doc which details the kit in mega detail</a> is pretty poor in comparison
<br/>
c) there's hardly any scene so there's not a lot of scope for help or general use of what you make
<br/>
<br/>
However, the Wii is starting to take off and the innards seem pretty similar...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
