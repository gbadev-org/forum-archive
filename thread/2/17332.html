    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know that NES had 4-color sprites (with 1 being transparent). How then did the original Final Fantasy have so many sprites with 4 colors + transparent? (Example sprite sheet -- <a href="http://pages.cthome.net/mnoni/webpage/finalfantasy.gif" target="_blank">http://pages.cthome.net/mnoni/webpage/finalfantasy.gif</a> -- especially look at the large ones near the bottom.)
<br/>
<br/>
I understand that you can layer sprites to achieve additional colors (For example: Megaman's layering gives him 6 colors: body=3+trans, face=3+trans). It's odd that these FF ones are all exactly 4 colors + transparent. If FF used similar layering, why would they stop at 4+1 instead of taking advantage of 6+1? (I see that they do use 6 if you include weapons, but the weapon appears to be its own layer anyway, so no reason to reserve the extra 2 colors for them.)
<br/>
<br/>
Is there another method of displaying sprites that gives you an additional color?
<br/>
<br/>
Also interesting is the fact that the big sprites are 18x26. Sprites are 8x8 (and I think I read somewhere that they're sometimes 8x16) but both 18 and 26 are [factor of 8] + 2. Very strange.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh, I've been thinking about this all day yesterday and all evening.  Unfortunately, the PPU viewer in Fceultra keeps crashing my computer (!?), so I haven't been able to easily dig into it and figure out what's going on.
<br/>
<br/>
A few things of note, though -- the large character sprites (the ones in battle), seem to actually only have 4 colors -- the black is the transparent color.  You can tell this at the beginning when you select characters -- at that point they are on a blue background, and there's blue instead of black in the character sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as the "overworld" sprites, I have no idea.  Maybe they did 2 layered sprites but only 4 colors in an effort to make them use the exact same colors that the large battle sprites have?  (3 colors + black?)  Since they would only be showing 1 at a time anyway, it's not like they had a whole lot else that they needed to do with the other sprites...?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm not much help, but just wanted to chime in since you got my really curious.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The overworld sprites appear to be divided into a top half and a bottom half, as opposed to having 2 overlapping sprites.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good point.  The overworld sprites that DO have 4 colors all have their "4th color" near the top, above where the "3rd color" stops.  
<br/>
<br/>
So the final verdict:  it only looks like they have 4 color sprites -- the big sprites only use 3 colors + transparent black, the small sprites are multiple sprites that use 3 colors each?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I found the answer. It's mostly been stated already but I have the pics for evidence.

I finally broke down and downloaded the ROM and extracted the bitmaps with NAPIT. (btw: staring at extracted ROM bitmaps is really bloody hard on your eyes!) I matched a few bitmaps and end-results here:

Each character has a color that is mostly relegated to top part of the sprite so I chased that idea a while. It turns out that's a red herring. The real answer is that black and transparent use the same color mask. Therefore, black must be on a separate layer. I wonder if they do that so they can flash the outline white when the character is hit. It's been a LONG time since I played FF but I remember this effect being used in Dragon Warrior.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
