About the two screens. The main screen surely is a lot nicer to look at having no hud/overlay at all. All the game info is displayed on the bottom screen. But, is this good or not?

<br/>
- two 3-inch screens
<br/>
- one of the screens is touch-sensitive, allowing a stylus to be used to control certain games
<br/>
- built-in Bluetooth connectivity for wireless gaming
<br/>
- specs slightly more powerful than the Nintendo 64
<br/>
- ability to play Gameboy Advance cartridges and Nintendo DS "game cards"
<br/>
- price point somewhere around $150. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm definitely getting one. I was hyped before, and now I'm even more hyped. Good thing I didn't by an SP when I had the chance. It makes me wonder, since it will play GBA carts, and rumored specs from before show that it contains a ARM7TDMI CPU like the GBA with probably some hardware similarities, but only faster (still rumor here), would they have set it up so that GBA games would still play normally, but in a sense give games extra processing time, such as <span style="text-decoration: underline">more sprite rendering cycles per scanline</span>? Sorry, but I'm having that problem in my own project, and I couln't resist thinking about it.
<br/>
<br/>
It looks like a nice layout, especially for those people who have big hands having to try to wrap them around the SP. More hand room! Hey, since it takes both GBA carts and DS cards, I wonder if a person would be able to play a GBA game on the lower screen while watching a movie on the top screen?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

One of the pictures on the main page shows the DS game card. There are 17 visible contacts on it. Are there more contacts on the other side?

If there are only 17 contacts, then that is pretty much proof that the cards are block adressed. ie. code is not executed from the cards but from internal RAM. This would make sense.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Another interesting tidbit I found on the Nintendo.com page for the DS is that developers will be able to use the GBA cart port as an accessory port for DS games.  I wonder if the DS is really just an expansion of the GBA hardware, ala GBC?  Would be nice if the extra hardware is also available to games distributed on GBA carts (for example, a GBA game could detect if it was on the DS, and if so, use the bottom screen for something).<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">btw.. did nintendo get into any specifics on the DS specs? like screen resolution, CPU speed, RAM?
<br/>
<br/>
just trying to get an idea on what to expect from this machine :)
<br/>
<br/>
is the 3D hardware accelerated or is it software using the second CPU?  I would think it would be hardware, but you never know with Nintendo :)
<br/>
<br/>
BTW... I was thinking about the issue of GB/GBC backwards compatibility, and if they go a similar route with the DS as they did with the GBA, they'll end up using the same chip that the GBA used for the GBA functionality (like how the GBA has the same chip that was in the GBC for GBC functionality).  Since Nintendo used the GBC chip to provide 4 of the sound channels in the GBA, that means that either Nintendo will have to put that chip in, or move that functionality to either the existing GBA chip or a new chip in the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm wondering what the likelyhood that Nintendo will redesign the existing GBA chip -- it just seems safer from an compatibility standpoint to just include the entire GBA/GBC chipset.  And if you do that, you might as well offer GB/GBC compatibility.
<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on that?
<br/>
<br/>
BTW -- I'm would be willing to bet that the ARM7 and ARM9 cpus will both be available at the same time -- at least in DS mode.  In fact, I'm willing to bet that programming the DS will be very similar to the GBA -- at least for one of the screens.  From what I've seen from Nintendo over the past few years, I think that they really want to avoid throwing out what works and instead just build on it.  So, just like N64 games can be easily ported to the GCN, I'll bet that moving from GBA development to the DS will be easy as well.<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It doesn't appear to be programmed in 3D to look 2D. I don't know if you have watched the press conference but Nintendo said that developers could choose either 2D or 3D with either screen. Which means you could have 2 2D screens, 2 3D screens, or a combination of them. I don't think it's the end for 2d, just keep in mind you can play GBA games on it as well so they can always make 2D games just like the GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

From what I can tell it has better 3D graphics than the N64 however I don't believe as advanced as Sony's PSP which pushes a lot more hardware power. However I believe the DS has enough 3d power to do most things developers would want. If you want anything more advance then just develop it for the Gamecube. The PSP seems like a portable PS2 to me and nothing new, however the DS seems new because of it's features. It's like Nintendo said, it's not the hardware it's the games.

Okay, good we have the tile modes left. The screen size should be a little bit bigger though. Why not 320x240? I love that resolution. Oh now I know why. 256 is the standard bg size, and they want it to look good with GBA games.

Yeah, but if games in 256-pixel-wide display go into 2D tile mode, they'll have to either 1. use 64x32 tile P.I.T.A. maps (like most Super NES games and those NES games that use V-mirror) or 2. use windows to chop 4 pixels off the left and right sides of the screen (like <span style="font-style: italic">Kirby Super Star</span> for Super NES and those NES games that use H-mirror). Otherwise, you'll get a tile split across the left and right sides of the screen.

It's from Sony, and Sony has a reputation for producing proprietary hardware. Remember that Betamax flopped because at the beginning of the VCR era, Sony refused to license Betamax technology to other companies.

I don't think the PSP will become the next Walkman. The Walkman played existing stereo Compact Cassette media; the PSP plays a new media type.
