    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I need help on deciding suitable selling prices for a dozen or so PCs, which I will be getting soon. All of the PCs are second-hand and were donated to my fathers company and he in turn gave them to me.
<br/>
<br/>
Vague PC Specs (Each PC is about 3yrs old):
<br/>
???GB Hard Drive
<br/>
Nearly a GB of RAM
<br/>
IR monitor and keyboard ports
<br/>
DVD/CD Drive
<br/>
Pentium III processor at 500MHz 
<br/>
<br/>
I think I should sell them at around 85 pounds each. What do you guys think?
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, if anyone on the GBADEV forum is interested in having one, I'm sure I could hook you up with one for next to nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>_________________<br/>my dev/business site:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think that's about right. I did see some in <span style="font-weight: bold">cash converters</span> (500Mhz, etc) for ?50, but then again yours aren't illegitimate</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Theoretically, an auction will perfectly determine what people are willing to pay for a given item. You might want to try <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/" target="_blank">this auction venue</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
But with that much RAM, you could probably auction half the RAM separately and make more money.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the help. I especially think using eBay is a good idea, since I had orignally planned to sell the PCs on my site where they would get much less publicity.

I would sell one of them on eBay to see how much they would go for, then set a specific price on <a href="http://www.half.com." target="_blank">www.half.com.</a>

Like tepples said, sell the RAM seperately. 1GB of RAM costs about $140(77 pounds) these days...<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
