    <h4>#1565 - loopy - Mon Jan 20, 2003 7:52 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In order to learn the ins and outs of GBA programming I decided to remake an existing game.  I chose this route especially because I'm no artist/musician and I didn't have any ideas.
<br/>
<br/>
The game I chose was the original NES Metroid.  It's only been a couple of days and I already have most of the scrolling engine, all of Samus' animations, collision detection, etc.  So far the graphics and collision are pixel-perfect.  You can't tell it's not on an NES emulator.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem now is, even though I'll be done with this in the not-too distant future, what good will it be to me?  I can't distribute or sell it to anyone legally.  I didn't expect this to turn out as well as it has so far.  It would be nice even if I could just use it to show gaming companies my stuff.  I need work.
<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts or ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Only things you can do is release it for free download and hope you have no legal hassles and use it for showing software companies, they like to see people can write GAMES not DEMOS so it should serve you well if it's fully playable, I've known a lot of coders who are great at producing spectacular effects, you ask them to write a game and they get totally stuck because they don't understand the whole logic of game writing and thats exactly what software companies DON'T want ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I'm definitely going to try finishing it either way.  If nothing else it will be really cool to say I did it and be able to prove it.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think I'll probably want to make this available anywhere until I think it over and do a little research first, though.  As a programmer I respect Nintendo's copyrights, and I've been keeping this totally to myself for now.  I'm kind of hoping there's a microscopic miniscule chance they'll give me permission to use it as part of my portfolio, but that's probably wishful thinking.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I also am currently developing a game using Metroid's graphics.  It has an original storyline just not original graphics and stuff.  It's looking really good so far though, at least I think it is.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I've done a similar thing - repoduced an older game, mainly because the assets already exist and it's ideal for learning the in's and out's of the system without getting too distracted by trying to invent gameplay.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also using it as part of a potential portfolio, but rather than offer it for download I'll simply be using it during interviews - the GBA is an ideal thing to take along.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
BTW, would someone like to check me on hardware.  Put e-mail here if you would.  It works in all the major emulators.

<br/>
Done so far - room implementation, structures, horizontal scrolling, most of samus is done.

Known issues -

1  Jumping when under something doesn't respond exactly like original.

Is it multibootable?  If not, that's OK; I have both MBV2 and flash.  So please send a copy to tepples?spamcop?net and put "GBA" in the subject.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, there's a few things that give away that it's not the original, one being that since the screen dimensions are less than a NES I had to put the status bar closer to the upper left-hand corner of the screen.  Anyway, it's really close.

<br/>
tepples, it's not multibootable.  In fact I just have the .bin output from gcc (devkit advance).  Is there anything else I need to do to it like add a header or something before it can go onto flash?

Design decision, or innocent omission?  With devkit advance, you need to do only three things to make a program work on multiboot: 1. make a global variable <span style="font-weight: bold">int __gba_multiboot;</span> 2. keep your program under 192 KB (this gives you 64 KB of EWRAM to hold decompressed assets), and 3. make sure you don't overwrite your program in EWRAM.

<br/>
I can add the header.  Or you can use "gbafix" to add the header.  Some flash writing programs will add the header for you.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Ah, yes.  I've been confused with that Loopy before, and I quite appreciate his work.  I did however write a GB emulator called LoopyBoy.  Pretty lame though cuz it only runs Dr. Mario, Tetris, and demos.  Still, it was fun to do.  I wonder how he got his name?  Mine was given me because I always used to say things were loopy.

<br/>
Innocent omission I would say.  This is my first ever experience with the GBA and frankly I've only learned as much as I explicitly needed in order to accomplish this so far.  Thanks for the info, though.  Eventually I expect it to be too large.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's been sent out and I'm curious about whether you guys even get it to run.  I didn't add the header cuz I just wanted to get it out.  I realized that if I'm serious about this I need some serious design changes, so we'll see what happens.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As long as it was well designed.

I had the same thought you did, but then I picked up a couple original metroid rom hacks that redid all the levels.  One of them was decent, the other was beyond painful.  Just because you CAN remake the levels doesn't mean you should.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
