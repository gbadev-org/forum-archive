<br/>
<br/>
Since the end of the last compo, I've been awaiting for the Flash Card that I was supposed to win. But in fact, there is still nothing in my mail box and nore a sign of anybody...
<br/>
Is it the case for every one who has won a cartridge?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Everyone should have received their prizes except for those that
<br/>
GameFreax were supposed to send out. I have mailed them several
<br/>
times and was told on the 21st of this month that they had been sent
<br/>
out the same week.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and they said they had sent F2A units instead of XG-Flash too...
<br/>
<br/>
Ill post here if I hear any news...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
