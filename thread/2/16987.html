I can't stop myself from getting on a high horse when confronted with situations like in the above links.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone suggest some tips or ways of responding that doesn't make me sound like a total git?

First, place a high value on your time.  Instantly, many things will cease to be worth your time.  90% of the problem is solved.
<br/>
<br/>
But failing that, determine whether you're obliged to be professional under the circumstances.  If so... well, be professional.  It works.
<br/>
<br/>
And if not, then you get to the fun part, which is How do I embarrass this person without being trite or lowering myself to name calling?
<br/>
<br/>
Terse and snarky works for me, but everyone is different.  Humor is always a plus.  Never, ever rant.  If you rant, they win.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, close your eyes and count to 10 before posting something snarky.  Then read it again, and ask yourself whether you want to be that person.  (My answer is sometimes "Yes, definitely!  harhar")</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When I first started on DSLinux, I often wondered why a lot of the more experienced dev's didn't respond to questions in the forums.  I understand why now, you end up getting sucked into juvenile games and semantics.

I actually have a lot more respect for tepples now after seeing some of the posts I've written over there and can empathise with a lot of coders who have to deal with their 'customers'.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, as I said, for some strange reason I just can't stop myself from posting, even though I haven't so much as booted DSLinux in over 3 months now.  
<br/>
<br/>
In a way it worked out pretty good for me, I learned a lot not only about Linux and the DS, but also about how you deal with a project like that, how to priotise what needs to be done etc etc.  
<br/>
<br/>
It was great fun actually using and understanding the DS technical documents like gbatek rather than just doing port after port after port.  It was a great feeling the first time I 'tickled' a register and had the screen brightness change.
<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't just the users that made me leave, there was the fact that pretty much everything interesting had been done already.  Put on top of that the inherent bloat of the Linux kernel it was clear to me that the idea of running a reasonable GUI under DSLinux was never going to happen.  Still, I did some cool stuff.  
<br/>
<br/>
My personal favourite was running perl based forum software on the DS (close second was <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dslinux.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/UsingDSLinux#head-37006ed1ea1b6576a700cd2aa9814959b0d83ae7" target="_blank">wireless MP3 streaming</a>, which worked better than I could of imagined).  Completely pointless, but I thought it was cool.  But that's why people code as a hobby, isn't it?  To make something happen that they think is cool.
<br/>
<br/>
I've since moved on to a much more fun project, which is replacement software for Pinball machines.  It's mainly the work of one very clever guy, thankfully he's done pretty much all the hard work so I can use my tiny amount of C knowledge to code rulesets/animations etc.  
<br/>
<br/>
I got bitten by the pinball bug about 3-4 years ago and ended up spending far too much money on a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=2684" target="_blank">Twilight Zone</a>.  It's given me that old feeling back again, that strange excitement when you try your code on hardware for the first time.  It's much more fun to burn an EPROM than it is to just copy something onto an SD card. 
<br/>
<br/>
There's something to be said about working with limited hardware, the DS is a supercomputer compared to what I'm working with now.  I get a 2MHz Motorola 6809, 512KB rom that's paged into 16KB of RAM, now that's what I call an embedded system :-)

<br/>
Clearly the OP did not realize that, and wasted your time.
<br/>
And then you decided to waste even more of your time by typing at someone who has not grown up enough to read simple documentation.
<br/>
If you don't want to sound like "a total git", just don't act like one.
<br/>
If you don't care how you come across, act however you please.
<br/>
<br/>
The time value advice is good.
<br/>
If it is worth your time to play 'forum police' than go ahead.
<br/>
I think, however, that the best way of responding to something like that is not to respond at all.
<br/>
Let other people make fools of themselves and get tea or hot chocolate or whatever you do.
<br/>
<br/>
At times you can also just refer someone to documentation... it's like responding, but not dignifying the question.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While I'm aware this isn't the answer you're looking for, I think an element like yourself probably benefits most boards, as it generates an atmosphere of a community not particularly interested in tolerating morons. That alone may not seem like such a positive, but it encourages people to read and learn before they ask stupid questions, for fear of being rebuffed. Ultimately this benefits everyone, because it means less crap posts and more knowledgeable users, the only costs being bruised feelings among those making the crap posts, and frustration on the end of the authority for having to deal with them, although they'd be dealing with more of them if they were to suffer fools politely. Ultimately I think the ideal is spreading out the disdain over several people; GBAdev is filled with people who know what they're doing and don't tolerate lazy users well, such that it's never one person dealing with all of the crap, which keeps things at an acceptable level for all involved. On the DSLinux board, there's not enough people treating idiots like idiots, so it all falls to you to handle, which is what's leaving you frustrated.<br/>_________________<br/>I've got nothing to say, but it's OK.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But now I don't know which SLOT-2 devices actually work with DSLinux. So i'd like to hear which SLOT-2 cards are the best ones to use.

plz don't point me to the wiki, I know there's a list, but I want to hear from someone if it works on his/her ds. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
He is not lazy, he is asking for a human opinion as clearly he has no confidence that he will have adequate information from the list.
<br/>
<br/>
Some times you *should* look at the documentation first, but there are many instances where doing so leaves you back where you started; not knowing what decision to take as you cannot compare them without purchasing them.
<br/>
<br/>
It appears to be a classic case of conscious incompetence; he is aware that he is not (or may not be) aware of something he knows.
<br/>
<br/>
We can all be guilty of being overzealous of our own perspective, expecting others to accept it (since it is reasonable). Accepting that ways over than your own can work equally as well helps resolve these issues (in yourself), so just because you would not ask does not mean others should not. I tend to be overzealous over <span style="font-style: italic">logical</span> reasoning; I hate poor logic being applied to reach premature conclusions. I'm sure you can see that in a lot of my posts on topics, such as the effects of piracy.
<br/>
<br/>
In fact consider this:
<br/>
 - a google or forum search query takes as much (in fact less) effort than writing a thread in a forum, so clearly they are not lazy
<br/>
 - reading a post on a forum takes as much effort as reading a page in a wiki, so clearly they (again) are not lazy
<br/>
<br/>
What is difference is what you expect; sure I can look at the feature set of visual studio and XCode, but in case there is something I am overlooking I also search for people's opinions in forums. Sure I don't ask, but it's the same as asking (IMO), just a little more time consuming and inefficient.

Hmm; it's all about perspective. They can "use their brain" all they want, but what good is it if they know based on past experiences that it will lead them to a situation where they know they cannot trust their inconclusive  state?
<br/>
<br/>
Post the link and tell them the answer is there.
<br/>
<br/>
It's far too easy to assume they are asking because they don't want to think, or read. But really it could just as easily be they don't want to make the error of making an error, and what better way than knowing the thoughts of someone who knows? Especially something that takes 0 time to answer as opposed to hours of pondering and testing ... sounds inefficient.
<br/>
<br/>
And just think of all the misinformation available; even read this forum for people with differing thoughts on the same topic. Then it is clearly obvious that these people have made their own (faulty) conclusions, which these "question askers" would much rather avoid.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, what worse way to "encourage" someone to do something "you" think is better than to "insult" them and say something negative to invoke negative feelings? Would it not be much wiser to answer kindly? Tell them that the answer is in the XYZ manual, tell them that everything they want to know is there and to ask questions to confirm their understanding ...
<br/>
<br/>
---
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
... and then there is the other school of thought. Why <span style="font-style: italic">should</span> they give it a second thought? Sure <span style="font-style: italic">you</span> wanted to invest the time learning it, but it would be terribly foolish for one to expect oneself to learn everything in the world. Sometimes it is wiser to ask someone to tell you an answer so that you can spend time elsewhere - paint more pictures, fix more cars. So you say it only takes 5 seconds for them to look? Then surely it's not laziness, but a false expectation. Change their expectation and <span style="font-style: italic">encourage</span> them to look - you will yield much better results. Not only will that person have more confidence in reading for themselves, but others are more likely to follow.
<br/>
<br/>
---
<br/>
<br/>
Here's another thought; you are asking a question here that you *could* have found out by studying communication, learning, perception and human knowledge. But you (presumably) know in yourself that it would be wiser to ask first since you don't know <span style="font-style: italic">where to start</span> ... I do know where to start to find that answer, but that's only because I studied pedagogy. And why should you learn it if you could just get the answer much quicker in an area you don't need (or feel the need) to further.
<br/>
<br/>
---
<br/>
<br/>
That being said it can be annoying, but only (and only) if you let it. I have my own gripes, but rather than make it get to me, I work with it whilst trying to counteract it. <span style="font-weight: bold">Create a good community and it will take care of itself.</span>
