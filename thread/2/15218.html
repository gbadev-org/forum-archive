Huh, I just installed some Java update on my computer (haven't done so in yonks) and after is finishes I get the message,

ok, that's fine. Interesting capitalisation. 'Successfully' <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> a proper noun, after all.

I dunno what wound me up in here (I did just get back from a hard day at work...) but I mean, I've just installed your product - I know what it is. I've chosen it. I've already made the "buying decision". Why are you still trying to sell it to me? What Java can "do for me"? All the good stuff is in Flash anyway! I'm not sure what my point is here ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah that's pretty minor. The one that really gives aggravates me is the iTunes installer. You get advert after advert about how you should buy an iPod (I already own an iPod, piss off!) and how well they work together. I know that they work together, this is why I'm installing your program.
<br/>
<br/>
What I'm really waiting for is one day to have iTunes crash, and have some watchdog code catch this and say,
<br/>

<br/>
To top it off, you always get QuickTime with it which you've got to turn off! "QuickTime + iTunes, a perfect combination". So..who has used QuickTime on Windows in the last 5+ years?
<br/>
<br/>
Then there's the "best played on nvidia" and (much more recently) "best played with Intel Core2" (ding ding ding DING!) ads that come in game. I know it "plays better" with this kit, but you don't need to remind me every time I play your game! Can't it somehow scan your computer and see what cards you've had in the past, or how often you buy new kit or something and then show an appropriate ad?

<br/>
No, I've just bought a brand new ATI HD 3870, I won't consider a new card for a couple of years. Can I not just disable these nvidia ads for a while?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else got any 'eager' installers or in-product adverts that piss them off?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Windows Live Messenger. When you download the installer and run it, it brings up a nice, clean list of what it's doing at the moment. Before you install it however, you get the option of other things to install too. Things like Windows Live! Rich Editor, which is just a blog editor, have their checkbox automatically checked for installation.
<br/>
<br/>
And beyond all of that, the installer itself makes a start menu entry! Just above WLM is a section named Windows Live Installer, which is just the same installer. I've known Microsoft loves product advertising, but come on! Cluttering up users' Start menus is not going to help download counts very much.<br/>_________________<br/>My favourite DS apps:

I have an nVidia card, and the last game I played with such an ad  (forget which) wouldn't work out of the box. Upon checking the the official website I found that it didn't run so well on nVidia cards and nVidia had to release some new drivers specifically to make it work.

It seems like PMPs all have nasty problems of one sort or another. I have a Zen which I quite like, but it's still got a lot of problems. The defacto media manager thing for it is really third-rate, but at least it's coming from the less-is-more direction. 
<br/>
<br/>
A big plus is that you rarely have to convert video for the Zen. Unless you have really high quality video (or an unsupported codec -- rare in my experience) it will probably be able to scale it down during playback (and the media manager will offer to convert anything when necessary.)<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, I'm glad it's not just me that finds this stuff annoying. I for one can't stand the 'nVidia - the way it's means to be played' logo attatched to seemingly 90% of all PC games, and it is infact one of my main reasons for buying ATI gear.
<br/>
<br/>
I also hate iTunes and Quicktime for their epic bundleware and advertising, which ultimately made up my decision to never buy an iPod as long as apple takes this strategy (Fellow Creative Zen owner) [Note: Yes I am aware you can use an iPod without touching iTunes]. On the subject of apple, the adverts for Mac really annoy me in that they can be misleading to many people. One of my college tutors was demonstrating to the class how the "Mac is really clever, because you can run Windows on it aswell", well I'll be damned, what did you buy a Mac for again.
<br/>
<br/>
I also hate Microsofts approach of telling us every time we update that we really should upgrade to vista because it's the future of computing and whatnot.
<br/>
<br/>
And why Intel's logo is absolutely everywhere beats me, I don't see why the average consumer needs to be told that intel is better than the competition to the point that nobody seems to realise there are alternatives. So when I play games I really do not need to know who or what are producing the latest components which are so "obviously" better than their competitors components. Please, what happened to making informed decisions.

in most games you can edit the config and set which videos to display. it's hacky, though.

On the Firefox point: that could be debated, with the Fasterfox extension. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
On the DRM point: XP does contain a bit of DRM that gets snuck in there with Windows Media Player 11. You can, however, stop it accessing the Internet and thereby pretty much stop it completely, by using the Group Policy tool (Open 'gpedit.msc' from the Run prompt.). Vista's DRM goes so far as to decrease the quality of HD-DVDs and Blu-Ray discs if the user doesn't have 'approved' equipment. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/" target="_blank">This site</a> is pretty much a campaign against DRM and also has a link somewhere to a forum post describing a problem in which the user could not watch low-resolution content from Netflix, but HD content was fine. <span style="font-size: 7px; line-height: normal">I might have been made slightly biased from that site.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
On the RealPlayer point: I never really use RealPlayer at all; I prefer Windows Media Player (which is fine since I'm on XP with DRM disabled ;) ). Urgh, SonicStage came on a minidisc with my MP4 player, which coincidentally, since it is part of the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_MP4/MTV_Player" target="_blank">S1 MP4 player</a> series, cannot play MP4s. I thought SonicStage was just an iTunes clone, and with everything I need set up in WMP, I see no reason to switch my player. Regardless of the Microsoft branding. ;)<br/>_________________<br/>My favourite DS apps:

I hate Mozilla. I mean I use Firefox* because I find IE unusable, but Mozilla really ruined Firefox with bloatiness and bad features (the worst gestures implementation ever, etc.) Apparently the ram usage is down below that of Opera's in FF3 though.

I agree that it seems like a dumb thing to do, but I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't increase the sales of the conditioning scalp lotion just because people didn't take the time to know it even existed.  When is the last time you browsed the shampoo isle to see what kind of treatments, revivers, conditioners, etc are available?  Most people just walk up, grab what they use, and leave.  The fact that you even read the bottle puts you above probably 80% of the people that use that product.
<br/>
<br/>
The nice thing is, you have the choice to read the bottle.  Maybe we need a "Skip" feature for installers.  "Click here to skip the adds and BS, and just install the damn software already".  :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I know I hate just sitting there watching a bar move across the screen or reading the BS info about the application I am installing.  Instead of your everyday commercial, it could be generational-ish ads (not to generalize on gamers) for musicians albums (with concert video), movies, etc.  Most of the time spent is data transfer anyway, so it's not like it would slow down the install much processing the advertising and I don't think it would turn off gamers if it wasn't a blatant "in your face" ad for something they wouldn't want.  I don't think most people would mind watching movie trailers if they have to wait for the install anyway.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Does anyone know how to get make to somehow return the number of targets left to build when it's running a makefile? (maybe through a builtin variable or function)
<br/>
I write the build scripts for my group at work and it'd be nice to get make to show something more informative than "compiling fred.cpp to fred.o". If I could somehow compute a percentage of how many targets built/to build and then whop it in an echo that'd be well lush.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
