Writing wise, are you left or right handed, and would you consider yourself more of a coder than artist/musician?<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

He's just normal, although there are some reasons (if you want some) on why this would be valid:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>It's in alphabetical order: L, R.
<br/>
</li><li>Ever heard of the controls "left right up down"?
<br/>
</li><li>Becuase there are not as many Left-handed coders.
<br/>
</li><li>You bothered asking.
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't be surprised that if he posted with them in the other order, you would post that silly little question regardless.

Holy crap, I never noticed that....

I think it's because my fingers know the vi keys, but my brain doesn't....I had to stare at the keyboard and pretend like I was using vi to see if you were right. :)

Anyway, so is this survey some sort of idea about left-handedness and creativity?

And what if, for the purposes of this web site, we are more of a coder, but spend just as much of our time making music?  .....ok, enough of my stupid questions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmmm.  I've personally noticed that about 90% of the coders I work with are muscially inclined - left or right handed.  It seems the part of the brain that allows logical programming also responds well to musical patterns.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So I guess another interesting survey question would be:  are you musically inclined?

I'm always listening to music, and quite often making it.  (guitar, bass, drums, flute, accordian, etc....problem is I just can't sing).
