    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm just curious what everyone loads up when they start to program for GBA.  I personally have DevKitAdvance, along with MS Visual C++ 6.0 for editing the code, then I compile it via a make script that I got from a tutorial.  Then I test it out on the hardware via Flash linker.  I use Paint and PhotoStyler for graphics, along with some custom tools to convert pics to C files.

<br/>
What do you guys do?

I've written an OS X native mapeditor but it's not yet ready for a public release (hang in there Darkcloud, it will be soon :)

I'm currently looking into using <span style="font-weight: bold">Macromedia Director</span> for creating cutscenes and other complex animations, writing a custom exporter plugin.

<br/>
For testing stuff I use <span style="font-weight: bold">Boycott Advance</span> when I'm on the road or an official devkit if I'm at work. I sure hope Visual Boy Advance for OS X will have GDB support soon though, that way I could do debugging when I'm out of town aswell, that would be great.

But what's most important, I load iTunes to play Slagsm?lsklubben, Tool, Ramones or De Lyckliga Kompisarna while programming. Music is important, see. :)<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
And notepad sucks unless you're doing a quick patch job that takes 2 seconds.  There are a ton of great editors out there that don't have a splash screen and load just as quick as notepad.  I use PFEdit32 personally and FRHexEdit.  And you can stick shortcuts into c:\windows\sendto (win95/98) or c:\documents and settings\user\sendto (for XP... I think) so you can Right Click-&gt;Send To it.

i am a notepad protagonist - many have tried, yet many have failed... i will not be moved! just what is wrong with notepad?! it accepts key presses from the keyboard, interprets them into ascii characters into a window, and hey presto i can save it as a text file, or rename it to .c, .cpp or .asm! if i want to replace something i go to "edit-&gt;replace", or if i want to go to a line i just do a "edit-&gt;goto" :) and i already know how to spell, so i don't need it to change all the keywords to a different colour (black is fine ;) )

1. Tabs are 8 spaces width.  That's nuts.  I prefer 4.

3. No search-&gt;replace (in win98)

4. Can only open one document at a time

5. Word-wrap is buggy in XP, and annoying otherwise

7. Good luck printing.

8. No line numbers

I mean, why put up with ANY problems when you can get something else with zero problems and takes .00005 more seconds to load?

Don't get me wrong either, I use notepad a ton, especially for HTML.  But I like Courier New and syntax highlighting for C++...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I use cygwin tools on XP.  I use XFree86 full-screen with fvwm2, xterm and vi.  I use make to compile and ctags to find symbols.  Been using X for around 15 years, both at school, work and home, and I'm much more comfortable editing 8 files simultaneously under X than I am under MS DevStudio - although I do us VC++ for occaisional Windows projects.
<br/>
<br/>
For graphics I use MS Paint and PaintShop Pro.  I played with Tile Studio for a bit, but I haven't used it in a project.  I haven't used a sprite editor either.  I don't have an artistic eye, so I couldn't really get much out of these tools anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
For sound effects I've used "Quack!", which is an object-oriented synthesizer (icons represent wave generators, filters, etc and you join them together to form complex sounds).  It works quite well.

<br/>
Have a look at Vim for text editing <a class="postlink" href="http://www.vim.org" target="_blank">http://www.vim.org</a>. It brings syntax-hilight for lots of languages, and a lot of features.
<br/>
But, as grabbed from its website :
<br/>
<br/>
"Vim isn't an editor designed to hold its users' hands. It is a tool, the use of which must be learned. "
<br/>
<br/>
I you work in both a UN*X/Linux and Windows environment, and use C and ASM for your GBA stuff, I think it's a great tool.

And for those who plan to come to Linux, for GBA development or everything else, this could help :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Devkitadvance for compiling, VisualBoyAdvance and BoycottAdvance for testing, NASM for INCBINning all my data into object files (I decided that converting data files into C headers is such a clumsy solution), notepad, and a couple of other tools I find or make as I need them.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, notepad is annoying for anything more than a quick page or 2 of coding. The Win2K notepad is infinitely better than previous versions, but it still really really needs:
<br/>
-configurable newlines
<br/>
-configurable tabs
<br/>
-delete-next-word key (Ctrl+Del still deletes the rest of the line)
<br/>
-delimiters on punctuation, not just spaces
<br/>
-autoindentation
<br/>
<br/>
It took them long enough to get Win2K notepad, but at least it has:
<br/>
-line numbers in the status bar
<br/>
-Replace and Go-To-Line functionality
<br/>
-Shortcut keys for open, save, search, replace, and go to line.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, now that I finally have access to the internet again I will look for a replacement for notepad or maybe an appwizard for VC which lets me use GCC.
<br/>
<br/>
edit: just configured MS VC++ for gcc. Much better than notepad :)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Jaywalk on Mon Feb 10, 2003 6:59 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>
