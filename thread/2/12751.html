    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just wondering if anyone can recommend a method to power three strings of LED Christmas lights (each rated at 120V, 60hz, 0.04A, 4W) for about 5 hours, using a very small, lightweight power source (think something that fits in a large pocket)? They won't be on steady, so 5 hours is a theoretical maximum. I was thinking several 9-volt batteries connected together? I doubt AC/DC matters with simple LED lights.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">LED = Light Emitting Diode, so it has to be DC. Battery life is measured in Watts/hour. Energizer, then Duracell, not sure who is next. If it is AC then you will need to create a bridge to convert it to AC (just google for the circuit diagrams).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hm, actually 120 x 0.04 = 4.8. Would I just multiply that by 3 for 3 strings? So I need enough batteries to pull 14.4W/hour for ~5 hours. Since they'll be blinking on and off at varying intervals I might get away with as little as 2.5 hours.
<br/>
<br/>
Duracell's website may be the most useless website ever. It is completely devoid of information. Energizer's has nothing regarding the specifications of the batteries, only some general battery usage tips.

I really don't know enough about electricity to figure this out on my own. The batteries would need to total 120V <span style="font-style: italic">and</span> be able to supply 0.12A for 2.5 hours? Looking at Wikipedia's <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_%28electricity%29" target="_blank">battery</a> article, a typical 9-volt battery is rated for 625 mAh... 120/9 = 13.333... so I'd need 14 of them to reach 120V, and that would add up to 8.75 Ah. At 0.12A they'd last for 72 hours? No way that can be right... :-S<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When you put batteries in series to increase their voltage, the current does not increase, and neither does the total charge (1 ampere hour = 3600 coulombs). Batteries in <span style="font-style: italic">parallel</span> have a higher charge. If you want to increase both the voltage and the charge by a factor of 14, you'll need to use 196 batteries.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ouch. Well I certainly don't need them to last for 72 hours. I could also give each string its own, separate battery pack if that would make a difference.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
