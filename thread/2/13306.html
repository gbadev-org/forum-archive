    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Reality TV has gone too far. I just heard on the news that the creators of Big Brother have created a new reality TV show in the Netherlands called Big Donor. In this show <a class="postlink" href="http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1267812,00.html" target="_blank">contestants are competing to get a life saving kidney transplant</a> from a terminally ill patient who is a match. The makers are defending themselves saying that the odds of getting a kidney though the show is much higher than being on the waiting list.

<br/>
What next, a reality TV hostage situation?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if they really wanted to help, they'd make the search nonprofit and not for entertainment. so, i'm also thinking: this is going too far.
<br/>
good (side) purpose (the core purpose is still brainless entertainment - even though it pobably *could* make ppl think, indirectly), badly executed. i thought tv already went too far, but this is a new peak.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

that's what i meant by making the search (for donors) non-profit and non-entertaining. and you're totally right, loosing the show means probably loosing life for most won't find a donor and once it's too late, it's too late. even a donated organ won't help then anymore. i don't know how the show is meant to be structured, though. life is cruel (sometimes) and they play with it. that's very sad.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Take away the entertainment and you have nothing more than what the health service is already doing; and non-profit means that all of the money goes back into the project instead of shareholders, not that people don't get paid.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

These people should already be on the waiting list for a transplant. If they win, they get one right away. If not, they remain on the list and are no worse off than they were before. Unless they have to actually be removed from the list to participate, in which case I may vomit.

It's not much different in that aspect from a person with a steady income playing the lottery (except that they're losing the money they paid for the lottery tickets that don't win). However it's still terrible to toy with their lives like that.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I personally like REAL reality TV.  Not this crap you guys are talking about.  It's not reality TV.  When is the last time you were on an island with 20 people?  Never?  Me either.. not much reality there..  How about.. the last time you were living in a mansion with 20 people?  No?  Dang.. me either.
<br/>
<br/>
Real reality TV:
<br/>
<br/>
American Choppper
<br/>
Horsepower TV
<br/>
Dirty Jobs
<br/>
etc.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
