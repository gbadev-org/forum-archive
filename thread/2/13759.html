    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am a game programmer with 5 year experience, and have developed for xbox360&amp;ps3. But I started to get tired of the "next-gen" consoles and quit my job recently. I think DS to be a very good game platform, and I have got the official sdk and hardware, and some demo have been made. I am considering start a small studio for DS game development. I could get people for art, sound, design, everything you need to make a game. But I do not know how could I get the game published. I am only familiar with make a game, not sell it...
<br/>
<br/>
So how could I sell the game when it is done? Or are there any commercial projects that need developers? Maybe outsourcing is a good start point for me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are a bunch of ways to about doing this.  In Japan, developers can approach publishers with presentation material, but in the west I think publishers usually want to see a working demo.
<br/>
<br/>
A working demo generally consists of all the key parts of the game engine, and a little bit of content.  It is OK if it is a little buggy, so long as it doesn't crash.  (Crashing may be OK depending on the circumstances, but it is generally in the Not Good category.)
<br/>
<br/>
Some publishers may or may not be interested in branding your title.  Some publisher will fund development, others will just agree to sell it.  I suppose someone may not be interested at all.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To get your game published you need to have your product distributed to the stores, plus the mass production. I doubt that the distribution networks are led by the suppliers (publishers), however you may find that the distribution network is typically direct from suppliers to stores with a few distributors aimed at supplying small non-chained stores.
<br/>
<br/>
Do a little research (it doesn't take that long) to see what the game distribution network looks like.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the production of the game, you could just obtain a loan for the production meaning you get all of the profits of the game. Another option is just to pitch your game to a publisher, but I personally think it would be better to obtain a bank loan rather than a publisher loan - they are both loans.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am just a humble developer and want to sell my game to a publisher, or make a game at publisher's demand...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh right, well in that case it sounds like you just need a deal with a publisher. Attend all trade shows and liaise with as many publishers you can, however without a marketing strategy you have only merit.
<br/>
<br/>
Having said that if you can prove there is a market for what you are producing then you will have the publishers attention. To make a game at the publishers demand you will have to prove your team is capable of performing such a feat, and you will also need there to be an opportunity to offer your services.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing I would say is that there is no one answer. If you can come up with a novel game idea that is marketable, then go for it. If you feel you may not be able to create something innovative enough, or revive an old genre then you may feel that the time would have been better spent elsewhere.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would recommend talking to some of us for game ideas, like post a poll with a few ideas that you are willing to do and we can post feedback on what some specifics could be like... Good luck anyways.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Currently I have no game ideas. I am not innovative type, or more precisely, I have no idea what the market(or publisher) would be interested in. I am thinking of making a small game with little budget and short period(3 month to the most). I am wondering if small games are easy to be published on DS. If you have any suggestion I would be very pleased to hear it :)
