    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I have a M3miniSD and it's running fine.
<br/>
I currently use moonshell to play movies and mp3's on my NDS, but I want to use it too on my GB-MICRO.
<br/>
But the problem is: The Crystal Converter software isn't working on my pc due a stupid bug in the installer (crashing on selecting the output; the default output is an unusable Linux-partition for my 'on-demand'-teathre software, and when I'm trying to change it it says 'Device unavailable' and it crashes). I mailed M3 support but all they say it's my Nero software, which I've uninstalled already, this is really annoying since I bought this thing to play movies en audio on my MICRO.
<br/>
<br/>
So I wanted to ask: Is there an alternative like Moonshell on the DS for the GBA/GBM?
<br/>
<br/>
I would be very pleased =) (and I hope they fix te bug in the converter software &lt;_&lt;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But I'm kinda mobile and actually I'm searching for a player which can play mp3's from directory directly without making a ROM (this takes some time). So it would be like the mp3player of Moonshell. Any suggestions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It also takes some time to copy the MP3 files from your computer onto the cart even if you use MoonShell. What's the major difference? Are you getting MP3s from other people who have miniSD writers on their computers?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I want to put mp3's on my miniSD from my homepc and when I get to school I want to put mp3's from a school computer on the miniSD.
<br/>
Also transferring mp3's from friends Ipods on pc and then to my miniSD. 
<br/>
But the problem is you got to make new ROMS every time, or you'll have seperate ROMS and you won't be able to play all music.
<br/>
<br/>
So I'm actually searching a movie/mp3 player for GBA(GBM) which plays files from a directory so you won't have to create ROMS every time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Are you sure you know where the original CDs are? This is gbadev.org, not gbapiracy.org.

What's wrong with one ROM per album? Or is one of the computers a Mac and thus not compatible with the GSM Player builder?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I usually get some songs of a friend which actually owns the album (e.g. rhcp and JackJohnsen last time) and I also have an online space where I store my own mp3's. 
<br/>
<br/>
What I mean by making seperate ROMs: You'll have to restart the console first, before listening to music in another ROM.. well it;s not a really big problem but it would be nice to be able to play all files at once.
<br/>
<br/>
But does there exist another mediaplayer? 
<br/>
btw I also saw a Stormcode player or something on *isnt that dpg-site illegal? :/* but the download is broken..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If I knew how to make an exit hack for every flash card, I would. Then you could press A+B+Select+Start to return to the menu.
<br/>
<br/>
Point is that the GBA CPU is definitely not expected to be able to decode 44 kHz stereo MP3 in real time.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
