<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking to pre-order my DS so that it can be sent to me on the scheduled release date of November 21st. 
<br/>
<br/>
I live in Australia and don't want to wait for it to be released here so I need to know a good place to order from with the cheapest price and fastest delivery.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone make any recommendations?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,
<br/>
Krakken.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
