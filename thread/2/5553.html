<br/>
<br/>
i'm not a coder, and anyway, i have no time to spend in coding. However, i have an idea for a game to be coded on GBA but i can't find any coder to write it. I know that sometimes, there are some coders who are waiting for projects, so let me present my idea :
<br/>
I love space strategy games and i found a simple amator game that symbolizes what i mean. here is the link to the demo : <a href="http://games.kingston.net/preview/332778.html" target="_blank">http://games.kingston.net/preview/332778.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It's called Galactic Battle. try it quickly, and you'll understand what kind of game i'm speaking about.
<br/>
<br/>
it's would be wondeful to have such a game on GBA. and i think it's rather possible as far as the GBA gameplay is concerned.
<br/>
If someone is interested... Go Go Go ! =)
<br/>
<br/>
Thx :)
<br/>
