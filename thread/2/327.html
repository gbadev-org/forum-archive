    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is an emulator for it on Windows, doesn't do the 3d display (unless they've done a version since I last saw it that uses some gfx cards "glasses" output) but emulates the games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It only appeared that way; I've got quite a few articles about it back in some old Nintendo Powers of mine. It used '3D glasses'-like technology to create a sense of 3D depth, but it reportedly gave you splitting headaches after playing it for an extended period of time.

I have seen emulators for it - I think you can get them at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.zophar.net" target="_blank">www.zophar.net</a>, though I honestly have no idea where you'd find them ROMs, if they're even out there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
