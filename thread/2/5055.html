    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Evidently, once you sign up with gmail you must invite as many people to join gmail as you can.  I think you also have to kill other people with gmail accounts if you have mutual friends without gmail so that <span style="font-weight: bold">you</span> can convert the people without gmail.  Not entirely sure about the last part.  All I know is this constitutes say... about my 782nd invite so far... =P

I don't have gmail.  I'm happy with what I have.  I guess I wish all the gmail missionaries luck though...  everyone needs a hobby? =)

You don't have to invite people to GMail if you don't want to.  I invited 10 of my closest friends and cousins and that's it.  They don't kick you out or pay you or anything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
