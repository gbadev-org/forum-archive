    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've seen several sites saying that the micro is released in the US, but I've now been to 3 stores looking for it and I've had zero luck.
<br/>
<br/>
Am I getting confused with the European release date or something? Has anyone seen the thing on the shelves yet? Am I just retarded? =P
