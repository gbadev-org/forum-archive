    <h4>#21213 - aaronphughes - Tue May 25, 2004 10:40 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am not trying to freak people out here, I am just curious about your thoughts on this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In a free market system, Nintendo has the right to design a system and reap benefits
<br/>
from it. They have also "decided" to charge a fee, for any company/individual that
<br/>
would like to develop for that system.
<br/>
<br/>
Now the homebrew community has obviously circumvented this fee, by reverse engineering the GBA,
<br/>
as well as the opcodes that go into each game. From this they have made assemblers, compilers and
<br/>
emulators, and eventually flash carts to play our own games on the original hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
So at which point, if any, do you feel obligated to pay that developers fee? If you really do 
<br/>
enjoy developing for this system, and never actually pay Nintendo anything, how is this different
<br/>
from pirating a song, and listening to it over and over?
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously it was not Nintendo's intention to have us developing for their GBA for free. If it was,
<br/>
they would have released all the documentation and development tools and not have that developers fee.
<br/>
Similarly, it is not the intention of the Music Industry to have people download their songs for free, or else
<br/>
they too would post the MP3's on their sites for free, instead of trying to sell us CD's.
<br/>
<br/>
In all honesty, we will all get tired of developing for this system, once newer and better systems come along, 
<br/>
similar to how we will grow sick of listening to pirated songs, once newer ones come out. In the mean time, neither 
<br/>
Nintendo nor the record company made any money from us.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now I am not concerned about any legal precedents, current copyright laws or anything like that, those things
<br/>
change based on public opinion and political pressure (ex. abortion laws have flipped flopped)
<br/>
<br/>
What I want to know is, your personal opinion, justified only by your own judgment and conclusions.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My own personal opinion is that the Homebrew community does not owe Nintendo anything, as 
<br/>
the majority of us (most likely) have purchased GBA's and numerous games, and wanting to program 
<br/>
for this system was a natural progression/consequence of simply liking this platform.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I am curious if anyone else out there feels that evading (avoiding) the developers fee is a form of piracy,
<br/>
or are we totally justified?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is a touchy issue. These regulations are in place as a mechanism to a specific goal. This mechanism is that of generating money from those that have it in exchange for the right to make even more money from the public by use of Nintendo's product. This mechanism does not include the homebrew community, nor was prepared for it in the 1980's.
<br/>
<br/>
It is not illegal to create games without a license - but it is illegal to create games that work, since it requires a license to get the Nintendo logo on your cart legally.
<br/>
<br/>
My personal opinion is that the homebrew community own nothing to Nintendo other than thanks for creating a successful platform to develop for.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello to you all,
<br/>
<br/>
I also agree with notb4dinner. As long as I paid the money from that system and do not infringe any law, I'm free to do whatever I want with it.
<br/>
<br/>
This is the same about Xbox and Linux/FSF progs running on it. You are free to use the HW you legally bought as you wish (again, to the extent permitted by the law).
<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I don't think there is a problem since no homebrewn games are sold. If we would do so, we would have to pay Nintendo. The designed a great HW, it is fair for them to have their share if you want to make money on it be selling GBA software.
<br/>
<br/>
To answer the original thread question, I think I owe nothing to Nintendo as a homebrewn developer.

Actually, Nintendo is on shaky grounds here. Monopolies are illegal, and if the only way for me to release a game for the GBA is by putting the compressed logo on the cart, then I am most likely allowed to do so.
<br/>
The law in this area is of course different in different countries.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I mean, I don't have to pay anyone to play on my guitar, do I?

<br/>
Oh, and about the monopoly. I think Nintendo is pretty much okay there. Nobody forces you to buy a GBA. And you knew before you bought the GBA you could only play Nintendo, GBA specific games on your device.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally; developer fees are peanuts. Sure, it'll be quite an investment but that's exactly what it is; An investment. And on the whole production cost, those fees are really quite low.<br/>_________________<br/>If everything fails, read the manual: If even that fails, post on forum!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Okay then, here is what the law thinks about piracy.
<br/>
<br/>
Theft is the deprivation of anothers goods, such as taking their wallet and depriving them of money. This does not happen when downloading a game for free, or developing games for free where you, or your team would not have purchased it had it not been free. However if that game cost money to download or you would have paid for it had it not been illegally free, then it is the person who recieved the money and did not subsidise money to Nintendo who has deprived Nintendo money. In the case of homebrew then the reciept of money for the cost of playing your developed game that has deprived money from Nintendo, or the ability of being able to acquire a license.
<br/>

<br/>
The reason why personal views aren't taken into account, as with abortion, is that people had their views tailored against this by the media. Abortion at one time was purposely percieved as murder, groups of criminals are treated as organisations.
<br/>
<br/>
The law is based on ethics, however this does not mean that the entire countries views are taken into account. <span style="font-weight: bold">If they were then black people and women couldn't vote.</span> In some cases the public just aren't generaly intelligent in the case in question, or are irrationally for or against a cause, again racism and prejudist is an example.

Almost. Nintendo has no monopoly. If I wanted, I could publish a game designed for Nokia Series 60 phones, Palm PDAs, Pocket PC PDAs, etc. Likewise, Sega had no monopoly around the time it sued Accolade. However, Sega still lost.

I'd be surprised if Nintendo holds a patent which you would be infringing by selling GBA games of your own making, if there is I'd argue it's validity - theres nothing new or novel required to make a GBA game.
<br/>

Although they designed and built the platform that doesn't auomatically give them any right to control what people do with it - including making (and selling) software to run on it.  Does anyone feel compelled to pay Apple licensing fees when they develop Macintosh software?

To be honest, I only heard about the "game" patent by a non-licensed hardware manufacturer, who told me that nintendo holds the patent for games but not necessarily for other uses.
<br/>
<br/>
So, you got me curious. I did a <a class="postlink" href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;TERM1=nintendo&amp;FIELD1=ASNM&amp;co1=AND&amp;TERM2=&amp;FIELD2=&amp;d=ptxt" target="_blank">quick search</a> at the US patent office, and it's really interesting. Nintendo holds 400+ patents in the US, covering things as specific as manufacturing GB-compatible cartridges to things as broad as a game where you can voluntarily replay a level (seriously.)  
<br/>
<br/>
I only skimmed the list, and I didn't see anything as broad as "any game using the gameboy platform," but there are a lot of patents that talk about certain aspects of gameplay or certain uses for the hardware.
<br/>

<br/>
To legally use their logo you must acquire their permission, which they will not do without a license. There are different laws in different countries, so depending on what country your are from Nintendo may not be able to punish you.

The difference with developing for a Macintosh for free and developing a game for free and making money, is that Nintendo at some point of a console lifespan are losing money for their hardware and rely on software sales and licensing to do so.

Patenting laws are different to copyright, and is stronger in Nintendo's case as it is not simply 4 characters, it is an entire bitmap.

True, "amount and substantiality" counts in a judge's determination of fair use. Several early Sega Genesis games were 512 KiB, and the code that Accolade copied into genesis_crt0.s was about 24 bytes (0.0046 percent of the ROM). The smallest Game Boy Advance games are 4096 KiB in size, and the magic cookie data is 156 bytes (0.0037 percent of the ROM).

I take that as a stupid comment. Pointless, not that I want to spark argument. Reason being, is that it is <span style="font-weight: bold">the</span> business model for releasing consoles as the are expensive machines in comparison to their PC counterparts. More graphics cards are sold for PC's, so their cost can go down a lot quicker and they can afford to sell their graphics cards based on the developers costs. This puts the cost of most consoles up to ?500-?600, and in the case of a handheld about ?150-?200 in order to pay for initial orders.

As with our law system, however in most cases based around computing, the law system is simply not ready for it and would often produce poor initial judgements. With computing, more often than not each case is individual and past cases are ignored as there aren't enough and the law hasn't adapted yet. In the case of using previous decisions, computer cases would most likely be using previous cases to disginguish themselves from that decision - and the fact is that even in America different decisions have arose over the same situations. An example is amazon being able to patent one click buying - the simplest algorithm on the planet that shouldn't even get past the first stage of patenting.

The truth of the matter is that consoles don't need to be more expensive.

A couple of questions though...

<br/>
Is this true? If it is, why aren?t all of us using the ?official? compilers and development tools?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote"><span style="font-weight: bold">keldon</span> ?

<br/>
<br/>
However <span style="font-weight: bold">Tepples</span> posted the ?Sega vs. Accolade? decision. If I read that correctly, it seems Accolade wanted to avoid the developers fee for the Genesis system. They reversed engineered the system, released "working" carts, they were of course sued, BUT the ruling was in their favor, even though they admitted to using the small boot up code to make the Sega logo appear.
<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, if this sets a precedent, it would NOT be illegal to create a "working" game even with the Nintendo logo present (at least in the US) 
<br/>
<br/>
Now I did intend for the current laws to be exempt, and only each persons own personal ethics and judgment to be used. However, if this precedent is the case (at least in the US), then it would appear that anybody can release a full functioning GBA game (perhaps on a flash cart), or maybe for download for use only in the VBA, and <span style="font-weight: bold">legally</span> would not owe Nintendo anything. Ethically however it would be a different case.
<br/>
<br/>
So, some clarification on the above would be great.

I disagree.  Imagine what would happen to Disney if copyright suddenly disappeared.  Think of all the roadside shops that would open up.  I think it would do wonders for people like uhhh... homebrew developers? Eliminating copyright means that the people who can do a better or cheaper job manufacturing will be the ones who sell the products.  All piracy would become legit.  As legit businesses they would have to do things cheaper (probably the current plan) or better.

My theory is that this would spark wars where entities all battle over doing a better job of implementing x-copywritten material.

Yes this is true and can be verified by asking Nintendo directly.
<br/>
<br/>
In order to posess and use the official tools you <span style="font-weight: bold">must</span> be authorised. If you haven't applied and been accepted you're not authorised.
<br/>
<br/>
Getting authorised involves having a commercially viable project which Nintendo approve - this will include having an incorporated company and sufficient resources to see it through to completion. You can also get authorised if you are subcontracting for another authorised developer or publisher (this is by far the easiest path).

If a person or entity is bound and determined to steal your work, they will find a way.  One could take a book, do a global name replace, and change the grammar and look!  We have a new book.

Cloning the vast majority of things is not worth that much effort.  One could set up a shell corporation and sell your book.  When you sue them the company has no assets and is magically bankrupt.

Furthurmore, ripping off the vast majority of things is not even worth *that* much effort.  In reality if you can manage to sell something in the first place you are lucky, much less have it ripped.  I do not think that there is not all that much to worry about.  If your *stuff* gets ripped off, sue them.  If that fails, clone your own work.

Perhaps.  Perhaps this applies equally well to both copyright and patents.  I agree that I am more strongly opposed to patents.  Either way just having a idea or having written a story, or having an idea for a story or a character is nothing special.  It's what one does with that idea or story or character that counts.  That is true now.  I think no copyright and certainly no patent protection would make that all the more true.

Accolade did not put any copyrighted code or logo in their game. If I remember correctly, the only thing remotely copyrighted they put in their game was the word "SEGA" stored as four ascii chars in a 32bit constant. This constant is a mandatory argument to some bios boot code which must be called otherwise the console will not work properly. The main issue in the sega/accolade case was that the BIOS displays the text "Licensed by SEGA" on the screen before the game starts, which was of course not true for the accolade game. SEGA sued Accolade for illegally claiming that the game is licensed by SEGA, and Accolade countersued SEGA for illegally claiming that they had in some way helped/licensed the Accolades game ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The background I give is Tetris. In Russia everything you create that is creative belongs to the state. Now that meant that when Tetris was created he was not allowed to make money from it and kept it a secret from the government. By leaking it to Europe he faced imprisonment, as he does not own his own work.

<br/>
How this relates to copyright, is that if you don't control the right to your own work then you cannot make money from it and other people can. That again is a stupid comment so I have put it in bold.

Some of your ideas are however very thoughtful, however are remeniscent of what was wrong with Russia. People should create things for as cheap as possible, but they won't - but we must also protect those who do need money for their work. That is the purpose of copyright.

My theory is that this would spark wars where entities all battle over doing a better job of implementing x-copywritten material.  Big companies could not cry 'you stole my idea, give me a million dollars!'  The response would be 'I came up this idea in the first place, I should be able to do a better job with it than anyone else!'

Patents were invented in Italy, where glass making firms used secret methods for creating the purest perfect glass. However people could work for them to learn their secrets learned over centuries passed down by families and steal their methods. The Italian state created a patent to protect someone from using a unique method, or idea. Patents are a very good thing, <span style="font-weight: bold">but</span> currently are implemented wrongly.

That is a very interesting and highly debated point you bring up. As well "deserve" is the important word here in my opinion.
<br/>
<br/>
There was a case I saw on the news recently about a car manufacturer putting integrated circuits (IC?s) on some parts of the car they sold. This way, only their "approved" replacement parts, such as tires and alternators would work.
<br/>
<br/>
A law suit ensued since another parts manufacturer cracked the code on the IC, and started selling replacement parts. This was taken as "infringement" on their patented IC or something like that.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically the case had two different points. Was this a high tech way of creating a monopoly OR an ingenious way to ensure your hard work is profitable?
<br/>
<br/>
I can understand both sides here.
<br/>
<br/>
Imagine if you never received a dime for coming up with a good idea. This why I often feel sorry for new rock groups who do great work, and 99% of the profit goes to record companies. On the other hand, let?s say someone finds the cure for cancer or aids, and demands a million dollars a pill! We are a pretty greedy species by nature, and there is this sense of entitlement or ?What?s in it for me? attitude. It seems we are constantly out to screw or take advantage of one another.
<br/>
<br/>
For the record the "other" parts manufacturer won the case, even though they admitted to reverse engineering the IC to make their parts compatible. Basically while nobody forced you to buy this particular car, the judge felt that this would set a bad precedent. If all automobile manufacturers began to do this, they would all in a sense, have their own private monopoly. Capitalism works best (for the consumer) when there are lots of choices and many competing companies have a price war lowering their prices to get your business. It works terrible for consumers when there are only a few competing companies and few choices. Then the current prices become questioned, and maybe there is price fixing going on.
<br/>
<br/>
Now back to Nintendo. I believe this is a tough area to apply current laws to. Do they have a monopoly has been asked before, and I think they do. Technically they don?t, if you consider portable gaming on cell phones (or the short lived game gear, turbo grafx and so on.). But honestly, these are only similar in the way that a car is similar to a skateboard. Most people want a GBA if they are playing serious portable gaming, just as most people drive their car to work, not their skateboard.
<br/>
<br/>
So, do printer manufacturers ?deserve? a monopoly on replacement ink cartridges? Likewise does Nintendo ?deserve? a monopoly on producing GBA carts?
<br/>
<br/>
My personal opinion is no.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Consoles <span style="font-weight: bold">really</span> rely on software sales (with the exception of the gamecube) to accumulate enough money to pay for manufacturing.
<br/>
<br/>
The XBox, for example has made a considerable loss with it being a $500-$600 machine - simply due to software sales not being what it wished for. The gamecube has made a profit - even though it has lower software, and possibly hardware sales worldwide than the XBox. Nintendo also rely on the handheld market where it is unmatched. Sales for phones in something like a 1 month period outshadow that of gba sales in a year - but the Nokia N-Gage did nothing to Nintendo's gba sales, so it is quite questionable as to whether they have a monopoly or not. Just as their is Macintosh and Linux, Microsoft still have a monopoly ( at the moment ).
<br/>
<br/>
We simply can't compare consoles to washing machines, printers and phones; although consoles aren't the only machines that rely on various other sales to generate profit. Contract phones, for example, rely on you paying up to $600 over a one year period (going by UK prices). But do also offer the option of a full priced phone.
<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, if the consoles were full priced the games may be cheaper, as they are with the PC - but that's only a possibility.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another thing we must recognize is that the console lives or dies by the *quality* of its games. It's been said before, and I'll say it again: one of the big reasons Nintendo has been a success is because they won't allow crap games on their platform (or at least not TotalCrapTM).
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone could easily produce a GB game, then many of us would have already released our TotalCrap games (I know mine are), and the overall GB fan base would suffer from it. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I also just wanted to clarify some terms. If you already know this stuff, please skip over it. But I thought I'd share, since when I started out it all seemed very confusing...
<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
COPYRIGHT is the body of laws that protects specific works of art, music, or text. The moment your author something, it is protected by copyright law. If you like, you can put "(C) 2004 My Name. All Rights Reserved" on your work, just to make it clear to everyone. If you're really paranoid, you can send yourself a copy of the work via registered mail, then never open the envelope. If you ever have to go to court, you can show the judge the envelope establishing the date of your claim. This is all free. You don't have to be a giant corporation to afford it.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, you may also choose to register your copyright with the US Copyright office, which costs $15 or something, but it is NOT necessary to be protected under the law.
<br/>
<br/>
You CANNOT copyright an idea, game system, mechanic, or algorithm, only a specific work of art. So if someone wanted to steal the IDEA of tetris and make it look different, they legally can.
<br/>
<br/>
Copyright was never intended to protect a little token of code that you must have in your widgit to make the widgit machine work. I mean, can you copyright a word? NO. That's what trademarks are for...
<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
TRADEMARKS are the body of law that protects specific words, phrases, character designs, or logos from being stolen or even closely copied by competitors. Trademarks cost more, because they MUST be registered with the government(s) of the states/countries where you intend to sell your product. To trademark something, you just put the little TM next to it, then send a copy of your trademark, along with a form detailing when you started using it, to the government. This initial registration process costs a couple hundred bucks, if I remember right. Again, not outside the budget of an individual.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, once you've used the mark for a couple of years, you can pay more to register it. This requires an in-depth search to make sure that the mark has not already been taken. Eventually, this will lead to your trademark becoming Registered, which lets you put the little (R) on your mark. The Nintendo logo is trademarked. Mickey Mouse is trademarked. Animated mice are NOT trademarkable. That's what patents are for... 
<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
PATENTS are the thing that cost a lot of money, comparitively speaking. Patents protect ideas, widgits, algorithms, methods of manufacturing, etc. Monopoly has a US patent, which means it is illegal to create a game with identical mechanics to Monopoly, even if you change all of the art and call it something else.
<br/>
<br/>
To get a patent, you have to go through a long and legally involved process, which is why most people hire patent attorneys to do the grunt work. I've never personally gone through the patent process, but I know that the whole thing can be done for under $10,000. Is that a prohibitive amount for a small business? Maybe. It totally depends on how much money the idea can make you, and how important it is to protect that idea from competition. 
<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, to get back to my original point, I feel that the reason Nintendo patents (and enforces) the method of making carts is more to ensure the quality of the product than to protect the platform from competition. And for that, I applaud them. 
<br/>
<br/>
I still don't feel that it's ethically wrong to make GB games without their blessing, but I DO feel it's philosophically wrong to deny someone (even an evil, faceless corporation, if you believe in that kind of thing) to protect their hard work from others. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't like their politics, don't buy their product. If you hate the way they refuse to share their secret sauce, then by all means go and make a sauce of your own. (And do it with the assurance that our legal system provides you with tools to make some money from your sauce. Mmmm. ;)

"Custom components" I assume you are talking about the GBA ASIC. Well, when you design a ASIC, there is a huge one time cost. But after that, the production cost is really low.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well there is never a loss, more of a virtual, or relative loss. The gameboy, I'm not too sure of exactly; but the current consoles definately don't make as much from consoels sales as it costs to develop and build - apart from the Gamecube, which is a very cheap console.
<br/>
<br/>
But having said that, the console market is like no other, and does rely on software in any case - especially since the console price is always lower than it ought to be, simply because there is software to back it up.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think Nintendo do sell their consoles at a loss; unlike Microsoft and Sony they invest in making their parts dirt cheap. It is questionable whether they even need software sales, since they have generated $6Bn profit in one year, compared to the $100 million or so loss that microsoft has lost.
<br/>
<br/>
Their fee is for those in the big picture. Nintendo basically give them a right to print money by marketting a console (which apparently does have a marketting campaign) worthy of bringing them high software sales - in exchange these software distributers give Nintendo a sub. Nothing wrong with that really is it?? Would you rather develop and keep all the money for yourself with only a few hundred thousand potential customers?

<br/>
Either way, I don't see how they "deserve" any money from hobby developers, or even 3rd party game and accessory companies. The GBA is a huge success, naturally 3rd party people and companies develop accessories for it, and hobbyists find more uses for it. The same happens to pretty much any successful product out there.
<br/>
<br/>
There are tons of GBA accessories made by noname companies. Some of them even include the compressed logo (like the "GBA memory stick"). You think any of thoose pay any kind of fees to Nintendo? You think they should?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Producing for the GBA is about the only way to make a short 2d game that actually generates money. Many of the games released are now matched by flash games that make nothing at all. So there's no question that without the GBA they wouldn't make money for their products and games.
<br/>
<br/>
I prefer the market how it is because I benefit from a low cost machine, and I only buy the best games - which is not a lot. But if they didn't charge for each game sold but sold the console at a full price go make profit, I think that would benefit the buyer who buys a lot of games - which a lot of us do.

If you were to print cardboard counters for board games, it would cost something like $400.04 for the first sheet, and $0.04 for every sheet after that.  If 500 sheets were made, the total cost would be $420.  The average cost would be $0.84 a sheet.  If you can only sell 100 sheets, you'd need to sell them for $4.20 a piece to break even financially.

Is that not what I said?
<br/>
The one-time-cost for ASIC masks is about 100k USD or so. Sure, it is a lot of money, but when you realize that N sell millions of GBAs, the ASIC mask cost per GBA becomes insignificant. And the nice thing about ASICs is that the cost per produced unit is really low compared to alternatives such as FPGA and/or ASSP. The only catch is that your production volume must be large enough, otherwise the cost of the masks become significant (Volume is obviously no problem for Nintendo).
<br/>
The cost for the ASIC is probably just a few dollars total. The most expensive parts in the GBA is most probably the LCD and the assembly costs (alot of manual work is required to assemble a GBA).
<br/>
For the GBA SP, the battery is probably even more expensive than the LCD, explaining the cost difference. The SP also has more plastic parts, resulting in more manual assembly work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is.  I wanted to illustrate with numbers.
