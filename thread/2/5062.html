    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Get It Now is the way Verizon Wireless and other BREW mobile phone network operators keep homebrew software and media off their networks. The official justification from the proponents of BREW technology is that requiring all apps on the phone to be obtained through the network provider enhances the security of the network because the phones don't have an MMU for proper virtual memory, but the truth is that it's just a cash cow. I assume that stuart2062 thought that many of us who are interested in GBA homebrew development would be interested on breaking barriers to homebrewing on other platforms.

I have plenty of things that I don't need (even lots of junk that I have absolutely no use for ;) ), but none of them costs me a large monthly fee and a one/two-year commitment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My cell phone costs $15 more per month than the most basic landline would cost, and it has a number of cost-saving features the landline does not provide (such as free long distance within the US) that easily mitigate the price difference. And I don't need to pay an $80 "installation fee" every time I move.
<br/>
<br/>
Carrying it means I never need to worry about being trapped on a highway somewhere if my car breaks down, or not being able to call emergency services if I'm on the scene of an accident (which has happened in the past). And if I'm stuck in the city somewhere late at night I don't need to worry about finding a phone booth and change to call a cab.
<br/>
<br/>
There are other tradeoffs, obviously: I only have the one handset and can't use it for a modem or faxing, and the signal quality - while good enoguh - is ultimately poorer than a land line. But these are personal/lifestyle decisions.
<br/>
<br/>
I could care less about Get It Now, and my camera has a bunch of features I didn't pay for, find excessive and will never, ever use (such as a camera, FFS), but these do not make it an unwise choice. Do I <span style="font-style: italic">need</span> the cell phone? Hell no; no more than I <span style="font-style: italic">need</span> a land line. In fact, I <span style="font-style: italic">hate</span> having a cell phone on a very primal, anti-corporate level. But I would be a fool to deny the convenience or cost-effectiveness it affords me.

Just to clarify, the I meant the comment about "intelligence and reason" specifically in reference to the line about people (none on this board that I'm aware of) who get phones just because "Well, everyone else has one!".
<br/>
<br/>
poslundc: If you use a cell phone *instead of* a landline rather than *in addition to* a landline, then I can understand a potential value. Although there's still some other drawbacks:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">free long distance within the US</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> True, but landline has unlimited free incoming calls from anywhere in the world at any time and any day. So that makes it a balance of how often you call long distance vs. how often you receive calls. I've seen maybe one cell provider that advertised "free incoming calls", but that was only on their higher-priced plans (and I'm not sure about daytime/day of week restrictions.)
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">And I don't need to pay an $80 "installation fee" every time I move.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> But if you ever need to change cell phone providers, you have to 1. replace your phone (because your old one won't work with a different provider even if they're on 100% compatible networks) and 2. Either wait up to two years (max) or pay a few hundred dollars early-termination fee. Although, if you move a lot within the same area, I can understand a potential savings.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus, if you dislike the companies so much, it's silly to keep giving them money unless the diffence in value is extremely significant. That's the kind of stuff that keeps companies like Walmart in business (I've heared of so many cases where a Walmart tried to open up in a town, the locals complained and did everything they could to keep it out, and guess what happened once it finally did open? All the former protesters started shopping there anyway.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
