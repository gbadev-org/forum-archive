<br/>
So, was homebrew ever actually done on the N64?

Links please :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As I understand a lot of people wanted MP3 and DVD player apps for it (I guess they planned to do some hardware hacking?), so I suppose it was mainly in the hopes of using it as a media center.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There were some people, which made some demos for the N64. Most of the source of that you can find on <a class="postlink" href="http://dextrose.com/" target="_blank">http://dextrose.com/</a>.
<br/>
But most of the demos are based on the official Development Kit from Nintendo. If you search with google you can surely find it.
<br/>
But you can also try some of the free assemblers or a GNU based MIPS C-Compiler. But without the official librarys it's almost impossible to get some 3D stuff working.

<br/>
You can find some informations about Backup Systems here. <a class="postlink" href="http://n64.icequake.net/" target="_blank">http://n64.icequake.net/</a>
