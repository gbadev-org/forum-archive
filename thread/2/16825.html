<br/>
To some extent, I believe so.  Things have definitely slowed down a bit.
<br/>
<br/>
Although I don't REALLY understand his attitude about it...do people really come to nds homebrew (and other console homebrew) because they think that's the way to break into getting published?  I would have thought Tepples would have known better.  I thought most of us showed up because it was fun to develop for in spite of (or even somewhat because of) the fact that Nintendo hates (or at least has no respect for) what we're doing.  
<br/>
<br/>
But it sounds, from his rant on his blog, like he expected Nintendo to finally give in and let him publish Lockjaw or some theoretical 4-player party game or something.  And when that didn't happen, he got disgusted and quit homebrew.  Doesn't make any sense to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think the DS scene will get a big pick-up again if/when the DSi becomes programmable. Most of the learning will have been done (due to RE-ing the DS) but there will be extra possibilities due to the extra resources on the machine etc.
<br/>
<br/>
My housemate has a DSi so I guess I could program that if they hack it, but I doubt my g/f would approve of me spending so much time doing that :)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not saying it can't be a way in.  But not the way Tepples seemed to want it to be.  His common statement (made as much or more on slashdot than here) was that he didn't like that Nintendo only accepted studios with past industry experience, secure facilities, etc.  This made it sound like he expected to be able to get published HIMSELF, as opposed to getting a job with an existing company.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On another note I'm going to be leaving my job at the end of October, so if I can secure my rent for a few months afterwards then I will have time for a mini project of some sort, which should be fun. I've destroyed my EZ Flash, so I just hope I can get a decent replacement.
<br/>
<br/>
If you <span style="font-weight: bold">really</span> want to produce your own Nintendo title, it might be best to secure a deal with a publishing / development firm to "handle" your accounts and let you operate as your own self-managed branch. You pay your own "wages", etc., pay for rental space of a desk in their office and operate from there.
<br/>
<br/>
In fact there are probably a number of organisations with a spare [secured] office that could do with the extra income. Now out of those organisations there must be a fair amount that are software / game developers.

I think December 2008 is when my boss at work started to push me from part time to full time. That leaves less time for hobbies.
<br/>
<br/>
One big reason that I ever got into the GBA in the first place was because it was a handheld. If you were around for <a class="postlink" href="http://pineight.com/donate/progress/" target="_blank">donate progress</a>, you'll remember how hesitant I was to get into the DS. But a couple years ago, Asus introduced an affordable subnotebook PC. I bought one shortly before December 2008.
<br/>
<br/>
I never expected Lockjaw to get published. It is, and always has been, only a training tool for Tetris players.
<br/>
<br/>
I've since learned that there is one intended route to getting published:
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>Develop a portfolio of titles for Microsoft Windows or for Mac OS X. </li><li>Use this portfolio to land an internship at a licensed video game developer. </li></ol>
<br/>
My complaint on Slashdot is that I would have to leave the state and move hundreds of miles away from anyone I know to do step 2.

Good to hear you're still alive and kicking. I do know what you mean though about the having-to-move thing. I work for a big games company in London - however if I were to move elsewhere in the country I'd have to do a massive commute to get to any half-decent studio since many of them are concentrated in the south-east area. If only I could work from home and make games there like you could twenty years ago :(

Excellent.  I'm all for independent developers pushing to get multiplayer console-style games back on the radar for PC games (not meaning windows, I mean as opposed to consoles).  The way to do it, in my opinion, is to just make excellent games, which is looks like you're gearing up to try to do.

I wish I could agree with you.  I have a G1.  But, I see two different mind sets when it comes to Android Market vs. iPhone App Store.
<br/>
<br/>
People with iPhones are used to being screwed.  They paid a crap load of money for an Apple product, they are paying the highest price for a data plan to be able to use the iPhone, and they are used to paying for any little app they want to add to the phone.
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, people with a G1 (or Android phone in general) have a "free"er mindset.  (please correct me if I'm wrong) I feel that Android phone users aren't spending near as much as iPhone users on installing additional apps.  Aside from touchdown (which is $25 btw) I haven't spent another dime on a game/app.
<br/>
<br/>
If you read the reviews, it's clear that a lot more Apps are free for android that you have to pay for on the iPhone.  I just recently had this conversation with a software developer, and although I hate Apple, I suggested they spend the $3000 and write an app for the iPhone vs wasting time with the Android market.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, in the future, the Android market could become the new place for millionaire developers to release awesome software, but at this point, it seems more of a "free" for all.
<br/>

I'm optimistic about the Android in the long term, but I think iPhone OS is where you want to be now, given the ~45 million unit install base.  (So far as I can tell, Android has an install base of a few million.)

I'm optimistic about the Android in the long term, but I think iPhone OS is where you want to be now, given the ~45 million unit install base.  (So far as I can tell, Android has an install base of a few million.)

I was looking at it more from a cost for the developer.  Or, how much one would have to risk out of pocket to even become an iPhone developer vs Android developer.  The fact that apple requires their hardware to develop, you have to invest a small fortune on a computer (by todays standards) just to consider developing for the iPhone.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think you hit the nail on the head when you identified the Apple user demographic VS the Android user demographic.  It is generally easier to sell to the more money than brains crowd than the more brains than money crowd.  But, this requires dealing with... Apple...

Wonderful observation.  Barriers of entry also weed out most of the unqualified riffraff.  The really qualified people can always get around them somehow.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Plus Apple have a trusted payment service and have created a culture in which the act of purchasing is an expected behaviour. People can already pay for and play games on their phones through Java and on their PC - amongst other platforms - but the "apple store" creates a great environment for developers to make money for their games.
<br/>
<br/>
Consider the Mac an investment / development kit.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it's possible that the install base for android will be bigger than the iPhone in the coming years. What I'm more interested to see is whether serious developers will choose Android in large numbers. From talking to some guys who build iPhone apps professionally, they all say that the big draw of the iPhone is that the hardware is so consistent. There's a fear that there will be so many different types of Android handsets that it will be expensive to develop for.
<br/>
<br/>
So in that way the iPhone is like the GBA... if it works on your hardware you can be assured that it will work on everyone's.
<br/>
<br/>
That being said, the number of potential customers in the iPhone store is huge, but so is the competition. The Android marketplace could be an interesting opportunity for a new development team. (Make a game about zombies on the Android and there are a handful of titles to compete with. On the iPhone there are hundreds.)
