    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, im new to the site and was wondering if anyone can answer some general questions. Because of this forum having a strong community i think i can get the best answer if i ask here. Well here goes....
<br/>
<br/>
1) My first question would be what are the best programs on the net, to understand how to use emulators on a DS? Im asking this because i am intersetted in getting emulators for my Nintendo DS, to play NES,SNES,GB,GBC games, etc,etc. But am not sure which is the best program to get them and which devices i should get for them.
<br/>
<br/>
2) Also i heard that some devices and programs can play movies, Music Videos, and MP3's on the DS is this true? And if so what are the best devices/Programs to get for it. Im ready to invest some money in the DS to get it as powerful and fun as i can.
<br/>
<br/>
Well i guess you can take my questioning as a desire to be able to play emulator games from other systems, such as SNES,NES,GB,GBC, etc. And to be able to play movies,music, music videos on the Nintendo DS. However i never used an emulator program so im a complete noob to this, im also not sure which is the right devices to use for the DS, to get it to do what i want it to do.
<br/>
<br/>
I just really like the idea of being able to play a huge libary of different games from different systems, on one portable handheld, and being able to watch movies, mvs, and music, on it as well. I have read up a bit on emulators and flashcards, and certain devices that says they can achieve this. But i want the experts that hang around this forum's opinion since i know they know what they are talking about.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in Advance.<br/>_________________<br/>...................</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It looks like you're asking for:
<br/>
a) A program to understand emulators
<br/>
b) NES, SNES, GB etc. emulators for your DS
<br/>
c) A program to get the emulators
<br/>
d) Devices to run the emulators
<br/>
<br/>
Well, you can get emulators for the DS from the web, so the answer to (b) and (c) is Internet Explorer, Mozilla FireFox, or the Netscape web browser.  As for (d) and your second question, there are several devices.  You will need to use something like a PassMe to allow your DS to play homebrew apps.  Then you need something to store your homebrew apps on.  You can use a GBA flash cart, but that's recommended if you're only making your own homebrew.  It's much cheaper and easier to play MP3's and videos off something like a GBA Movie Player with upgraded firmware and something like Moonshell (a great program) running on it.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I hope this was somewhat useful.  It's kinda hard to answer questions when they are worded in a confusing manner, so please try to ask your questions in the future with one clearly written sentance whenever possible.  It makes it much easier.  For example, try this instead of your first question:
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to know more about how emulators work on a DS, so can someone tell me where I can go for technical documents and source code?
<br/>
<br/>
Whoever reads that knows (a) you want to learn about emulators for the DS, and (b) you want to learn from technical documents and by reading the source from working emulators.  Hope that little tip was helpful, too!
<br/>
<br/>
:)
