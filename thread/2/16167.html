From all your posts here, and on slashdot (And probably other forums that I don't read), it's pretty clear that you feel strongly about this.  So here's your chance to go all out and talk about it without being offtopic:  Why is this so important to you?  (I'm not asking in an aggressive, antagonistic way -- I don't want to start a war, I'm asking because I want to understand).  
<br/>

And another corollary question:  I can understand being disappointed that the current state of video games is this way, but what is your goal by bringing it up so often?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because I am developing a multiplayer video game that would not benefit from a separate view per player (think Bomberman or Smash Bros.), and once it's finished, I want to know how I can distribute it in such a way that it will get played. I can't go the normal console route because I'm not yet in a position where I can afford a lawyer, an accountant, a multi-year lease on office space, and all the other trappings of a business. I can't really go the PC route because conventional wisdom is that a PC's monitor is too small for more than one player. (Or does conventional wisdom not know jack?)

I myself own a 32" monitor made by Vizio. But that won't help me reach the existing installed base of PCs with 17" and 19" monitors if players would have to buy a new monitor or buy a second desktop PC to install next to the TV just to play my game. I guess laptops might work, as those can be moved next to a TV, and many of them even come with a built-in SDTV scan converter. Or I'll have to put more effort into the 2-player cooperative campaign so that people try my game and <span style="font-style: italic">then</span> figure out how to set up a bigger monitor for 2-on-2 or 4-player deathmatch.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While I understand your fears, I think that the market of people who are likely to discover your game are also willing to try it on a single monitor PC.
<br/>
<br/>
When I was in college, Armagetron and Liero were extremely popular, and they were perfect examples of the kind of game you are talking about.  And at the time, bigger monitor were even more rare.  (I remember having 4 people crowded around a single keyboard on a tiny desk with a 15 inch monitor playing Armagetron)  Now, Super Mario War is also popular in the same way.
<br/>
<br/>
While it's true that it's unfortunate that there's not as much of a standard of doing what you are talking about, I believe that if you make the game, and it's fun, then people will play it, even on a smaller monitor.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe Tepples' fears are much more likely to be accurate. It's not just the size of the screen because plenty of people play multiplayer games (including 4-player goldeneye) on 14 inch TV screens with a much lower resolution than any SVGA monitor. The difference with doing it on a console and a PC has much to do with how people are used to interracting with a pc.
<br/>
<br/>
When I first got introduced to emulation (with the GB, NES and SNES), we were fine sharing one pc keyboard to play a game; but there just aren't many people willing to get used to playing games like that (ever tried sharing a keyboard that operates as two 12-button SNES controllers?). Of course that wouldn't be a worry with switch gaming.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus you will find TV's are often positioned for seating many from a comfortable playing distance, whilst PC's are often positioned to seat one.
<br/>
<br/>
Hardcore, enthusiastic and experimental gamers are more likely to try and learn your game; but it is written that a man who looks to the clouds and the way of the wind never plants seeds - i.e. just do it and stop looking at obstacles (obviously doing this with some wisdom, it isn't encouraging completely thoughtless action).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not being funny but I've never bought any of the above in order to play a single game, and I doubt that anybody ever would. Shouldn't you be looking to use hardware that people already have or am I missing the point? I'm fairly sure most people (who would be interested in having a 4 player game - without knowing the details of said game) own a desktop or laptop PC of some variety.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I don't think anything <span style="font-style: italic">requires</span> a 32" HDTV, that is a bit excessive and I for one would definately not be willing to buy one for a single game. If smash bros works fine for 4 players in a single viewport on a standard definition 19" TV (and lower) I'm sure you will have no problems fitting your game around that (again without knowing the details of your game).

Since you already stated you don't have the resources to produce a comercial console game, I am assuming you wont have a great budget for the marketing to reach your potential audience.

To the extent everyone is on a different computer, the friend can stay at home and use their own.  Admittedly, this makes things different.

For what it is worth, aiming for the lowest possible required system specs is good probably a good idea if you want to appeal to a larger userbase.  This way you could do 2P networked play on non-"gaming" machines (ie, mom's box that is set up to do email and the internet).

I looked in a local computer store today, and <span style="font-style: italic">none</span> of the desktop PCs on display had a composite or S-video jack on the back.

I've considered that, but it wouldn't work too well in my own extended family. In one household, there are more gamers than gaming PCs. Or the kids might be required to stay at a sitter's house while the parents are at work. (You guessed it: I'm the sitter.) Or home might be 669 miles away to a nuclear family who is in town for the extended family's annual reunion. In addition, the Internet adds noticeable latency that isn't seen on a single PC or even on a LAN; ask anyone who has tried playing Brawl online with the sort of "economy tier" Internet connection that Comcast used to criticize in <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Slowskys" target="_blank">its TV ads</a> but now offers.

I will make my own game console system (I think I posted about it before) (I will make a new wiki using software I wrote myself, because the wiki providers I used before are acting stupid), it is 2. but will also display a warning message if it is not digitally signed by my company, but you can still run it anyways (it will ask you to push CANCEL to not run, or ACCEPT to run it anyways), and there will also be a option to suppress the warning message. Also source-codes of everything built-in to the system (including the hardware) will be available and license by GNU GPL v3 or later, so if you don't like it then you can change it (but external software (i.e. games) is not necessarily license by GNU GPL, but some might be). It will have other thing also that I think is problem with other game console system (and with other computers!) but will be fix on mine.
<br/>
<br/>
For sure many thing is game written for Windows computer or another computer, you have to have the correct version of operating system it isn't Free Software. Make the operating system Free Software and more secure. You can also use virtual machine such as Java or XY-MINI or NES/Famicom emulator (for the purpose of my game console system, a modified NES/Famicom emulator (meaning homebrew .NES file is converted to a new format by filling in a few unused fields in the header) might be called FamilyVM, avoiding trademarks and other stuff, and allowing use of more buttons on game-controller), etc. Possibly someone will make extension for Mozilla to allow use wii remote on Mozilla web-page like you can on Nintendo Wii, with multi-player games. Or, make the VM run by javascript that is also cross platform with different computer/controller, so it work in many different system.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Prompting the user to add a title's cert sounds reasonable. I'd also recommend running each game in something like a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD_jail" target="_blank">FreeBSD jail</a> so that one game can't screw up another game.

But then how do you plan to get your console into the hands of the masses, so that professional developers will find it potentially profitable? We're back to the problem of the first post: there aren't enough deployed units of your console, just like there aren't enough deployed units of slim PC + scan converter or slim PC + monitor bigger than 21".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there really anything that can be done about that though? I mean it's just the way it is, the console companies arn't going to change it, and there's nothing indie developers can realistically do to change it, that leaves PC manufacturers.
<br/>
<br/>
I also don't think that you need a slim PC or a greater than 21" monitor for any PC game suited to multiplayer <span style="font-style: italic">parties</span>. I have personally played 4 player splitscreen coop on Serious Sam (a first person shooter) comfortably on a 17" monitor - albeit in cramped conditions. But still, you are going to need pretty motivated people to want to play a local 4 player game which means the game needs to be damn good in the first place and worth the effort (of getting everybody in the same place at the same time). If people want to play 4 player local games, then they will find a way! I don't think the developer needs to worry too much about screen sizes or hardware setups - just let people set things up how they want them, besides the problem of TV sizes doesn't dissapear on consoles, you can't gurantee people to have huge and/or HDTVs.
<br/>
<br/>
Also zzo38, the thought of a fully open source console is nice, but you go on to mention digital signing, wouldn't this be contradictory? I mean if we had the source code to a console, wouldn't it be easy to fake digital signatures or remove the need for them completely? Perhaps a whitelist approach to allowed software would be better, this way no software could be run without being on the list (commercial software would be added automatically through software updates) and commercial software would require the prompt to be accepted once, adding it to the list. Also it sounds like there would be an issue with piracy equal or greater than that of the PC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'd also recommend running each game in something like a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD_jail" target="_blank">FreeBSD jail</a> so that one game can't screw up another game.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">Something like FreeBSD jail seems good to do so. Thanks for telling me that. But, I am planning to use Linux not FreeBSD. Maybe there is a similar thing that can be made in Linux though. Anyways, I will figure it out.
<br/>
<br/>
I mean by the warning message that some titles might be completely unsiged, you can't add it's cert if it is unsigned. Of course the configuration option (set by the user) can suppress the warning screen, but digital signatures are signed with private keys by my company (and possibly other licensors also, in case for example some company wants to make a pornography game, we might assign another company to be the licensor for porngraphy games), and it will check the public key stored in the console, if it it matches then it won't display the warning message.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, in addition to the warning message, there will be trademark rules as well, so that someone who doesn't pay and have their software checked for quality by us and have it digitally signed are not allowed to use our trademarks in certain ways in order to sell the software. This way, people can know whether or not it is certified or not. Some people will want to purchase only certified software while other people won't care.

Of course, the user of the system (or anyone who clones it, but they can't use our trademarks without our permission) can remove the need for digital signature by modifying the source-code and recompiling (or just change the configuration to suppress the warning message, which is easier), but other people who write third-party software won't be able to do so unless they sell the hardware as well (again, without the trademark).

Probably for the second one you mean unlicensed software would require a prompt, while commercial software wouldn't require a prompt? Anyways, I will use non-symmetric digital signatures which means you don't fake a digital signature (and people that do fake it will be sued for trademark infringement). But, possibly I can have a whitelist also, and when it displays the prompt for unlicensed software it can optionally add it to the whitelist when accepted (possibly depending on configuration setting).

If everyone does it differently instead of everyone the same, then it is harder to crack the copy protection on these systems. And, of course, there can also be hardware copy protection by USB security dongles (I will add a driver for it so that they can be used if anyone wants to use them). And another things that can be done with hardware copy protection, is that if someone uses a copy of the DVD without the dongle (for example to share with your friends/neighbours) then they will get only a demo version without all the functionality, and then they can decide whether or not they like it before purchasing a copy for themself also. And, of course, copyright laws still apply also, even if there isn't any hardware or software in the computer that enforces it.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
