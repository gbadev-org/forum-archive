    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No. It's kind of like Equinox (SNES), but the main character is a large, light-purple bubble. It was a computer game, but I'm not sure if it was PC or some other system such as Amiga. It was unoficially ported to GBA some time around January (I could be wrong). There was a news posted about it at Zophar's Domain, which is where I originally learned of it (though it seems there's something wrong in their database system, because it won't let me browse through their older news).
<br/>
<br/>
The game does exist, because I had it (in GBA ROM form). But I lost it in a HDD crash, and now I'm looking for it again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
