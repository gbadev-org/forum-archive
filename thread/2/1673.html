    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all,
<br/>
success-hk is out of stock of the ezf-advance 256m. I am thinking about buying one but am wondering how long it might take to arive if i preorder it. Has anyone had experience preordering an out of stock item from success-hk? If so how long did it take to ship and did they charge you before or after it actually shipped? Any advice would be apriciated.
<br/>
<br/>
p.s. if anyone has one they would like to sell I'd buy it.
