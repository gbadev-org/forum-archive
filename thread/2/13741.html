    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm having problems with setting up dsdoom. so far i have unzipped all the files in the dsdoom.rar into the root folder of my R4DS sd card, and got a shareware version of doom and put the doom1.wad in my root as well.

now this is where it doesn't work. when i run it, it says...
<br/>
<br/>
 ....
<br/>
 IWAD found : /doom.wad

 Checking IWAD : IWAD tag /doom.wad not present

does anyone know how to solve this problem i have?

I wonder why there's so much homebrew code that isn't DLDI compatible, everything uses DLDI pretty much.

On a side note, I'd also like to see some software that can read from both the slot-1 using a DLDI and slot-2 like a GBAMP at the same time, Chishm said it was possible but I've never seen it implemented...I'd try myself but even when I follow the tutorial on the libfat page it gives me compile errors.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

No, DLDI files are used to patch the .nds file on a PC. The only reason it works on your R4 is because they use automatic patching now, which reportedly doesn't <span style="font-style: italic">always</span> work. Read up more on the DLDI wiki if you're interested...<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

huge chunk of the homebrew was written prior to slot1 cards existing

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Indeed, DLDI only came into being on Christmas 2006.  Pretty much anything written before that date has no chance of having DLDI support unless it's been updated since then to add it in.  Before DLDI, you had to recompile your program for every new device added to libfat, so even if you have a slot-2 device you'll find some homebrew files that only work with one or two old devices, like the GBAMP CF and Supercard CF for instance.  From my understanding, CF was more popular than SD in the beginning (aided by the ease of use of the GBAMP using Chishm's hacked firmware), though SD has gained popularity since then.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

*Ahem* Okay lets take a crack at this...
<br/>
There are a bunch of different types of hardware for running homebrew, correct? Now, some games need to access the filesystem (folders and files that are separate from the program; the .nds file) In order for it to be possible to access the filesystem on a given card, you need a driver. Similar to a driver on your PC, drivers tell the system how to work the hardware, in computer language. (A bunch of numbers) Since there are a bunch of different cards and stuff for running homebrew, each program that wanted to use the filesystem would have to know all of the different instructions for using the hardware (drivers) for each and every device. DLDI solves this program, .dldi files are written separately with the instructions for each device. When you have a program that needs to use the filesystem (sometimes called FAT, because this is the specific type of filesystem used) you use a program usually on a PC to patch the program (.nds) with the DLDI driver (.dldi) that is written specifically for your card. But, only if this program is DLDI compatible, meaning it uses FAT (the filesystem) and it has been made with a more recent version of libfat. Example is wolf3D for DS, it was originally programmed when DLDI wasn't around, so you can't patch it with a .dldi file, because it wasn't made to be compatible.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the second part, I dunno where half-life came into play, but there are no half-life engine games for DS. The source code for half-life is not available. Doom runs on the Doom engine, which does have source code available. There is also <a class="postlink" href="http://quakeds.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">QuakeDS</a>, which uses the quake engine. (the Half-Life engine is based mostly on the Quake engine, with a small bit of the Quake 2 engine.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 10px; line-height: normal">I always wondered how many lines of code from Quake are still in the Half-Life 2 engine...</span><br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

You need the official .wad file for it, which you can get from the official install, if you have the game, install it and then look for the doom.wad file in your install directory and just replace it with the one on your card.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

I'm pretty sure Doom2 will work but I've never tried it myself, Ultimate Doom is what I've got currently, and it played and saved fine up until it crashed every time on a certain level on the last episode... can't remember it though.

I'm not sure why saving is crashing it. You mentioned you have an R4, I haven't heard of any writing problems with DLDI on the R4, I know they exist with other cards.

That's because the ordinary R4 driver leaves the initialization of the SD card to the card's firmware, just as scsd_moon does. Neither supports pak swapping, partly for that reason<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
