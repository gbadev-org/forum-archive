    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GameGizmo.com is selling a GBA peripheral called the "Game Wallet".  It connects to the GBA's serial port and can copy programs from SmartMedia flash cards to GBA flash cartridges.
<br/>
<br/>
But does it work without a flash cartridge?  That is, can it transfer a .mb program directly from SmartMedia to the GBA without having to copy it to a cartridge first?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't think you can use it without flash cart :(  Would've been nice if you could get direct access to it somehow because without it it's about as much use as carrying a few flash carts around with you (although cheaper in the long run).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes you can use the game wallet to run .mb files directly from the smart media cart, you just have to name the .mb program you want to launch :
<br/>
b@@t_gb@.mb
<br/>
<br/>
And that's it...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, you can use the multi-boot method, but then you're restricted to the internal RAM.  A flash cartridge is required to play any game/program that requires more space (ie. comercial games).
<br/>
<br/>
I am in the process of designing something similar to the GameWallet that wouldn't need a flash cartridge.  It would allow users to play games/programs up to 32MB from a SmartMedia card.  There's a post in the Hardware section ("SmartMedia to GBA adapter") with more information.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
