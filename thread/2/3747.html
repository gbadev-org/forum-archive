You're probably not looking hard enough. There is a site that I looked at that gave a good description of the things you can do with your flash cart. Unfortunately, it includes both the illegal and legal things, so I can't say it on these boards. I would happily e-mail you the web address of the site though.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
