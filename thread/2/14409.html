<br/>
<br/>
First question, if you use routine X, which is under GPL2, in your program, can you specify that routine Y if used on its own is to be under a separate license? Or that if someone removes routine X and all the code that uses it, the result is then under a different license?
<br/>
<br/>
Second, I'm looking for a license that basically just says if you use my code, you have to do two things:
<br/>
1) Mention in your program and/or documentation that you used my code, and
<br/>
2) provide a copy of the version of my code you used upon request.
<br/>
<br/>
The idea behind #2 is that if you use my code and modify it, you have to release that modified version, but not the entire source code of the program. (If you write routine X and use a modified version of my routine Y, you have to provide a copy of that modified routine Y, but not necessarily X.) Is there an existing license that covers these terms?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'll get the first thing out of the way: Nothing you read on gbadev.org is legal advice; it's just a starting point for your discussion with legal counsel.

<br/>
This works if the license on routine Y and the rest of the program is GPL compatible, which pretty much means a GNU GPL with some exceptions (such as the GNU Lesser General Public License), a FreeBSD style permissive license or the Sleepycat license, this works.

Probably the clearest way to do this would be to place routine X in its own file, with a GPL copyright notice at the start. The other routines can go in other files with appropriate copyright notices. I don't know what the full implications are with this though - I assume the program/library would be GPL2 overall.

There are some guidelines here for using different licensed code in the same project that may help: [url=http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/gpl-non-gpl-collaboration.html]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The problem is- is your license compatible with the GPL/LGPL.  You could put a compatibility clause in that makes it compatible with the GPL/LGPL license if any of the code is used in conjunction with GPL/LGPL code.
<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing magical about legal writing... it's a lot like programming actually.  You get what you write and exactly what you write.  If you want a contract or a license to work a certain way, write it down.  That having been said, a lawyer should know the laws and know how to write a solid contract, so it is a good idea to run your license past a lawyer before you go live with it.  Lawyers run $100+ an hour.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Realisticly speaking, you are probably safe to pick something and then watch you code disappear into the depths of obscurity.  You could use a normal GPL (more or less what you want), or you could release it to the public domain and ask that people send code upon request (cannot be enforced, but it probably won't need to be.)  You could also write your own.  Writing you license with the motivation behind will probably be good enough unless you have wild plans.
