    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In the next release, I will not be providing documentation on how to get a working installation of System 6.0.8 on your DS for users running Linux and Windows PCs.
<br/>
<br/>
All of the new documentation will be specific to Mac OS X and possible Mac OS 9.1 since it is next to impossible to get anything working properly due to the incompatibilities of the two platforms.
<br/>
<br/>
While it is possible to successfully install System 6.0.8 on a PC, the process is complicated and even when complete most mac downloads will become corrupt once they are downloaded and before you can transfer them to the disk image.
<br/>
<br/>
I realize that the user base for a Macintosh emulator on the DS is extremely small but I fear this move will cut it down even further.
<br/>
If anyone has any ideas how to get PC users up and running and able to install software using free tools, let me know.
<br/>
<br/>
PearPC is also an option for installing Mac OS X on your PC, but you would have to purchase a copy of Mac OS X which I doubt too many people would want to do.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a shame too, there are so many fun games that run on the Macintosh Plus but again, the user base is extremely small.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
