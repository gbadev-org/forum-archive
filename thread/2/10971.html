A HMD would be nice but that price is way too cheap. But someone should hint Nintendo about this anyway. I don't mind these fake rumors ;)

They still could patch games to use alternate input controllers (e.g. HMD-tracking)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by darkfader on Thu Aug 31, 2006 7:47 am; edited 4 times in total</span></div>

The text does line up though and I saw a few differences when differentiating the layers but that could also be because of JPEG artifacts perhaps.

So these papers came out of a wastebin? And wouldn't a photocopier hide the wrinkles much less? The text looks all straight.

About that HMD... I just recall that they did have something at E3. This is an interesting news page: <a href="http://www.3001ad.com/currentnews.cfm?c=v&amp;n=39" target="_blank">http://www.3001ad.com/currentnews.cfm?c=v&amp;n=39</a>

Maybe it went in the bin that also accepts banana peels and other non-shred-able items.  People are people- they make mistakes (if that's what you'd want to call this).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, but this is not about the ease of use, but about the inhibition threshold of picking it up and using it. By making the controller look intentionally like a remote control, i.e. a device that everybody is used to, Nintendo wanted to take away the "fear" of non-gamers. Now, by putting an HMD next to the controller, they would achieve exectly the opposite. I mean, however nice it might look, it's not going to look like anything your mother uses.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the images and sound could probably not be transmitted wirelessly to the HMD, so there would be a cable to the Wii. Now imagine yourself standing in your living room wearing this helmet and swinging the Wiimote around. At some point you will stumble over the cable and pull the HMD off your head or accidentially beat up other people, or step on your cat.

However, as stated in the paper (fake or not) you wouldn't have to have the HMD to still play the game. It would be just an add on. You also have to think that Nintendo would work on some sort of HMD. They would improve the Virtual Boy. I don't remember any other console manufacture making something like this.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, if it's real.. I say good luck and hopefully it isn't toooooo expensive.  HMDs in my opinion, of which I own 2, have a pretty short life.  Unless there are a lot of games available to use them, fit and feeling is exceptional, and there is a real benefit to using it, like head tracking or 3D..  They become a nice paper weight very quickly.  Both of my HMDs are great quality (and were expensive at the time) and the feeling is OK for both of them.. but it doesn't take long for you neck to start hurting and games to lose the coolness factor when you are stairing at a couple of LCD screens 3 inches from your eyes.  Now, take that and add the multiple hours people spend playing their consoles.

The Wiimote works by a sensor bar mounted (or at least positioned) on a television, right? Well, with the HMD on, would it completely obscure your vision? If so, if you somehow get all mixed up, how could you really tell if you are pointing with it correctly?
