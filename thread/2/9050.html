I'm thinking of writing a language that compiles to a byte code for a virtual machine.

Writing a compiler is not same as writing an emulator/virtual-machines.  If you want to write a compiler, you might be interested in <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=8724&amp;highlight=compiler+book" target="_blank">this thread</a>.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm interested in compilers and emulators/VMs.  I doubt a single resource covers both of them, "Art of Computer Programming" aside.  Hence the new thread.
<br/>
<br/>
A compiler can be made that creates byte code X.  A VM can be made that reads byte code X.  What the VM does is an entirely different story.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was looking through the code of Nessie [for a lil bug fix a while back], and to cut a long story short the emulator works exactly how you would imagine an emulator to work. Straight forward interpretation of the bytecode; nothing out of the ordinary.
<br/>
<br/>
In order to get an emulator functioning would require no more knowledge than you already have. However an effecient one [on the other hand] may.
<br/>
<br/>
As you know, Java JITs. Some efficient emulators supposedly JIT. I'm guessing you want to JIT. If you have done network systems architecture [network io, synchronisation, memory models, cache etc] or are familiar with issues with each then you will have saved yourself much heartache and questions.
<br/>
<br/>
Emulation was discussed years ago here although I'm not sure at what scale. It may have possibly been more about hardware emulation, and I cannot think of a single search term to lift it up as I barely remember a single word in it.
<br/>
<br/>
I found <a class="postlink" href="http://fms.komkon.org/EMUL8/HOWTO.html" target="_blank">this</a>; but I'm sure you've come across all of these entries too. <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator" target="_blank">And nowadays wikipedia seems to be the place to search</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
