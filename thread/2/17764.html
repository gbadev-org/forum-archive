    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This should really be in the offtopic forum, not Announcements and Comments.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my list:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  Advance Wars
<br/>
2.  Advance Wars
<br/>
3.  Advance Wars
<br/>
4.  Ogre Tactics
<br/>
5.  Advance Wars

Really, I bought my GBA literally just to play advance wars.  I had purchased one before, didn't like any of the games, and sold it.  Then I played advance wars....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
4) Final Fantasy remakes (I prefer the originals)
<br/>
5) Mega Man Zero series (they are too hard for me, even much harder than good old NES games)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
