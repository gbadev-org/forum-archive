<br/>
I'm new to here. I thought I'd ask on this forum, because you deal with GBA everyday etc. :P
<br/>
<br/>
My problem is, I bought my Pokemon Emerald cart (name doesn't matter, really) a while ago. My girlfriend played it for 60 hours and now, it crashes randomly. Totally randomly. It never crashes at the same spot twice. I just play it and after 2-5 minutes, it crashes. It crashes just the way it crashes when you <span style="font-weight: bold">slowly</span> remove the cartridge when it's on, normally. Also, sometimes the cart doesn't boot after the Gameboy Advance logo. One time I even managed to turn the GBASP off by the software! After the GBA logo, it just switched off, just as I would normally switch the GBA to OFF (the screen went off etc., but the LED stayed green) I tested the cart on a GBA and on GBASP, I'm sure it's the cart, not the gameboys :P Other games work. Tried the lame methods - cleaning with isopropyl etc. Nothing works. Does anyone know what could fix it? Or had the same problem?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,
<br/>
