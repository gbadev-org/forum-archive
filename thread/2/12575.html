    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've realized that my videos are gone! I can't even find the part 5 I spent years searching for in every video shop known to man. And now I've got this crappy DVD collection with different voice overs that sound really really annoying. They changed it for no good reason with some irritating primitive sounding Pai - I feel cheated out of a good story.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried the American Amazon which seems to be the only ones who have the version with Eddie Frierson and Rebecca Fordstat's voice over, but they will not ship to the UK. And the only UK retailer who has replied to me is absolutely useless :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">3x3 Eyes is good stuff.  I don't think I saw the end of the anime.  The manga is ~40 volumes long.  If I ever get back into manga, I want to read it.  ...but 40 is a lot.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I felt a bit cheated by the ending of the manga. Bought _ALL_ volumes, and they didn't give a bit of closure. A bit like Parasite, which also picked the cowardly way out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I should probably save myself the time and not read it then.  Yuyuhakusho was in a position to contine, but it pulled a "X years later..." ending.  Everyone got together and talked about the important things that happened and the manga was over.  I was glad they stopped at about 20 instead of pushing to 40.

I've only watched the videos of it though. But after them all going missing I am disappointed by the lame voice over that manga treated us with - it is just awful and there was no need for a second English dub!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Legal reasons perhaps?  Maybe they were fans who wanted to do a dub.

Maybe I was a bit harsh. But it still didn't finish with what
<br/>
I would call an ending. There's no real happily ever after.

The couple just continues for a way to make Pai human...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">English dubs are fine when done right. My problem with 3x3 eyes is that there was a perfectly fine English dub that had similar dialogue to the original. But manga decided to create a new dub for the DVD collection that is absolutely crap. They make Pai sound far too primitive, the dialogue is a little annoying and I can't stand listening to it at all.
<br/>
<br/>
What hurts is that I had the original dub on VHS (video) but it seems to have gone missing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was really scared because I thought I was logged in, so when I went to pay it told me I wasn't logged in. Then when I tried to log in it was not bringing me back to the page and then every single bid was too low. I about 37 seconds left, and I increased by ?5 each time, I got the final bid 7 seconds to the end with ?25 ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
