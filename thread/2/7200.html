If I may, why do you want to hack? These forums are more involved with homebrew programs, but then again, others have changed some hardware aspects to help them with their homebrew stuff.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do you know anything about soldering? A good first hardware hack would be an adapter from the "standard" 1/8" 3.5mm miniplug to the DS's rectangular microphone jack. A software hack on top of that would be some sort of soft-modem that can convert data to audio and then back to data. Practical applications for a modem might include the ability to use other input devices with the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I resisted the urge last time, so I'll do it for you.  Typing "fewl" instead of "fool" is a great way to present yourself as an idiot.
<br/>
<br/>
monsoon, this is a technical forum, not a kiddie hacker chat room.  Learn how spell.  Use proper grammar to the best of your ability.  Actually, your grammar is fantastic.  All you are missing is capitalization and some punctuation.  Here are some spelling tips:
<br/>
<br/>
fewl = fool
<br/>
ne = any
<br/>
any more = anymore
<br/>
<br/>
Typing "fewl" instead of "fool" saves no keystrokes.  "ne more" is no less keystrokes "anymore".  I also don't recommend using "bro".  Try to make your posts look as professional as possible.  You never know who is reading them.  I will now step down from the seat of spelling and grammar police.

Was I too harsh?  The goal is not to scare monsoon (or anyone else) away.  Clearly he's smart, but nobody is too smart to ignore social conventions.  (You need to rich to do that, and if you ignore them then your wealth probably won't grow as fast as it could.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, not really too harsh. But I'm sure that you could have PMed monsoon, or simply asked monsoon to take more care with his spelling. Then if monsoon didn't listen, you could have said that. However, it was fine to say it.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, this has veered way off topic, and probably given monsoon a bad impression of the community. But I'm sure monsoon'll come to learn.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I really did not think that what you said was to harsh, the fact that you would want me to approach myself with a more profesional manner is fine,and i will agree, this has gone way off coarse from what we really intended this whole segment to be about, no worries if you guys have none, now lets get back to "develpment".
