    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently bought this game (a fake one i think) and i noticed major lag in some parts... is this normal or is it because its fake? I read somewhere that some games come with an extra 'processor' or something in the cartridge and this helps the game run faster, maybe the fake doesn't come with that? Can someone check this for me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If it does not come with an 'extra processor' then it most likely would not work. It could just be down to how the game plays. Go to a game shop and ask to play the game, that's the only thing you can do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
