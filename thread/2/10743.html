He's wondering what you (and the rest of the community) think the next Nintendo Handheld console will be like.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
GBAJAY: What do you mean by flip on its side?
<br/>
<br/>
What I want:
<br/>
<br/>
-Same style/size as the DSlite
<br/>
-DS and GBA compatable
<br/>
-2 super unscratchable touchscreens (some plates which go ontop, which can easilly be replaced and only cost $5 to buy replacements)
<br/>
-Stylus will also have another use --- being able to use it similarly to the controller on the Wii
<br/>
-Will be able to play the downloadable roms, like the Wii
<br/>
-Will be more compatible with Wifi
<br/>
-Global Positioning system, also see where your friends are</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A few GBA products require the link port or at least won't fit without it there, such as the e-Reader. Nintendo are not averse to losing support for a few accessories (which is what the browser really is) if it means reduced manufacturing costs.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

Nintendo could for go the functionality of the SLOT 2 Accessories without even having the slot there. What I see now as being the major accessories for this slot would be the rumble pack and the memory expansion.  Depending on the setup they could leave the slot there just not provide a port and have it directly wired to both the rumble pack and the memory card. That would save a little bit of money.  This would also through much work allow someone to figure out the connection and wire their own GBA port and flash their firmware to make use of it. 
<br/>
<br/>
What I would like to see since the Wii is going for retro consol gaming that the next gen handheld do the same provide compatibility for GB, GBC and multiplayer GBA games. I would be willing to pay a little extra for a device to play all my old games. and also provide a download service for the youth who missed out on the old times of handheld gaming.   
<br/>
<br/>
GBAJAY are you talking about having a sliding screen... that would be cool. I would like to add something to your design, have the second screen slide so the screens can be in 3 positions; side by side, sliding screen face out only, and sliding screen face down providing a protective shell for both screens.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
