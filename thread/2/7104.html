    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, 
<br/>
<br/>
first: I don't want to do ANY offence, just explain some things.
<br/>
And note: I'm <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> a pirate myself.
<br/>
<br/>
I some of the people (especially ones from the States and Western Europe) actually <span style="font-style: italic">hate</span> the pirates. 
<br/>
Why? Because they actually do damage to USA, UK and Japan industry? Because they don't respect what programmers made in all these months?
<br/>
Because they 'support terrorist crimes'?
<br/>
<br/>
Neither of these statements is true. There is no actual damage. Proved. The authors get all the pay they deserve. Proved. The statement that money bought with, for example a SuperCard, goes to Al Queda is just a piece bull***t.
<br/>
<br/>
Now find a Eastern European or somebody from Asia (except Japan) if he CAN afford a game per month. No? See that's the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Average pay in my country is about 700$ per month. In Norway for example it's about five times bigger. I assume it's the same in England or  the USA/Japan. I was watching american documentary with 'poor people of America'. 'Poor people' were crying because they earn ONLY 900 per month. Only?! Shit, Chinese averagely earn 100$ per month. It's not a miracle that there's so much pirates! 
<br/>
<br/>
What I want to say is: Stop screaming about how much you hate pirates, because they DON'T affect you (Lynx?!) in anyway. For an average Western person 50$ is dirt cheap. For a Chinese, it's all the month's food.
<br/>
<br/>
Think about it. 
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: I can afford only 1 game in about 2 months and still not pirating, but it's not the same (I don't think we're poor for <span style="text-decoration: underline">eastern</span> standards, it's just that I don't get enough money per month, I'm a kid).
<br/>
<br/>
P.P.S.: Sorry for the spelling mistakes and stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm sorry, but how did you actually prove that?
<br/>
There is a real damage on the game industry, and the fact that you say, that some people can't buy a game and won't pay for it unless it's "free", I see it every day in my country.
<br/>
It is true what you say that the average income per capita is higher in some countries, but it's also true that life is a lot more expensive in those countries.
<br/>
The "average" income in my country is around US$500-600, and that's what gets a normal person that has a "decent" job. The lowest legal wage is about US$280, and I must say that almost no one can live with that...
<br/>
The point I'm trying to make clear is that only a small fraction of the population of poor countries can afford to buy games, the rest just have to pirate them, and that's not a good thing, is a social problem: the creation of false necessities.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interesting arguments all around, but I have this to throw into the discussion -- the reason <span style="font-weight: bold">I</span> hate piracy.
<br/>
<br/>
Because whether or not the companies really lose much, they THINK they do, and end up imposing all sorts of annoying restrictions on us because of it.
<br/>
<br/>
Copy-protected cd's and games, annoying cd keys, firmware upgrades that prevent homebrew development, "broadcast flags", it's all the companies reacting to piracy, and taking away my ability to use their products.
<br/>
<br/>
If the pirates suddenly stopped, games would be much easier to install and play.  Cd's would be easier to rip to my computer.  Homebrew development would be easier.
<br/>
<br/>
And since we happening to all be people involved in homebrew, I think that gives us enough reason to hate piracy.
<br/>
<br/>
(and living here in China, it's pretty easy to see just how little all that copy-protection does.  If it exists, the Chinese have copied it. )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
What a ridiculously obtuse thing to say. As though the money they get paid were to get picked from the magic money tree or something, and that the actual, bottom-line financial success of the game had no impact on or relevance towards their future income.
<br/>
<br/>
Between you and warsong, I'm starting to think people should need a license (or at least minimal proof of an education that goes beyond having a fervent opinion based on an editorial read online somewhere) before they post such nonsensical political rants. An argument like this would've gotten laughed out of any of my <span style="font-style: italic">high school</span> classes.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, ad hominem isn't normally my style, but I can't really reduce myself to taking such arguments seriously. Get out of your parents' basement, folks, and take a class or read a newspaper or something. Or do we need to add a section Beginners FAQ on how to formulate a rational argument?

<br/>
<br/>
So... Just for fun.. let's ask some questions..  And I'll actually give facts I think everyone can agree with.
<br/>
<br/>
Piracy = Illegal?  Uhh.. Yup.. that's a fact.
<br/>
Murder = Illegal?  Uhh. Yup.. that's a fact as well.
<br/>
Theft = Illegal?  Well, in the USA.. that's a fact as well.
<br/>
<br/>
So..  Piracy.. doesn't effect me, so I shouldn't care..
<br/>
Gang bangers killing each other.. well, I don't live there.. it doesn't effect me, so I shouldn't care.
<br/>
People getting robbed every day.  Well.. I haven't been robbed lately, so it doesn't effect me and I shouldn't care..
<br/>
<br/>
So, basically.. what I read from your post.. is as long as I'm not the developer of the software being pirated.. I shouldn't care...  As long as I'm not the one being murdered.. I shouldn't care..  And as long as I'm not the one being robbed.. I shouldn't care.
<br/>
<br/>
If you pirate software, YOU ARE A THEIF!  You are stealing something you DID NOT pay for.  You might not be stealing it from me, but that doesn't mean I should stand by and watch.. because it doesn't affect me.  I'll tell you right now.. If I'm standing in a store, and see someone steal something.. I'm going to do something about it.  Why?  Because they are a theiving bastard!
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.. I make good money.. and I could afford to buy all the DS games I want..  I own 6 of them.. of which I really only like 2.  But, you know what?  I worked to get where I am.  Yeah.. I could have become a theif.. stole stuff my whole life, because it's easier then getting a job and being a respectable part of society..  But, you know what?  I chose not to..  I'm sure every warezing bastard will think this next sentense is the stupidest thing they have ever heard:
<br/>
<br/>
I've paid for things I didn't have to..  I've corrected mistakes people have made when they undercharge me..  Why?  Because IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO!  If I buy something and it rings up $8 and it's supposed to be $12, I tell them..  If I order a $10 meal, and $5 worth of sides, and they forget to charge me for the sides.. I tell them.  You know why?  Because that is how ___I___ choose to live my life.
<br/>
<br/>
So, if you don't like being called a warezing bastard, then don't be one.  If I state that I would like respectible homebrewers around me, or on my sites, and that makes you mad, then don't visit my sites.  Don't read my posts.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I hate thieves, and pirates = theives.  That's a fact.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#56614 - ScottLininger - Mon Oct 10, 2005 4:28 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interesting discussion. I'd like to hear more from the pirate side, since it's easy for folks who dislike piracy to stamp our feet and say how evil it is. (I for one promise not to yell at you if you can present a reasoned argument.)
<br/>
<br/>
I dislike pirates. It's an emotional thing for me, though, not necessarily a logical one that I've thought out and could argue. I certainly don't have any statistics to back up the idea that pirates put people out of work or damage the economy. As a creative professional, it just makes me angry that people might take my stuff without paying me for it.
<br/>
<br/>
But with that being said, I have to be honest and say that I haven't always been an angel in that regard.
<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, I pay for everything I use, from CDs to games to software. However, when I was in college, I couldn't afford to pay several hundred dollars for a Photoshop or Autocad or Premiere license key. If it wasn't for piracy, I wouldn't have been able to *touch* professional level tools like those, so I wouldn't have learned them, so I wouldn't have the career that I have today. Now that I get paid for using these tools, I pony up the license fees and feel good about doing so.
<br/>
<br/>
To this day, I feel that students should have access to FREE software for learning purposes, and I would be willing to provide such copies if I knew a student who needed them. Technically, this is piracy, so I guess I'm a hipocrite. :P

Yes, I totally agree with that. But it's because you CAN afford it.
<br/>
Some people just can't afford it. Why? Because there are people who are rich and want money and only money. That's what I find disgusting and there are not the poor to be blamed. They SHOULD have same rights as we get, right?
<br/>
<br/>
It's a shame that e.g. RIAA attacks 10 years old and demands 5 millions of dollars. But when they see someone who could afford everything he pirates, he is left intact. A shame.

And there is NO DAMAGE to the industry, because PRICES ARE RAISED.

Um, no.  Authors get paid both an upfront fee and ongoing Royalties.  When piracy bites into the royalties side of the equation, we authors get affected as well as the publisher - usually more so.  Publishers can usually setup their contracts such that the developers get a fee to almost cover their expenses, then they make their profit, then the remaining sales are divided between publisher and author side in some unbalanced way.
<br/>
<br/>
Piracy affects everyone.  The author through lost sales, the publisher through lost sales, the consumer through higher prices to make up for lost sales, the pirate through thinking that he's not really doing anything wrong.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's no better way to meet a new group of people than to argue with them! I think I heard that somewhere... or maybe not.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a problem with small-scale piracy.
<br/>
<br/>
First, I feel that whatever "damage" may be done by a person who downloads a game (or music, or a book, and so on) is partly offset by the increased exposure the product gets. On one hand they may not pay for the product, so that's a loss, but if they rave about it to some friends, or on a web forum, and two or three people go out and buy it because of that, then that's a win. Or a publisher might sense how popular the game was and decide to publish the developers' next game as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, much of the time when I download something illegally it's something I wouldn't have bought/couldn't find anyway. Sometimes I like a song I hear on the radio or heard about a game which sounds interesting, but I'm not willing to drop the cash on it to find out if its as good as it sounds. I think that's true for a lot of pirates. If the person wasn't or couldn't buy the product anyway then that's no loss to the developer or publisher. On the other hand, the downloader got what they wanted, and the folks trying to make money with the product recieved their favorable opinon (if the product is a good one). What's better? A person not buying a game (for whatever reason), or a person getting a copy for free? If the person who downloaded it likes it, they may even go out and buy the sequel, if it's easier to find or they have the cash at the time.
<br/>
<br/>
Third, downloading a game or music is different from "traditional" stealing because nothing is actually taken. So if thousands of people download a game you're not robbed of those thousands of copies. You've still got them, and they don't need replacing. You may not have made thousands more sales, but you haven't lost thousands of copies which you paid to produce. Downloading is "half as bad" (financially speaking anyway) as physical stealing.
<br/>
<br/>
I realize that there's a point at which you can't make money purely through mindshare. You do actually have to move product to eat. But I don't think that small-scale pirates have a large negative impact on earnings, if they have one at all.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to throw in a note about Cory Doctorow, a writer, here. He has released a few of his books as free downloads as well as publishing them in dead tree format. His first novel, Down and Out of the Magic Kingdown, according to his web site, "was downloaded hundreds of thousands of times and sold like hell." He even gave his blessing to downloading, but he still sold well. Maybe the negative impact downloading has on sales has been exaggerated by certain groups who want to milk us for every penny they can get.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm making a distinction between small-scale and large-scale pirates. Small scale pirates are folks who download games and music. Large scale pirates are those who get ahold of a work, duplicate it, and sell it. I'm not going to endorse them in any way. Making a copy of a work because you want it and selling another person's work to make money are far apart on my scale of badness.
<br/>
<br/>
* Some of you may be wondering what I'm doing here if my first post (this is my first one, right?) is to argue over something not even programming related. I'm mostly just lurking for now, since I'm just getting my feet wet with GBA programming. I only recently got a sane build environment set up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It really depends on where in China, also.  The differences between the countryside and the cities are huge, as well as WHAT you are eating.
<br/>
<br/>
I live in one of the richer cities, and a restaurant (I use that term loosely) meal can be anywhere from 75 cents US (at a small dirty street shop) to $2 (for mcdonalds/kfc/etc) to LOTS (for elegant dining and shark's fin soup).  Most of my coworkers, who have decent IT jobs, think paying more than $2.50 for a lunch is a bit steep.  Just for lunches, at the company cafeteria, I spend about $25 US per month.  Of course, I could do it cheaper if I cooked all my own food, but it gives you a reference point.
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, in the poorer places, you can easily eat out for about 25 cents US. 
<br/>
<br/>
And all that is assuming you want food with meat in it. If you're happy with mostly rice and vegetables (which the poorest people do), you can do it a lot cheaper.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, to bring it all back to piracy, my coworkers always laugh when I tell them how much non-pirated DVD's cost in the US.  The pirated ones sell on the street here for 75 cents each.

I knew Cory back when I was growing up in Toronto, back in the BBS days when the Internet was still a gleam in all of our eyes. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/stuff/doctorow-drm-ms.html" target="_blank">This talk</a> that he gave at Microsoft on DRM is a long read, but is an <span style="font-style: italic">excellent</span> insight into the history of how copyright law and consumer behaviour have evolved alongside technology.
<br/>
<br/>
What bothers me are the blanket statements like "piracy has no effect on the industry" and similar oversimplifications.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure that on some level Adobe realizes that it's unlikely Photoshop would be the tremendous success that it is today if not for literally the thousands of people who grew up becoming experts on pirated versions, and who now insist on using it in the various industry positions they hold. 
<br/>
<br/>
Not all effects of piracy are positive, though, and it's foolhardy to assume that they are, or that even the benefits necessarily outweigh the drawbacks.

<br/>
There ought to be more substance to this kind of claim than "it doesn't seem like it would have a large negative impact", since the developers would claim otherwise, and have spent over two decades investing in the development of technology to combat it. (Financially speaking, it wouldn't even make sense for them to pursue that route unless piracy was already costing them more than it does to find ways to copy-protect their software.)

That's a very good question. I really don't have much. I've seen mildly convincing proof on both sides, but nothing that really impresses me. My impression is that it's very up in the air, with studies saying piracy is bad for the industry on one side, and studies saying piracy isn't bad on the other. None have struck me as me as especially persuasive yet. Until I see something that does, I'm just taking the side I prefer.
<br/>
<br/>
I felt my morality justifications were appropriate since my post was about my feelings towards piracy, and my morality judgements figure into my attitude. I'm not claiming to know the truth, but these are my opinions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i think the criminal level piracy effects the industry as a whole by the amount that has been spent on them as a whole ... i.e. a cart with 100 games (if there is such a thing) sold for ?80 probably accounts for 3-5 game losses
<br/>
<br/>
the other level of piracy .. i.e. home level copying is impossible to measure as there are various trends to take into account; such as whether the people who never buy music or games account for little, some, or most of home level piracy
<br/>
<br/>
official reports say that piracy both does and does not; but that is mostly down to the fact that the reports target different levels of copying; i.e. large scale criminal piracy, duplication / lending, downloading, pirate purchases, and radio recording which all takes the single title of 'piracy'</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

hmmmm Interesting. That is difficult to assess really. i didn't consider games out of production - i completely forgot about that whole era of doctor 64. It could be argued that without that option more commercial games would have been purchased on some small scale

are you implying that you feel buying the game and returning it within 10 days is in any way better than copying the game and playing it for 10 days? Having said that that is a very good area you brough up there

<br/>
sometimes when i am undecided about games i will buy 5-6 at a time and return the ones i realize are not to my liking. but to buy a game with the intention of completing it within 10 days to return it is (in my opinion, i.e. <span style="font-style: italic">i do not impose or preach this view</span>) worse than copying a game as it involves direct deciet; especially in my area where you have to 'whistle innocently' while they are signing your refund reciept

Sure am. Once I've returned the game to the store, I can't continue to play it. Even if I claim that I break every CD I burn after 10 days, there's no financial liability to bind me to my word. Why do you think that "you must delete these files within 24 hours of downloading them if you don't own the originals" nonsense never took?

Go to a store with a demo setup.  It's best to go when it's not busy.

Buying a used game takes it out of circulation and reduces supply.  Home consoles are sold at a loss, so buying a used console is doing the manufacturer a favor (alhtough they'd rather see their console in two homes instead of one).

<span style="font-weight: bold">thought i'd throw in the links between the debate and that of idealism and utilitarianism</span>
<br/>
<br/>
idealists believe in a universal rule of right / wrong and the utilitarianists believe in the context of the action
<br/>
<br/>
playing a copied game has less of a negative effect on the surrounding environment and has a greater positive effect on themself than buying a [potentially high demand] product with the intention to return it where its boxes must resealed and other persons are deprived of using the game - and therefore utalitarianists favour copying a game to decietfully returning one
<br/>
<br/>
idealism does not favour context and opts for a universal rule such as all unprohibited copying is wrong in any case whether they want to try before they buy or want to ensure it works with their system
<br/>
<br/>
there are flaws with both views, i.e. if lying is wrong [in the idealists world] then what do you say to the killer who asks if a little girl is in a room; the flaws with utilitarianism need not be pointed out as they are obvious. also there are biological and socialogical links to a persons preference of which view they adopt</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What utter nonsense. I'm more inclined to call those people "excusists" than "utilitarianists".
<br/>
<br/>
I don't believe for a second that so-called utilitarianists are pirating games instead of buying/returning them because of some kind of perverted notion of a moral high ground. I do believe they are pirating instead because:
<br/>
<br/>
- It's <span style="font-style: italic">easier</span> (less physical labour) to pirate than it is to buy something and then return it to the store later on
<br/>
<br/>
- There is no financial investment involved, and no repercussion if they forget to return something they pirate
<br/>
<br/>
- They know perfectly well that once they've bought something, if they like it, there's a good chance they'll want to keep it and have to lose their money
<br/>
<br/>
- Most importantly, with piracy, they can keep the game forever if they want to.
<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of justifications for why people pirate, some more valid than others. But the notion that they are just doing what they consider to be a <span style="font-style: italic">more noble</span> alternative to the legal action of buying a piece of software and then returning it to the merchant? That's laughable.

A quick survey of Blockbuster's website shows that they still rent games for the GBA and DS. I'm not sure if they have Blockbusters in Muskogee, OK (where Joe_Sextus lives, who was the one claiming not to have the option of renting), or if Muskogee is excluded from their online program, but that would seem to be the reasonable alternative for the vast majority of people.
<br/>
<br/>
As was already said before, though, not having an alternative doesn't give you the legal right to try before you buy. In this case, the "alternative" is to do your homework, and if you don't like the choice you made, either suffer with it or sell it. Not liking those options doesn't make piracy okay, though.

well it is all about your boundaries of right and wrong. if i know deep down that i do not intend to keep a game for more than 10 days (bearing in mind a majority of games nowadays can be completed in under that) then i am <span style="font-weight: bold">decietfully</span> acquiring the game. when copying a game i know deep down that i am likely to enjoy the game and am <span style="font-weight: bold">unlawfully</span> acquiring the game against the law
<br/>
<br/>
when highlighting the type of wrong involved in both it is easy to make the distinction between the two and favour one over the other. the law allowing it does not make it right; it's merely a loophole designed for the audience who genuinly planned on paying for the game not those for a free ride
<br/>
<br/>
these days shops are more lenient when it comes to returning; but at the same time i dont think they want to be taken advantage of, not to mention breaking the personal level of trust so i feel it is 'wrong' to do either and buying the game with the intention to complete it within the return time makes you no better or worse than a pirate</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Don't most stores either have a no-questions-asked returns policy and/or they will only exchange defective copies of a game for the same game. How is this deceitful? It is either expressly allowed by the company, or you will only be able to exchange it for the same game. And how many people actually do this as compared to piracy? Surely it is not worth the effort for most people to continually buy and return games in 10 days or so. In fact, the only reasons that I can think of that people will actually do this en-masse is so that they can pirate the game and then return it to the store and get their money back.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Modasi Games</span>

There's nothing deceitful about it at all. You do not enter into a contract with the store you purchase from when you buy a game saying that you don't intend to return the product. Once it leaves their hands it belongs to you. If the store has a return policy, it's at their own discretion and if they feel you're jerking them around and exploiting their good nature then they have the option of denying it to you.
<br/>
<br/>
Retail companies know perfectly well that the vast majority of sales wind up being final, and it's worth the investment in customer satisfaction to take back the minority that are unwanted. Do you think Costco would let its members refund merchandise that's been used for several years if it wasn't a viable business strategy for them?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying it isn't a cheap thing to do. It surely is. But it's hardly <span style="font-weight: bold">deceitful</span>.

i do not consider copying a game to be stealing any more than being a jerk is stealing - bearing in mind to steal is to deprive one of their goods. when you consider the end product of the actions; no game is sold yet a game is completed. how do you then decide which action is stealing and which is not when you consider its end result
<br/>
<br/>
i am also not under the belief that the law is the answer to why or what is right/wrong. for example most laws permits alcohol and cigarettes which are in 'some' views wrong. the laws of ohio prohibit oral sex; so is the rest of the world holding wrong practises or is 'that' law disallowing something right?
<br/>
<br/>
i brought up utilitarianism and idealism as they are philosophies covering what can be considered as right and wrong. i noticed that people here had conflicting definitions on what is considered to be right and wrong, which is the most difficult boundary to truthfully make</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Rather than get into a semantic argument over what constitutes stealing (I'll go so far as to say the dictionary disagrees with you, though), I'll simply ask you: doesn't it seem awfully contrived to define stealing in terms which purposefully excludes intellectual property?

I have no problem with the philosophies, but I believe you are misapplying them if you think pirating a game is on a higher moral plane than returning a game to the store because you are creating a disruption to the store by doing so. I think you are deluding yourself into excusing it because if you go the way of piracy you don't have to work as hard, invest as much, or give up any of your ill-gotten gains at the end of the day. Why haven't you factored any of those elements into the utilitarianist philosophy?

Intellectual property is an unspecific term that is not exclusive to the domain of copyright law.

yes. IP is much more complex and different to a tangible object which when gone is gone. The loss concerned with IP is financial, and not easily measured - to have it defined as stealing is implying there was deprivation; i think another way to put it is that there is a line to cross before something is considered as theft; maybe one could better consider an action as theft under a certain circumstance and not possibly under another due to its complexity and implications of definition

My point is that any behavior can be justified.  "He looked at me funny, so I killed him" doesn't justify murder in the modern world, but given a time and place it might be a fact of life.  Lines are fuzzy.
<br/>
<br/>
If all you make is $100 a month, justifying a $50 game purchase is hard to do.  Can you justify spending half a month's pay on a single game?  Probably not.  Think of what else you could spend it on.  If a meal out costs $0.25, and a DVD $0.75, can you justify spending dinner for three on a game (or DVD)?  Probably.  That is more or less what they run in the States depending on where and what you eat.

Yes, but this is the OffTopic section, and video games piracy /is/ related to gbadev, especially if you consider the equipment we homebrewers use to develop at home. Remember Nintendo vs. Bung.
<br/>
<br/>
About the question, my personal view is that every association between the act of theft and a larger honorable fight between social-economical classes should be forbidden. Never gonna happen, of course, considering that if you have to go against any ruling power, you have no option but to go against its laws at some point. But it's very hard to separate a real struggle for freedom from crime under that context.
<br/>
<br/>
The brazilian scenario is just like that: Sony and Microsoft won't estabilish their video-games division here, because of piracy beyond control - so people have to import games, at a higher cost. Gamers complaint about prices, so they turn to the piracy market, which is magically cheap. For some reason, the SNAFU is good for the government, so they won't do anything to change it. I mean it - Nintendo (the only to have a estabilished base in Brazil) had to give financial help to the federal police in order to make the fight against piracy start moving, but personally I don't think it's paying. More and more you see piracy becoming the common place here, and more and more you see gamers - even inside the ridiculously small brazilian game industry - support piracy, because, you know, this is all the government's fault.
<br/>
<br/>
So, although Robin Hood might be a strech, piracy does indeed take the colors of fight between social classes given the right circumstances. At least here, people are against it by default, but they quickly change their opinions when you question if current prices for original games are fair.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I Agree, MKDS sold over 112,000 copys less then 200 people would be pirating that game so do the math : $112, 000 times? $80 USD(not sure since im in australia) = $8, 960, 000 so we take the 200(theres probably less then 200 but ohhwell) people pirating it and you end up only loosing 16,000 of 9 million so honestly, it may be wrong but its not like its the end of the world.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think most places in the US has it at $35usd but removing taxes, manufacturing costs, distribution and the profit of the store selling the game, how big is N's profit on each game? 5-10$?
<br/>
<br/>
Id have to wager that more than 200 people are pirating the game tho. At 35$ I cant really see a reason for this. Where I live its 50-55$ and even that is very reasonable for a game such as this.

Did you actually read all of this thread? How do you know there are 200 pirated copies? Do pirates keep records? If and when this game is pirated, do you think only 200 will be 'produced'? And at what figure do you draw the line at?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Modasi Games</span>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The issue of piracy has nothing to do with much of what has been argued. For example it can be argued that piracy may not have any 'actual' financial loss since nothing has gone missing. In the same way a person has not taken from any money from miramax if he snuck in on one of the many 'unfortunately' empty seats at the empty showing of their unsuccessful movie that they would never have bought.
<br/>
<br/>
But that makes it no less wrong than if it had had a negative effect because it has just not been fair to every one else who did pay. That is what I think is most wrong of piracy. It is unfair for someone to cash in one someone elses product and unfair for someone to reap 'my' benefits. I personally think the law is catering for this much more than it is for the financial good of the companies. <span style="font-weight: bold">What do you think?</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I think the worst parts of the law are those which exist but really should not; and those which really should exist which do not. And not because they do or do not exist - but because they are so complicated that its problem is in having a general conclusion in the first place.

I do not like to pick personal fights or such. I do not like squabbles or anything of that sort. However I will point out that they have lost their sense of security. I will however try to answer your question without that in mind as I think that I do see what you were intending to say.

Honestly: In order to answer that I would have to come to a total conclusion. If I do reach a conclusion then my conclusion must satisfy the proposition that the amount of sales in a world without piracy is the same as a world living to my conclusion. I think that many people are happy to cut their arm of if it itches - whereas I strive to find a way to remove the itch and nothing more. With the itch refering to loss of sales; and removing your arm refering to 'simply' outlawing all forms of piracy whether all of it leads to loss of sales 'simply' because you know that some of it does.

I think it is just something you just see around you. Some people abuse their lunch break so they remove lunch break. Someone left food in the lab so they ban all foods in the lab. A fight happened after hours so we now close early. These are widespread examples of chopping off your arm for a quick fix solution. It has the side effect of havnig no lunch break; no food in the labs; and the night not being any good. It is natural to choose the obvious answer that surely works as it is easier than finding something that has minimal side effects - like providing eating areas and making the lunch breaks coincide with the happy hour.

No. We all have beliefs. Some beliefs just do not work in practise - i.e. having all forms of piracy as legal may ruin something if it happened. What I am actually talking about is the concept that [if] my idea of things is right that it could actually be put into real widespread practise and work.

Well on the bright side I guess it's better to not believe somthing you see than it is to believe something you can't see. Honestly though - I am happy to admit when I am wrong. I just do not see the point in lying about it and pretending it to be something correct. I am under no illusion that I am 100 percent right.
