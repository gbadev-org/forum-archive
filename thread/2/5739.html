I believe this is like a miniature orchestra with nice classical music.<br/>_________________<br/>They say when you run a Microsoft Disc Backwards you can hear Demonic Voices... That's nothing when you run it forwards it installs windows.

Some video demos of the "game" in action can be found here:

Made a silly movie of me playing with the beatness plankton:

It's not really my kind of game. There is not much behind the surface and if you've seen video of all 10 planktons, you've seen everything.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't really know why I got it. Maybe because the special edition box (with the cheap headphones) looks soooo good :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Announced for America without a date, not even <span style="font-style: italic">x</span>th quarter of 200<span style="font-style: italic">y</span>, typically means it'll be effectively canceled like the North American versions of <span style="font-style: italic">Mother 1+2</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Nintendo Puzzle Collection</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic">Payback</span> were.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I didn't think it would be my kind of game, either, but after playing around with the demo for an hour or so, I have to admit that it's strangely addictive.  I can't see myself buying it, but I think it would make a great gift if they sold it for cheap (I'm thinking $20).  Perhaps they're holding off until the holiday season so they can sell it as a stocking stuffer?
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, if you're willing to pay a bit more for the import, I can't see any reason to not get the Japanese version since it doesn't seem like there's any localization to be done.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The quite thick instruction booklet is in japanese only though. But the "game" isn't that complicated and there are some FAQ's available at gamefaqs.com if you wonder which planktons can be controlled with handclaps, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Are you serious?! Wow, thanks, that's just the info I needed. I'm very curious about this toy (wouldn't even call it a game) and was seriously considering the import... I guess I'll get it JPN then. Thanks.

The manual is still in Jap only though, but you won't be needing it. I figured out almost everything in about five minutes.
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you get the special edition that will get you a very classy looking package.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
