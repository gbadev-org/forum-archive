    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, I'd post this in one of the coding related forums, but I'm not sure it's coding related...
<br/>
<br/>
I've been having bizarre, weird problem lately...
<br/>
<br/>
To sum it up in a nutshell, whenever I edit a text file and save, the last 3 lines or so of the text file are duplicated.
<br/>
<br/>
This has been causing me huge headches, as I'm trying to write code and edit makefiles and as a result my files are being borked...
<br/>
<br/>
The problem occurs no matter which tool I use. I've been editing C source files in Eclipse, Notepad++ and Programmers Notepad and the problem keeps happening.
<br/>
<br/>
It happens independant of whether the file in question is original or an editor of someone else's file.
<br/>
<br/>
Attempting to remove the added text has no effect, as the extra text reappears when the file is re-loaded.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem does not seem to affect MS-Word documents though.
<br/>
<br/>
I've scanned for viruses and spyware using both Avast and ZoneAlarm and have turned up nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried changing the file encoding options with no change.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently I'm running XP SP2.
<br/>
<br/>
This is driving me out of my mind! I'm completely unable to end any kind of source code on my system and I'm having no luck working out what the problem is.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any ideas at all, because my temper is fraying and my patience is wearing thin...
<br/>
<br/>
:-(
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: If I remove the stray text using WordPad it does not reappear. Now I'm really confused!<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, not blank lines. Duplicated lines. Basically the last three lines of actual text get duplicated. I tried "fooling" it with whitespace, to no avail.
<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned that editing with WordPard doesn't have this problem. I just tested VS2005 and that's also able to edit the files correctly without mangling the files.
<br/>
<br/>
The duplicated lines cause big problems. The C comiler complains about all kinds of things, thanks to extra } and the like. Make doesn't like makefiles with stray text in them either.
<br/>
<br/>
Whatever this is, it's not cool :-(
<br/>
<br/>
At least VS and WordPad seem okay. I'll try Netbeans next and see whether it also suffers...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

Baaa, what a hassle. Well, unless the problem starts happening in WordPad and VS I'll just leave it for now...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmmmm, I discovered something rather interesting...
<br/>
<br/>
I was working with one of the problem files in Visual Studio, saved it and compiled with no problems. I then reloaded the file and wham, Visual Studio pops up a rather interesting message amounting to "The line terminators in this file are erratic, would you like VS to correct this?". To which I say yes. 
<br/>
<br/>
The file didn't get b0rked, so I'm happy...
<br/>
<br/>
I suspected it might have something to do with line terminators, but altering this stuff in the other editors didn't seem to work...
