    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I invented a mozilla firefox extension: <a class="postlink" href="http://zzo38computer.cjb.net/mozilla/" target="_blank">http://zzo38computer.cjb.net/mozilla/</a> (I need better toolbar icons, though. Just rename .xpi to .zip and change the icons)
<br/>
I also invented some GreaseMonkey scripts: <a class="postlink" href="http://zzo38computer.cjb.net/userjs/" target="_blank">http://zzo38computer.cjb.net/userjs/</a>
<br/>
And the other question I have is, that the "New User Script" command in GreaseMonkey doesn't seem to do anything! What I think it should do, is to open a new window with the script header already filled in, and you can type a script in and push execute or no execute, and file/new/open/save/install, and if the window is open with "execute" set it will run that script when the page is refreshed.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Okay, that's great, but what is it?  All I know is that it's a Firefox extension.  What does it do?  What's its purpose?  Why should I install it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

View the source-code if you don't know (rename .xpi to .zip to view the source-code). If you have any suggestions you can post these here as well. There will be NO difference once you install it, you will have to enable the options you want before they will effect. You can also uninstall it at any time.
<br/>
<br/>
Some of the functions are:<ul>
<br/>
<li>Relative Location Bar: If enabled, it treats URLs entered into the location bar as relative URLs instead of absolute.
<br/>
</li><li>Do Not Create Exposable URI: Keeps wyci<span style="font-weight: bold"></span>wyg:// in dynamic URLs.
<br/>
</li><li>Delete: Delete any content from a web-page. When the page is refreshed the content will be redisplayed.
<br/>
</li><li>View Current: Similar to view-source, but includes dynamic content.
<br/>
</li><li>Properties: Similar to page info, with some different options, including the ability to edit forms, set cookies, scroll to anchors, and enable/disable individual style-sheets.
<br/>
</li><li>Keyboard Shortcuts: You can configure ALT+F1, ALT+F2, ALT+F3 to execute any javascript code executed in chrome context.
<br/>
</li><li>Toolbar: You can add these toolbar buttons to any toolbar or menubar: Previous, Next, Up, Root, Disable Javascript, Enable Javascript, View Source, ALT+F1, ALT+F2, ALT+F3. Previous and Next use the data stored in the &lt;link&gt; tags to navigate. Eventually I might add the function to define your own page sequences.
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
I also plan on adding these functions, but I might need help, so I would like you to tell me if you know how to add these functions:<ul>
<br/>
<li>Override XSL stylesheets for specific XML documents, specified by root element, name-space, or document URL
<br/>
</li><li>URL blocking/rewriting
<br/>
</li><li>Ability to load/save form data to files
<br/>
</li><li>Ability to rewrite DOM so it is different when accessed by web-pages, but still uses default DOM when accessed by chrome
<br/>
</li><li>Rewrite web-pages and other files before loaded, like making a proxy server built-in to Mozilla Firefox
<br/>
</li><li>A clone of GreaseMonkey, with many of the same functions but some things different, such as the ability to open a new window where you can type in and execute a user script immediately, and then save it if it is good
<br/>
