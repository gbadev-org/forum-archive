I think the worst case scenario is that it could be of good use and expanded, but was never released.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ah, so how about putting it in the "Help Wanted" section first - try to get a few people involved in the project. Otherwise the risk for people taking a look, but then not really doing anything with it, is rather high, I'd think.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
