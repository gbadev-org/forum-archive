    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nine days to go by my watch...anyone else got GTA fever yet? I know I have!
<br/>
When San Andreas came out I was in university and only one of my friends had a PS2 there and he raved about it for months until the PC version came out. Now I'm the only one with a PS3/360 (all my friends are skint) so I've invited a bunch of people to come round my house the following weekend so they can watch me play! I consider this revenge for the whole San An thing...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, who's getting it and which version are you getting? I've pre-ordered the PS3 version but I'm kinda worried that the frame rate will be dodgy. Hmm.
<br/>
<br/>
PS: did you know that GTA IV is coded in PAlib? ;-D<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm fairly excited, I've pre ordered a copy from Game and I'm working that day so I'll be stood outside in the, most likely, cold and wet weather at 9 a.m. in Leeds ready to get my hands on a copy, I've even contemplated taking the afternoon off, hmm.... I might still do it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
honestly, i kind of skipped this whole gta stuff. 1 was kind of cool, i liked it. i even played 3 on some occasions... but i never stick to it. it doesn't mean i think these are bad games, no way! just not the type of game i enjoy the most.
<br/>
<br/>
... if only oblivion wasn't so damn buggy! ...
<br/>
<br/>
have a nice time playing 4 when it's out! and don't forget to got to school and to work! (don't forget you also may need some sleep from time to time!) :^D
<br/>
<br/>
ps: does game still have the MAGENTA {(c) T-COM} sign? Q: "Nice pink (fag) bag, what's in there?" - A:"Mortal Kombat?" ;^D

I've never finished a 3D version of GTA, to be honest I've never owned one and have never been that excited about it, I've just played friends copies a few times and to be honest even then I generally only get so far before just driving around and seeing how long I can evade the cops for, but for some reason this one's drawn me in and I'm going to do my best to try and finish this without so much in-game procrastination.
<br/>

Hmm....I need to finish FFVII first though, I've only just started playing it and managed to reach the Ancient Temple last night where I ended up just walking around aimlessly in before going to bed</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

True, well GTA1 and GTA3 were the only ones that had any real leaps; GTA4 does not seem like it will be [even] half of the leap that GTA3 was - but I'm sure we'll all enjoy it!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wow, you are the 1st person that I've seen actually state they liked the 2D games.  Almost all of my friends refer to GTAIII as "the 1st one", &amp; I had 1 &amp; 2 for the PC &amp; Loved them.  It's a shame that everyone dogs on them just because they are not as pleasing to the eye.  In my view the game play was very much the same, &amp; I loved driving all around the city, jumping the cars, getting them fixed in the repair ports, picking them up with cranes, hitching trailers onto the semi's... there was so much to do!  Plus, on the PSX you could swap out the game (once it loaded) &amp; put in an audio cd, &amp; then your cd would load as the music on the radio.<br/>_________________<br/>-#2pencil</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

as far as i can tell, this is my "technology of the year", as of now! those behaviour controlled procedural animations look awesome!!!! what i have seen so far looked so natural, no multi animation blending / ragdoll / what-so-ever looks that good! i thought crysis' animation system would be hot, but as i saw some euphoria footage, WOW!!!!

the name already tells a lot of the effect that this piece of software has on me!

Well like I said, a guy got stabbed in Croydon! Apparently everyone thought it was a publicity stunt and just carried on looking. The guy actually went home to get the knife ... thankfully he's ok!
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: it wasn't GTA4 related, it just happened to occur in front of a queue for the game. Although one 18 year old kid did have his jaw broken in a mugging for his game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
