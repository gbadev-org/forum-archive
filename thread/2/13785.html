    <h4>#135829 - simonjhall - Thu Jul 26, 2007 6:46 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yo, it's been mentioned a few times but never discussed fully - would there be any scope for a "could you code this?" forum?
<br/>
<br/>
Stuff which would go in it:
<br/>
- "I'd like game X ported, but have no programming ability - what's the chances of someone else doing it?"
<br/>
- "I'm writing a program and need function X - has anyone already written this / I don't know how to write this so can someone write it for me?"
<br/>
<br/>
I realise that this is similar to the "help wanted" forum but I think there's a subtle difference, as I've always seen that forum as a "I'm making a project and I'd like an artst". This new forum would be more of a dumping ground for those useless porting requests, but also could be used for more constructive "I need some code" threads.
<br/>
<br/>
One advantage of doing this would allow you to put a big fat sticky at the top telling person X what their chances are if they want some closed-source game coded for the DS.
<br/>
Another would allow people who are submitting these requests to see a) which games have already been considered and b) the response that those threads got, allowing them to properly construct (and punctuate...) a new request.
<br/>
<br/>
What do people think of this?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think that port requests that are reasonable (open-source and within DS hardware limits) should stay, but the ridiculous Port-halo-3-and-other-impossible-stuff-to-the-DS-for-me and stuff like that should just be deleted, so the forum will be more helpful to those with reasonable problems.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

If they live in with the main development forum old porting requests will get pushed off the front few pages pretty quickly (assuming they have no posts), meaning that in about a month's time I reckon we'll be getting a brand new "OMG a N64! emulater would be sooo cool" thread!
<br/>
Deleting threads like this is definately a bad idea, as people may assume that ideas like this have never been thought of before.
<br/>
<br/>
Or even, how about a stickied message saying which things have been requested and links to the appropriate threads where they were considered / squashed.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

a forum for game port requests would just be a madhouse, imo

If this board has (making up numbers here) 100 folks capable of porting games, you'll have 10000 people making port requests

&lt;lmao!&gt; good one... "never been thought of... n64 emulator on the ds"... &lt;tear drops&gt; wow, that was a good laugh.
<br/>
<br/>
well, i find the idea very good, but it should get a better name. this one is pretty general. i think something as tikker has supposed would work better, although his topic is a bit to biased towards "coders only" and leves out the hb requests.

Anyway I think generally its a good idea, and there could be two stickied topics, one for requests already made, and who made them, and the other explaining the probability of someones port request being coded. (Stuff like making sure the source is open, and that the original system requirements aren't too demanding, etc.)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
