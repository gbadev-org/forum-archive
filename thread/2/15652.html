    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Which key should run (Run Application) in the new combination computer/game-console-system that my company will make soon? Of course, you can also just type RUN, or use the game controller and push START button (and not even use a keyboard at all), or select it from the menu, or use the remote control, or use the KEY command to change the function key definitions, etc. But which one should be the default one? I cannot decide all by myself.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by zzo38computer on Sun Jun 08, 2008 10:52 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In Super Mario Bros. (NES, GBC, GBA), run is B. In Sonic, run is down+C. In Kirby (most platforms) and Noddy (GBC), run is pressing a direction twice. In Super Mario 64 (N64), run is tilting the stick all the way. In Smash Bros. (N64, GCN, and some Wii controllers), run is tilting the stick all the way quickly. In Animal Crossing (GCN and DS), run is L. In Me &amp; My Katamari (PSP), run is Up Δ Up Δ.

What did you mean by "run"?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

i think it'S more like "ide" run (i would have misunderstood that, too, if i wouldn't have that command in front of me every day... and the "run" run judt didn't make sense.  ;?
<br/>
<br/>
Although I must admit, the OP and topic are misleading. The poster should rename it accordingly ("Run Application" Key or something instead of "Run.")
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I chose "other", because off the same reason as wolped: F9 :^)
