It is OK for you to remain anonymous, but if you would like to explore this a little more, please make yourself known here. I have been rather studious lately and my time is much more available now.

Then finish your marble madness clone or whatever you are planning to do and stop flooding the forum with senseless discussions about a game project that doesn't even have started.

I never liked Marble Madness, it was too hard (the versions i've tried).
<br/>
maybe the realistic one would be better i dont know, since the controlls has been fkuced up in those versions i've tried, i got tired of it.

<br/>
Easier gameplay, and maybe an option to change the camera view would be a big plus!<br/>_________________<br/>yeah, well, maybe... or? anyways.... eh...  what was i talking about??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
