    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It occurred to me earlier today to actually check the wikispace in my signature, and it hasnt seen any actual changes or content in a few months now. Should I take it down, or is someone interested in writing articles for it? They don\'t have to be big long elaborate things, a guide to saving in SRAM on the DS would be a good example. Let me know yall.
