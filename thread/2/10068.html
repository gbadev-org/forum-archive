<br/>
<br/>
for a project I'm working on, I need the ability to send keys to the active application. I already have code to do it in Windows, but As my laptop is Linux only (and I just like multiplatform code), I would like to have the ability in Linux. On google I didn't came closer that someone asking how to do it on a forum, but the reply only said he didn't need it in his case ;)...
<br/>
<br/>
So does anyone here knows how to do this?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrsnowflake.be" target="_blank">http://www.mrsnowflake.be</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
