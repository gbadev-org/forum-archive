    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone. I'm Newb, and I'm learning c++ now on my own. I've never programmed anything before, except I have done the gba and regular console versions of the various "hello world" programs and I'm starting to get a feel for all of ths.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm extremely interested in GBA development. I don't know if it will be a useful tool in the learning process to develop some games for visual boy and eventually GBA. I do know that I really want to make my own games on GBA to play while I learn to make 3D games. 
<br/>
<br/>
So for my first post at this board is for beginners advice that is up to the minute. There's lots of advice out there, but the mind updates always, so that advice has got to sound much better from those who are doing it now.
<br/>
<br/>
So what kind of advice can anyone offer to a complete newb learning C++ with a focus on game development?
<br/>
<br/>
I bet this'll get stickied one day. heh heh.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I'll reply... I only got to know Marble Madness a few years ago and couldn't get into it because it is so old now. However, I love the freeware game "I've got some balls" which is like a modernized version of the concept. Something like that would be great on any platform.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's a good starting game for sure - nothing to complex yet touches all the basics of gameplay.  Go for it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Apparently there's an 'official' Marble Madness coming out for the GBA. I assume it'll be a port rather than an enhanced version, as I've seen it advertised at budget price, but details are sketchy to say the least.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">still, imagine a marble madness on DS using real 3d, where the marble/playfield is on the topscreen, and the bottom screen is used like a 'trackball' - you rub in the direction you want him to roll.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
As for the DS, there wouldn't be harm in adding that funcionality, but I'm focused on the classic brought into today to show off the advances the world of gaming and graphics has made.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm focused mainly on PC/PS2?XBox/GBA releases of marble madness, but i doubt it will go further than a remake on GBA and a new game on PC, both for fun.<br/>_________________<br/>Teach me GBA :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
