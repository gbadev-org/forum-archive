    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I am interested in purchasing a GB Smart Development Kit (aka GB Smart Drive, aka GBStation), with two of the compatible 16Mb or 32Mb cartridges.  This is the device that has a cart reader/writer and a 3.5" floppy disk drive below, and runs on batteries.  I have no intention of piracy, as I want to use this device along with two music carts on two game boys (LSDJ and nanoloop) to allow me to save pattern, patch and song data onto floppydisks so that I can do continuous mixing for more than an hour.  If any of you have these devices that are not in use, please let me know by email or just post here.  I will pay well.  Thank you.
<br/>
