<br/>
Add the low power consumption (around 18W!), that it supports any (of my) USB keyboards out-of-the-box and it's quite impressive. :'D
<br/>
Only the browser should come with it for free, imho.
<br/>
<br/>
And it's damn quiet. :')
<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy my Wii...
<br/>
<br/>
... Now, I hope that didn't come out wrong. ;'p
<br/>
<br/>
Greetings to everyone. :')
<br/>
<br/>
PS: Writing with the Wiimote is also fun. :')
<br/>
And no, I wouldn't consider myself a fanboy. :'p X'D<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's nice to see big N has taken the internet seriously this time around (NGC's network support was a joke), giving us a really great online "toy".
<br/>
I hope they do extend their VC and WiiWare libraries, though. Also, downloadable demos would be nice (I went on a limb and bought "Defend Your Castle" for the remaining 500 WiiPts., and I didn't regret it... I sure was lucky this time round).
<br/>
<br/>
And the typical "elevator"-like music kicks ass (not as much as the actual elevator mucis in "Blue Harvest")! :^D<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released
