For "command set", couldn't you just use, say, 65C802 bytecode? That way you won't need to write a new assembler; you can just use ca65 like the people at nesdev.com do.

But I don't see any interrupts or ways to do time delays in there.

There's tilemaps, but no scrolling.

I can't think of any practical use for this virtual machine.  Might as well write games for an actual existing console, then use an emulator for that console.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, it is not designed to be implemented in hardware, but if someone wants to, you can do that (but please wait for the final specification). It is something like the way Java and .NET are used, but is much simpler than Java and .NET. Not all of the specifications has to be implemented either, some parts are optional. It can work on Nintendo DS, GBA, computer, other system, and maybe even on a DVD player if the manufacturer includes that feature (even though it isn't that likely).
<br/>
<br/>
In addition to that, this is also a part of a larger project, a comercial (but still free/open-source) project, this is one of the three ways planned to run programs on that system (the other 2 are as a Linux executable file, and as a program written in BASIC and interpreted).

I have a <a class="postlink" href="http://zzo38computer.cjb.net/gasm.zip" target="_blank">generalized assembler</a> that can easily be programmed to work with this system. This isn't designed to be implemented in real hardware, so it includes some commands that would work good for a virtual machine but not very good with real hardware.

I know that, but I didn't type the specification, I just invented it, told him about how it worked so he could type it, I got his suggestions on the virtual machine as well (so it is slightly modified from the original idea), and look to see if it was correct. I don't know how to type a specification very well.

Register FFF0-FFF1 is a timing register, you can also use the FRAME command to do time delay. I was going to originally have interrupts, but he said it doesn't need interrupts because it is a virtual machine. If you think scrolling is needed, you tell me suggestion how should I add scroll register and stuff like that?

<br/>
This is much simpler than real game systems. If this is used it would be emulated more accurately than existing console emulators. The other this is, this one is designed to work with any display size and hardware capability.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In addition to these things, I also need help with licensing, as well as comments on nearly every other part, in case something is unclear and you don't understand, or if there are typing mistakes, etc.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
