    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
Are there any known game publishers for us indie GBA game writers?  
<br/>
<br/>
Also does anyone have, or know of, any success stories about having their game published they could share?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I take it that its very rare for an homebrew game to make it to the shelves?  No one knows anyone who accomplished this?
<br/>
<br/>
or even better; if someone can suggest/recommend a potential publisher I could contact about a game I have finished creating?
<br/>
<br/>
I have plenty more details if needed!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's next to impossible to get a homebrew game published on a console.   Publishers have that racket all tied up.  Your best bet is to create an awesome homebrew game, and try to get a job at an already established developer.  Or, start a company, and try to get a publisher to give you work (license games for cell phones etc).
<br/>
<br/>
A publisher doesn't just publish "cool games."  They have to fit all their other requirements for a game that they would normally pay to ahve developed for them.  The chances your game does that are slim.  Sure, you can try and really sell it to them, and maybe make a go of it, but it's slim.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Now, almost 3 years later, the game has changed publishers at least once and is still not on the market.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
