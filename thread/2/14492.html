    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do you want to make them faster? Or do you want to make them slower? I think a patcher to make wait states slower comes with the SuperCard software. Is there a specific program that you want to patch?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wanted to make them slower. I have patched a Shitfaced Clowns demo with the Supercard software and at least it starts correctly on my six years old F2A. It's a same that the software patches the rom to a 4/2 wait state (I think), 3/1 would be better for my flashcard.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, thanks for the info.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The SFC demos typically come in an ordinary version for cards that can be clocked at 2/1 (called "overclock" in memtestARM for DS) and a "lamer" version for cards that can only be clocked at 3/1.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What demo are you looking to run? We did do a "lamer-version" for "Newton never did this, bitch", but this isn't online anymore. I could put it online again if needed. Theoretically, I could make a "lamer-version" of "Who's your favorite clown", but I'm a bit afraid that the code is out of sync with the tool-chain.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason we never did a "lamer-version" of "Matt Current" is that one of the effects breaks horribly without 2/1 wait-states. That is mostly due to some sketchy code on my part, but I never got the time to fix it and now I kinda feel finished with that demo. There's so many things I'd like to fix, beginning to fix them will just lead down a very long road ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could reupload Newton's lamer version if there's no problem. I was searching for a rom waitstate patch for a quick-fix for the four demos of SFC, even if the results weren't good enough. At least Newton's demo runs ok on a 4/2 waitsate environment, despite a few graphic errors in the bloom effect showed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
