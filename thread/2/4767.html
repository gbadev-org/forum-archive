In a Disney-liscenced game, it's certainly inappropriate, though.

Perhaps it's based on an OTP memory (one-time-programmable, like an EPROM without a window or like a flash without an erase line). Ni–∏tendo has admitted publicly that future Nintendo DS carts will use an OTP memory made by <a class="postlink" href="http://www.matrixsemi.com/" target="_blank">Matrix Semiconductor</a> rather than a mask ROM.

I'd really like to know why people consider four-letter words so offensive? What does that accomplish? Sure, I mod away childish uses of obscene language, but I see little to nothing wrong with the occasional swear.

A copyright license from The Walt Disney Company has nothing necessarily to do with the level of potentially objectionable game content. For instance, the theatrical miniseries <span style="font-style: italic">Kill Bill</span> was published by Miramax, a division of Disney, and any video game adaptation would be licensed by Disney, and it would probably have swearing, and it would probably be M-rated. Likewise for any hypothetical video game adaptation of M. Night Shyamalan's PG-13 horror films, but probably with a T rating. But your point becomes valid once I replace "a Disney-liscenced game" (sic) with "an E-rated game".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

So, I don't know.  Is it possible this person got their hands on a bootleg copy, possibly from Hong Kong the video game piracy capitol of the world where you can buy a game that looks exactly like the original but it's not?  Or did this guy get a flash cart and download the rom?
<br/>
<br/>
Seems suspicious to me.  I'd like to see the entire credits of the cart in question, see if it matches what I've found.

Actually decided to watch the Mode 7 intro, that's where the text is.  And since the intro is at the very beginning, and according to the linked article above, which said...

There's still hope that they might sue the Sun for libel or something *fingers crossed* Difficult to know whether they would have a case for the dad if he bought it unknowingly.

My personal rule of thumb is to not bid on any GBA games from sellers in Asia (most "new" GBA games I run across on Ebay tend to ship from Hong Kong).  Sure, that won't weed out all of the pirated games, but it'll help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Either way the seller will just register a new ebay nick and start over again. However, you can have some fun with them by registering a fake ebay account and make sure you win ALL of their auctions and simply dont pay. Keep doing this until your account gets locked, then open a new account and continue.

They are often listed as "flattened boxes" or cartridge only.

Yeah, I don't know how they do it. I've had one once, the plastic was a lower quality but the rest of it looked the same as a real one, even down to it having a y head screw instead of a normal cross head that a lot of pirates have. It's fairly obvious that a cart is pirated once you get hold of it, even if you didn't notice the plastic the instruction book usually has about 8 pages and has no real content (mine was some review of the game, one step away from being written in l33t speak).
<br/>
<br/>
Doesn't really help you before you bid though, other than what's been mentioned the usual giveaway in the UK is the 'advance' on the box being written in black not white which means it is a copy of a US box, not a PAL one. And sometimes they say they are from a territory that has not had the game released yet. Not all say from Hong Kong as well, I bought mine from someone in the UK. It's a shame really, it's become impossible to sell GBA games on eBay apart from reputable sellers like the guy who runs Videogamesplus.ca etc.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">CanIKickIt(YES_YOU_CAN);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When my brother wound up getting pirate copies of the old Pokemon Gold and Silver carts off ebay a while back, most of them arrived with dead SRAM.  One seemed to be OK, but its SRAM died about six monthes later.

<br/>
Vulgar expressions don't convey any meaningful information, except perhaps anger.  Even that is pretty easy to discern from tone of voice.  Using the adjective forms of vulgar words in "every-day-talk" is especially silly as they don't convey anything at all- not even emotion.  That's not strictly true... vulgar language usage, especially excessive vulgar language usage, reveals more about the speaker's mindset and upbringing than anything else.  I can see why one might be offended by another with a generally vulgar mindset.
<br/>
<br/>
Let's say you bump into someone on the bus.  One of these responses probably gives a vastly different impression of the person you bumped into:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>...</ul>
<br/>
<ul>Excuse me?</ul>
<br/>
<ul>Whats your problem?</ul>
<br/>
<ul>What in *(^#ing *(&amp;$ is the (&amp;*$ing matter with you #$#$ing m&amp;#$#@( &amp;^#!er?!</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, there are people that actually speak like that.  (According to another denizen of this basement, there are people that speak worse than that...)  Admittedly, if one is trying to accurately portray people that swear, suspension of disbelief is broken if their language is cleaned up.

<br/>
It's better than tone of voice at conveying the *extent* of the anger or frustration, at least when used in text.  But there's more benefit to it than just conveying information. It serves as a (rather effective) way of releasing built-up tention, frustration, and/or anger. Just like violent games, it's a safe alternate to hitting someone or throwing/destroying something. And even if there wasn't any use to them, that still doesn't make it "bad" or offensive to use; there's plenty of things in life that have little to no use but are certainly not offensive or wrong. Besides, they're only words anyway, and as any pre-schooler knows, "Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never hurt me."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Verbal abuse does psychological damage which is worse than physical damage- it stays with a person for far many more year than physical damage.  Physical abuse also causes psychological scars- that is what ends up messing people up down the line, assuming the victim is not killed.

Verbal Abuse != Swearing.  It often involves swearing, but it's certainly not the same thing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sometimes it's funny too.
<br/>
And sometimes unnecessary as well.
<br/>
<br/>
e.g. I find Billy Connollys rambling tales quite funny, and his profanities add to the humour (for me anyway). However, Roy Chubby Brown is just a talentless failed comic, (again my view) but he did admit that when he started swearing in his act, people laughed, even when his jokes were rubbish.

No, they are not the same thing.  The sticks and stones saying is a false claim that verbal attacks are harmless because the damage can not be seen.  I don't think that it pertains to swearing at all.

Ok, but that just backs up my claim that swearing is fine, because 1. They're only words, and 2. They're not verbally abusive words.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think the word fuck for example, cen be used to strengthen a statement without actually by itself changing it's meaning.
<br/>
For example, which of the following would you say is the most excited about a game/project/whatever:
<br/>
- It's good
<br/>
- It's great
<br/>
- It's fucking brilliant<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
