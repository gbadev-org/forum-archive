<br/>
would anybody know anything about how the output of a USB webcam is structured.  I am looking to capture the image from the webcam and send wirelessly to the GBA ... Before i do so i figure i should have a basic understanding of the serial output...  any info or links to info would be greatly appreciated.....  thank you<br/>_________________<br/>KILLAH BEES SOLD 50 GOLD 60 PLATINUM</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">USB is not simply a "serial output" of the image.
<br/>
USB is waaay too complicated, you can't do this.
<br/>
If you want a cam, buy one with a general interface.
<br/>
<br/>
For wireless transmission of a image you need serious bandwidths, not sure how you'll be able to do that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">what we are thinking now is we have a camera with analog output ... we are thinking of breaking up the RGB values from the signal and giving them a 12 bit code ..... we will be cutting the number of possible colours to around 4000.  and also our framerate will be very low....

thanx for your input<br/>_________________<br/>KILLAH BEES SOLD 50 GOLD 60 PLATINUM</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This would in effect put video digitizer hardware on a cartridge.

<br/>
You can go full 15 bit on this as long as you do the gamma correction inside the cartridge hardware.

<br/>
There are 280,896 cycles per frame.  A DMA from the cartridge to VRAM can pull 16 bits per 2 cycles.  A 240x160 mode 3 (15-bit) bitmap takes 38,400 16-bit words, which should take 76,800 cycles to transfer from the cartridge.  It should fit comfortably within a frame's time.
<br/>
<br/>
By now, it looks a lot like a TV tuner.  You might as well broadcast the video camera's output on a weak TV signal and then pick it up on a TV tuner like the one available from Lik Sang.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
