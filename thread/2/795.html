With so many rich people on the planet there should be no reason
<br/>
for people to starve. 
<br/>
But I guess people like Bill Gates (Sorry Microsoft, just pullin' BILLIONAIRE's names out of the air) are too selfish &amp; greedy :(<br/>_________________<br/>---------------------------------------------------

So if you look at it relatively, I give more.

With all the spare money he (and other billlionaires) have, they could END world hunger INSTANTLY.<br/>_________________<br/>---------------------------------------------------

And I've also read that when he dies, most of his money will go to charity.

It's not fair to accuse him of not supporting charity.

I don't think world hunger is as much about money as it is about politics.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

At MSFT's IPO price of $21 per share Bill's initial fortune was worth $233,982,000 or $233.98 Million. Adjusted for splits, if Bill had not sold any stock since then, he would have 3,208,896,000 shares. Those shares would be worth $85,099,921,920.00 or $85.1 Billion today.

So there is no way he's donate $200 Billion.

I don't know about his will, but I do hope that part is true.

Here are some interesting facts:

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">According to the National Coalition for the Homeless, there are 760,000 homeless people in America. Bill could give each of them $42,212.62. 
<br/>
<br/>
According to the people at Save the Children it costs $240 to sponsor one child for a year. This means that Bill could save 133,673,311 (133.67 Million) of the children. Of course, there are only 58.5 million people (adults included) in all of Ethiopia.  
<br/>
<br/>
According to the people at Make-A-Wish, it costs between $3000 and $4000 to grant a wish to an ill child. Assuming an average of $3500 per wish, Bill could grant the wishes of 9,166,169 or 9.17 Million children. 
<br/>
<br/>
 It costs roughly $30,000 to purchase the supplies to build a 3 bedroom home for Habitat for Humanity. (Labor is donated.) Bill could donate supplies for 1,069,386 homes. Since these are 3 bedroom homes, let's assume 4 1/2 occupants per house; Bill could house 4,812,239 people.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all!
<br/>
<br/>
This is some of a topic to dicuss in a development forum! :-)
<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, I think it is interesting and I would therefore like to contribute with some thoughts in relation to the war in Iraq. First of all, USA was offering Turkey 30 BILLION DOLLAR (!!!) just to be able to attack Iraq from their country, and the whole war will cost - not only the USA but Europe as well - much, much more than this; furthermore, after the war we will have a huge work to do rebuilding the country; think about what could have been done with all this money in countries such as Africa, Asia etc. This is billions of billions of dollars we're talking here!
<br/>
<br/>
So yes, it is a highly political subject: USA are willing to offer billions of billions of dollars in a war but they are not even willing to sign the Kyoto-treatment.

Apparantly he gave away a total of $555M in the year 2001, and he continue to do so.
<br/>
<br/>
I agree on the war stuff... One could probably buy a few very good assasains for a fraction of the cost. ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
