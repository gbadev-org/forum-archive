    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The license of wolf3d is not one of the Compatible Source Licenses described by the RPSL. So I'd guess they are incompatible unless you use the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#MereAggregation" target="_blank">FSF-approved loophole</a> of a multitasking system that allows separate, cooperatively multitasked programs to run together. For instance, you could set it up so that wolf3d starts the MP3 decoder as a separate process whose output is directed to a file descriptor in wolf3d. The <a class="postlink" href="http://mpg321.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">mpg321</a> program does this by acting as a process that wraps the MAD library. The more it looks like one process being piped into another using an imitation of UNIX methods, the less likely that your combined work will be considered a Derivative Work.
<br/>
<br/>
But still, why would wolf3d need an MP3 decoder? Didn't it use sequenced music? And given the ease of writing a portal engine (the general case of a raycaster), and the unsuitability of the wolf3d subject matter for users in Germany and its border states, why would you need to port wolf3d instead of making a similar game from scratch?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <h4>#119137 - Firon - Tue Feb 20, 2007 1:18 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lazy1: what I did to bring sizes down was to resample to 32768Hz before encoding (which is the DS's native sample rate, so works best). I then used -fx6b180 to encode some songs and got very good results. Couldn't hear any obvious quantization noise. 160kbps doesn't sound so good, though.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the reason I say -f is because fast needs less CPU than normal mode to decode. Even though you should be able to do normal in realtime on the ARM7, it's always nice to have extra CPU available. I've not done any benchmarks on the DS, but you might want to see if it works.
<br/>
<br/>
If you use mono music, then decoding is a joke. But stereo is so nice. :)
<br/>
<br/>
x6 enhances quality without slowing down decoding, but makes encoding slower (x1-x6 are the available options.) I think it's worth it, though. If you're pressed for time, x3 is a good happy medium.
<br/>
<br/>
Another nice benefit is that it uses a whole 10KB less of memory than Helix!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But you can high-level-emulate it, translating NoteOn commands into NoteOn commands in a MIDI synth. <span style="font-style: italic">Doom</span> source ports for PC do the same thing.

You could always use MP2 instead if a decoder is available. It has a lower computational complexity than MP3, which is why MoonShell uses it for DPG audio.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

This is not what I meant.  If I were to rephrase your quote, I'd put it like this:  ignore the rules <span style="font-weight: bold">if and only if</span> nobody will care about what you are doing.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are working on a proof of concept that will never leave your computer, your licenses don't need to match.  You can replace one of the components later, if you ever decide to distribute your application.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't most of the license issues appear at the distribution level?  You should be able to combine GPL code with proprietary code as long you only distribute it to other people who have access to the proprietary libraries.  I'd double check that, though.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">New issues/questions:
<br/>
<br/>
1:
<br/>
Some sounds within wolfenstein use the ym3812 sound hardware instead of pcm sound. Since emulating that sound hardware is impossible and converting them won't work (broken emulator, plays sound half way only) I decided to record myself playing wolfenstein then cut out the sounds and save them separately.
<br/>
<br/>
This would be an easy solution and only take up 13KB of memory but I was informed on IRC that this would be illegal.
<br/>
I don't understand why though, it was taken from the freely available shareware version and would be distributed with the same program it was supposed to be used with.
<br/>
<br/>
I have run out of ideas on how to get those sounds working, I tried the ym3812 emulator from dosbox but it only gives silence.
<br/>
<br/>
2:
<br/>
I think the arm7 may not be fast enough to decode wavpack, it takes about 2-3 seconds for the arm9 to decode 1 second if I remember correctly.
<br/>
Then again I might not be doing it properly, I don't know anything about audio but I'm assuming that I'm not supposed to decode 1 second at a time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
