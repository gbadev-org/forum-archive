    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright - we've got a perfect new location for the DS Multiplay tomorrow. Slainte Bar &amp; Lounge! It's huge, it's clean and the lighting is low. There are 2 for 1 drinks until 8PM so arrive a little early to "power up" with some pints. We're bumping the event up an hour from 8 to 7PM for this very purpose...
<br/>
<br/>
TIME:
<br/>
7PM-Whenever
<br/>
<br/>
LOCATION:
<br/>
Slainte
<br/>
304 Bowery NYC 10012
<br/>
(at 1st street)
<br/>
Tel: 212 253 7030
<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:
<br/>
* B, D, F, V to Broadway-Lafayette Street
<br/>
* 6 to Bleeker Street
<br/>
<br/>
Here's pictures of the place. This place is ideal and they're happy to have us, so show up, bring all your DS games and let's have a great multiplay.
<br/>
<br/>
See you tomorrow!

(Actually not a DS documentation issue at all at this point, most of us are fighting with our wireless drivers... &lt;sigh&gt;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
