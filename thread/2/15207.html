<br/>
<br/>
could someone create a snes emulator for a mobile phone, that would be great. Surely the phones today have fast enough processors. especially the sybians
<br/>
<br/>
i love emulators 
<br/>
i have found a gameboy emulator for mobile phones. It allows you to play both original and colour. Bit buggy as most emu's are but the guy has my praise seeing that there are hardly any emulators for mobile phones out there. 
<br/>
<br/>
It works on all phones with java but the newer the phone the better the performance. 
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of any other mobile phone emulators?? 
<br/>
<br/>
The emu is called meboy

Don't expect it, especially in this part of the internet, because this is about GBA and DS development, not mobile phone development.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sweet, I get right on creating the emulator for you.  What were you think in terms of price and time?  Also, are you going to include the development kit and registration fees or should I just invoice you for those as well?  I'm surprised that no one else has created one of these yet.  Everyone knows that creating emulators is so easy, a caveman coudl do it.  Even better, creating one on a platform as variable as cellphones, where very phone has its own API and hardware makes it even easier yet!  ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
