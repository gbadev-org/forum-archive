I guess you could completely remake the game engine using the graphics that are OS, but it would take a while.

Flash is awesome for prototyping games and tools, so long as you don't need to do any deep computational work.  You can't port, but you can rewrite.

There are plenty of flash decompilers.  I think Action Script Viewer is supposedly the best.  Never used it.  Costs about $60 IIRC.

A remake is the only way to go.

Sure, that would be awesome for you, but what incentive does anyone have to make a remake for you?  Everyone is busy working on their own stuff.  If you don't have time to learn to code, make time to learn.  No matter how busy you are, I bet you spend 15 minutes a day on it.

Never use flash decompilers on code that you shouldn't be seeing in the first place. That is completely wrong to do.

You should read Macromedia's white paper on security.  I'd pull it up, but I don't have time now.  There no such thing as "flash code that you shouldn't be seeing in the first place".  That's like trying write secure HTML.

EDIT:
<br/>
Anything that needs to kept secure will be handled by server side scripts and/or be transferred in dynamically.
