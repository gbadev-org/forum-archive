Uh, yes they are. Both of them are "recognised" by several virus scanners and I had to modify devkitARM code to prevent *all* nds files being flagged as one of these.

I was thinking of having:
<br/>
<br/>
A tiny database that just checks for the DS brickers.  I'll need copies of the brickers rather than just the MD5's so I can generate a hex value for it.  Also you could use it inversely for checking whether files have been tampered with (Flashme etc).
<br/>
<br/>
The full database but split up into A-M virii and M-Z to stop it running out of memory
<br/>
<br/>
Having the full database is still useful IMO, as you could use it as a 'clean' platform to test specific files on your PC.  To get the file across, you could either just copy it onto the media, use ftp or it would probably be pretty easy to knock up something for Boa (mini httpd) so you could 'submit' it to your DS for checking.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Really none, The only Virus was made by DarkFader (Most likely paid off or from some bet since at the time DS owners were all high and mighty with 'We cant get viruses' after the PSP broke out) and was in taihen.zip and romloader.zip Like Tepples said. The programs are old and useless since they came out back in 05' or 06' and we have much better NDS software now.
<br/>
<br/>
Its very unlikely anyone will remake a virus or convert the viruses to new software (Even if they can get a hold of them) since its very useless. And at the same time, needs A LOT of work  in order to be distributed and recieve eyesight. With very little, basically no gain

Wrong, VERY wrong. A Virus is a program that is made to cause damage to internal systems/processing (Meaning its aimed at the Operating System or Firmware of a system.) and often retain it utterly useless and a brick (Hence, bricking it)<br/>_________________<br/>laos,

As for scanning.. Could you imagine what it would be like for the DS to run a full database scan?  It's bad enough on a 2.8Ghz PC to run scanners.. forget about it on a DS.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Using ClamAV with a  24MB daily.cvd, it took about 20-30 minutes to scan the 40byte (or thereabouts) EICAR test file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
