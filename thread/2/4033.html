    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So here's the deal I have like 4 consoles in one room. The cords are everywhere, you have to change connections to play each one, and its generally a big mess. I see only one solution.  Create a giant computer containing the hardware from each system so all games will be playable at once with a universal controller.  Through the use of plastic and crudely drawn plans, it will be possible. What do you think?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This may be your very first post on these forums, but you really need to think about what you're saying. Taking hardware apart, and putting them all together and expecting them to work is folly. Beside, you'll be voiding your warrenty on the more recent consoles. =P
<br/>
<br/>
Like keldon said, get a junction box. You may not get the spiffy universal controller that you wanted, but it's better than going through the trouble of going with your plan that is most certain to fail. Sorry to sound straight forward with this, but you know it to be true, either now or later.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You're likely going to have more fun tearing apart your old consoles than you'll have playing most of the games. Sure, you might screw something up, but think of the rewards! A crazy plan gone right will silence your harshest critics and give you a story to tell for the rest of your life.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, it would be C. O. O. L. Projects like that are more creative and challenging than ANY video game.

Hey Keldon, what's a "scart junction box"?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">RobotCheese, I am not going to try to dissuade you from such a noble project, but you are in for a world of hurt if you want to make one controller talk to all of those units. Godspeed and good luck; me, I'd buy a USB controller and a TV-out card for my computer and plug into emulation heaven.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A scart junction box is a box that takes in a couple of scart inputs and has one scart output. this is ideal for gaming as you don't have to go behind the TV.
<br/>
<br/>
To make a single machine would be pointless. To do that there would have to be a central processor with software of its own that will control the other pieces of hardware. You will still have to put the different media into each machine.
<br/>
<br/>
And a certain level of skill is required to carry out a project like this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Keldon, scart cables are a European-only thing. In America they use A/V cinch cables to transport signals to and from their televisions. But there should be something equivalent (a multiplexer?) for that type of cable, too.
