<br/>
<br/>
Because Datel's adapter runs on emulation (I heard Datel licensed Marat's GBA emulator source code) rather than through a modded GBA motherboard, it might have a hole in it allowing for streaming a full-size ROM directly from the PC to the Cube without a flash cart.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The GBA's cart bus needs ca. 200ns latency at 3/1 wait state. I don't think a PC solution provides that. If you want a device that looks like a cart with a cable coming out of it, you might as well just get an EFA flash cart. I was hoping that a PC program would be able to stream a GBA binary directly to Datel's emulator.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
