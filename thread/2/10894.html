I pressed "other":
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know you guys personaly, i just read a lot about "split", "drama", "facts" and so on...
<br/>
And i don't think most of the people in #dsdev or (passive) readers in this forum understand whats going on. At least, I don't.
<br/>
I read a few of the off topic stuff (forgiveness, who hates/destroyes the scene) and was there when some people flamed #dsdev with anti-SC banners, but i still don't get it.
<br/>
<br/>
I will shortly sum up, what i know. I do this only to tell you, what i think about the whole stuff (and perhaps becouse you can see then, why my conlusio is wrong, because i missed some part of the storry ;-)
<br/>
This is not a bid to explain it to me, because i know, this will end up in a new flamewar without any new information for me :-(
<br/>
<br/>
So, in the beginning, DF has done some heplfull stuff for the community (i see his name on my console whenever i compile a nds, he has done some kind of flashingtool for the gbamp firmware).
<br/>
Then came the bricker. It was wrong to do it, it was wrong to release it, but he was sorry.
<br/>
A few weeks later i remember asking in IRC, why he was still banned (ok, it was wrong, but he said hes sorry and it was a while ago). I got something with piracy back.
<br/>
As an alternative there was #mellowdsdev
<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago i heared, there was a new home for #dsdev on a new server, without the bans. A new start. Sounded great (because i still didn't understand the perma-ban).
<br/>
So i joined that channel.
<br/>
<br/>
One day i couldn't. I needed a registration and a password. Plus DF was again banned. I once tried (just for fun) to join #mellowdsdev on blizzed - and got instandly banned. Whooho my first ban and i didn't do anything!
<br/>
<br/>
And now all i read is "foo is destroing the scene", "bar has done nothing for the scene".
<br/>
<br/>
When #dsdev on blizzed was a try to start over without the silly (sorry, but i still don't know the "facts") bans, flamewars and the whole acting-like-10-year-olds, it failed.
<br/>
<br/>
I know what some people will say now: "Oh, DF had 5,6 new chances and he allways..." I just know of the bricker and the "SC must leave" banners in IRC back then (but i don't know if these were from DF like everyone said iirc). This is one (or perhaps(!)) two reasons for a temporary (imho) ban, not 5.
<br/>
<br/>
This is just to tell you, how little is known by (most? some? at least me) of the people. For us it's like watching 6 year olds in the sand who argue about who has the right to have the shovel...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

He makes the move to wherever a pointless excercise IMHO. I'll stick with #mellow thankyou.

And StoneCyph saying he didn't give me the perm ban is a lie. Just because BRP did the honours dosn't mean it wasn't on Stone's behalf.

Sometimes people will attack you personally, flame without an apparent reason, etc., even if you don't screw up (or have only screwed up in their imagination). In this case, complaining is the way to really screw up.
<br/>
<br/>
These flamers are either lamers who don't have a clue but believe themselves to be experts, or would-be psychologists testing whether you'll screw up. The other readers either ignore them, or find ways to deal with them on their own. The flamers' behavior creates problems for themselves, which don't have to concern you.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't let yourself be drawn into a flamewar, either. Most flames are best ignored ? after you've checked whether they are really flames, not pointers to the ways in which you have screwed up, and not cleverly ciphered answers to your real question (this happens as well).

There is a single problem that continues to be fed this flood of bullshit.

This community has a problem which has lost too many intelligent people to this community due to a select groups inability to communicate without aggressively forcing their own egocentric optionated opinions.

Sure we know - the mods here are on the side of the forum posters... Since some forum poster - I am volunteering myself as an example here - don't really care who hurt whose feelings on IRC, it would be best not to clutter up the board with that drama. The bottom line is that locking threads that are essentially spam doesn't make the mods here biased, it makes them good moderators.

Then someone mentioned the bricker again and SC began his ranting.
<br/>
He could've asked me to remove that text from my site... but he needed his op-friends for that.
<br/>
Then following a temporary kickban and I admit I went too quickly into a wrong strategy after that but I didn't think that'd get me a global ban on the bots.
<br/>
<br/>
Heck, I've had a global ban on the bot before (EFnet) for no reason at all. After some talking that went from global to just #dsdev again.
<br/>
They somehow see me as a threat, yet claim that nobody takes me seriously anyway.
<br/>
Right now, I'd be happy with just an unban from the other channels. That way it wouldn't feel like a tyranny as the situation now appears.

If they comply, I'll withdraw from this server move matter. The results from this poll are pretty clear already anyways.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not to steal your "thunder" DF, but this whole thing isn't just about you!  My point about the "sides" is that they ARE NOT clear!  I'm not on "DarkFader's" side..  I'm on my side as I think most people here would agree they are on their "own" side..  By all means I am not on HeadSpin/HeadKaze's side, as I have lost all respect for him.  But, I treat him the same as I treat everyone else on IRC.
<br/>
<br/>
And to say "what is going on" and expect an direct answer is really a joke.  Both sides (as they seem to be grouped) can't seem to possibly explain anything without rumor or opinion.  I personally can only tell you my point of view.  So to get an aswer that sums up the whole problem just can't be giving by one person.  And if someone tells you they can sum it up themselves, they either A) don't know the problems or B) are lying.
<br/>
<br/>
As for "spam" and cluttering up the forums..  Well, There are a LOT of posts on this forum that I don't read.. These posts only use up ONE whole line per post and are easily passed over.  If you don't care, don't click on it.. it's that easy.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem with saying "leave IRC on IRC" is that everything turns into a Flamewar on IRC and nothing can/will change.  Obviously the forums can't/won't help either, but it didn't hurt to try.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well on that note we can conclude that the forums worked as an outlet to resolve this situation, which is good. Now I hope that eventually you will all get along.
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly just move on, forget the past and otherwise you will get perm banned. If someone speaks of the bricker, come up and say, "it was me, I was wrong I am sorry". If SC says a snide comment, don't act on it immediately, he may retract and apologize if you give him space to - just remember his mod status. Not that I am putting everything on you, but remember who has the power in the channel, so you would be foolish to not consider biting your tongue on the odd occasion in your probabationary period - because that is what this is in a sense.
<br/>
<br/>
IMO the adult way is to admit you are wrong when you are right, it makes you the bigger 'man'. And eventually you will be known and remembered for your good work and not your bad, or any drama associated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Depends on what "conspiracy theory" you are talking about.. Not that I really care anyway.  I wasn't there, so I don't know what you were told, what theory you were trying to find the truth about, I just came in when you were trying to start cracp on #dsdev.  Now, there were FACTS involved with a theory.  Your stupidity just made the facts harder to follow and didn't help anything.  If you would have been trustworthy, waited a few days, you would have been able to read the REAL story, not just rumor you heard on IRC.  Not only have you lost my trust, but my respect as well.  Respectful people don't act like that.. Even in make believe "internet land".<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
