As of today, Lik-Sang.com will not be in the position to accept any new orders and will cancel and refund all existing orders that have already been placed. Furthermore, Lik-Sang is working closely with banks and PayPal to refund any store credits held by the company, and the customer support department is taking care of any open transactions such as pending RMAs or repairs and shipping related matters. The staff of Lik-Sang will make sure that nobody will get hurt in the crossfire of this ordeal.

Our records indicates you can retrieve an additional $ 9,99 USD refund in your PayPal account. In order to successfully retrieve the refund please confirm your existing PayPal account on this page. Please notice that the confirmation of your PayPal account is needed to have this refund send into your PayPal account.

The whole thing might seem reasonable if it weren't for the fact that I don't have a PayPal account (PayPal don't like South Africa, or anywhere in Africa really...). Hence, I never informed Lik-Sang about any of the non-existant PayPal accounts that I don't have (Yes, I know, double-negative, it's intentional...).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, another important problem with this is the fact that the last time I bought anything from Lik-Sang was about 2 months ago, so I have no clue what this supposed refund is for...
<br/>
<br/>
Phishing? That's what I think this is...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else gotten anything similar?<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dunno, is that a copy/paste from your e-mail?  If so, mouse over the links and see if they are truly to the ones listed in your post.  If they link to anywhere besides Lik-Sang or PayPal, they are phishing.  If they do in fact link to the correct sites.. I don't know what they would be phishing for..
