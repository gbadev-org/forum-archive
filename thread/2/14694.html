    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Funny thing, when reading a forum today I realised that I read out aloud in my head, as in there's a little voice in my head that I listen to who speaks what I'm reading. It's a man, with a British accent (probably because I'm British), and recently he's been reminding me of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0079273/" target="_blank">Paul Bettany</a> o_O</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What did you get up to at the weekend to cause Paul Bettany to appear in your head?  Although I frequently find unless I actually say the words 'aloud' in my head I tend not to read them properly.  I'll get to the end of a paragraph and realise that I've not actually read any of it and have to read it again</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I watched A Knights Tale a few days ago, maybe that's why. I think the thing we're talking about is concentration, and to know that I got through school, college and university without knowing what that was or that I should be listening to that voice!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
