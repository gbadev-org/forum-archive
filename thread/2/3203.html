According to your member details, you live in Washington. Any chance you could offer some relocation help for our fearless FAQ maintainer?
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone needs to relocate to the Denver area, let me know. ;)

I do not know why but I was suspecting something like this :O)

Seriously, that's good to see that talented people can make their way through homebrew development. After the guys from Neopong who found a publisher, or tepples who got an offer, it shows that one can succeed !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I hope you like Seattle, but I don't really have much relocation advice other than some restaurant recommendations. And commuting accross the lake is never worth it, even if you'll have that cooler apartment in the city...

Only an educated guess about who you were based on location, level of expertise, and some posts you made about tile map techniques.
<br/>
<br/>
I was a PC/Mac dev. lead there several years ago. Got burned out and moved on... I'm genuinely just a hobbyist on the GBA stuff though, VERY intermittently doing a rewrite on my favorite 8-bit RPG.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Excellent.  Yep, I'm a Griptonite Lead and yes we've done a bunch of Harry Potter games in which I was the lead on all but the first GBA version.  And yes, I know more than is healthy about both the GBC and the GBA.  I can also say that in the many years working for my boss, I've yet to get burned out to the point that a few weeks off doesn't make me want to come back and do some more work for him.  Griptonite is just a great place to work.  Hopefully, you are gainfully employeed and happy wherever you are currently working as I know I am.  :)
