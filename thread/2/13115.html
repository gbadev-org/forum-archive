    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry, but this is absolutely important and quite shocking.
<br/>
<br/>
Please dont dismiss this, as this WILL effect almost every gamer in the UK.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Cut a long story short;
<br/>
<br/>
GAME have just bought out Gamestation.
<br/>
<br/>
This means;
<br/>
<br/>
*Less choice in the High Street
<br/>
*Higher prices in the High Street
<br/>
*No-one to price check against
<br/>
*Lower trade-in amounts
<br/>
*Less support for older products
<br/>
<br/>
While other stores (HMV/Virgin) do sale some game products, their
<br/>
selections are infinitesimally smaller. Many things Gamestation
<br/>
sale's even Game did not. (specifically retro/older stuff, as well as
<br/>
more 3rd party hardware rather then 1st party ones made abroad).
<br/>
<br/>
Effectively , there is no competition for Game now on the vaste
<br/>
majority of products.
<br/>
<br/>
Which is a very bad thing!
<br/>
<br/>
I am absolutely shocked this has been allowed too happen.
<br/>
It would be like Tesco's buying out Sainburys.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
While I dont hold up much hope, I really urge you all too spread the word, and sent polite notes to the competition/Office of Fair Trading;
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please, I know this may seem boring, but its very important.
<br/>
Even if you prefer your local GAME to your local Gamestation, it still will be terrible thing if Game are the only dedicated retailer.
<br/>
<br/>
Id advise just a short polite note to the email above (or the address)
<br/>
State the objection in logical terms.
<br/>
Specifically that this will reduce competition &amp;or give them a monopoly.
<br/>
GAMES excuse is likely to be that you can still buy games elsewhere, so perhapes also pointing out that other retailers have only a tiny sub-set of gaming products.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am not a UK person but that sounds like GameStop in the US. Basically the FuncoLand was not doing well so they sold it to whoever owns GameStop and eventaully EB games.

Good Luck getting enough people to want there store back. Personally I don't think Europe is barely making out in the Video Game department with the constant delays, restrictions, and changes.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't imagine how somebody would pull a world three scale operation to release a game system from Europe and still have games in Europe be top notch and not upgraded when it reaches the States or Japan*
<br/>
<br/>
* I am just mentioning this since I heard about an CC64 comeback in Germany but as a full fledged game system this time around. It would be nice to see it as Apple competitor again and still play those tape drive games.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's odd because I always thought that gamestation was bigger than GAME! In my area the gamestation stores are 2-5 times the size of GAME stores; but I don't think the petition is necessary, the competition commission is probably on the case already.

Having said that you can create an <a class="postlink" href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/" target="_blank">e-petition</a> and have the government order an investigation from the competition commission.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
*slams head on desk* But will GAME keep the GameStation shops seperate and carry on selling what they sell (but at GAME prices), or will they just change every Gamestation into a new GAME?
<br/>

Well, I just took a look at that PDF. No idea what the business garbage means.

They are not, I emailed them and also checked their current case's.
<br/>
You apperently cant suggest it to them directly, you have too go ver the Office of Fair Tradeing.
<br/>
If the OFT gets enough cause for concern, they will pass it too the Competition Commision.
<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I dont think it will take much.
<br/>
Probably 10-20 emails from different people.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I dont hold up much hope overall, but Id at least like the issue investigated.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

<br/>
We are currently in the process of writing to the acquiring company
<br/>
asking them to provide detailed information about the transaction.
<br/>
Should the merger qualify for investigation under the Enterprise Act
<br/>
2002 the OFT will consider whether the creation of that situation may be
<br/>
expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any
<br/>
market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services that
<br/>
warrants reference to the Competition Commission.
<br/>
<br/>
Your comments will be taken into account in assessing the significance
<br/>
of this merger.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for bringing this transaction to our attention.

Yours sincerely

This is the OFT note, it hasnt gone to the CC yet.
<br/>
They do say our comments will be taken into account, however.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing it will be argued that games can still be bought elsewhere, so it all comes down too a percentages game.
<br/>
<br/>
Does/did Game station offer enough of a service different to HMV/Virgin to be considered competition for game?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Doing some research, I dont hold out much hope because Waterstones recently bought out Okatics.  Different market, but still a simerla situtation.
<br/>
Apperently WHSmith sold enough books to be considered competition despite Waterstones being the only big bookstores chain left.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Gamestation were the only 'real' game competition for GAME. Consumer wise gamestation wins hands down; they give you more, sell for less, have classic games stocked! Most gamestation shops outdo GAME stores in the local area, but GAME stores are everywhere. We will just have to wait and see if they start messing around with it.
<br/>
<br/>
I remember when they were (EB) called Virtual Reality (or Virtual Reality before it was bought out).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree.
<br/>
But also I think Gamestation was more locally managed then Game.
<br/>
Seemed to be more stock variance and differences between the stores I knew in different areas.
<br/>
I have also heard that some Gamestations are quite bad.
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, I guess we will see an instant stabilization of prices. Gamestation wont be beating game on price in anything any more.
<br/>
And its nothing but bad news for the consumer.
<br/>
<br/>
I really hope the OFT can see that no other store really competes with Game now.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --
