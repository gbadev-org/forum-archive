    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The new Super Smash Bros. for the Wii (Super Smash Bros. BRAWL) has a really cool sounding main theme, which you can listen to from their main page. The downside? The lyrics in the song are all in what appears to be latin. It would be particularly awesome to know what those lyrics are in english, but I don't know latin, and my friends that do can only translate it's written form.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Translating the latin text I'm sure wouldn't be that difficult, if I had it. Problem is, I only have a recording. I would need someone to write the text down before I could translate it, and it seems like that person could probably translate it at the same time.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

<br/>
i am sure somebody would be able to at least write it down - latin's spelling is  fairly regular and similar to the pronounciation (as oppossed to french...), if i remember right from my chorus days...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
