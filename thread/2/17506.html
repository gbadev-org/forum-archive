<br/>
<br/>
I made an application which work as an hexadecimal terminal. It can communicate with a Gameboy Advance connected to the parallel port of a PC with a Xboo cable. The application is protocoltool and it's available on SourceForge.
<br/>
<br/>
The communication is possible with the 8-bit and 32-bit modes, but the Joybus protocol isn't implemented since I don't know the hardware level protocol. Since I use bit banging on the PC side, I need to know the proper format for transmitting/receiving and handshaking.
<br/>
<br/>
I have the register documentation for the Gameboy side.
<br/>
<br/>
Does someone has any information on this?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.
<br/>
<br/>
