    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If this is your first programming job, emphasize your level of interest in programming, your desire to learn new skills and techniques, and especially your excitement about the prospect of working in a professional <span style="font-weight: bold">collaborative</span> environment.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry about advertising your technical aptitude -- your interviewers will ask you what they need to know.  If you don't know the answer to a technical question, be honest about that, and try not to be embarrassed.  "I haven't done that yet" is a nice answer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A friend of mine interviews people every day for entry-level jobs in the games industry, and he tells me that the occasional "applicant in a suit" really impresses him. I interview and interact with software dev guys a lot, and I feel the same way. Show me some "old fashioned" respect and I will remember you.
<br/>
<br/>
Because, unless you got the interview from a personal referral, chances are that you're one of dozens of applicants with virtually identical resumes. So how will you stand out?

Personally I think people who show up in a suit stand out, but in the wrong way. It doesn't have to do with respect, it's about understanding company culture and fitting in with it. I've never worked at a company where a suit is the standard outfit, so my first impression whenever a guy show up in a suit for a job interview I think that this guy doesn't understand what games is about. Obviously, as with everything else, my view of a person change as I talk to them.
<br/>
<br/>
In general I'd say it's a sad state of affairs if the clothes you wear makes for an important factor, when all the end customer care about is being entertained, and not so much about hte clothes a programmer was wearing when making the game.
<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to game jobs interviews I have 2 interviews where I've stood out in a really obvious manor (and by pure chance as I've been blissfully unaware of everything, really.. :) ) The first job was with an old demo group so they received tons and tons of really fancy demo effects that just couldn't be applied to games programming, so I got the job because I was think about occlusion, FOV and LOD's. The other job I got, the person hiring me said he was fed up with seing the standard FPS shooter engine so when I showed a really simple puzzle game, a complete game with music, sound effects, front end, all game logic, a couple of levels, cutscenes etc, he was really impressed. I guess impressed to see someone actually thinking about something playable and enjoyable instead of focusing on the technical low level bits. Obviously this depends on what job you're applying for! :)<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The job interview was yesterday, and I think it went quite well.
<br/>
<br/>
From the moment I entered the building, I tried to gauge what kind of atmosphere there was... trying to remember not to stand there like a lemon when anybody spoke to me.
<br/>
<br/>
The position is a games dev one year placement (I have to do one as part of my degree); the interview was with the head of the specific division I'd be working in, the senior programmer who I'd be working with, and the student who held the position the year just gone.
<br/>
<br/>
I feel the interview went pretty smoothly, I managed to explain myself clearly, without endlessly repeating myself or forgetting what I was saying.
<br/>
<br/>
There were parts of the interview where there was a split second of noticeable silence where I thought <span style="font-style: italic">"Uh oh... are they thinking of a question... should I ask one. Losing momentum. Wait... I've got a plan."</span> and leapt in with "Perhaps we should discuss... &lt;something about CV&gt;" or "I've prepared a demonstration of my handheld project, would you like to see it." (or something like that)
<br/>
<br/>
Questions... discussion... info... they seemed to enjoy my games (!) and it all seemed to go like a dream from there. At the end, I thanked them for their time, said I enjoyed the interview and asked what the next stage was...
<br/>
<br/>
I find out how I did at the end of next week. :D<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
