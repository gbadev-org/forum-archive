<br/>
<br/>
I made a software on a linux PC for testing/debugging different ports/interface and one of them is a Gameboy Advanced connected to a PC's parallel port with a Xboo cable. This is currently in development, and I would like any ideas, feedbacks, wish list or wanted features for this.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,
<br/>
<br/>
