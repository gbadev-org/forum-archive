    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hiya im sure this has been asked many times before so first i wish to say i am sorry for any kind of repeated message.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway my name is Martyn and i am apart of a newly formed Game Development company, now our first game is not a computer game however it is a Trading Card Game and we are hoping to start producing it in around 4 months. Now we are very excited about this as we have had a lot of interest from hopefully future players. Now we are doing the TCG as self-Publishing.
<br/>
<br/>
My main question is this, i am hoping to create a series of computer/console games based on the card game and one of them games i have planed to appear on the GBA now the game is pretty much designed on paper and i have an artist lined up (still looking for programmer) but my main question is this
<br/>
<br/>
If i went and sent a demo of the GBA game to a licensed publisher doe they generally look outside of there own company to publish games?
<br/>
<br/>
Any answers will be greatly accepted :)
<br/>

It's happened before, but rarely. Your game would have to be truly exceptional to gather much interest, and it would probably need to be much more than a "demo." There are a few people on this forum who have been able to get published through an existing licensee, but it sounds like they started the process with a game that was essentially complete.
<br/>
<br/>
Your challenge with this project is that most of the really experienced programmers in the homebrew scene are working on their own projects. It's hard to convince someone to join your team unless you're offering to pay them.
<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, it's much easier to self-publish a card game. I'd focus your efforts there. If that portion is successful, you'll have the reputation and money to pursue the gameboy angle. If your card game is really successful, you'd probably be smarter selling the license to an established development company, anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck! It sounds like a cool project.
