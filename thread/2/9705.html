    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK i opened it up :P hehehe
<br/>
<br/>
just put it together again, now it wont turn on
<br/>
if i plug in the charger, it lights up for a sec then goes off
<br/>
<br/>
if i turn it on, THEN plug the charger in - it turns the screen light on for a sec and makes a little high pitch squeak for about a second then it all goes blank
<br/>
<br/>
What might I have done?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It sounds like you knocked something loose, or damaged a part. Generally, if the GBA ends up recieving too much power or not enough power this will happen. Except for the squeak. I can't exactly explain that. I would recommend opening it up and looking in the power supply area. (If anything is suddenly black that wasn't before, it goes into early retirement.)

Did you clear yourself of static charge before cracking it open? (please tell me you weren't foolish enough not to)

Well, I didn't care much about the GBA so I did not. I guess this is most probably the reason then? Heh.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, when I opened up my DS I defiently got myself static-free. That lives well thankfully :P
<br/>
<br/>
Oh well; I still have 2 GBAs :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I took out the battery, tried one from my other GBASP - that worked. I tried the old battery again and it was fine..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
