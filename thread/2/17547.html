    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys,
<br/>
<br/>
On the topic of "what we've been up to recently," I just launched a Kickstarter campaign for a new (and old) pen &amp; paper RPG project of mine: Children of Fire.
<br/>
<br/>
Children of Fire is a story-focused RPG where players are angels (or any of a host of other supernatural creatures in the related mythos.) So if you'd be interested in owning a copy of the game and supporting indie game design, check it out:

BUT, the campaign is still going. You can still preorder the rulebook for only $25, and I've instituted a stretch goal... if we get 2x the backers I had hoped for, I'll bundle the Children of Clay expansion into the deal.

P.S. This Kickstarter thing is a fantastic way to fund game dev projects. Had we had this a few years ago I think we'd have seen an even more vibrant homebrew scene, since people could make enough money to make it worth all of those hours.

Hahaha. I <span style="font-style: italic">am</span> funding the project. The kickstarter campaign is market research: are people interested in this thing? Do they care to have a color version or should I just do it in B&amp;W? Now I have an answer.
<br/>
<br/>
In my mind, Kickstarter isn't about raising money, it's about testing the waters. You only have a small amount of time and energy, so what creative projects should you spend it on? I'm still parsing and learning about the limits of the thing. As I mentioned before, you can read about my first, <span style="font-style: italic">failed</span>, KS project on <a class="postlink" href="http://scottlininger.blogspot.com/2011/07/my-first-kickstarter-campaign-numbers.html" target="_blank">my blog</a>, if you're supremely bored. :)
