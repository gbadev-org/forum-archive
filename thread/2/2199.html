    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just heard about this thing today. Just goes to show how up on the times I am.
<br/>
<br/>
So what's the skinny on this contraption? I've sifted through Nokia's pages but haven't come up with very much fruitful, except that it has a 104 MHz ARM processor (which raised an eyebrow in comparison with the GBA's 16 MHz ARM), yet seems to be very scant as far as dedicated graphics hardware goes (which raised the other eyebrow).
<br/>
<br/>
At first glance, it looks like they've traded the dedicated 2D hardware for a faster processor, which would explain why 3D titles (most notably Tomb Raider) are being featured on their website. I wouldn't mind an editorial or two on how good this tradeoff actually is...
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone seen one of these things? Is it going to be putting Nintendo out of the handheld business anytime soon?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not keen on shelving my GBA efforts, but I've noticed that Nokia has a dev competition going on with a 30,000 euro prize (don't know what that is in local currency, but it's bound to be something decent). I highly doubt I could pick it all up in time for the deadline on my own (end of January), but if one or two people wanted to team up with me it might be worthwhile.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ngage is a flop.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason of this is, that Nokia seems to go for 3d for 3d's sake, not for the gameplays sake. That is why Nintendo stands so strong: They do not limit themself when it comes to hardware, but they don't try to break any limit's either. This makes the games more fluid and welcome in the gamers heart. Nokia goes like "OHH MY! Look! We can do 3d, and the gba can't do that as good as us!"
<br/>
<br/>
True.
<br/>
<br/>
But have they realised what they are actually sending on the market? I guess not.
<br/>
NGage is a machine that fails because it's dedicated to hardware power. Harware power is good, but not crusial for gaming. Games for Ngage will only become "showoff's", and not real games, were the story is important. I doubt that there will come any RPG's for NGage, as Ngage is simply meant for a quick game, and not something spectacular like "Golden Sun".
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;"It's a mobile phone!"
<br/>
YES!
<br/>
&gt;"And who would like to play on mobile phones?"
<br/>
Not me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
GBA is for gaming, and you can use NGage as a phone. That's it.

Well, it seems to me that just about any company can attach an LCD to the latest ARM processor... it will probably take more than a good design to be the new handheld console king, though.
<br/>
<br/>
It occurs to me that since all these new competing brands are all ARM processors, the winner might be the one that lets you play the games for the other models. This gets difficult when some of them (like the tapwave) start adding customized video hardware, but if you stay on top of it you could probably clean the competition's clocks. It should also, of course, emulate the GBA's 2D hardware, which shouldn't be too difficult for a 200 MHz ARM to do.

For a cellphone its seems a little ackward, but i wouldn't know for sure, haven't tried the thing.

<br/>
Gaming console wise :
<br/>
-It has an ackward screen size.
<br/>
-Control are so-so (from what I've heard)
<br/>
-Ackward to switch game cartridge
<br/>
<br/>
But most importantly, I dunno if it'll make it as a long term console. I think a lot of people are worried about if it'll still be on the scene in 1-2 years, thus preventing them from buying it (especially when you consider it's price).
<br/>
<br/>
The Zodiak by tapwave (that's been posted previously) look really good though. Gaming wise, it seems to be a better platform than the GBA (Control, Screen, etc...)

I think that deep down we all know it will tank... but can anyone really say why?
<br/>
<br/>
Is it the lack of a big-name company (ie. Sony, Nintendo, M$) behind it?
<br/>
<br/>
Is it the big price tag? (As I recall, it was the $400 price tag that caused the Turbo Express to fail, even though it was lightyears ahead of the Gameboy and could actually play the carts for the Turbo Grafix 16.)
<br/>
<br/>
Is it this ominous sense that they won't get the developer commitment they need, probably because of the first two reasons?
<br/>
<br/>
I ask these questions because it really <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> an impressive-looking console... kind of like the N-Gage, but done right.
<br/>
<br/>
The GBA's 16 MHz ARM is far inferior to what's out there today... but then again, the GB outlasted consoles far superior as well. It'd be nice to have a better understanding as to why.

I think it's the lack of a big name that says it'll be there for a while, contribute to commerical failure in a vicious circle.
<br/>
<br/>
But the thing with the Zodiak is that you could still use it as a regular Palm, and thus play Palm games too (I supppose), so even though it might flop as a gaming, it wouldn't be a total waste, thus perhaps making viable... Mmmm, they should realy push that aspect in their PR, own it has access to the already Palm extensive library.<br/>_________________<br/>-Inside every large program is a small program struggling to get out.

<br/>
Plus I think one of the reasons the GBA has done so well is simply how much fun it is to develop for. It's like a flashback to the days of the SNES, so all the people that played games back then (such as myself) are old enough to make their own games now, and have similar system to play with.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

How would it account for the different memory maps of the different ARM architectures, or for I/O registers? You'd need full-scale virtualization for that, and without an MMU, that's [H]ard.

Besides, N-Gage graphics is a dumb frame buffer, and it's not as wide as the GBA screen, so something's going to get cut off. Scaled mode isn't as applicable because of the big difference in screen aspect ratio.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

This pertains to instruction, memory, and exception handling <span style="font-style: italic">within the core.</span> The memory map lies <span style="font-style: italic">outside</span> the core, on the other side of the memory controller. How do you expect to be able to run GBA software on a machine where, for example, BIOS sits in the 0x02000000-0x02ffffff area that corresponds to the GBA's EWRAM?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Theoretically, though, it should be much easier to write an emulator. You could trap all of the load/store instructions and replace them with macros equivalent to the effect they would have on the GBA's hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
This is all just spinning ideas, however. I don't know how practical any of it is.

Now, let's not bad-mouth a system most of us haven't played yet. Until we do, let's not go trash-talking. Heck, it might be the best thing since the gameboy!!(i STRONGLY doubt it)
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm... the N-Gage... not a serious threat .... the Zodiac ... also not a serious threat ... the PSP .... TROUBLE(i think).
<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly all these new handhelds come out. But what about cost?? And the real playability??? Its like cramming 20 different features into a phone and it only runs for 10 minutes!!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Some companies need to slow down and take the Nintendo approach. Don't use new technology unless it is efficient, NOT fast.
<br/>
<br/>
One last thing to make my point clear. Sure Nintendo could have come up with some $200 dollar Game-Boy with color when the Game Gear came out but they stuck with the good old original. Notice when they did surpass the Game Gear in quality it also used less batteries. Of course, there isn't a back light so here comes the GBA SP.
<br/>
<br/>
6 batteries (Game Gear) vs. 2 batteries (GBA) or Lithium Ion battery (GBA SP)
