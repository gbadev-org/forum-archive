I thought one of the main reasons for making homebrew in the first place was to demonstrate skills to employers. Besides, once DS-Xtreme comes out, a lot more people will be using SLOT-1 solutions, which don't have anything in GBA ROM address space.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I can't honestly say I see myself or that many other people getting employed as a result of working on homebrew...
<br/>
<br/>
As for having to pander for SLOT-1 devices. No thanks. I prefer the slot-2 options are the moment. It's just something about having that 32mb of extra RAM if I really need it that's nice.

Also, it's great for DSLinux ;-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

Plenty of the regular posters are professional developers.  Many of them were not professional developers when they started posting.

Some of them have done professional DS work.  I'm not sure exactly what each and every ex-gba homebrewer is working on right now (for obvious reasons).

Take a tour of the "Help Wanted" forum.  The job offers from EA and other companies are real.  If you are 17 and in high school you won't get the job.  If you've got your act together, interview well and are willing to relocate, you might be hired.  Note that I doubt that gbadev applicants are the highest on the list.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone could be reading what you are writing.  There are about 1900 members with 0 posts.  I'm sure at least a couple of those people are VIP lurkers with hiring power.

Anyway, we've gotten a bit of topic. Back on the subject of Java on DS, I've downloaded the WabaVM source that someone linked too, although I've yet to take a look at it. Anyone else looked at it yet?<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

"Willing to relocate" even internationally? How many years does it take to 1. build the confidence, 2. learn the language (except among US/UK/AU/NZ/anglophone Canada), 3. learn the laws, and 4. perform the paperwork to be able to relocate to another country?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

As I discovered when I went to work in the UK for the last 5 months, having a Right of Abode does not mean you have a social security number, tax code and all the other irritating crap that goes along with a job...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI
