    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What DS games should I buy? Obviously the selection is a little low at this point... There were several games at my local store that I didn't recognize (and were behind glass, so I couldn't even browse the boxes.)
<br/>
<br/>
Are there any RPGs at all? The Metroid demo is fun, but it's too short. Suggestions?

I bought those two, and I did NOT regret it!  (It didn't hurt that EB also gave me a $20 mail-in rebate for buying my DS with two games)
<br/>
<br/>
I later bought Asphalt Urban GT, and it's OK...  but the control is a little iffy, and it's a very hard game IMO, not like other racing games that start easy and get hard.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
