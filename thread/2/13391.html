    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now that <a class="postlink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6422333.stm" target="_blank">Acclaim have revealed plans involving 20,000 volunteers developing one game</a> it's got me thinking of this is possible in another way.
<br/>
<br/>
I once thought that it would be a great idea if [say] the entire GBA community worked one one large game that was somehow made up of lots of little games all pieced together - in a clever way like a 7th guest style puzzle-a-thon. Of course I would never mention it because I just would have had no time for it and still wouldn't. But I want to see if other people could think build on that thought.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this somehow possible on the GBA? And if so would there also be a way where one could - for example - include a regular update that is loaded via flash cart or something? The very download would encourage subscription, and with there being some 40 million DS owners and 80 million worldwide GBA owners maybe that isn't such a bad idea.
<br/>
<br/>
p.s. I can't sleep right now; why? No fair, I have an interview!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For one of my works I plan to create such a game like that. In fact the Saturn game I mention is what I want to make in such a product.
<br/>
<br/>
The way it works is that we all do our fair share and jot down our ideas at the same time.
<br/>
<br/>
For example if keldon has a great idea for game and we are his team who is dedicated towards bringing the sight true. We the team would also have our share in what we want in the game also.
<br/>
<br/>
We take our ideas and start presenting them to the table and keldon being the leader officer will be like " okay but we need stay on main focus  of the original game and then we can start adding such and such "  
<br/>
<br/>
Then on certain days we will start working on other peoples ideas and making place holders for there ideas  in the game itself in the game engine and on paper.....
<br/>
<br/>
Also people would bring there work home.
<br/>
<br/>
Now on the international scale we will have updates that will give out user created items. We will also mail updated discs or ask for people to mail in there carts to have them updated.
<br/>
<br/>
Everytime we update we add a whole new feature to the game that is in present with the old features and or areas.
<br/>
<br/>
Now back at the workstation we are situated with making the game flow.
<br/>
The world of the game itself will be setup so we can have new anything and everything.
<br/>
<br/>
There would be no limit if we could have a working enviorment where everybody is on the clock. 
<br/>
<br/>
Then again like you asked how could they do such a thing. I have thought about like you have many times before. 
<br/>
<br/>

I'd say that the idea of downloadable updates would be more feasible on the DS where there is already a reasonably standard way of connecting to the internet. On the GBA it might be possible if we had something in place to allow internet connection - for instance I've considered adding such a feature to Xboo Communicator but have been held back by the lack of a standard cable.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't see it being possible just becuase of the different levels of skill.  You'd have some parts of the full program extremely efficient, and others not so much.  Efficient developers would lose interest as they see it become bloated and may no longer what their name associated with it.  Then, you have lack of collaboration experiece.  Most homebrew projects are only 1 person doing what they want to do.  There are only a few that have more then one person working on them.  And even of the ones with multiple people, how many have multipe coders?
<br/>
<br/>
Then, let's say you have a 20 person team...  No matter what, you would need a project leader.. and if that person says or does something that any of the developers don't like, they quit.  next thing you know.. there is only a few people left working on the project.  Now, if you can keep the team together, the project leader would have to provide very detailed information as to what they expect.  You can't have 20 developers doing whatever they want, and not expect things to collide or have dever battles over how something should be handled, or if they should be the one that codes it, or someone else should, etc.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Tepples</span>: Very true, it would be pretty much like Warioware - although the idea for it came to me a log time before I heard of that; I first thought of a giant puzzle game with each person contributing at least one room/level!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Lick,Wintermute</span>: Yes, a community is not a dev team and there would have to be a core of producers. There would have to be an initial idea, and Acclaim are putting their eggs into this basket so there's got to be some form of working management system for this type of project.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the whole "one big game", see it more like one big set of add on mods to an engine or something. You have a core engine where the player can move around an environment and the <span style="font-style: italic">many people</span> make small add ons to it; if they leave a completed add on then everyone can work around it and patch it in. There's got to be a clever mechanism to make this work.
<br/>
<br/>
With the EZ-Flash and MicroSD is it easy to <span style="font-style: italic">just plug the SD into the cartridge and you have an update</span>? If so then that could be how! In fact that could be the whole way it is "sort of" handled!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Sgeos</span>: Well imagine it as a competition; the top xx make it into the final game. So they are submitted to one place, rated/judged and eventually patched in.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Keldon, do you, personally, think, that a good game will come forth from hundreds of different gameplay elements?
<br/>
<br/>
Somethings to think about are how to keep the difficultylevel balanced. Also, some of those elements will never fit in with others. Also, how much storage/development time will such an element require, there's never enough resources to completely insert them in the product while keeping the game balanced and on time.

Maybe I should start by saying there should be no disagreement (on my part); why should there be a disagreement? That is what is wrong with the internet, everyone wants to argue and disagree, why?
<br/>
<br/>
I see the logic yes, why shouldn't I since it is obvious! Clearly a book written by 1,000 different people will have plenty of problems, but that in no way means that 100 or 1,000 people could not contribute to making a book in a creative way. But as for the "argument", no that is not what I do, it is pointless arguing. <span style="font-weight: bold">What I will do in the future is state that I am arguing; in fact I will put it in my sig because it really annoys me when people begin continue arguments that never began.</span> Maybe the argument is a continuation of some eternal <span style="font-style: italic">something</span> that attaches itself to random permutations of words &lt;/pondering&gt;

<br/>
Maybe that's because this is a topic saying "what would" not a project saying "this is". There are few times where I say "this is" what I was saying, instead I say "what would" and give an example of a project utilizing this. But that is a very big point, supported by the perfect war example of "Chinese whispers", which was a soldier communication training exercise that found its way into schools.
<br/>
<br/>
So that partly answers the "what wouldn't work"; and like Lick (or someone) was saying, a large committee is bound to fail. The addition of committee layers also slows development time with the flow of information - it's something I deal with being part of different committees, and also being part of the town's general committee you see first hand how big of an effect communication channels are.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well you do have <a class="postlink" href="http://improcomics.org/mainpage-flash.html" target="_blank">impro-comics</a>, but that is completely different as you can easily have another person continue a story. Keeping the stories consistent is another story, but that's pretty much a story written by a large amount of people. But it is not a novel, or a graphic novel; just a long series.
<br/>
<br/>
Probably the reason why nothing like that has been tried is because we have never been at a stage where it was possible. Since when could you have people connected via so many streams across the world at an instant? Plus it is a very difficult task to find a "mechanism that works"; again the useful productive questions are:
<br/>
 - what would work?
<br/>
 - what wouldn't work?
<br/>
 - what must be overcome / understood?
<br/>
<br/>
And like I said before, <span style="font-weight: bold">Acclaim are investing in something of this nature</span>, in fact they are going for a bigger scale utilizing more people.

I don't think anyone would say it can't be done in general.  But, if you step back and look at the homebrew community, it's size, and the amount of internal "fighting/disagreements", I can't see the project going anywhere.

<br/>
But, instead of just talking about it, try it.  It's not like there is anything to lose.  No money out of anyone's pocket.  Start a project on souceforge and go for it.  That's easy enough, and will be the solid proof needed to show who is correct.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm, well yes the community size is very small in comparison to successful OSS projects. Also most successful OSS projects are full of professionals and have many contributions from commercial entities (not to say that non commercial entities and unprofessional coders are incapable).
<br/>
<br/>
As for starting a project, now is too premature; there is not even a plan other than "wouldn't that be nice if many coders were involved in one single (clever) project with a good management system". I also think it is far too early to say "it definately is this or that"; I wouldn't even go as far to say that "it is possible". In fact I am not saying what, just asking how.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course maybe the question is far bigger than I suspected and if there is an answer that it would require more research into the topic to find it. But in summary so far - give or take a few posts and without bias to too many of my own statements:
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Large numbers</span></span>
<br/>
 - large numbers are more difficult to manage, especially where many are involved in the decision process
<br/>
 - the probability of arguments increase, so does its effect when coupled with peer pressure and sub group formation &lt;side thought&gt; why are there arguments?
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Communication</span></span>
<br/>
 - wars are actually won/lost on communication, in fact it is the key to all collaboration
<br/>
 - it is one of the biggest hurdles between discussion and specification in a large group as typical communication does not tend to ensure both parties have the exact same concept; this is pivotal to such a system's success.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Submission/collaboration mechanism</span></span>
<br/>
 - a subversion system with accept/reject/fix-and-retry could work
<br/>
 - game can treat additional submissions as mods, add ons or "something"
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Mixture of gameplay elements</span></span>
<br/>
 - it's not good, it's not fun, it's just "random"
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Questions to be asked</span></span>
<br/>
 - if "it" was done by some "random" team, how do you think "it" would be done?
<br/>
 - what is "it"? It's the most important question because at the moment "it" is just a random game type that nobody knows about. "It" could be a puzzle <span style="font-style: italic">giant 7th guest style puzzler</span>, or a <span style="font-style: italic">super sized adventure game with alternate physics utilizing the same character</span>
<br/>
 - <span style="font-weight: bold">more importantly</span>, what sort of project/task/challenge could involve many different coders producing a single game?
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">possible related topics lightly said</span></span>
<br/>
 - a game with MiniSD flash card updates that <span style="font-style: italic">could</span> utilize downloads subscriptions

I don't think I'm being quite as negative as Lick is :P
<br/>
<br/>
The Acclaim project, being an MMO, is pretty well suited to this sort of endaevour. There's a fairly long tradition of user supplied content going right back to the days of Doom. I think their major issue is going to be one of filtering rather than lack of submissions.

Large numbers are probably best co-ordinated through a forum, depending on how many people want to get involved.

There are arguments because of the egos involved - game programming seems to be much like a band, everyone wants to be the lead guitarist and in the limelight. With GBA/DS homebrew the age of the participants may be a factor.

So if there are a lot of programmers, one could maybe try to split the project up so that there are lot of 'contributors'. One way is to have a bunch of minigames with a connecting storyline. Another way might be to create a sort of engine that lets other programmers contribute in a way that is similar to creating resources (as artists would do). Or maybe there are a lot of artists in this community, then it'd be easier to split up from the start. I've run out of thought for the moment...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sounds about right - kind of on the same note as what Wintermute was saying about organizers/leads. There is a business management model for such behaviour involving everyone thinking for themselves with the bigger picture in mind. The committee only direct (or something to that nature) and it works good with large groups of this kind. Of course it is a completely new Software Engineering approach when applied to programming and would require a whole new set of practices and patterns (possibly). Having said that the model is great for information based areas where there is too much knowledge required for a single person to be a producer for.

<br/>
Yes; well part of the management process (above) has each task coordinated by a different person. So in some tasks the manager sees to his employees and they coordinate him [the manager]. A single direction for a massive group is quite like directing a war; communication, coordination, collaboration and conduct are the key to it all working together. (Note: I mentioned war before)

Well that is a nice trail of thought; RPG types with many puzzles and minigames via a connecting storyline makes sense.

 - it may be beneficial if there were a person assigned to the task for collating common ideas and linking them together in some way. There may be an optimal ratio of say 1:12.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well back to the topic; a large number of artists works well and is not much of a problem, but how could one make use of many programmers? Incompetent programmers could not be all working on the same code base, however could script behaviours. The reason being is that an inexperienced programmer is very likely to introduce code that is inconsistent or difficult to reuse (in fact it is probably inevitable).
<br/>
<br/>
Having said that you can have a scenario where, for example:
<br/>
 - an inexperienced coder creates a small confined concept / sub-game / script / character behaviour
<br/>
 - a second coder examines the code and identifies bug-hot-spots and potential issues with reuse and future modifications making use of, or making use of code that makes use of the product
<br/>
 - a third coder improves the code using the recommendations of the second
<br/>
 - a fourth coder examines the code and accepts it
<br/>
 - a fifth coder begins to integrate small concept into larger context
