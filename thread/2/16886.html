    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everybody,
<br/>
<br/>
I decided because te most old nds sources and stuff like that aren't downloadble anymore to setup a torrent tracker for high quality nds sources, homebrew games and related stuff. Please join this community so ensure high quality homebrew source. <a href="http://anime.exofire.net/" target="_blank">http://anime.exofire.net/</a> The site only excepts now 50 accounts to start with. Please join and help this starting community. Yes I know, the site has sometimes some errors because of the changes to the software on the server. But they a gone soon. I hope this community will grow to the larges (nds) homebrew  community from the internet, yes I keep dreaming. Srry for the guys who can't join, it is a private tracker with limits but each time the limit is reached I will check if we can change the limit up to a new lvl.
<br/>
<br/>
If somebody has ideas for it or other things to share for it. Post it here in this topic.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I like the idea of having yet another good source for ds stuff.  So I don't want to sound like a total naysayer and completely rain on your parade. But I do have a few critical thoughts:
<br/>
<br/>
Why torrents?  Generally torrents are useful when you're dealing with large files, or a lack of legality.  For small stuff like most DS files, I'm not sure that it's necessary.  You also end up with a dependence on peers instead of everything actually being in one place.
<br/>
<br/>
What's up with the name Anime Universe?  If you want this to go over, you have to do the legwork first of making it obviously be what it's supposed to be.
<br/>
<br/>
Creating an empty space and then asking people to contribute rarely works.  Make it compelling first (do the homework of gathering as much DS stuff as you can), then people will want to come and contribute.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I personally think I miss something like the HBDB that's in DSOrganize... you know, sometimes you can't follow all the news and having all the latest versions and new releases in a single place would be nice. But I think we need something that can access single files and that can work from the DS itself, so I woulnd't choose torrent and trackers for that.
<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents, of course.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Why Torrents you say, because I haven't the endless space to host everything ever released in the homebrew scene. And why you don't want to share the load?
<br/>
<br/>
A nice app to get the latest news from the homebrew scene and downloads on your nds is nice but you have to understand that downloads on the nds always stay slow, most of the time. Maybe I can run a python p2pclient on the server and when the nds app request a file, the client will download it and send it to the nds app :)
<br/>
<br/>
@sonny_jim
<br/>
Can you send me the ctorrent what you got working on dslinux? Does it support rssfeeds?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://imetal.nl/" target="_blank">Website / Blog</a>

I don't mind sharing the load, that's not the issue.  The issue is whether you'll have enough people willing to "share the load" to make it work.  (ie It's not MY project idea, so if I need to repurpose my computer to do something else, and stop seeding, I will.  Suddenly, your site doesn't work because I'm not seeing)
<br/>
<br/>
If there was a large crowd of people interested in this stuff, you could assume that there'd be enough people to keep things alive.  But for a topic of limited interest like this, and particularly something where the goal is archiving, as opposed to just allow easy downloading, torrents seem to be to be the wrong solution.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I downloaded a torrent that was an 18MB pdf with ctorrent under DSLinux as a test.  It took ages (&gt;1hr) when the same torrent on my PC (ran at seperate times) did it in under 20 minutes.  Do not over estimate the abilities of p2p on the DS, especially with the homebrew wifi code.  A straight download is simpler and as long as it can resume, better imho.
<br/>
<br/>
You don't really need to worry about bandwidth, as I bet that there's less than half of DS homebrew users now than there has ever been, judging by lack of recent developments.  Plus most DS homebrew is quite small, I bet you could squeeze in plenty of good stuff in 30MB :-)<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">

I've seen so many posts with "new site, please join" that disappear in a month.  I doubt it is because they don't have good intentions, but I'm guessing it is because there are already enough sites.  That, and maintaining a DS homebrew site is a ton of work.

I've always been open for help at ndshb.com.  I'd overhaul the site in a heartbeat if people were willing to help me put it back together.

Mainly, it is just out of date.  It has a little activity in the forums (end user, not dev) but the overall objective didn't make it.  hive.ndshb.com was supposed to be the next step, allowing anyone to add files to the database, but again, it has proven to just not make it there.  Then, of course, is the "outdated" look.
<br/>
<br/>
hive.ndshb.com currently has two different download modules installed, but I'm not sure if either of them really fit for a nds files download site.

Heh..  I've failed at this topic so many times it's not funny.  Here is the last failure:
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ndshbhive/" target="_blank">NDSHB Hive</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Prior to that was <a class="postlink" href="http://dl.ndshb.com/" target="_blank">SLURP</a> which worked about 70% of the time (if I remember correct) and was the Proof of Concept release that started us working on "NDSHB Hive".. but, again, after fighting with code for so long, it became such a mess that starting from scratch is probably the only real options now.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, most of my attempts were back when you had to fight more with getting code to even work when it came to WiFi.   But, being a crappy programmer doesn't help.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What about <a class="postlink" href="http://gameup.supercard.fr/" target="_blank">GameUP</a>? I've never tried it, but sounds kinda like what you guys are talking about.
<br/>
<br/>
Now that I think of it, it'd be great if something like this really took off. GameUp or NDSHB Hive (or some new app) could utilize the new argv stuff from devkitARM (see <a class="postlink" href="http://devkitpro.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/devkitpro/trunk/projects/nds/HomebrewMenu/" target="_blank">HomebrewMenu</a> code) and therefore homebrewers could start using "<a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/filesystem/" target="_blank">filesystem</a>" (a maintained part of devkitARM) now that EFS has seemed to have disappeared. It could still support the old way of doing things of course for those roms that are not dev'd anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
Make the program a sticky here on the forum, get people to adopt it. Flash cards would then hopefully follow suit on the argv because of this new popular homebrew repos type program.
<br/>
<br/>
Kinda like a homebrew channel of sorts. No more websites, forum posts, etc. to scour looking for homebrew or updates to homebrew. Just an app on your DS that would allow you to browse available roms, download them, and run them... right from this "homebrew channel" type app. Devs could update their roms via a website like GameUP or hive.ndshb.com does, but users won't need to worry about that. They could even see a "NEW"/"UPDATED" type section when starting the app, kinda like DSiWare.
<br/>
<br/>
Could even start by talking with GameUP and pdroms.de or whoever to start generating the initial content/game/apps DB.
