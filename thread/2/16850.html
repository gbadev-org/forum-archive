    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been looking for a good hex editor for years now, and I just can't seem to find one that works for me.  
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for:
<br/>
-support for big-endian and little-endian
<br/>
-translates a selection to standard types(byte,word,dword,float, etc...)
<br/>
-can open large files (&gt;2gb) without lagging/breaking.
<br/>
-cross platform would be nice, as I do a lot of work on a macbook.  however, just windows would be fine.
<br/>
-ascii/unicode tables would be nice too
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am surprised, though, at how many only support up to 1-1.5 GB.  I would have thought that once you get that big, its trivial to open larger ones.  Can you not just take your large file and buffer a "window" of it around the part you're looking at?  Even with slow hdd access, it seems like you should be able to do this without any noticeable lag.
<br/>
<br/>
What if I wanted to write a program to open, say, a 100GB file on Windows?  How would you go about doing that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It really depends on the data in the file and how you intend to use it. sequential stream? random access?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
