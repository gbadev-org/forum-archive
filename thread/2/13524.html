"Thank you for your email. 
<br/>
I checked your complaint and noticed that our crawler doesnt crawl your forum anymore. My guess is that either that when it crawled your forum either the robots.txt wasn't there or there was a bug in our system and we apologize if that is the case. 
<br/>
Your content will be removed very soon as our system will delete older post that weren't indexed again. In the meantime I disabled the preview feature for your board. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you"

Either it only took them a few minutes to reply to my e-mail form on their website, or they have a standard mail they send automatically to everyone ;)
<br/>
<br/>
The robots.txt has disallowed bots from crawling the forum for years...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
