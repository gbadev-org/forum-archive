I want to get a 2gb Flash card I can develop GC games on.  I have to look into how to do that.  Beats wasting discs.  Does SD loader have some kind of solution for this (large card, etc)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

WHAT?  How about the price of the unit when you F* it up?  I first dabbled in this stuff to import Guitar Freaks for the PS1.. What a learning experience.  Buy a $10 mod chip, wreck a $100 PS1.. Nice.. next time, I bought the $20 or $30 Plug mod instead.. and I have an associates in electronics and have worked for PCB manufactures and assemblers.  So, it's not just soldering skills that you need.. You also need to know what the hell you are doing.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah... I have a finishing up my BS in Computer engineering (it is a combo of Electrical engineering and Comp Sci)   and am starting my masters in CS this semester... we never learned the basics of Tech soldering etc in school, only design and engineering stuff.  But I never had too much trouble with the soldering stuff or chips.  Except a few burns and irritations.

Seriously, dude, flux rocks.  You can easily attach wires with one little touch.  No biggie.  The prob with Playstations are those small ribbon cables (PS2, not so much ps1) and other crap like that.  Those get old and the holders and cables crack.  
<br/>
<br/>
Good news, GameCube has nothing like that :)   It is one of the easiest systems to mod I have ever encountered.  Except, you have to find tune your potentiometer on the laser, but that is just trial and error, also easy. Also, gamecubes can be purchased used for $30 or less on eBay etc.  Not bad.  But I can totally understand not wanting to, based on that chance of screwing up.  
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I could use a LARGE CAPACITY reusable flash solution for programming.  That would really be cool! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is the sister site for homebrew.. dun dun dunnnnn.... <a href="http://www.gcdev.com/" target="_blank">http://www.gcdev.com/</a> Click on upper right hand side graphic that reads "discussion form", not all links work.  
<br/>
<br/>
You can lean a lot from that site.  I am going to start a GC project with SD Gecko when I am done with my GBA game.  I looked into that solution after my last post (and it looks like a great solution to use with my $10 mod chip and action pro/ SDLoad).   There are great references on gcdev etc.  There is a good library, libgc or something to that effect.  It is referenced a lot on that site.  You get it with the DevkitPro -&gt;DevkitPPC package, from what I gather.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  Oh yeah, the library is called: Libogc

I think there is a whole article (google for this) on how to set up Action replay to load applications from SD card.  You just enter a specific code in to action replay for fetching the instruction from SD (this is on the article I was talking about).  There is no need to stream from broadband.  I think that is just another option to load, and perhaps save time transferring the DOL to and from SD, or making a disc.  You just use devkitPPC, compile to DOL, transfer to SD, and use action replay.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, some old homebrew may be referencing the old way of loading "Phantasy star Online with Broadband".  I guess it would depend on what the application was doing, as far as needing the broadband.

<br/>
Anyone?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know you can load DOL's from the SD card...I'm not looking at the AR method, I'm looking at the Datel SD Media Launcher, it has a CD that loads a program and it has a GC SD card adapter, it boots DOL's automatically.  I'm just wondering how much software out there is able to run from the SD, a lot of it appears to be built for the old PSOload methods and broadband streaming.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
