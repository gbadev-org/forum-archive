The DSi can run Opera without a RAM expansion (there's no SLOT-2 on the DSi anyway). I'm not sure if this is due to more built-in RAM or Opera being optimized, but I suspect the first.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

According to the Opera people it's a bit of both, but they've confirmed that there is some extra RAM during an interview. I don't have a link handy though.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think you're right. Opera has said that the browser is improved and that it has more efficient ram usage. It suggests to me that the browser's improvement comes from relying on the slow ram a lot less.

That's been the subject of a lot of speculation.

the avg q3 scene had 8,000-10,000 tris on it excluding models. 3rd party mods pushed it up towards 20,000 per scene. (by scene I mean visable at any given time).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm still fiddling around (haven't and most likely won't release anything, I like fiddling), couple of days ago I got beat up by GCC as I ported a C function of mine to Arm9 ASM and after profiling I found that gcc beat the living crap out of me by 20% :S *cries*

A human being can still beat the compiler, but usually by a relatively small margin, and usually only after spending hours on it. And at the same time the code becomes harder to debug and re-target. A friend of mine once said those wise words: "A compiler can generate better code in microseconds than you can do in hours", and that is so true. But of course... if your routine is really critical, and you really need those 10% extra... you could always give it a try.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I once spent weeks writing a piece of code for a game (that's not yet out...) that had a run-time of 7-8ns. It's such a stunningly short amount of time! If only the compiler could have written it for me, I wouldn't have lost so much sleep! I literally was bricking it for months on the run up to writing this thing, as I thought that there was no way I'd be able to do better than the compiler could do.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
