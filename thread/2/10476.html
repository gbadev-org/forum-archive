Same here. Personally, I didn't know Liranuna except from the fact that he was a great coder,and a "plus" for the DS homebrew community.
<br/>
<br/>
I believe that something big has happened,as this whole discontinuation has passed the joke point. And why even wanting to erase a profile?
<br/>
<br/>
Something's not right.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, bye!<br/>_________________<br/>He who laughs last, obviously didn't get the joke.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe it's because there is so much "undercover" things going on in the DS Dev community that he got fed up with the crap and instead of blowing the whole thing wide open, he decided it would be better to leave then expose the guilty ones.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, if you don't know anything about his announcment, than it is because you aren't on IRC enough to see all the crap that comes about from time to time.  Information is shared, people learn things, etc.  Some of it is complete BS, some is not.  Not everyone has the ability to wade through it all.. But, if you were around from the beginning of the NDS homebrew scene, you know some of the truth.  When someone tells you something you know for sure to be untrue, as you where part of it.. than you learn who is full of Sh!t and you need to remember that.  But, as some are able to bludgen others enough to warp their minds to believe what is untrue, you end up with false truths that are belived by many.
<br/>
<br/>
Final thought:  You must do a lot of research to find the truth.  If information is offered freely.. it is most offen untrue or unresearched.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So perhaps you'd like to share this "truth" or do you just like to behave like you're in the middle of some sort of far reaching conspiracy?

What I've heard of the "truth" so far doesn't bear repeating.

<br/>
These theories though, they're so ridiculously and blatantly stupid that they're not worth repeating even, but at the same time it's possible someone gullible would beleive them, which is really sad; but that's how conspiracy theories work.
<br/>
Leaving the scene is the worst solution though, as if it's one of these crazy theories he's caught up on, we're the only ones who can ever refute it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know anything about all the "conspiracy theories" going around.  When I saw the post on SC's bounty site, it was the first time I had heard any of the N stuff..  I've said this before and I will say it again.  I have NEVER said anything on IRC that I regret.  I have never said anything FALSE on IRC and personally don't give a sh!t about IRC.  I don't care that there are two main channels (#dsdev and #mellowdsdev) and I don't care if people don't get along.  That is human nature.  We just need to deal with it.
<br/>
<br/>
With that said, I will provide some facts.  If peope "think" otherwise, I would love to hear their comments.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1) DarkFader provided the code for PassMe.
<br/>
2) Natrium42 designed the circuit board for PassMe (EVEN THE SINGLE SIDED ONE!!!!).
<br/>
3) I was the first person with a working PassMe with the help of the two mentioned above.
<br/>
4) I have paid DarkFader and Natrium42 EACH $1 for every PassMe I have sold!
<br/>
5) I made available $300 to the DS WiFi Bounty.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone tells you anything different from the 5 FACTS listed above, they are either lying, nieve, or been bludgen to believe untrue information.
<br/>
<br/>
Facts I would like to hear from others:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Official date WiFi Bounty was over.
<br/>
2) Date the WiFi Bounty page was updated to reflect that it was over.
<br/>
<br/>
I know the ~answer to these, but would like to know what others thought about it.
<br/>
<br/>
SgStair, the problem is, if someone provides one little fact to anything, 10 people run off and speard that fact.. but, by the time it is spread, it has been so messed up, that it is not fact anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW: Before anyone says SC had been to busy to update the page, he sure does seem to have a lot of time to troll #dsdev with an iron fist.  Updating a page isn't hard.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
However, both of the questions you asked are easy to answer:
<br/>
1) The date of the close of the bounty was the date that the source of the wifi lib was released - The post is still on the site, though it's not obvious that it's the first release of the source. - for reference though, that date is December 24, 2005.
<br/>
2) Since Stonecyph's page is on a wiki, it's not hard to find when it was modified to reflect the current status - a little bit of digging shows the date as July 1, 2006.
<br/>
<br/>
And, the conspiracy theories I'm speaking of aren't even remotely based on fact - I mean they're wild speculation, and they only just barely qualify as sane, with a very liberal definition.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe I wasn't clear.. Instead of talking about conspiracy.. how about we talk about facts provided in the conspiracy?
<br/>
<br/>
My point being.. ANYONE that has provided information for or against any conspiracy.. if they have provided different information, it is untrue.  So, instead of us discussing some half brained theory (of which, I'm sure has nothing to do with LiraNuna leaving the scene, as I know why he left and it doesn't have anything to do with half of the BS floating around.) Start posting facts that either are for or against the theories you have heard.  That way, it can be corrected by the people that actually know.
<br/>
<br/>
There are some people deep into these theories (be it by choice or by nature) that are providing information that does not match what I have provided.  If they want to fess up and challenge these facts, I wish they would, so that they can get their facts strait.
<br/>
<br/>
SO, if _YOU_ (this being anyone that is reading this post) BELIEVE anything other than what I have provided as FACT, please state your case.  If you have HEARD from someone, anything other than what I have provided as FACT, you can consider that person one of the 3 things I listed in that post.
<br/>
<br/>
Point being: Now is the time to post YOUR facts and read what the real FACTS are.  This process will weed out the snakes providing false information.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lynx: because it's much more fun to talk about the fallacies raised in the conspiracy and laugh at them :P
<br/>
<br/>
Throwing out random facts to attempt to dispute all conspiracies isn't nearly as good of an idea as identifying the conspiracies that exists, and refuting them directly.
<br/>
<br/>
Dynastab: "He didn't really maintain the page at all, he knew sgstair was working on it and no one else was going to try to do a better job. I don't know if he paid sgstair in full or not....is this up for debate or something?"
<br/>
To defend him just a tiny bit, it's not his project even though he was involved via the bounty - all the information about the project has been available on my websites, and on January 18, 2006, I make the following comment on <a class="postlink" href="http://akkit.org/dswifi/" target="_blank">http://akkit.org/dswifi/</a> : "Also, to clarify, Yes, I have completed the requirements for the remainder of the bounty, and have received the payment. Many thanks to all who contributed towards making this a reality!"
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, I will now disclose information about the latest conspiracy theory making the rounds. I was going to leave this alone but it really does deserve to be refuted again.
<br/>
<br/>
Recently on IRC, Headkaze (of <a class="postlink" href="http://headkaze.webpal.info/" target="_blank">http://headkaze.webpal.info/</a>) introduced the grandpappy of conspiracies that I've been involved with (ok, that doesn't say much)
<br/>
The story goes (referring to myself in third person for clarity):
<br/>
(1) Evidently Stonecyph worked for nintendo before starting the bounty.
<br/>
(2) So he decided to cheat the community out of a lot of money and donate it to nintendo's anti-piracy unit
<br/>
(3) So he creates a bounty for a wifi library, because he already has all the technical information about the ds's wifi
<br/>
(4) He contacts sgstair and offers to split the bounty in return for all the technical info
<br/>
(5) sgstair creates the library, takes 1/2 of the bounty money, and SC and sgstair laugh all the way to the bank
<br/>
<br/>
From my perspective, each of those items has a number of things wrong with them, and they range from the mildly stupid to the utterly absurd.
<br/>
Now, here's my take on those points.
<br/>
(1) To my knowledge, this is incorrect - I'm not aware of Stonecyph working for Nintendo at all during or before this period.
<br/>
(2) This is just absurd. While I'm not familiar with the internals of ninendo, and if they have an anti-piracy unit, even if they did.... 3 grand is a drop in the bucket in comparison to the millions nintendo can put wherever they like.
<br/>
(3) Yes, he created a bounty, however, those of us who are commercial DS developers are aware that there is absolutely no documentation on the DS's wireless chipset in the nintendo-provided SDK. Probably only a few internal developers at nintendo even have this information.
<br/>
(4) Well, this is obviously incorrect to me, although, sorry, there's no obvious or practical refutation - just have to trust me.
<br/>
(5) It took me ages of work, looking through code and toying with registers to figure out enough to make the basic functionality that exists in the lib today. The amount of time the wifi lib sucked up in it's development is enormous, and not very cost effective (I make more than 50 times what I did on the wifi lib in my current job). And I have confirmed that I received all of the bounty money (less paypal fees) to my satasfaction. Again you have to trust me.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, sorry about the long post - this is something that bugs me, because firstly it's so utterly incorrect, and secondly, it's highly defamatory, even if, as headkaze claims, it's only an opinion that he got from a friend (although he seems to beleive it wholeheartedly enough).

<br/>
First of all number (2) was a joke and I said it was a joke, to get the attention of the "Fat Club" which is the affectionate name I give to the people who support SC like he's a fan club. The statment went along the lines of "I heard SC was an insider for the Nintendo anti-piracy unit". So you can remove that from the consipacy theory. I thought that statment was so outragous that it was an obvious joke - sorry about that, it's my wacky sense of humour. 
<br/>
<br/>
I was only really interested in finding out if (1) was true because I think half of what SC says is a lie. The rest was not a rumour started by me at all - I heard it from someone else. I was just asking questions to see if it was true.
<br/>
<br/>
People don't seem to realise that I was looking for some evidence not spouting off what I'd heard like it's the truth, so I was very careful to ask questions and suggest the ideas that I had heard to see the reaction of the people involved.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not going to reveal the original source of this information, but I have an IRC chatlog of the entire thing. I made a promise not to say anything but I broke that promise.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I talked to neimod about it who was apparently offered the same thing as sgstair to which he's denied it completely. Which dosn't give the consiracy much water because I thought he was a key player in providing the evidence for this "conspiracy theory".
<br/>
<br/>
I messaged wntrmute and told him what I had heard which resulted in me being banned from #dsdev. I thought I made it clear that it was something that I was told, not something I had made up. It wasn't difficult after that for someone from #dsdev to move into #mellow and gain Op status to ban me from there also.
<br/>
<br/>
My personal feelings on the matter is that what goes on in IRC should stay on IRC, but since my name is brought up I may as well give my side of the story.
<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is SC is the cause of most problems on #dsdev over the last few years I've dabbled on IRC, he is the one who apparently split the scene and he is the one in the middle of this conspiracy theory.
<br/>
<br/>
I question the reasons for giving him Op status on #dsdev, but it's not my decision and the other Ops there have made it clear that this will not change. I still question weather or not he even worked for Nintendo. People seem to think he has, including him. I've heard he's grown up a bit and dosn't cause so many problems anymore, in fact he's suprised me on a number of occations recently. I guess it depends on his state of mind at the time.
<br/>
<br/>
I apologise if I have purpetuated this conspiracy theory by bringing it out in the open, but I guess the only people who really know if it is true would be sgstair, SC and the originator of the conspiracy "leak". The first two deny it, so I guess that's where this whole thing should end. Without proof there is no point to continue speculating.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope I havn't offended sgstair because I respect him alot for his work on dswifi and don't want to diminish his hard work in any way. I thought that weather or not it was true, I didn't care much about it anyway. We have dswifi and that is what really matters. It just annoyed me to think that SC would do something that goes against his hard line anti-piracy philosophy. And I was desparate to find out if it was true.
<br/>
<br/>
So there it is people, the full story, and LN didn't leave the scene because I told him this "conspiracy theory" let me make that clear, he had already heard it from someone else. I repect LN 100% and think he's one of the coolest people in the scene. Where the story began is a mystery to me, I'm sure I heard it through someone who heard it through someone else. It's about time the original source of the information came forward and made it public with the evidence this thing seems serverly lacking. There are quite a lot of people who don't like SC, but I don't think he deserves this sort of treatment if it's not true.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
But I don't believe someone could spoof my IP like that so maybe it was me. I was pretty fed up after the Fat Club was attacking me all night, so maybe I did do that. So perhaps the ban was needed. I was possibly drinking that night too, so it could be possible that I lost control.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't get why I was banned from #mellow though. Guess that's not a hard thing to do since it's pretty easy to get Op status in there.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, the ban isn't really the point (which wntrmute has kindly lifted now anyway). I was just explaining how I came to know the consiracy theory. Maybe now it can be layed to rest.

I love ToD, it's on my cart as we speak. Havn't been game enough to play it off my face though. You really rotate that playing field abruptly. I think Lumines is more suited to that "state of mind", personally I think ToD is better suited to Acid, but noone even does that drug anymore. Alcohol is my only poison these days, and gets me into enough trouble as you can see ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#94736 - Lynx - Tue Jul 25, 2006 11:56 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">*sigh* Not IRC logs.. it could get ugly..  As for leaving IRC on IRC.. well, if you don't want IRC conversations to leave IRC, then you shouldn't be there.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not going to pull up logs nor request anyone to post the logs I have seen.  SgStair, you know the kind of stuff that SC has pulled, so there is no confusion there.  I'm not even going to tackle the grand conspiracy theory you are talking about, as I have no facts (nor know of any) that go along with  it, and as I said, first I heard of it was when SC finally updated the DS WiFi Bounty Page.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, the clerification of why I seem to be the only one posting facts AT ALL in any of these posts.. and why I posted them when most people think they are "Well, duh!" type of facts.
<br/>
<br/>
I was lucky enough to be a part of the birth of the PassMe only because DarkFader and Natrium42 were gracious enough to allow me to be a part of it.  I have never claimed it was mine or tried to take any credit for it at all.  I did it for one reason only.. and that reason IS NOT money!  It was "fame".  And for one day..  LYNX was the name at the top of EVERY DS Homebrew site!  MY HANDLE! ME!  I often wonder how Pepsiman feels to be the DSLinux Guru.. but for one day.. I knew how it felt.  And it was awesome.  If you wounder why I'm even talking about this, it is to show my honesty.  Of which, I'd like to see others post otherwise.  The reason I bring up honesty is becuase there is such a big LACK of it on IRC.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, with my first donation ($200) to the WiFi Bounty, SC's response was "Who the hell is this guy?" and "Welcome to #realdsdev, the hidden channel for the real developers"..  I was pretty new to IRC so I thought... Neat..  Now, for the same reason stated above, I donated more money.  Trying to be listed at the top of the WiFi Bounty page, I out-donated SC.. of course, he matched it and remained on top.  After SgStair claimed the first milestone, I donated more.  One, to see if SC would match it, and two, to see if I could get my name on top.  So I donated another $100, and as it stands now, am at the top of the list.  Yipee.
<br/>
<br/>
Later, I find out through log posts that SC is acting like the $3,000 is HIS MONEY!  Not Bounty money.  That he put the bounty together and it was all him.. needless to say, it went into a "me, me, me" pissing match on IRC PM and we argued about it.  I'm not going to try to take away from SC and say that the WiFi Lib would have been created without him, and I'm not going to say I don't appreciate him putting it together and managing it (if it has been managed properly, that is!!!!).  But, the FACT is, it was BOUNTY money, not his.
<br/>
<br/>
Now.. as my interactions with SC becamore more hostile, and lies were spewing more than I could even put up with.. we parted ways and I haven't PM'd with him since.  But, the final conversation had to do with the PassMe, and who really was the first person with one, and who really created it.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, that leads to my FACTS.  SC says Kraln made the first PassMe.  SC says that Kraln designed the single sided version, not Natrium42, and if I am going to believe the BS, that's up to me.  Apparently, I wasn't around when the PassMe was born.. and I am just an idiot.
<br/>
<br/>
Now.. let's jump to the #dsdev spamming and all the trouble that has been brewing for a VERY LONG TIME now..  but has never really been addressed in the open like this.  Like I've always said on IRC..  Who gives a sh!t about IRC?  It's a joke!  That is my feeling toward IRC.. and if I was banned from a channel I wouldn't give it a second thought.. and to clerifiy, I have never been banned from any channel.. at least.. not that I know of.. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
If you could take all of the fights.. all of the arguing and put names on every one.. I think you will find a trend.  Somehow, one name will be at the top of most every list.  Sure, people pop in from time to time to start trouble, but the same name will be there.  Why is that?  Why is it that this ONE PERSON (SC) is always in the middle of everything?  On top of that, why is it this same person is still an OP of #dsdev?
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone really cared about trying to "heal" the dev community, I think the first place would be to remove the thorn from the side of the community.  I'm not for or against #dsdev or #mellowdsdev, and I personally think they both have their place.  As I have said before, human nature is what it is, and people are not going to get along.. that's just it.  But, when you have a single person causing so much trouble..  With nobody else willing to stand up and fight for the community.. well.. you end up with a thread like this one.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, SC lies and is still an OP on #dsdev.  As far as I'm concerned, he has done just as much (if not more) damage to the DS Dev community as DF with his Trojan proof of concept.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: And I forgot to mention.. It's hard to say if you (SgStair) received ALL of the bounty money.  If he lies, how do you know he's not a theif as well.  There is NO OTHER explination as to why it would take THAT LONG (as you provided in your response) to update a single web page.  There was no reason he couldn't just direct people to YOUR donation page.  And there is STILL NO REASON he couldn't direct to your donation page now..  THERE IS NO REASON for a DS WiFi Bounty donation button on that page at all!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
1) breaking up of the ds development scene for a well known case
<br/>
2) SOMEONE that accused _me_ for that split up
<br/>
3) both of the #*dsdev channels being driverted against me cause of a special someone
<br/>
4) calling one of my (past) beloved hangout channels #mellowdsdev as a place of (and i quote!) "warezers and brickers"
<br/>
5) THE FACT THAT I HAVE DONE NOTHING AND GOT ACCUSED BY EVERYTHING
<br/>
6) ignorent - i tried and did nice act by opening #learn2d and never heared a single thanks. not that i want to, cause the fact that i made some people leaving FB modes and start learning the 2DHW, made me smile (not to mention PAlibbers, but that's a whole diffrent story)
<br/>
7) some more stuff i would like to keep to myself
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">personal related issues</span>
<br/>
1) I did all the DSdev i could think of. I've used almost anything the HW is capable to do. (no, not my released project, but WWYS demo for EVOKE)
<br/>
2) the fact that i want to try other handhelds for development: GBA and DS are preety the same (I/O based) while PSP is BIOS based
<br/>
3) how can i forget the fact that i have a high chance of loosing my life/hobby on the upcoming 3 years for my country.
<br/>
4) i got 9 months left to have a free time for myself, i want to use that time wisely. (some of you think it's a lot of time, but not when the clock ticks backward torwards your army service that might lead you to eventually die for your country. i had been chosen by IDF to be a GI Ground infintry) and as far as i knwo Israel, those are bad news)
<br/>
5) i left all of my projects as open source - anyone with good will can continue it.
<br/>
6) more personal reasons i don't like to discuss about
<br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong - i'm not moving to the PSP cause i like it or think that the DS stinks/PSP rules. but cause PSP is my only choice. i'm not going to spend another ~400$ (price of GP2x + taxes) just cause it's 'Wrong' to program to the PSP (a HW with a lot potential imo) 
<br/>
<br/>
now stop being little kids and leave this thread/my self alone.
<br/>
if anyone finds one of those reasons stupid, please **** ** ****.
<br/>
you got my explonations even if some (or most) of you may find it dumb,
<br/>
i ask you, the admins to lock this thread or even erase it. it shouldn't had been created in the first place. sorry i gave the wrong impression to people by writing the word 'discovery' or such, my english is terrible (as most of you know) and i tend to use improper words to express myself. 
<br/>
people _knew_ i was going to leave, and it was only a metter of time untill i made it 'official' by posting it on my site, so don't be clueless.
<br/>
<br/>
edit: another reason my be found <a class="postlink" href="http://liranuna.drunkencoders.com/the-ds-scene/" target="_blank">here</a>. it may sound easy to interpert, but it got atleast 10 hidden and double meanings.
<br/>
<br/>
i hope that clears the situation.
