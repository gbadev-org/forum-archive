    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I just had a strange thing happen...
<br/>
<br/>
I had ordered a PS2-&gt;XBox/GC controller adaptor from success-hk since I had no problems when I ordered my GBA flash cart from them. This time though, I went for the 1-2 week Air Mail shipping instead of the faster option.
<br/>
<br/>
Order went through, got to "shipped" status and had my card chared all seemingly ok. But, three weeks later, it still hadn't arrived, so I got concerned and put in a help ticket about it. This made me somewhat concerned about the reliability of ordering things from Hong Kong.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, as it turns out, the blame in this case fell squarely on <span style="font-style: italic">my local US post office</span>. It had been sent registered, so I needed to be there when it was delivered to sign for it. Like almost anyone with a job, I'm not home when the mail comes. But, that's normally fine because when that happens they're supposed to leave a note that they attemted delivery and that you can pick it up in person at the post office. 
<br/>
<br/>
Ahem...note that I said, "they're <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">supposed</span></span> to"...
<br/>
<br/>
Guess what my wonderful local post office didn't bother to do...
<br/>
<br/>
I had been just about ready to post on the "Retailer Feedback" section to complain about success-hk, and then discovered that my local post office had been holding it without <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> attempt at all to notify me, for <span style="font-style: italic">two weeks</span>!
<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, they still hadn't sent it back yet, so I was able to pick it up this morning. But, moral of the story: Umm, if something's gone wrong, don't impulsively blame Hong Kong ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered a computer from pricewatch.    The day I was going to complained to the company that the computer still hadn't arrived, the delivery guy left it in front of the back door without ringing the doorbell or anything.
<br/>
<br/>
I opened a bank account and they couldn't verify my address, so they sent a cashier's check to the address they couldn't verify.  (Without calling me.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had same similar experience, but the company dint submit my complete adress, and had the same ordeal but the post office did not hold my belongins, but it was worth the trouble because the company and the post office were all rattle up with my complaints that I eventually receive 2 x-rom kits...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ooh, okay.. my past experiences with Success-hk has been all good!!
<br/>
only downside was that i had to wait for a month and a half before my flashcart arrived... but there was a good reason: out of stock ^^
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and I think too many complain at the store too fast.. even if the local post-office might have been the screw-ups....<br/>_________________<br/>yeah, well, maybe... or? anyways.... eh...  what was i talking about??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
