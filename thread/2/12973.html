(Note: the following not necessarily applicable outside North America)
<br/>
<br/>
Most americans already own and rely on a car. Without it, they'd have no way to get to work/grocery store/etc., since most people live well outside walking distance from the places they need to be on a regular basis, and that's something that usually outside of their control. Most places in the US don't have good enough mass transit that people can get by without a car. If you're in someplace where that can be done (like NYC or something), then I can sympathize, but you'd be in the minority.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.

<br/>
Exactly.  It sucks to have no transportation, but that's not a problem with Nintendo's supply chain.  
<br/>
<br/>
That being said, you can get a cheap used car in most parts of the US for about $1000.  It'll be a piece of junk, and wouldn't be reliable enough for long trips, but it'll get you to the store on most days.  In most states, driving lessons aren't required if you are over 18.  Just go take the driver's test.  The only required insurance in most states is liability, which is pretty cheap if you haven't had any traffic violations in the past.  
<br/>
<br/>
My point?  Having a working car can be done for relatively cheap.  Generally, if you (or the person providing for you) can afford to get a wii, you can afford the transportation to get a wii.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Only in Animal Crossing. In this world, I'm just blaming Nintendo for the fact that months later, only launch quantities are still available.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
