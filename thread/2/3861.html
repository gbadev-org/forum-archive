    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone out there found a good site, community, or tutorial on creating games for cell phones? I'm interested in learning more, but I don't really know where to start, besides google of course.
<br/>
<br/>
I've heard some people on this forum mention it a few times, so I'm hoping for some suggestions. Anyone?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Check out <a href="http://www.mophun.com." target="_blank">www.mophun.com.</a>  It's a development environment that works on a number of different phone models, and you can download the API and compiler/tools for free.  It's similar to GBA development, too, with tilemap and sprite functions already supported.  There's a decent forum there for Mophun development.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it dosent make sence to spend time on mophun, its way past its prime.
<br/>
if you want to make games for mobile phones you should rather take a look at java, brew or symbian.<br/>_________________<br/>cheers,
