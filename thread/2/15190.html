    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there any information about file formats used in Brawl? I downloaded one stage, open in hex editor, it appears to be encrypted or something like that, but the site I downloaded from it says they automatically fill in the name, but I wouldn't know how to do that. Also there are program for decrypt screenshots, making better quality than a normal screenshot, but I can't find the document for how it works, or source-codes. And, what memory address is file stored on Wii remote for the controls of the game, if you changed it? And, can you edit the file on computer to mix Japanese and English in your name, and can you edit the controls to something other than the restrictions they give to you, such as L shoulder button to move left?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
