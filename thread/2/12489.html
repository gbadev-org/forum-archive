    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone know if its even possible to get a DS without this problem? I am weird like that and it bothers me so much I went out and bought 3 DS Lites (all Onyx Black) and they all have the problem to one degree or another.
<br/>
<br/>
So now I have a pile of DS sitting here and I'm thinking, aside from the fact that I am weird like this, why can't Nintendo make a DS that has equal color temperature on both screens.
<br/>
<br/>
And I don't want to hear about how the bottom screen is a touch screen, bla bla. We already know that they did use a different rough screen for the early models and it had normal color temperature and white uniformity.
<br/>
<br/>
At this point I'd be willing to pay $$$ for a freaking DS with a normal bottom screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not totaly sure that is true since from my research it seems that the initial release of hardware included both screens, and subsequent to release they dropped the rough one in favor of the smooth one entirely.
<br/>
<br/>
Even if that is the case, where would I be able to find an old model that is new in box? Probably impossible since they are sold out everywhere I go.
<br/>
<br/>
Unless you are suggesting I look on EBay? That's not a bad idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh wait, yours is a regular DS, not a DS lite? Well that explains it because the original DS' never had the problem. It's specific to the DS Lite.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
