    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to skip the entire "getting homebrew published" phase and actually become a licenced developer for nintendo. However, their corporate site is a little hard to navigate and as such (although it points out the limited opportunities quite nicely) I am having a hard time figuring out exactly what I need to do to be "qualified". I realize that they kind of stress exierience in the field as a requirement, but won't other companies stress this as well? How am I supposed to gain experience that I don't already have?
<br/>
<br/>
Can you (meaning anyone with a shred of info) point me to some places and possibly some people who can help me with this sort of thing? I mean, it makes more sense to go work for the company and actually get games published than it does to try to publish from home... Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know, doesn't Nintendo's developer site suck? :P
<br/>
<br/>
One great place to start and become established is developing smaller shareware PC games.
<br/>
<br/>
Those are much easier to get published, and you don't need huge budgets to do them, either!
<br/>
Check out GarageGames, Idigicon (they mainly publish educational games), GameDev.net...
<br/>
<br/>
A tip for developing the things. If you are looking for any handy development tools and you don't mind spending a bit of money, I would recommend Blitz3d or BlitzMax. Not only are they nice languages, but the community there is great and full of many established indie game developers (including the soon to be even more legendary John Pickford) from whom you can glean all sorts of knowledge.
<br/>
Of course, be careful making any decision; they aren't for everyone and you could easily prefer more advanced languages C++ if you're already acquainted with them.
<br/>
There are also a few other languages like FreeBASIC, DarkBASIC (which is apparently painfully expensive/buggy, but I've probably been biased), Torque (building something with it is more like unbuilding the stuff it has; some people seem to prefer that way, though)... Some are better suited than others. Essentially what I mean by this little ramble is that, with casual sorts of games, the simpler you can make the development environment the better.
<br/>
<br/>
A really neat way to gain a bit of qualification is to contribute code to some big open source projects. "I work for free!" seems to look pretty good for various evil employers :b
<br/>
Even if it's just some artwork for a Linux distro, it can be pretty cool.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the hardest and least fun way that is also, unfortunately, the most likely way (for some people): School. Surprises happen, like with those people who got hired by VALVe to work on Portal. There are some real success stories! (Thus obscuring the hours of boredom. Be careful, some courses don't even touch code!).
<br/>
School stuff is also a good way to meet other skilled developers; games like Bontago and (I think, but am not sure) Darwinia are stellar examples of that.
<br/>
<br/>
Some handy links:
<br/>
-<a class="postlink" href="http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=65083" target="_blank">So you want to be an indie developer? (More links inside)</a>
<br/>

<br/>
-<a class="postlink" href="http://www.gameproducer.net/" target="_blank">http://www.gameproducer.net/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Here are a couple notable things done by small shareware developers that I know of:
<br/>
-<a class="postlink" href="http://www.squashysoftware.com/" target="_blank">Platypus</a>. Along with a nice, exciting little Making Of.
<br/>
-<a class="postlink" href="http://www.zee-3.com/" target="_blank">Naked War</a> (Err... don't let the name ruin it). Those people (John and Ste Pickford) went from established AAA game dev to independent, but it is possible to go the other way :b
<br/>
-Of course, there are many others...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any of those sorts of things, if they work out well, should help you get Nintendo's attention.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps, and good luck!<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Picklesworth gives some excellent advice for getting hired by a game company, which is by far the best way to both gain contacts in the industry.  Once you have a bunch of contacts at the publishers it is vastly easier (but still very hard!) to get a game published if you have a solid demo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#110435 - sgeos - Tue Nov 28, 2006 5:03 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You will have to be willing and able to enforce an NDA.  If you look like you might disappear, you will not get a dev kit.  Nintendo does not want people funneling official dev kits to ebay or Akihabara or whereever else they might end up.  The same goes for the official documentation.
<br/>
<br/>
Financial Stability + Business Plan = Chances of Approval
<br/>
<br/>
I'm fairly sure that the Nintendo developer requirements boil down to financial stability.  If Coca-Cola applied stating, "we have a new game development division and would like to purchase dev kits for R&amp;D"... I'm fairly sure that they would be approved.  MS/Sony and affiliated companies might be denied if they were to actually apply.  I could see that going either way.
<br/>
<br/>
Where does this leave a small developer?  You'll either have to come up with funding on your own or get a big publisher to vouch for you.
<br/>
<br/>
If you've published anything at all the scales will probably be tipped in your favor.  I'm not sure how capitalized <a class="postlink" href="http://www.popcap.com/" target="_blank">PopCap games</a> is, but I'm fairly sure they'd be approved.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow. This is all fine and good, but I\'m not looking to get published. I don\'t have a company of my own. I want to be hired by nintendo in the fields of programming to work on their projects, not necessarily to get a devkit to work on my own.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the crud about being established will probably be the better way to go at first. I am still in high school (but only for another semester!) so I am looking into all sorts of colleges and things. I am going to go to a smaller technical college to get an assosciates degree, and their program promises to get me into work in my field somewhere, or pretty much die trying, so that will be a big help. After that, I plan to go either into a 4-year university or another branch of this college to get a bachelors and major in something broad like software engineering or computer science. 
<br/>
<br/>
I realize that in order to get into gaming, you need to be established elsewhere first. However, the shareware option doesn\'t exactly look like a bad place to look into.
<br/>
<br/>
How exactly does one \"develop\" smaller shareware PC games. Is it something I can do on my own, or do I need to be a part of a group? (not exactly a problem here, we\'re working on a very nice RPG as we speak, which is a first for me, since I prefer the puzzle field actually)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, how would I go about publishing these games in such a way that they would become recognized by the companies I am looking at?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your help so far. I knew y\'all would pull through!

So idealy what I do is make a bunch of games that I think are fun and interesting (and idealy show off some nice effects or concepts to display my skills) and then license and sell the games online? And I keep on doing this as a hobby to whatever I study in college until I have a nice collection of stuff, and use all of that stuff in my portfolio when I apply?
<br/>
<br/>
Would interesting projects also be in the non-game range, like 3D modeling applications and the like? Also, are freeware projects considered shareware by this set of standards? I really dont like the idea of charging for all of my projects, or really any of them, but I could handle it for the finalized games, if I ever end up with any...

Disclaimer:  I'm a full time programmer, but not in the games industry.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are trying to get hired, as opposed to becoming a "licensed developer", I don't think it matters whether your stuff is commercial/shareware/etc.  Have a portfolio of cool stuff (games, 3d apps, etc).  Make sure at least some of them are completed....demos look nice and all, but having a finished, polished product to show demonstrates that you can follow through with things.  Chances are, they won't be looking for one specific type of thing ("How many japanese-style RPG's have you made?"), but instead will be looking for your general programming skill, ability to complete a project, creativity, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I see. This is a nice touch, considering that my art skills arent that great. Perhaps I should focus on developing our very nice battle system on PC instead of on the DS, as I intended. Thats the kind of stuff I excel at. I actually like crunching numbers as opposed to drawing stuff, can you believe it? 
<br/>
<br/>
OK, I think I have enough to run with. Thanks yall! I am in the college application process now, so I will simply worry about that and keep this little development thing to the hobby that it needs to be. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I was looking at the nintendo site, and they require a certain number of years of experience in a certain field. How do you show that you have spent time on a project? Or does that have to be years developing for another company?

Yes, no, maybe?  It depends on the company.  Everything seems to be being done with SDKs these days, so you are probably better off programming using an SDK that a DS homebrew lib.  (Maybe?)  If you can write assembler, that is always good.  It really depends on what the company and people hiring are looking for.

<br/>
Here is a basic checklist for you:  Can you program?  Can you program a game?  Can you complete projects?  Can you complete large projects?  Can work as part of a team?

I sent nintendo such an email. and got an automated response pointing me to the school campus on which the company resides. (This info I already knew.) They gave me none of the actual info I asked for. Unless I can figure out how to talk to a real person, I\'m shot there.
<br/>
<br/>
I figure I\'ll go into a much smaller company that is licensed to publish games on a nintento platform, and work my way up to nintendo development. (By this, I mean that I want to be working on the zelda and mario things, the characters that make their way into SSB, the ones where nintendo is the only logo that shows up.)
<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, I\'m working with my team (I got a group together) to put up a site devoted to our actual PC projects, so we can start making this whole portfolio thing happen. It should turn out very nicely, and then we can add projects and such as we get them done and focus on our schoolwork.
<br/>
<br/>
Can you list some companies I might be able to get in with (that are licensed with nintendo) that would not look instantly at your years of experience? Nintendo appears to look at that first, from what I can tell, so experience is (as I have stated a few times now) going to be my main focus. Years of training is easy to cover, thats what college is for.

I was under the vague impression that they only gave SDKs to licensed developers. Kinda pricey in my opinion for a hobbiest programmer, so I will stick to my PC stuff. Unless you mean things like VisualStudio, in which case Im already all over it.

(1)Uh, programming and mathematics
<br/>
(2)Video games of all varieties, mainly in the areas of statistics and inner (sometimes unseen) workings of varios game pieces. Engines, map generators, external level designers, etc. Stuff that makes the actual game material work. Oh, and I am a music composer, so that is probably important too.
<br/>
(3)Not to hot in the character art department, but I can do basic things like menu systems and make them look quite nice. Much unlike many demo systems, I actually prefer my menus to be highly interactive. (On the DS, my menus will probably be more fun to play with than the games themselves.)
<br/>
<br/>
That pretty much covers it I think. Thanks for the stuff so far, and I like the way this discussion is going.

My advice in general is not to e-mail (unless you know the other person), but to phone people if you want to get an answer. It's far too common that important e-mails A) never get past the spamfilter B) get there, but get deleted right away or C) get a lackluster form letter response, possibly even automated.

If you really want to work for Nintendo, contacting them is a good thing, but don't forget to contact other companies too.  For whatever reason, Nintendo might not hire you.  Furthurmore, another company might give you some really good advice that will help you land a job.

Good luck.  Very few people get to work on those franchises and many people want to work on them.  Your best bet is graduate from Digipen.  Last I heard, Digipen graduates have a more or less guaranteed spot at either Nintendo or Sony.  Last I heard, HAL was the developer of Smash Brothers.

<br/>
What do you want to be hired as?  You could probably get a job as a game tester now at just about any company.  Smaller companies are typically more idiosyncratic, or at least personal, in their hiring policies.  Large companies have to hire more people, and they weed out unlikely candidates with minimum requirements.
<br/>
<br/>
My advice is to go to the mall.  Look at the games on the shelves.  Look at the publishers.  Some of the games might even the developers.  Also, figure out who is making your favorite games.  Contact all of the above.  Personally, I'd keep track of who properly responds to you and then I'd apply to them first after graduating.

<br/>
SDK stands for standard development kit.  No, you won't get the official Nintendo DS SDK, but you could make something with Java's SDK, or some other SDK.  A lot of using an SDK is being able wade through the documentation (at least at first).  You can learn that anywhere.  Any SDK you might use will be able to similar things, even if they go about doing them differently.

Many/most of the composers at game companies can program, but they compose music instead.  Chances are, you'll either be a composer or a programmer.  Maybe you really want to work on audio programming?  You might not get to work on that, but your employer may want to know what you are good at and what you want to work on.

You'll probably either be a programmer or an artist- at least if you are working on the DS.  If you apply as a programmer, then you will be interviewed for a programming position.  What would you rather not program?  AI?  Encrytion?  Code optimized in assembler?  PC side data conversion filters?

Ugh. I can't stand Digipen... maybe it once stood for quality, I dunno, but from everything I've seen it's largely become a clearing house for unqualified, uneducated people who dream of making video games, but unless they have the initiative and discipline to educate themselves <span style="font-style: italic">outside of the curriculum</span>, simply won't acquire anything that makes them genuinely useful in the industry.
<br/>
<br/>
From what I can tell, they basically run you through a bunch of hoops that builds you up a portfolio of team projects, but there's no quality control or attempt to teach or apply any real software development fundamentals.
<br/>
<br/>
(This is not a blanket statement on the quality of Digipen graduates; I know some strong programmers who graduated from Digipen. I just don't think they owe very much to Digipen for it.)
<br/>
<br/>
I've also seen many programming candidates from Digipen who <span style="font-style: italic">desperately</span> want to work in video games, and will clearly work their asses off to prove themselves, but <span style="font-style: italic">Digipen simply didn't teach them the fundamentals they needed to know in order to be useful</span>, and we couldn't take them on unless we were prepared to shoulder the burden of educating them on pretty much everything we already needed them to be capable of.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're serious about programming as a career, consider an actual four-year comp sci or software engineering bachelor's degree. Digipen may help you get your foot in the door in some places... but then again, the reputation they are currently earning for their graduates is far from stellar.

Completely, categorically avoiding games courses is probably a good idea.  I'd take a computer science graduate and an art school animation graduate over a couple of game course graduates.  YMMV.

It might be a foot in the door. The bar certainly isn't too high if you wanna stand out.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to work on one of their top-level franchises, though, I'd wager the route to doing that would still be quicker going with an actual degree and getting industry experience at other companies. They won't be recruiting from Digipen to make the next Zelda, that's for sure.

Traditional companies in Japan <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> consider new graduates.

So its either Digipen or a comuter science degree. Well, being born in Texas, I am sort of out of the way of digipen to begin with, so maybe Ill deal with a college around here. Im so confused right now, it feels so nice.

Keep in mind that Digipen is a <span style="font-style: italic">money-making business</span> run by Nintendo. It is in their every interest to attempt to recruit people for the college by selling their connecton to it.
<br/>
<br/>
A comp-sci or software eng degree can only serve you better than a Digipen diploma; it can't serve you any worse. If you're determined and you've got what it takes, then who knows, you may one day get to work on one of their A-level franchises, but I can pretty much guarantee you it won't be because you went through Digipen.
