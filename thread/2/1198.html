    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have any books been written about Gameboy Advance development that used DevKit Advanced as a base?  I remember someone asking me about it years ago, but I do not think anything ever came of it.
<br/>
<br/>
I ask because I feel that I could tackle the task of writing a book about GBA development, but I want to know if it has already been done.
<br/>
<br/>
What books are available?  What gaps need to be filled?
<br/>
<br/>
I assure you that my writing skills are better than my internet postings make them out to be ^_^
<br/>
<br/>
How many people would actually buy a book if it was available?  How many would just use an online version available for free with DevKit Advance?  (That makes it obvious that I would look to O'Reilly to publish it).
<br/>
<br/>
I have always wanted to be a writer, but chose to persue computers instead.  I have also been trying to figure out a way to get some compensation for DKA in a fair way.  I don't really feel comfortable  adding a 'PayPal Donate' button DKA's web site ^_^
<br/>
<br/>
I'm I still just dreaming, or do I have an audience here?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://devkitadv.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">http://devkitadv.sourceforge.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think a book about the compiler only would be viable for mass selling.
<br/>
<br/>
But i could be interested.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think there needs to be a book about some of the more advanced techniques and aspects of GBA programming. 
<br/>
<br/>
Like a book that starts out with a basic project, and by the end, you have a fully featured game. 
<br/>
<br/>
The book can cover some of the basics like collision detection, and then also some of the more advanced things like graphical effects, managing memory, etc.  
<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice to see an example of how to go about making a game, from the beginning to end, with all the details, and planning.
<br/>
<br/>
I know there are books about game development, but I'd like to see one whose focus is on GBA game making.  I think there's a gba programming book coming out soon, but I don't think it covers "game-making" stuff.<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Any book would not just cover the compiler, but how to use it end to end to create a real game.  Focusing purely on DKA would make it incomplete.  For example, DKA is totally mute concerning IO registers, palettes, sprites, and video memory, and it should probably stay that way.
<br/>
<br/>
Whether or not I decide to write a book only determines if I document those things not addressed by DKA as well as the things that are such as the memory map, interrupts, the linkscript, crt0.S, low level IO hooks, appended assets, multiboot-cart loading, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, everything about DKA specifically will be documented, and documented well.  I am just wondering if there is an opportunity here to get something published.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://devkitadv.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">http://devkitadv.sourceforge.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

(http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/?group_id=67315) to the DevKit Advance web pages a day and think it must be a lot of people.  I wonder who all those people are?  Especially considering that I only update about once a month.  700 hits should translate to at least 100 individuals.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't help but think that if someone was browsing the book store, and saw a book telling them on the cover that they could create Gameboy games at home that they would become very interested.
<br/>
<br/>
I would estimate that the number of people downloading the devkit fluctuates between 3 and 20 people a day each week.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what to make of these numbers, maybe they are an illusion, but I think it means that many people are at least curious about it, even if they don't participate in forums or mailing lists, or ever even produce something interesting.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://devkitadv.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">http://devkitadv.sourceforge.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I should have tried to sell the idea more, then people would be less wishy-washy and say yes or no.
<br/>
<br/>
I would have to write a book for people who at least know C inside and out.  It is such a small, simple language, that I can't imagine wasting space on teaching basics when so many other good books and web sites are available to teach it.
<br/>
<br/>
There are already a few, very thick, books on game design.  And although none focus on the Gameboy Advance, I'm not sure they need to.  The practical design of GBA games is self evident.  Just play as many good ones as you can and take notes.  I think you may need the more abstract design theories to give you a vocabulary to think and talk about what you learn from actually studying games.
<br/>
<br/>
I think when students clamor for less abstract and more practical they are really asking people to do too much of their thinking for them (teachers are supposed to do a little thinking for you).  At college I always thought it was a symptom of a person not learning any particular programming language well enough when they could not see a real solution when presented with abstract theory.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, people have different ways of thinking and solving problems, so it is really just my opinion.
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I am not qualified to write a book about game design.  I am like a home movie enthusiast who studies great films.  I understand a lot, but you would want Spielburg to write you a book about movie directing, not me.  
<br/>
<br/>
What I do understand is the GNU Compiler Collection and how to use it to get the most out of the Gameboy Advance.   My aim would be to write a book that would impart the practical knowledged needed to allow you to know exactly how to do what you imagine.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be practical, but it would be practical implementation, not practical game design.
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I am getting started because certain parts of this project have to be completed whether or not they ever get converted into dead tree format.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://devkitadv.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">http://devkitadv.sourceforge.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A lot of people are trying to learn *programming* on the GBA. That's a really, really bad idea in my opinion. It's the old trying to run before you can walk thing.
<br/>
<br/>
Sure, learn game programming on it, after all it has some nice game-oriented tricks up its sleeve, but only once you have at least a basic idea of what you are doing with variables, arrays, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Writing about that would be a waste of time, for yourself and anyone who wanted to know about devkit. One question though - wouldn't Nintendo stop you from doing this? I know they *shouldn't*, but they are heartless SOBs. And a general arm targeted GNU gcc manual would be a bit... dry.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#5952 - Jason Wilkins - Tue May 13, 2003 7:41 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A general arm-gcc manual would also be very short, probably about 4 pages.
<br/>
<br/>
I am 100 percent confident that there is nothing Nintendo could do to prevent anyone from writing about how to program the Gameboy Advance anymore than Toyota could stop someon from writing a Toyota repair manual.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, there is already this:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1931841780/ref=sr_aps_books_1_2/026-9015716-0312421" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1931841780/ref=sr_aps_books_1_2/026-9015716-0312421</a>
<br/>
<br/>
(just don't ask me why it is only available at amazon.co.uk ^_^)
<br/>
<br/>
I do not plan on writing anything "For Dummies".  DevKit Advance documentation will be for people who know how to program, understand C, the basics of a C toolchain, and just need to know how to use the tools to access every function of the GBA.  
<br/>
<br/>
After users have had their hands held through some tutorials and have learned the basics from other sources, then they will appreciate the non-tutorial style more.
<br/>
<br/>
This doesn't exclude some sort of 'quick start tutorial', which answers questions like 'how do I compile a program', but even that would aimed only at people who have not used gcc before, not people who have never compiled a C program before.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://devkitadv.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">http://devkitadv.sourceforge.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well usually any shipment would take 4-6 weeks, which is 1 month to 1 and a half months. This is amazon, they are probably very busy. Isnt it becuase they send out all the shipments for an area when they get big enough to not lose money from only have a few packages going to one area. Oh, do they not send a package delivery service ( plane, truck ) to the area, or do they just send it threw the mail ( hahaha, lost in a few hours. ) 
<br/>
<br/>
I live about 106 km from where I ordered my skateboard, and they said 4-6 weeks... took 2 months.

Just be happy they dont get you so anxious and say 2-4 weeks and end up getting it in 2 months.

Anyway, I dont know what you mean by "condition." It isnt in any condition, its condition is bran new.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean why does this book have this statement? the whole availability statement? its just like percaution you could say, to let you know a possible reason why your package might be late. Dont even acknowledge that, just ignore it, this book isnt out yet so dont worry about stock, and the book will most definetly be printed.
<br/>
<br/>
Sit back and relax on the posts bro, dont post so many questions about little things. The more you post about little things, the more annoyed people will get with you and ignore the big posts and problems.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Include only a little bit of C or C++ stuff in there. And maybe you could actuallyteach someone about programming for a console in general. 
<br/>
<br/>
I am a pretty good DirectX (that's PC programming for those who don't know) programmer and have had Microsoft's API do all the allocation for me. As of now i am using HAM v2.71 and i am trying to get off the API stuff and do direct programming.
<br/>
<br/>
Like talk about how registers control everything and how RAM is used. Don't assume we are dumb in programming, just dumb to console (register) programming.

Would i buy the book.... Maybe... is it worth looking into. YEAH!!!<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
