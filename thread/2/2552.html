    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have something like that on mine too, except it's less serious. When I reset the computer, it changes my IE homepage to a site called fastsearch or something, and then after the computer's been on for a long time (usually about once a day) it runs out of memory like things have been locking up and not freeing up the memory they were using, even when nothing has locked up since the last reset. Then I have to reset it and the homepage thing happens again. Very annoying. Has anyone else had anything like this happen?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, one solution I can suggest for your problem is to run c:\windows\system\msconfig.exe and disable all the unneccessary startup programs and see if you can track down the bad one. Just looking at the names, popserver sounds pretty bad. Good luck getting it fixed. Spyware is the worst thing to happen to the internet since spam.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently deleted about a gig of junk off my 98 computer's hard drive, but all it did was slow it way down.  I can't even run my NES emulators for debugging (much less GBA), and my other computer isn't DOS-friendly.  I've also had Deku's problem with fastsearch controlling my IE settings.  I looked through the registry, msconfig, ini files, and I have run Ad-Aware several times, but this won't go away.  I just think it's ironic that the fastsearch homepage says "the search engine you trust".<br/>_________________<br/>DS... shiny...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What DOS apps do you use regularly, other than possibly mb.exe? When I switched to Windows 2000, I switched all my custom development tools from DJGPP (GCC for DOS) to MinGW (GCC for Windows).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Download Process Explorer, it gives you more details about processes running and whether they are services, jobs, or own processes. You can  turn on colour coding and get better visual feedback on whats what.
<br/>
<br/>
And as someone above mentioned, run MSConfig and stop unnessesary programs from launching on start up. If you get in a habit of doing this you will know whats running in the background and will be able to identify possible Spyware and Viruses or even just annoying processes that software use for checking their website for updates.
