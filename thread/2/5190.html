    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just a heads up.  I know Tepples mods on both of these forums, and I'm not sure how many of you guys frequent those forums.  ANYWAY, I got an email from the admin of the boards saying that they've been hacked so I had to check and see what happened.
<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;All the fonts have been changed to super big
<br/>
--&gt;There's a pic of some man butt-naked and grabbing himself down there
<br/>
--&gt;All posts have been over-written.  Each word is now "gaygaygay"
<br/>
--&gt;The hacker was too much of a pussy to leave behind a calling card.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I'm mad.  Not at the site for the security issue, but more at the hacker for being such a wimp.  Hopefully they were too much of a n00b script-kiddie to go through a proxy.
<br/>
<br/>
Just a heads-up for you guys.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I hope this site has better security.  I would be very surprised if the admins of pocketheaven didn't have a backup of the forums from yesterday, since I've seen them restore a backup once before, which made some of my posts disappear.
<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed they were running an old PHPBB from 2002.  If that's not putting up a great big "hack me" sign, then what is?<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was never a mod on boards.pocketheaven.com. I'm just a regular there, as I was here until I got 2,000 posts.

In many cases, this is reversible. After an <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/dwi/OSC3P-BF-readme.txt" target="_blank">incident on DDREI.com's forum</a> that prompted me to write the song <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/dwi/Balloon_Fever.ogg" target="_blank">"Balloon Fever"</a> (a happy hardcore cover of a tune from a 1984 Nintendo game), I did a bit of research into phpBB's censor mechanism. The posts themselves may not have been edited in the database but rather rewritten at the word-censor level.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ah, interesting.  So then it was almost like a dictionary hack that was used.  It also makes sense to do it that way since it would be significantly quicker then to edit every post.  The fact that each word is the same makes sense for it to be a censor-like edit.  I sure hope they get it all fixed up.
<br/>
<br/>
"Baloon Fever" is awesome!!
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and sorry about that mistake up there.  I (for some reason) thought you were a mod there.
