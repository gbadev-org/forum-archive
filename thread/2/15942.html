    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dell Dimension 4100 purchased in the fourth quarter of 2000. Came with 128 MB of RAM; added a 256 MB stick. Came with Windows ME; upgraded to Windows 2000 and then Windows XP through college. It doesn't come close to meeting the minimum CPU requirement for the camcorder that I just bought, but FFmpeg still works.

<br/>
GBA purchased ine June 2001. Came with no writable program storage; upgraded to an MBV2 cable, a Flash Advance Pro 256 Mbit, and eventually a GBA Movie Player.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
