It'll happen, given that one of the pirate cards is already able to play 512 Mbit commercial games by translating DS card accesses into accesses to a file on a CF card. This is especially easy because both are block devices, though there is a bit of jerkiness during FMV playback. The difference with the NES emulators is that the NES carts aren't a block device, and using a block device to emulate a directly addressed device has always been slow.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I'm right about it being the first 16KiB of DS EXWRAM being overwritten that is preventing the demos loading, then I could probably release my source now and I think no one would be able to make it work, except maybe DarkFader. You need detailed knowledge of how the GBAMP works, and how my hack works, in order to do this. 
<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few hints (and reasons):
<br/>
1) Only the first 512B of flash are accessible on the GBAMP before it is unlocked
<br/>
2) My loader is not in those first 512B, and therefore must be loaded by the GBAMP firmware
<br/>
3) The GBAMP firmware loads it to 0x02000000, using a mov instruction to obtain that value
<br/>
4) The bootstrap code must execute from pretty much the same halfword addresses as it does now, as this is what unlocks the cart
<br/>
5) Changing the destination address would involve changing the mov to an ldr, or else the original firmware won't load (for those who still use it). I guess this is one thing a pirate won't care about
<br/>
6) All 512B are used for something, I had enough trouble changing the jump to address (I had pretty much the same problem, but found one duplicate piece of data in the pool)
<br/>
7) Without any place to put that ldr value, you ain't loading anything to any address that isn't a shifted byte value
<br/>
<br/>
Oh crap. I just realised I can change the mov r0, #0x2000000 to a mov r0, #0x2100000 and it will still work, both in NDS mode (where it no longer overwrites that RAM) and GBA mode (where it wraps back to 0x2000000). The question is, should I?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think that not making things is not the right way for things to go. Being a pirate or not is always a question of choice in the end. Not doing something like this would be like censorship. People have the possibility to choose between "wrong" and "right" and that possibility should never be taken from them.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a thing roaming my mind, which is this. Imagine a guy or girl has no money to buy games, and was offered a DS with piracy capabilities. Why shouldn't he/she pirate the games, if she would never be capable of buying them anyway? Why should money give him/her more rights?
<br/>
<br/>
Where I live, at Portugal the games available are shameful. I have like 3 or 4 games in the market, and there probably won't be much more available.
<br/>
<br/>
So I tend to buy them on ebay. I have already spent more in games that my DS has cost me, and I must say that the last 3 games weren't very good:\ If I had bought them at the store I would have returned them, but I can't, so I'm stuck with them. If I am able to play pirate games, I'll then know which games are good. The new NDS patcher has already put me wanting to buy Advance Wars really bad.

But, to tell some one that they should do this or that, because piracy is already available on the NDS..  and that it's not "their choice" what everyone else does with their "product" is a load of crap!
<br/>
<br/>
I agree emulators allow people to take pirated ROMs and run them on other hardware, but the emulator itself, NOR THE DEVELOPER of the emulator are pirating.  Now, this may be a stupid statement (and I don't know if I believe it myself), but I like to think the emulator developers aren't doing it for piracy.  They are doing it to understand the innar workings of the hardware they are emulating.
<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the SuperCard was designed with piracy in mind..  I also agree that (sadly) piracy helps the homebrew community.  But, if the homebrew community takes the "evil pirating" SuperCard and makes it work with the DS for homebrew, to give developers an additional 32MB of RAM and direct access to the CF card, that's GREAT!  The SuperCard becomes an awesome Homebrew tool.

Wow..  Crack must be cheap these days, as everyone seams to be smoking it!  I don't know what 3rd world anti homebrew country you live it, but it is not illegal to code your own games/apps in the U.S. and that's all I care about.

I liken myself to a weapons manufacturer. If I choose to make it, my product can cause harm to others (through lost profits, ignoring anticapitalist sentimentalities) and allow people to break the law (piracy <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> illegal). In fact, that would be the entire point of the product (let's face it, guns are designed to kill people and "backups" are for piracy). 
<br/>
<br/>
Simply creating it so others have the ability to choose is not enough motivation for me. It will take hours of effort to make it work, and I don't want to waste those hours, since the end product can't do anything legitimately legal (except proper backups).
<br/>
<br/>
When I release the source code, people can improve it in any way that want. I just wonder, do you think releasing it under GPL will mean the pirates contribute back to the original source tree? I don't.
<br/>
<br/>
It's just a sad fact of life that piracy and homebrew are closely intertwined. Without homebrewer's there wouldn't be the ability to run unofficial code on any console. This unfortunately includes unofficial "backups". However, without piracy there would not be enough demand for flashcarts to make them profitable to manufacture, and homebrew would not have such a wide audience.

The GBA Movie Player was designed for lawful timeshifting of programs recorded from television. It still sells enough at $25 a pop to merit continued production, even without the wink-wink-nudge-nudge of piracy.

The GBAMP is not a real flash cart, as you said. It can run only a few GBA ROMs and, through hacking, many homebrew NDS ROMs. This is actually a good solution, as it is very difficult to get it to run pirate games. The people who have the knowledge to make piracy work have so far been uninterested (speaking from the 3rd person and in general). Unfortunately, you still get the occasional <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7074" target="_blank">ignorant pirate</a> who doesn't understand the limitations and illegalities of the issue.

I don't think the manufacturers of unofficial flash carts had official developers in mind when they made the carts.

I don't agree with your example. You are not making the gun. Someone else will do the gun with something you did. Just like Nobel and powder.
<br/>
<br/>
But of course the choice of doing it or not is always yours, that's not even in question here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

By the way, great work with reviving the Chrono's OST, brilliant work really. Too bad it got canceled:\

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">AFAIK, you couldn't pirate your games on GBAmp, because of slow CF access times. Demos shouldn't be such a problem, because the load entirely into RAM. And I'd love to see old SNES Marios on DS.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is possible to pirate games from the CF card, as the M3 firmware has shown. It has a feature to stream the games straight from disc. I too would like demos to work, since they are free and fun. Unfortunately I am pretty sure that the same things holding back the demos are holding back the commercial ROMs. This is a big deterent for me, since I don't want to see my work used for piracy.

As for SnesDS, this probably won't be fixed until Loopy updates again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's fine. I too was just explaining my reasons and wasn't trying to flame anyone.

<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
Well it seems that I accidentally fixed WMB demos when I fixed SnesDS. I purposely left out the CRC stuff in the public release, but that doesn't seem to have stopped them loading. Unfortunately, it is now "in the wild" and I can't really remove all copies of it. I am not going to announce it either, so hopefully people won't notice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
