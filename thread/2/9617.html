    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">that certainly does ruin a perfectly good game. WFC will get less popular with things like this coming up :( and less WFC users, less chance nintendo will make more WFC games. I hope nintendo can find some way to stop these idiots</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Well, when you go online with your DSgame for the first time, NWC registers a identificationcode or something on your DS.
<br/>
<br/>
But I think it would be easy for hackers to fix that :/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Everyone draws the line in a different place.  I guess I'm a bit liberal in that I think playing restricted tracks online in MKDS is okay, as is generating acww loot through savehacking and sharing it with friends who want it.  I consider this passive hacking, not active cheating.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't approve of cheating online.  Someone has created a hack for mkds that makes you 150cc speed online.  I am completely and totally against this.  This video proves the tetris hack.  Again, I am completely and totally against this.  If someone makes some kind of metroid aimbot or infinite ammo or other similar cheat, I will be totally against that.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad this stuff is hard to find online if it's even released.  Cheating hurts the gaming community, while mkds restricted track hacking just makes your opponent go WTF?! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, you can reset your friend code and the ID code.<br/>_________________<br/>Private property.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That kind of crap has always been part of online gaming.  I mean.. The first time I played THAS online I got my ass handed to me by a guy screaming back and forth on the screen with a gazillion points.  Sure.. he could be a super leet sk8r... or a cheater.. hmm...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.. I doubt there will ever be a way to stop cheating online.  Even 3rd party addons for playing online seem to get bypassed at some point.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
