    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
even though my resolution was to only buy a DS once I have programmed something for it, I got weak and bought it anyway. Bought a black DS lite with 4 games - so far I am impressed. It lifted my mood and that was the general idea behind buying it, so I don't feel too guilty.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think my contributions here will remain to be completely academic for the time being, as I don't want to risk bricking my DS lite by incorrectly flashing it. Also, I have seen that one of the online stores for the flash cards and no pass said "currently out of stock", so I don't even have the hardware to put any hypothetical programs of mine onto the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and on a sidenote, I am reading Neuromancer right now. So that's where the nick Wintermute comes from! :)
<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,
<br/>
