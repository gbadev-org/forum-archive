    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought an MBV2 cable a while back, tried it, and didn't like it.  I paid $20 US plus shipping for it, but it's been sitting on my desk in its box pretty much since I bought it.  It works, but I have no use for it, especially since I have a flash card and a GBAMP.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested in it?  I'd be happy with a couple bucks plus shipping cost, say $5 US?  PM me if you're serious and I'll get a shipping estimate for you.  Generally, it'll probably be aroun $4 or $5 to ship within Canada, a dollar or two more to go to the US.

Tell you what... I'll even throw in Turok: Shadow of Oblivion for GBC and/or a DS stylus if you want either/both for free.  (I'm just trying to clear some space off my desk).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
