Yes, but at least I could have invented texture mapping or something like that. Maybe I'm just being a big baby, but I don't care; I've got the credentials to have invented something. I'm 22 this month and I haven't invented anything yet, by this time Einstein had already published his paper on "Consequences of the observations of capillarity phenomena".
<br/>
<br/>
I tried a new effect, and the researcher said I'm a generation too late, it's in all of the next gen's GPU's now! I've been thinking of it since I first came across 3d.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
i.e. i have often 'invented' things that turned out to exist already, and thought 'man, if i'd been there'. but it often turns out that the 'invention' may have been the conclusion or combination of things known to me, which might only be the result of the same 'invention', or, might have not been known at the time of the invention. Sometimes knowing the need of the invention is the major part about it; and thinking 'I figured it out', but already knowing the need is just misleading yourself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#121383 - keldon - Mon Mar 12, 2007 2:21 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That can be the case, but not always. I think that the need for a particular technology motivates invention more than previous knowledge assisting it. However knowledge that it does exist may help a lot as you know there is a solution to be found instead of having an incline that the solution might exist. It also means that a precedent has already been set, and something to judge your work by.
<br/>
<br/>
It can also be argued that half of the invention is identifying the need, and that the success of an invention is merely a measure of its demand. Like my [current] signature says, intelligence is not having the answer but asking the question. Not the correct meaning of intelligence, maybe I should attribute it to wisdom or find another word that better suits it.

Actually a way to explain what you was saying would be to give an example of solving a dynamic programming problem. These types of problems are impossible for the beginner programmer, but once you know what dynamic programming is you find that these problems are much easier to solve when you first approach them. So just knowing about dynamic programming opens you up to a whole array of problem solving; just like finding special cases for NP-hard problems.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Inventing is a process.  It is not magic.  Anyone who thinks you can just invent something amazing off the top of your head is diluded.  Most inventions start small, unamazing and useless and.  At first, they fail and people who don't understand inventing laugh at both the invention and the inventor.  You are generally looking at Mad Invention #123 working and being useful.  The first 122 versions won't be worth much.
<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of things left to be invented, but inventing is <span style="font-weight: bold">not easy</span>.  If you think you are cut out to be an inventor, keep trying.  Study all sorts of fields.  Solutions often but not always come from something that is apparently unrelated.  You can also try testing a permutation of components even if you think you know the result.  They may well fail, but you might learn something you didn't know before you started.

Not quite, but we [at uni] noticed that many people made their major discoveries and breakthroughs in their twenties. Like one researcher [at my uni] who created an algorithm that can turn a proof for a solution into an efficient solution! Or one of our lecturers who isn't even 30 yet and has some amazing papers on searching.

If it were possible that you would do it 1000 years ago, why not put those brain cells to work and do it now?

We are all able to find solutions, but situations where there are no formal approaches often belong to a set of problems that have not been raised as problems.

When I say something new, I don't mean something like the theory of relativity. Line drawing, shortest path and texture mapping routines are what I am thinking of. For example when I failed to find algorithms or usable approaches to rendering semi-transparent polygons in software (without resorting to sorting a list of pixels with time) I decided to find my own way. If I came to a method that would be used in the future in the same way as Bresenham's line drawing method, or Tom  Duff's formulae for alpha blending I would be pleased with my days work.

I agree with your overall message- workers are more valuable than thinkers and whiners and are rewarded as such.
<br/>
<br/>
I do, however, caution people against believing too strongly in <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy" target="_blank">meritocracy</a>.  People born with money and power are predisposed to getting (retaining) money and power.  This is more or less how the entire world works.  For what it's worth, in the US, there is little stigma related to vertical social movement even if it rarely happens in practice.  (Things like caste systems more or less prevent vertical social movement; people stay within the caste.)

If you do nothing but think, you may as well be doing nothing.  You need to do something with your ideas for them to be worth anything, even if it is just talking about them.  Just don't expect to get rich by talking.  =)

The real pioneers are rarely the ones to make it big.  If they even get off the ground with their idea, someone with more money usually takes them with gamblers' ruin.

Right.  Look at MS Windows.  It is slowly improving on concepts developed in the 60s, if I recall correctly.  I didn't know that until just recently.

I don't know what drives me, but once I think something I have to know! Take [again] my semi-transparent texture mapping routine; I don't think anyone else adopts that method yet (although the application of graphics would have no need for complex semi-transparency).

<br/>
Personally Inspriation is everywhere. If you see something, dream something, say something, do something, or live something it is called inspiration.
<br/>
<br/>
On the topic of getting your foot in the door of Microsoft to sabatoage there BSOD funiture and using college for this it will work two ways.
<br/>
<br/>
1. You go for your degree, diploma, sheeps skin, or certificate and you show off your talents. This is what I am doing now where I am ready to work right now under a big project ( yet I don't have anything in my pockets to get anything of the ground ) but nobody is willing to hire me without a certificate.
<br/>
<br/>
2. You know people and they say they  can get you a job at some place doing what you know how to do ( somebody here was doing this ) but the problem with this you need trust and respect which is very hard to find. Like I had a teacher who was a actress and was in big NYC plays so her freinds would inform each other of Jobs and productions.
<br/>
<br/>
3. You do 2. but you need 1. first dew to eqaul opertunity. In the US they have to hire the person who has the Diploma over the Certificate 99.9% of the time even if they both get paid the same amount for that work.
<br/>
<br/>
I know there might be more ways but I am out of suggestions at the moment.
<br/>
<br/>
For me I am a Self Proclaimed artist and I have to promote my work via Internet or threw examples like comics and drawings or project animations
<br/>
that I successfully do alone most of my time. 
<br/>
<br/>
Even if I do get a chance to work at a VG studio I have to deal with people 
<br/>
that want me to draw something I might now and how people want me to draw.
<br/>
<br/>
This is why I am getting all my ideas, dreams, etc out on paper and into picture or comic format.
<br/>
<br/>
Also being in the US Comic books is the most respected form of art along with 3d animation ( since most in the west can't draw for there lives ) is becoming extremely popular.
<br/>
<br/>
If I ever made it then it would be me in my workshop drawing whatever I want like Amaro, DB, Ranma,  for whatever project is given. Now thanks to 3d it will be harder for my work to be respected or even noticed.
<br/>
<br/>
In America it is crazy hard to get noticed. All I ever see and hear about is Stan Lee this and Stan Lee that. 
<br/>
<br/>
The last time I seen somebody did something in the artworld and was big was Samurai Jack and PowerPuff girls.

This is still the case for manufactured products or for mass market/direct-to-consumer software. But combine the internet with the fact that a small team of programmers can create commercial-quality software, and you have a world where a talented team with a good idea can create very successful businesses.
<br/>
<br/>
The world has changed. You no longer need massive capital to try out an unproven business idea.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But what will the world look like when FOSS leads the market? Unless we can develop the development process and transfer of information and knowledge it will be terribly stumped.
<br/>
<br/>
FOSS (even at this early stage) has created an anti-segment, the opposite of productive marketing (which I almost made a rant about). Proprietary software may use proprietary traps to force you to spend $300 in order to be able to open documents that other colleagues write (when they so easily could have used OpenOffice) but the fewer options and reduced complexity of a UI without advanced options that are easily separable from lesser advanced options wins hands down. Unfortunately very few FOSS products approach it in this way, and the only one that comes to mind is Azureus.
<br/>
<br/>
FOSS can have a good future but to be honest much more research is needed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">FOSS is a threat to the big guys, not the little guys. 
<br/>
<br/>
A 2-man team is never going to program a serious competitor to, say, Photoshop. That's FOSS's territory.
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, a massive FOSS team is never going to bother creating a web-based image filter that turns satellite photos into vector land-usage maps. (That's just a random example for a problem-solving bit of code that might have real world utility for a small but well-capitalized market.)
<br/>
<br/>
The challenge is finding a niche that's under-served and has a real need for some clever software. Yes, a market of 10 million people who'll each pay $100 for a piece of software is attractive, but that's a hard nut to crack. Better to look for a market of a few thousand customers who'll pay $5000 a seat, or better yet $100/month/seat, than to try and take on Microsoft.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well that's about as close to the truth as you can get. Linux has a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Windows_and_Linux#_note-0" target="_blank">50-80%  market share of the web server, render farm, and supercomputer markets</a> but only 0.7% of the desktop market share. You will also find Linux being used with high powered embedded hardware, such as keyboards.
<br/>
<br/>
I once remember a ?10,000 keyboard running on Windows; but now Linux is becoming more and more popular - being used in the <a class="postlink" href="http://namm.harmony-central.com/Newp/2004/Mediastation-X-76.html" target="_blank">Mediastation</a> and the powerful <a class="postlink" href="http://charlie.keyfax.com/motif_xs_whats_new_and_whats_the_same" target="_blank">Yamaha Motif XS</a> (running MontaVista Linux).
<br/>
<br/>
FOSS is doing a great job of competing with the 'big dogs' technically, but in my opinion it is lacking <span style="font-weight: bold">big time</span> as a product. Most FOSS projects are FOSS and not products, and the people involved in the movement need to be aware of this. There are few 'products', and those few products are successful in their area - such as Apache and (possibly) OpenOffice.org. I do not consider Gimp to be a "product", for the same way that Usenti is not a product. Great tools they are, in fact better tools than any available proprietary product - but they are tools with some dangerously powerful yet unchannelled product potential.
<br/>
<br/>
Well that's my view of most of FOSS's power. I have ideas as to how it can go mainstream; but if it did, if OpenOffice.org squashed MSOffice, Gimp squashed Photoshop and the majority of users were using OpenSource packages (paid or free) then what? Will open source produce code that can be unrivalled to the point that commercial competition is no longer viable without joining the GPL and producing only open source software? If (or when) open source succeeds and that becomes the reality, then I hope we end up with fewer "products" that do the job as opposed to the current norm of 1,000 products that do near enough the same thing - creating consumer confusion!
