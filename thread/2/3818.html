I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say there's no way in hell a level editor for a SNES game would work on the GBA sequel/update/whatever.  It's not like the game is a port, and even if it was, it would have to be re-coded for the GBA.  Such a level editor has to hack into the ROM and change data.  I'm sure that the maps are formatted differently and stored in a different area of the likely different sized ROM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't help this Pirro guy.  All he wants to do is get someone else to make a Harvest Moon game for him, the way he wants it done.  This is likely to be an attempt to get graphics so he can ask someone else to code the game since he "made the graphics" already.

Pirro, don't expect any help from me until you can prove you know the difference between making a game and pissing people off.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When the DS comes out, expect a lot of people asking people to remake games like <span style="font-style: italic">Super Smash Brothers: Online</span>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The closest thing to <span style="font-style: italic">Smash Bros.</span> for the GBA is probably <span style="font-style: italic">Kart Fighter</span> run in PocketNES. Pathetic.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I wrongly assumed that the level editor could export/save the levels in its own format; not just edit the file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
