<br/>
<br/>
I am not a game devloper but I am using GBA for ARM programming practice and intend to use GBA console as control engine for toy.
<br/>
<br/>
I am very doubt, where is EWRAM phisically locate (in the GBA unit or in the game cartridge)?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">EWRAM is located in the GBA.  It is called "external" because it is external to the ARM core.
<br/>
<br/>
When I opened my GBA to install an Afterburner kit (which I removed after it made TOD and everything else look extremely washed out), I saw two packages that dominated the mainboard.  One is marked AGB CPU; I assume it contains the ARM7TDMI and GBZ80 cores.  I didn't look too closely at the other chip, but I assume that that's the EWRAM.
<br/>
<br/>
But some Game Paks do contain a small amount (up to 64 KB) of static RAM to maintain the game's settings, high scores, player progress, etc.  This is mapped at 0x0E000000-0x0E00FFFF.  It's quite slow to read or write (8 wait states IIRC), and because this RAM uses the old GB bus protocol, all access is 8-bit.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
