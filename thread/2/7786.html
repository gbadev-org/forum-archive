    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok their both out, dont care about price nor battery life, I just want to know which homebrew scene is going to accelerate faster?
<br/>
<br/>
psp has a bigger homebrew stuff, but sony isint too friendly with their continous efforts to stop developers from making homebrew stuff on their psp..
<br/>
<br/>
the gpx2 runs on a linux os and gamepark welcomes developers with open arms to do whatever they want on their handheld, and their firmware update will not intruge stopping homebrew developers from doing whatever they want..
<br/>
<br/>
But im still skeptical cause, the gpx2 dosent have a large audience as the psp, so i dunno if homebrew developers use that as a high like they love to get noticed for their work, so they use mainstream hardware to strut their stuff, rather then something that people say "whats that? when did it came out?"</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by GBAJAY on Thu Dec 15, 2005 5:38 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

But by then, the firmware shipped on new units will be so "secure" that you'll probably need to solder in a modchip in order to get homebrew to boot.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It depends entirely what your goals and intended audience are.
<br/>
<br/>
Hacking around and developing your basic programming and game-creation skills (no specific timeline); writing programs that are going to be easily accessed by other homebrewers: GPX2.
<br/>
<br/>
Making demos/games with the intent of finding a job doing specifically that in the industry (faster/more intensive timeline); writing programs that aren't going to be as accessable but might be seen by a wider spectrum of people: PSP.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that either is serviceable towards whatever goals the other offers as well, but if you're trying to weigh the merits of one over the other that's probably where I'd begin.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">gpx2 looks better for homebrew and soon Sony will do what Nintendo did, but a lot better because you can't really mod a UMD into a passme like device or even burn one into a passme and they have had a rep of making stuff a pain in the butt to mod, fix, or play CDs on a computer
<br/>
<br/>
so go with gpx2 and it has a built in SD slot or was it CF</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't mean to either sound stupid, or be offensive, but, what the hell are you babbling about? are you saying sony's protection will get stronger or weaker? what do you mean by 'what Nintendo did' what did they did, I mean do? are you saying sony will start using carts? That statment confused me a little.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

If by "carts" you mean selling games on Memory Stick PRO Duo, then Sony is planning to do just that by using the Memory Stick as the storage medium for a service similar to Xbox Live Arcade.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Of course, newer and better passmes exist now that defeat this mechanism.  link1426 says that something like this will be harder to do on a UMD disc than a cartridge.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
