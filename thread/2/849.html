    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well there are tragicly few space shooters released these days, but games such as Ikaruga and Panzer Dragoon Orta (though of course this isn't a space shooter as such as it is not in space, but anyhow) proves that the genre is far form dead.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Puzzle games dying? Doubt it! Especially the GBA is very suitable for puzzlers and I think Kuru Kuru Kururin proved this (to name one)! However, puzzle games aren't as popular and don't sell a lot of copies on average...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
But Gabriel Knight creator Jane Jensen asked for feedback on what gamers would like for a fourth game in the series!!!

<br/>
The person who wrote that article hasn't got a clue.
<br/>
The whole issue of "Dying genres" is a load of crap!
<br/>
<br/>
O.K, I accept that today's youth is not the same as in 19xx (because of different upbringing, media influence, etc) but humans will always need escape from reality/boredom, and for this we turn to interactive entertainment - Video games!
<br/>
<br/>
When Pong was created in 197x, it was supposed to be tennis (or table tennis) on a computer. In the 1980's - 1990's , no-one made pong exactly as it was, but they certainly made Tennis/Other ball game sims!
<br/>
<br/>
In the movie and fashion industry it's the same, There are certain fads that come in, only to be 're-done' several years later. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now, we see it now with mobile gaming (phone's, hand-helds, etc).
<br/>
The kids of today never went to the arcades to play Flying Shoot-em-ups, but I still see them on the bus playing a clone (of those games) on their nokia mobiles.
<br/>
<br/>
We will continue to see classic genres brought back-to-life forever!(using whatever technology that's available at the time).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BOTTOM LINE : History will always repeat itself.<br/>_________________<br/>---------------------------------------------------

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The classic beat 'em up has really been beaten up. Only since Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has been released can i say there is a decent beat 'em up. It's just fun...
<br/>
<br/>
Let's see where the bad ones are ... hmm... almost all the recent batman games with the exception of vengence... that's all!!
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps taking a game from 2D to 3D isn't a good idea. But once done, companies should take a look at what that game did right.. and clone clone clone.
<br/>
<br/>
Cloning something isn't bad, just goes to show how good a game idea is... heck maybe somebody will clone yours.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
