    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Seeing that I just lost my save data in Pokemon gold (probably from a dead internal battery), is there anyway to dump the (working) saves of a GB/C game and possibly use it in an emulator or something?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Oh, being able to write the save back to the cartridge would be useful also.
<br/>
<br/>
Kinda offtopic, do GBA games use flash memory for their saves?  Since late N64 games did, I figured GBA games did too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You couldn't use a software tool on the DS since you can't fit GB/C carts in there in the first place (and even if you mangle the carts to fit in, the DS has no z80 processor so it wouldn't know what to do with the cart), and a GBA-side tool would not work because you cannot access the GBC cart in GBA mode without the specialized hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, I already knew about the GB/C and the DS incompatibility, but that sucks that there probably isn't a way to back-up saves.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
