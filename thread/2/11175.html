I made some games for NDS can you publish them for me when it is finish? (You can keep all the money from selling it). You can see parts of it at <a class="postlink" href="http://zzo38computer.cjb.net/nitro/" target="_blank">http://zzo38computer.cjb.net/nitro/</a>

DSBASIC though is probably done (or close enough to publish, maybe). The source code is available, and has to be modified to work in SLOT-1 cards.

This sentence alone doesn't make sense.. unlicensed hardware?  I guess that would be true if you had a Nitro Devkit that you obtained in an unlicensed manner?  As all the Nintendo DS's on the market would be liscensed hardware, no?  Though even that.. the homebrew wouldn't be illegal, just the method of obtaining the unlicensed hardware..    Now..  Assuming he meant "making unlicensed games for hardware is illegal." also wouldn't be true in this generalization.  Even when you think about GBA roms requiring the encoded Nintendo logo to run.. let's say that IS illegal, and would not be allowed..  If you are using a passthrough method to boot.. your homebrew wouldn't contain any illegal content and therefore would still be legal.  Even if the passthrough was illegal, that wouldn't make your homebrew illegal.
<br/>
<br/>
It's like saying, "making a car is illegal".. Well, you can make a car.. and it not be illegal.  But, if you made a Ford Escort (for example) it would be.. as Ford owns the TM/patents/etc.. on parts of the car.
<br/>

On the same note, you can't generalize and say all homebrew is legal.. As we all know.. some of it isn't..

NoPass cards and CF adapters do not carry an Official Nintendo Seal. Likewise, NES compatible games produced by Tengen, Codemasters, and Color Dreams, and Sega Genesis compatible games produced by Accolade (along with the earliest EA releases for that platform) were "unlicensed".

Nintendo's argument might be that making hardware and software that interoperates with Nintendo's console violates Nintendo's patents on the console, as <span style="font-style: italic">Sega v. Accolade</span> didn't touch on patents.

Oh.. I got what you are saying, but you are not making software for a NoPas or CF adapter, you are making it for a NDS..  So, it should be more like "I regret to inform you that making games <span style="font-weight: bold">that use</span> unlicensed hardware is illegal."

I don't think either of us would expect to see that hold up in court, and we didn't make the hardware (well, most homebrew devers).  Rest assured, I researched a lot before selling PassMes.  Everything is open to interpretation.

Exactly.. and if you wanted to take it a step further, you could call it "pencil" or "doll hair" as game names have no reason to sound or even have anything to do with what they "may" be a clone of.  Personally, I can't figure out why anyone would want to "copy" a commercial game?  What's the point?  Now, if you like a commercial game, and want to make a game like it, prove your skills and make a game in that genre (sp?).  No need to copy characters/storyline/etc.. that just removes from showing off your skills as people think, "wow.. nice copy of XXX" as apposed to "Wow, check out this awesome homebrew game!"<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Legal departments also make claims that don't intend to act on, 'just in case'.  'Just in case' is very important in a country like the USA.
<br/>
<br/>
Hence, I'd expect the conversation to go something like this:
<br/>
<br/>
Homebrewer:  Can I make homebrew programs?
<br/>
Legal:  Do you have a licensed devkit?
<br/>
Homebrewer:  No.
<br/>
Legal:  Sorry, you are not allowed to make homebrew programs.

Heh, you mean at least two..  The last one "we" did it was him and an associate against seven on the other side.  5 of them were with a local big time firm, and the other 2 were from Washington DC..  The money they spent on lawyers, they could have just followed the law.. but I guess it's more fun this way..  The whole system is screwed..  But I don't mind.. it's free money for us.  We just push it as far as we can, and then settle.. though I think the next one might actually end up in court, cause he want's his name in the paper when we win.. :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Doubt it.. You don't even need to talk to them.. it only "really" matters when you file the suit.  That's when it becomes "real".  But, of course if it ends up in court, the judge prefers to see that you communicated with them prior to filing your suit.  Normally, you would say "I'm going to sue you because of this" and they say "go ahead, but you will lose because of this." and then you say.. "yeah.. your right, see ya." or.. "I don't think so, I'm filing on Friday." and then they say either "Ok.. can't wait to see it." Or, "What if we give you some money to go away?".  :)  
<br/>
<br/>
It's funny.  Companies know they are breaking the law, but don't care.  As it is cheaper to pay people to go away then to follow the law.  Or, they make a lot more money by not following the law, even if/when they have to play people to go away because they are breaking the law.  Problem is, the ONLY people that get paid are the lawyers.  Your lawyer want's 50%+ of a settlement, and their lawyers get paid $200+ per hour for every thing they can bill for.  They will schedule meetings to talk about future meetings just to bill their client.. the whole thing is one big racket..

So, you end up with a sleazy lawyer because he'll work for less money but take all your settlement.  Or, if he is defending you, only charge you half what a "real" laywer would charge.  Either way, you normally end up with the same sentence..  As I don't think either really care about their client.
<br/>
<br/>
But, as with cops and other "thankless" jobs, everyone hates them till they need them.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can see nintento having issues with a flash-cart or a third party cartridge. I mean, that would prevent them from getting money from the hardware they put time and effort into developing, wouldn't it? That would let third party companies not have to have their hardware licenced by nintendo (which I'm sure costs something) and make pure profit from a game. Not good.
<br/>
<br/>
However, although that claim covers developing <span style="font-style: italic">for</span> the unlisenced hardware, it does not cover developing <span style="font-style: italic">on</span> it. Thus, as long as you have a real nintendo cart in mind for the final product, you should be fine. Assuming this guy knows what he's talking about, of course.
<br/>
<br/>
So, here's your solution. Ask your "nintendo" buddy how you can aquire some licenced hardware for you media to go on. I know perfectly good and well that nintendo sells the hardware to developers, I've been to the site. You have to work for nintendo though, and that poses a problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I would highly recommend ignoring this guy, as he sounds a little fishy to me. If you really want to, look for a publisher. However, I'm told that the odds of actually publishing a homebrew game are slim to none, so good luck in that department.

That's kinda what I was talking about.. except, you are developing for the Nintendo DS!  Therefor, you are developing _FOR_ liscensed hardware.  Even if you didn't to use a real Nintendo card, you don't develope your homebrew for the media, it is just a storage device.  Sure, you might develope your homebrew to use the GBA MP, and without the GBA MP it wouldn't work, but none of it would work without a DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, what about if you are developing "for" an emulator, and don't plan to use any hardware at all?  Just because end users put your homebrew onto whatever media they obtain, would this still be covered under the "BS" sentence we are discussing?

Doesn't <a class="postlink" href="http://www.intsys.co.jp/tools/index.html" target="_blank">Intelligent Systems</a> produce most if not all of the offical dev hardware?  Not that this necessarily undermines your point.  (IS is second party.)
<br/>
<br/>
Dev hardware can be used for piracy, so the parties involved want tight control over who can get ahold of it.  This means that they don't want unofficial dev hardware in circulation- at all.  It can't be controlled.  How many times have you used your flash cart for something that could be considered piracy?  Never, right?  How easily could you use if for something that could be considered piracy?  Very.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as actual development goes, most console manufacturers make money by selling licenses.  I don't think that Nintendo is an exception.  This means that if you don't buy a license, you've cheated them out of a sale- and a fairly big one at that!

The problem with working out a home office is one of security.  If you invite friends home, what prevents them from wandering into your office?  What about the day you forget to or don't bother to lock the door?  In an external office, these kinds of problems presumably just do not happen.
<br/>
<br/>
If you solve your home office technicality and meet all of their other requirements, they will sell you a license.  Note that "all of their other requirements" may be too steep depending on who you are.  Once you have a license, you can buy equipment.

Nintendo is huge and has their money invested in all sorts of things.
<br/>
<br/>
Aside-
<br/>
If you visit Nintendo HQ in Kyoto you can get a book that lists Nintendo history, shares, etc.  You can not enter the building.  Talk to security, and they'll give you your book.  IIRC, it lists the kinds of things Nintendo has money tied up in.  I have a copy but don't know where it is- I recently moved.
<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, even if they have money invested in real estate companies, I highly doubt that leasing from those companies is a required of developers.  =)

<br/>
Why does it have to be a North American handheld platform?  This is like saying:
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going camping and I want a new vehicle.  Which Ford jeep do I want to buy?  You might want a Ford, and you might want a jeep, but then again, you might not.  You might want a minivan.
<br/>
<br/>
Given that you are based in USA, targeting a US platform makes sense, but restricting yourself to one is silly.  Australia, New Zealand and UK don't have any significant language barriers that I am aware of.
<br/>
<br/>
Restricting yourself to a handheld system is also silly.  You might want to develope for a handheld and you might not.  Why this restriction?
<br/>
<br/>
I recommend developing for the PC.  You don't need a license.  If you lack funds, your initial bottleneck will probably be printing CDs.  If you can find a retailer or even a distributor to carry your product, that problem may disappear.
<br/>
<br/>

Players have much lower expectations for graphics, etc. on paid software for a mobile system than on paid software for a sessile system. If a Windows game has GBA style or DS 2D style graphics, they will expect it to be freeware. On a phone, they're more willing to accept 2D. However, due in part to the greed of network operators who want to lock customers into their own online stores, the North American phone game market is nearly as tough to crack as the console game market.

This is why I recommend the PC market.  You've developed PC games before.  Are they marketable?  I don't know, but nobody is stopping you from finding out- granted you have enough in the bank to cover production costs.  Google "cd replication" to solve production questions.  Sales is, of course, a whole different story. =)
<br/>
<br/>
If the North American market is hard to crack, what about another market?  Per above, the Japanese market has a huge number of companies making cell phone games.  I doubt it is hard to get into, but due to competition I'll bet it is hard to do well in the Japanese cell phone game market.  I don't know much about other country's cell phone game markets.

What is your target audience?  If you want Half-Life 2 level/style graphics, you need either time or money.  Time and money are the same thing if you can do the job yourself.  Look at the credits to get an idea of how many people-hours went into art.  (Many. =)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The problem with programming on the PC (for me anyway) is that I don\'t have easy access to a touch screen, and can hardly expect my audience to have that access. It would make the game a bit procy to ship one with it, doncha think?
<br/>
<br/>
The whole point of programming on the DS is mainly to play with integrating the touch screen into the gameplay. If you\'ll notice, the actual games vary from very simple 2D (mario minigames) to rather advanced 3D for the platform. (Metroid.) I still find that each and every one of these games is enjoyable, regardless of quality, because the touch screen makes them fun to play.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don\'t think nintendo will actually bother stopping homebrew at any point. In fact, I don\'t think they realize how much money they could make by selling homebrew hardware themselves. (something like a re-writeable cart with a fixed header, so it couldn\'t be used for piracy. And yes, I know this could be bypassed easilly, but you get the idea.)

That's why you develop for Pocket PC, Tablet PC, or a desktop PC with a graphics tablet, and just deal with the fact there exists no PDA or phone with a decent Control Pad.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

"The CompactFlash is severally crippled"? I can't make head nor tail of this. And aren't most Pocket PC devices nowadays phones, not pure PDAs, and subject to the network operator's lockout chip in my country?

When i said CF I meant the .NET Compact Framework. As for Pocket PC being phones, that is a separate category called Smartphones. Smart phones running Windows Mobile, can still sync to a computer with MS ActiveSync and this allows you to install programs and games on them. I have done some development for Windows Mobile, in both EVC++, and .NET 2005 (using the CF) and in my experience a program written for Windows Mobile 2002 (also called Pocket PC 2002) will work for most later versions of Windows Mobile including Smartphones. Keep in mind that most of these devices can't upgrade the OS, so a Pocket PC 2002 device won't be able to run Windows Mobile 5.

The older devices, as far as I know, don't have this ability. Alot of the "security" features and technology Microsoft brags about (like VPN, Wi-Fi, and Mobile 2 Market) don't apply to the older devices.

I can't really say much about that. I live in Oklahoma, most people hear have never heard of Pocket PCs or Smartphones. 
<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest problem with this market is cost. A new PocketPC can run anywhere from $299 to $699, but a used HP Jornada 568 on ebay runs from $10 - $100, depending on what's included with it. (This is what I have).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do players pay money for any of those games, or do they skip over anything that isn't freeware? And is a Java applet acceptable in lieu of SWF?</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
That is exactly what I was thinking.. You have a major simplistic 2D market with your corporate environment that "doesn't see" all the employees playing these simplistic games, and can start/stop playing at any time.. Ya'know.. like lunch breaks (yeah.. right)  But, as tepples said.. does anyone ever pay to play these games?
<br/>
<br/>
But, even the cell phone market, is there really any money for the developer?  The games are $6 to download.. I'm sure the Cell Phone company gets some of that... then the publisher.. etc.. what's left for the developer?  $1?  And how much of these $6 games really sell?  I've never bought one.. my brother bought a couple, but not because he wanted to, but because he let his son play with his phone..
<br/>
<br/>
Even PDA games.. I have a bunch on my Palm, but all were free.  Maybe the rest of the USA isn't as "cheap" as me.. But I can't see wasting $6 - $30 for a novelty game.  The PC games I have purchased were due to an adiction factor.. I played the free demo, got sucked into online gaming and couldn't help but plunk down the money to purchase the whole game..
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I may be off base here, but I think the real money would be in monthly charges.. I never got into the MMORGs but I had a friend that had 3 accounts and his friends all had 3+ accounts.. that's a lot of money/month to play a game.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
