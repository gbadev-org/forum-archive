You guys are all brave doing iOS development. I quit when Apple changed their rules one too many time while I was working on my project. Wasn't worth the risk of them deciding not to allow my app.

I haven't really been doing any game-related stuff, although I'd like to. I just haven't had any luck finding an artist. I've got a couple projects (a blaster master spinoff, and a kids game) in the back of my brain, but they both need art.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't remember the exact language, but they had a clause for awhile disallowing 3rd party cross-platform compatibility libraries/toolkits. (It was a couple years ago when they were battling with Adobe about flash).  I read through that section of the agreement about 10 times, and was still unsure whether the library I was using qualified. (it seemed that I would most likely be allowed, but it wasn't clear cut -- the maker of the library had made a statement of "Apple's new agreement might sound like they won't allow our library, but we're pretty sure they will". Not enough to really give me confidence)
<br/>
<br/>
That's when I realized that, whether or not it was allowed, I didn't want to contribute to a system that tightly controlled what I was allowed to write.
<br/>

Anyway, I'm working on and off on my game creator app (an expansion/addition to my earlier <a class="postlink" href="http://gbatemp.net/topic/312959-tiled-map-level-editor-on-ds/" target="_blank">level editor</a>). So far I've got the level editor, obviously, and a sprite editor. Now all I need to do is make a game editor. Should be easy enough.
<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime I've been making some minor changes to DSLiero (and made a new release back in February that seems to have gone unnoticed ninja-style). Still want to add multiplayer. Damn the lack of reliable (local) networking libs!
<br/>
<br/>
I made a DS version of the <a class="postlink" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/321/the-mole-in-the-hole" target="_blank">'Mole in the Hole' boardgame</a> that I never released. Having already released a Labyrinth knockoff, I didn't want to step on anyone's toes releasing another one of their boardgames for free :p

It is important to remember that the iOS developer program is a private club.  Ultimately, Apple gets to decide if something is allowed or not.  Apple can kick you out of the club if you follow the rules but somehow manage to be obnoxious.  Apple can also approve apps that discreetly break the rules but are in the spirit of the program.  The rules can and do change, so any particular draft can be seen as a set of general guidelines.  A lot of legal clauses are "just" CYA that will not be enforced unless there is trouble.  If you have no intentions of causing trouble, you are probably OK.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Still hoping to get a good game running on the DS(i). I have great plans for the future, but I have been running into walls for days now (first time with wifi (dswifi), and buffer/speed problems).
<br/>
<br/>
I joined here in 2003 (I think) having all kinds of questions about GBA hardware, and how to do games the right way. Now I feel I have reached such a level that I could help others. Still there is a few areas, including the DSi mode/DS&lt;-&gt;DS communication where I feel things have not been progressing any further, and that is a scary future scenario for us!
<br/>
<br/>
And I am not 1% interested in 3DS. I am in for DS and GBA because of the SNES type hardware where all my childhood games were born.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">Exceptions are fun</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
