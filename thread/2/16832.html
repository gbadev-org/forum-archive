    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It appears that my compy has finally decided that enough was enough, and now it won't start up. I'm not sure where the problem lies, but I can say it's either one of 2 parts, the power supply or the motherboard (or possibly the CPU). When I turn on the power strip that the compy is connected to, I can see lights turn on from devices connected to the MB, like my multi-card reader. When I push my compy on, it either powers up for a split second, or it begins to power up (with all the sounds related to it like the spinning up of fans), but does nothing after that. At this point, the fans are supposed to slow down, but they don't.
<br/>
<br/>
Just when I got back into longer programming sessions with my project, this happens. What do you all think about this? You think it's the PSU or the MB? I don't have any equipment to test either of them.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
I did some research on faulty PSUs and MBs, and I believe now that the problem is the MB. Scanning the area of the MB, I see a bunch of capacitors. They all looked fine except for one, which was buldging at the top. An example of what I mean can be seen <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pcstats.com/articleimages/200302/capblown_3.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>. I could explain what this means, but I don't feel it necessary. So, my theory is that because of this, it created a larger load on the PSU, and it triggered the PSU's emergency shutoff switch, which is why it would only power up for a split second most of the time. Still, I would like everyone's opinion on this, if you all agree or disagree with the analysis.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by DiscoStew on Mon Aug 24, 2009 7:01 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I posted some extra information in my first post, but anyways...
<br/>
<br/>
No beeps, blank/black screen, no change when trying different power outlets. As of right now, it has stopped with the later symptom of being on with fans spinning and doing nothing, and it now only spins the fans for a split second before they shut off (and the lights on my devices go off too).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it one of the large(r) capacitors next to the CPU? There are usually 6 -12 of these capacitors. One bulging usually does not bring the whole system down. I have had system with 4 or 5 of these leaking and the system would still boot. Granted it would hang/freeze randomly usually after running for a while though.
<br/>
<br/>
you may want to disconnect your hard drive to prevent data loss - your hard drive may still be fine - or at least disconnect it before you do more testing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The one that is buldging is not next to the CPU, but on the other side of the RAM slots, in between that and my IDE connector. It's a size down from the larger capacitors that are on the MB.
<br/>
<br/>
I hoep nothing went wrong last night though. I had my compy going through a defrag session with it auto-shutting down when it completed. I woke up this morning with it having been off, but that doesn't necesarily mean it did it normally.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had a similar problem a while back.  After moving my pc, it would start booting for ~2 seconds and then shut off.  The problem ended up being both, my POS power supply shorted and burned out my mobo and processor =S.
<br/>
<br/>
I would focus on checking the power supply first.  Swap it out with a known good one, see if it works.  Don't try the bad power supply in another system, it could break that one too.
<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, if you don't have another supply, you can check the voltages on 20/24-pin main power connector with a multimeter, make sure all the voltages are normal.
<br/>
<br/>
pinout for a 24-pin atx:

<br/>
Note:  To turn it on w/o the mobo, you have to rig it by shorting the on wire to gnd.  pinout says its the green wire, so short green to black.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
But shorting the on wire to ground is exactly what your mobo does to turn on the power supply when you hit the power switch, its about as harmless as it gets.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was able to grab an extra PSU and MB from work (though both aren't as good as what I had). When plugging in the PSU to the supposed bad MB, and getting everything up, it at first did exactly what my other PSU did, which was it was on for a split second, but later tries lead it to actually stay on. Still no MB activity like beeps and such. I'm gonna try  both borrowed items together this next time, but I'm gonna need to check online for the pin placement for the front panel (like the On button for the computer). Will report with more info later.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Still, I think I'll keep my old MB just in case I get the opportunity to put it through other tests, like with actual equipment.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
