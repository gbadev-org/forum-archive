    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Possibly the most advanced GBA game yet... (and its not made by Nintendo, gasp!)
<br/>
<br/>
I decided to break it apart just to see what made it tick. Its in Mode 4 and by playing it for a bit everything is textured. Heck it even has some kind of LOD on the buildings!! As far as I can tell, it doesn't even use sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
Are game programmers chained to a comptuer all day???
<br/>
<br/>
And the audio is sweet too! This game TOTALLY blows away Super Monkey Ball, Jr. in graphics. The new king has arrived...<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

MrMop is a really friendly guy who will try to answer all your questions!
<br/>
And it's NOT raycasting! :D
<br/>
Let's hope those guys get their FPS deal soon... They are already working on the next game and a new version of their c2 engine which will support nextgen handhelds like PSP or Zodiac.
<br/>
They also have another game completed for about 5 months now... It's NFS Porsche for GBA... But it won't get published before march... Anyone understands publishers?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, 
<br/>
<br/>
I know this is a bit late, but its actually a portal based rendering engine. Its good for GBA as it achieves near 0% overdraw.
<br/>
<br/>

Portals are a way of storing / culling the world and not rendering it. Raycasters normally render slithers of a surface one screen column at a time. The slither information is based upon info obtained from geometry that rays intersect with as they are projected across a map. I suppose that you could store the map using portals and then render it with ray casting. 
<br/>
<br/>
In the case of our C2 engine, we use portals to store and cull the world, but use a polygon renderer to draw the polygons within the portals.<br/>_________________<br/>I am a machine</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
