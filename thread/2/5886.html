<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think you will find that file in the Visual Basic SP6 update. Just extract to a temp folder and it should be there. 
<br/>
<br/>
Just checked, it is in there but in a cab file. You'll need something like winrar to extract it from there. I think there is a command line util with windows that will do it.
<br/>
<br/>
Place the ocx in the same dir as the .exe and it should pick it up.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
