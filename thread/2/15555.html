<br/>
Can you imagine playing all your favorite PS3 games on the GBA at 0.1% speed after buying special upgrade hardware?  That would be sweet.  If I start praying now, perhaps the lawful emulator god will grant a PS3 emulator for the GBA... or an x86 emulator for the c64, or something like that...
<br/>
<br/>
I hope x86 emulator for the c64 uses tape to emulate the expanded memory the x86 has.  The tape drives were just cool.  I bet you could emulate anything on the c64 using tapes!  What were we talking about again?

these are sort of "multi games" sony design rippoffs. it's just your regular tetris and breakout (and more) handheld, with no cartridges (or in some cases just exchangeable screens) etc.

can the ds emulate the atari jaguar (yes) or (no)

can the ds emulate the the 3do (yes) or (no)
<br/>
will there ever be a 32x addon to JEnesis (yes) or (no)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i am not an emulation expert, but as a hobby gba / nds / pc developer, i guess, the answer is clearly and consistently: no.
<br/>
<br/>
although the gba version of DOOM is based on the jaguar port, even the gba isn't powerful enough for running the game natively and "cut" to fit the gba! given the limited power of the nds, a jaguar emulator wouldn't be any fun.
<br/>
<br/>
i haven't played DOOM on the jaguar, in fact, i don't even know if i have *ever* played on the jaguar. (though, i have played on some of the old consoles, but i didn't know enough about the topic back then to remember right now.)
<br/>
so, if what i just wrote is BS, just apply it to the more powerful consoles, like the 3DO, and it's true again. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
as i see it, native (and also fun and usable) emulation of these consoles is highly unlikely.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

FYI the Jag was never true 64-bit neither, it just had two 32bit cpu's on a 64bit bus (I think).  From what I remember it used an M68k and something else.  Lots of custom graphic chips as well I seem to remember.  Highly doubtful that decent emulation will happen any time soon as there aren't even any decent Windows emulators for them yet</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Possible? Yes. Useful? No. The closest thing to precalculated bilinear would involve enlarging textures, and for any nontrivial application, that would need more VRAM than the DS has. Interpolating MIP-maps would need even more duplicate geometry RAM for models close to texture LoD boundaries so that the more detailed model can be blended on top of the less detailed model, and geometry RAM is another thing the DS is short on.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Come to think of it, it might be possible to do dither-bilinear (think: the Unreal 1 sw-renderer) in DSdoom, since it's software rendered. This does ofcourse produce a lower quality result than true bilinear, but it might be good enough. I've run some experiments on this on the GBA (in the SFC-engine), and the results were really good - but for the GBA we decided not to go for it, since our 3d-stuff is already quite heavy ;)
<br/>
<br/>
edit: already had a hack at it, and it's really easy to do in the v-direction on the walls (and should be equally easy to do in both u and v direction on the floor - but I'm suspecting that the floor isn't as important, since it never seems to give very big upscaling anyway). Dithering the u-axis without in a robust way looks a bit more tricky with the current data structures.
<br/>
<br/>
edit2: hah, got u-axis dithering working as well, with some nasty nasty hacks.  very very very experimental nds and source (or, well, diff to the current dsdoom trunk) at <a class="postlink" href="http://kg.slengpung.com/kussie/dsdoom_ditherhack.rar" target="_blank">http://kg.slengpung.com/kussie/dsdoom_ditherhack.rar</a>, don't expect me to finalize this in any way, though :) It only works on mid-textures, and only on those who are 128x128 big or something. The code is also a lot slower than it needs to be. As I said, it's a dirty hack.
<br/>
<br/>
edit3: <a class="postlink" href="http://kg.slengpung.com/kussie/dsdoom_dither2.rar" target="_blank">http://kg.slengpung.com/kussie/dsdoom_dither2.rar</a> - made it apply to all walls, and cleaned up the code slightly. It's still a nasty hack, though. Removed the Boom-fix for tutti frutti, since it made dithering tricky (and in theory it's incorrect, although the issues with it is smaller than the initial issues).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">seriously, why do people talk about stuff they have no idea of? (i don't mean like, they have understood something wrong or misinterpreted something or little knowledge about it etc., i mean literally *NO* idea! totally ignoring the possibility of "educating" oneself by looking things up on, let's say, wikipedia)
<br/>
the only thing that comes out of such posts in the end, is humiliation and "noob" posts.
<br/>
how sorry is that?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

i don't know. ;^P
<br/>
but, there's always the possibility to "ask". ;^D
<br/>
<br/>
ps: (this is serial!) does my previous post really read like that? that was not intended to, i was just curious and i wanted to point out, that there would only be people laughing about, screaming on and making fun of such posts.
<br/>
<br/>
i mean "maybe make a ds application like an nds file that prerenders the graphics to trilinear so when u start a .nds file (quakeds) or (dsdoom) you see the trilinear graphics maybe its impossible"
<br/>
... come on? that isn't dreaming any more! if it was possible, "everyone" (i'm aware of x360 games that use "linear nearest mipmap" filtering, despite that fact, that the hw supports AF) would be doing it!
<br/>
<br/>
then that posts clearly shows  (i'm abstraction here a bit, because i don't intend to make it personal) the postsers knowledge -&gt; *no* idea how this stuff actually works. mostly, other will pick on him for that. so why bother posting about something you honestly, really don't have a clue about?
<br/>
checking the web trying to inform oneself about the basics isn't that hard!
<br/>
<br/>
i guess the only good it did, is it made kusma make that nice demo. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: @ tepples, i know. so do i. i sometimes make little silly jokes (nothing personal, i hope), but i always try to help (which sometimes includes these jokes that exaggerate things a bit.) but some people are so good at ... whatever it is, that sometimes it's really hard to help.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released
