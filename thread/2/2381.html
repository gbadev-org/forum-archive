I've never played an online game of this magnitude (I've played Diablo a while back online). I thought it would be kinda neat, but it expects you to group up if you plan on getting far. I'm the kind of person who doesn't just go join people I've never known.

Then how do you play any console RPG? Even in 1-player games, other characters will join your party for various reasons. Or do you mean not being in control of your party's movements?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess I asked the wrong question. With console RPGs, yes, you do have people join you, but they don't talk to you. They talk to the character you play, and they only say things that help the story go. But this game uses real people, and you communicate like they are actually there. I'm talking more on a social perspective.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not much for being social, like being able to walk up to someone, and just talk. I don't think anybody would want a low-social (or in this case in the game, a mute) player to be with them, nor would I like to be told what to do from some group I group up with. I'm more of a solo person who has control of a few characters (like a console RPG), someone who likes to have fun, but is not forced. But being solo in this game doesn't get you far from what I read.
<br/>
<br/>
So the question would be, "Should someone with low social skills play a game like this?" I'm willing to give it a try, but I don't want to get bumbed out having to pay $50 if I can't handle it.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, actually you will be paying more than $50 because they charge monthly ($13) and $1 for every new character you create) for playing on the server. Let's say you play for 5 months and create 3 characters, thats already $118!!! And plus you have to have broadband (or is that just for PS2 version?) which MOST of us can't afford.
<br/>
<br/>
Since it looks like you aren't just giving away cash, i think you should get Final Fantasy X-2. Still a good game with excellent graphics. Heck, get them both!!!<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you can communicate well enough to post intelligibly in this forum, you don't have to worry about poor social skills for an MMOG.  But if you just don't think you'll have fun working with other people to accomplish common goals, then you probably won't want to spend money on a game where that's the primary activity.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
