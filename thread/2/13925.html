Castle Wolfenstien or Beyond Castle Wolfenstein. I use to play those games are remember how trying to get passed the gaurds and trying to escape was really quite fun, and it looks like a simple game... i'm most likely wrong about that because no game is really "simple" anyways tell me if anyone has or will or wants to release and of the original Wolfenstien's i would ask about Wolfenstien 3D but thats already been done!
<br/>
<br/>
if you need files of the game i have them all so just ask!

While they are somewhat similar, that's like saying that <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.C._Kids" target="_blank">M.C. Kids</a> is as good as a clone of Super Mario Brothers as any could be.

<br/>
<br/>
In the 2d version, you could point your gun at enemies, and hold them at gunpoint (whether or not you had ammo).  You could search them and take their stuff.  You could get an enemy uniform and sneak around.  There were chests with locks you had to pick.  You could get grenades and blow holes in walls that you could walk through.
<br/>

It was a great game, with the 3d version being quite a step backward in terms of gameplay, in my opinion.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I once bought a legal release with commercial roms for classic systems along with emulators for them - well it was in a large book store chain and looked professional enough.

<br/>
<br/>
2. to load directory of the D64 disk image, you type:
<br/>
LOAD"$",8
<br/>
LIST
<br/>
<br/>
to load and run a game you type
<br/>
<br/>
LOAD"GAMENAME",8,1
<br/>
RUN
<br/>
<br/>
to load first file from the disk and run it you type
<br/>
<br/>
LOAD"*",8,1
<br/>
RUN
<br/>
<br/>
Then you use joystick emulation to play the game.

Also you could "port" or "Clone" the game itself. I have posted on a project I wanted to do earler on.
<br/>
<br/>
My concept of porting is that we recreate everything from the original using cut/paste method from images to audio and then recreate each part of the game using a method from a simular game like itself.

But if you have the assembly language source code for something, you can use static recompilation. Treat every x86 instruction as a macro that expands to multiple ARM9 instructions. It might even be easier than writing an emulator, as you can hack the source code to work around deficiencies in the compiler, up to a complete rewrite of the graphics engine. In fact, Intel used just this technique to allow assembly language for its 8080 CPU to be recompiled for the 8088 and 8086 CPUs.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i know i did that and then the game lagged pretty bad and its not because i had it at a to low FPS but because its not suppose to be running on DOS i think. it started to freak out to. like screen going black to normal.

<br/>
there must be a fix or something.<br/>_________________<br/>God  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.freewebs.com/jrohtmltesting/loveshack.htm" target="_blank">Speed</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Those computers are now emulated on the DS with Pom DS, Frodo DS and Pokey DS.

So playing the games is very easy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
