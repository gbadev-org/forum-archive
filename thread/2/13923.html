    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Theres a few pieces of homebrew software that can do this, the one I use is called Rein, but theres also eepinator, etool, and probably some others I'm missing.

You do have a means of storing these saves right? Like a flashcard or similar? If you have a slot-1 card (looks like a DS card) you will probably need to use eepinator, as I don't believe the others are compatible with <a class="postlink" href="http://dldi.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">DLDI</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

<br/>
<br/>
I'll have a read of the info.
<br/>
Thanks for pointing to the right direction.
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully it's easy to use!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The only save tool I know of that works reliably with R4 and other SLOT-1 cards is savsender, which sends the .sav file over Wi-Fi. The others don't work because R4 does not support being swapped into SLOT-1 while the DS power is on.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Well I want to get the save files backed up from my original Final Fantasy 3 and New super mario bros slot 1 carts..

Would save sender be able to do that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
