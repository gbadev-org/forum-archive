Talk about unrewarding! :P

Or there might just be something wrong with me. I guess that's why I have trouble finishing large projects^^'<br/>_________________<br/>___________

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

I tend to agree, except that I just recoded my map-update routine in ARM ASM, optimized the hell out of it, debugged the hell out of it, and it <span style="font-style: italic">still</span> takes too long. Which means I need to reformulate my approach to the problem. (In this case it just comes down to too much stuff needing to be transferred via DMA, which is unfortunately something I can't improve upon by recoding in assembler.)
<br/>
<br/>
Blast... back to the drawing board...

Um, I didn't want to crowd any of the on-topic forums with what was pretty much me shaking my fist at the clouds? :)
<br/>
<br/>
In regards to the other contents of your post which have mysteriously (accidentally, I assume) disappeared, it's only taken a few days of studying the gcc -S -O3 outputs of my C files to really impress me with how straightforward and simple-minded the compiler actually is.
<br/>
<br/>
I kind of get the impression that before I'm done with this project I will probably have recoded 80% or so of it into ASM. So much for just optimizing the 5% that consumes 95% of the processor...
