Can the smaller MAME roms be converted to enable gameplay on GBA ?
<br/>
How? Is there some software for a newby ?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Game Boy Advance CPU isn't nearly fast enough to emulate most MAME games. MAME strives for accuracy and relies for speed on Moore's Law (density of integrated circuits doubles every 18 mo). You'll usually want to port a disassembly of the original game to ARM assembly (this takes work), though you may need the original ROMs to make the graphics.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
