    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In my spare time I am playing around with C++ and SDL to create an RPG demo. I like the old snes-style graphics. My character sprites are going to be 16x24 and the dimensions of the screen are the same a s NDS, so that I can remake the demo with the same graphics for the nds later. (I haven't gotten as far as understanding how many colors I can use in the game and stuff, for easy port to ds). My question is (I've looked around and figure it's possible, but don't want to get too far without knowing) does SDL have the capability to just double every graphic in size (without anti-aliasing)? That way I cane use small gfx and someone playing the computer version can still clearly see them, even though they are pixelated. Double in size would be fine I think. And if this is possible, is it a better method than just doubling the graphics in a raster art program?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
