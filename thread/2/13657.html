So what do you look for in a games consultant? I'm going to phone them tomorrow to see exactly what they are looking for, but I think I have potential to fulfil such a role. Ok, so I haven't played games for a few years, but I used to be a complete addict. I can master any game in a matter of button strokes, and I can identify improvements in timing like Sylar reading your heartbeat.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So you say it's a glorified games testing role! From the text I get the impression that it is strictly about fine tuning the gameplay? My other friend feels it's a testing role too, I just don't.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So logicaly this is saying to me...........
<br/>
<br/>
1. Play hacker
<br/>
2. Find other "Hot Coffie" and play the blame game you for not telling.
<br/>
3. Judge programmers hard work that is there pride and joy.
<br/>
4. Take notes on what they did to get that.
<br/>
5. Finally play games and be a tester.
<br/>
<br/>
So that is like two jobs.
<br/>
<br/>
1.Test player ( which Nintendo employees in Seatle times )
<br/>
2. Debugger ( basically a programmer going threw the game to check faults.
<br/>
<br/>
That sounds nice but I don't like the idea of indivisuals looking at soembody elses work for "bugs"
