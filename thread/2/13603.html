Due to the success (or rather the lack-of) of the GB Micro, I don't think we'll see a DS Micro.
<br/>
Also, due to the success of the DS (it being larger than that of previous GB iterations) I don't think we'll see anything of the "DS2" at least for another year.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

Dood77, do you know for definite that the GBM was unsuccessful or is that just your own opinion?
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I'd imagine it sold less than the GBA or SP if only because of the timing. I have one and it's a rather nice liitle device but I'd say most people probably bought a DS instead.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

I meant unsuccessful by business standards, not technology. As in it sold much less than expected, I don't know the numbers, I've heard them once, probably at a site like IGN. I do know that I've never known of anyone personally who's had one, and there are about 4 or 5 sitting used in the glass case of my local game crazy.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

<br/>
As far as I can tell, the camera that points at the player's face is for one Japan-only game. Game Boy Player already ditched support for tilt-sensor games (<span style="font-style: italic">Kirby Tilt n Tumble</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Koro Koro Puzzle Happy Panech</span>) and Game Boy Camera (which was very popular among Super Game Boy users). Anything designed to act like Game Boy Camera would probably either fit in SLOT-1 and face out, or have a cord between a cart that fits in SLOT-2 and a "webcam" looking thing that clips onto the top screen.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I feel if they would just release the canceled/ on hold "Gameboy 3d" already.

I dislike the idea of adding devices to a universal device already. It saves money for developers but for people who want to go that extra mile for example in the many Super Famicom games that had add-on devices it would be a complete loss.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

Why? The DS is the third pillar, ain't it? They never said they were going to release new platforms for each pillar consecutively.

<br/>
What, you're thinking they're gonna do a fourth pillar?!
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think the GameBoy is away and done with, all this pillar nonsense is rubbish. The next handheld will definitely be a DS of some sort, it may or may not ditch GameBoy support, but I think it's more likely that they will ditch the GameBoy slot and make a virtual console for handheld games, like the Wii. But if they want 100% legacy DS support, we would need a SLOT-2... SD card slot would be nice too.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

<br/>
It isn't always about whats most practical, people will see the size of the device and quality/amount of the content and make judgments on how 'high-tech' it is. A good example is iPods, <span style="font-style: italic">This little thing holds 20,000 songs?!</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, less empty space inside a cart gives less space for stuff inside to jostle around and get damaged, and probably more resistant to being crushed, too. Hardware developers shouldn't feel pressured to use all the space inside.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
