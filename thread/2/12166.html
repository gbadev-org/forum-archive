    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone know if Applesauce Polish is safe to use on the DS touch screen? I already bought the polish for my Zen Vision M, so I'd like to find another use for it. I e-mailed the Applesauce people and they said they didn't know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I still wasn't able to find any information about Applesauce and the DS, but I found a site about a similar product called Displex. It says that it's not meant for the DS touch screen so I'm not going to attempt it with the 'sauce.

I'm not too concerned about the visual appearance. I can only really see the scratches when the screen is dark. However, there's a little bit of friction whenever I brush over the scratched area.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could try a screen protector. The extra layer of plastic might smooth out the bumps, but still allow you to use the touch overlay properly (as long as you get one of the DS or PDA versions).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
