<br/>
There certainly are elements of the attack that can't be explained, or the governments ignore entirely.
<br/>
<br/>
Most people won't question what happened and this is what the ruling power wants.
<br/>
<br/>
Notice how it's always refered to as 9/11? No mention of the year?
<br/>
I think it's so that people don't notice how long the 'war' has been going on.
<br/>
A recent survey found a third of the American public didn't remember the year of the attacks <a class="postlink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060809/od_afp/usattackspolloffbeat_060809145351" target="_blank">[Source]</a>. 
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.scrippsnews.com/911poll" target="_blank">Some sites</a> are claiming a third of Americans suspect a conspiracy theory. I myself believe it was an attack carried out by the US government.
<br/>
<br/>
I feel the attack was a way to justify the war with Iraq and anyone else they choose, 7/7 was a follow-up because the majority of the British public didn't want a war and were losing the want to fight.

Also they claim the steel was weakened by fire from all the kerosene. Interesting considering that the kerosene appeared to burn outside the building. Oh, and that several million tons of steel makes an excellent heatsink. I wonder if the kerosene had enough energy to raise the temperaure by 1000C across all that steel?

Well thank you for saying to us your opinion about what happened on 9-11 and pushing aside the dead from that while you bring up the death toll in Africa caused by "natural" circumstances. Maybe we should just leave them alone, since we can't seem to handle things in our own country. Hunger in Africa? You've already tried making a point about the problems within America, so why put Africa on it as well? America could be considered the leading power in the world, but that doesn't mean they can do everything, like wipe out hunger in Africa. If you want, they can hike up the taxes, and send stuff to Africa. Does that sound like something you'd do?
<br/>
<br/>
You know, all you gotta do to convince people about something is to make sure they don't have any foreknowledge of what's being talked about, or in other terms, convince the "stupid". Humans are so subseptible to anything they don't currently know, and when convinced that it is truth, they'll take that to heart, whether it was actually true or false. A lot of what was said in that video told me things I never thought about...ever. But because I knew nothing about that in the first place, unless there was something objecting to that, would that be considered truth? Most people won't accept truth unless it's given to them on a silver platter. Well, the authors brought out the platter, but can you say for a surety that what's on the platter is the God-honest truth?

Hmmm!!! It all depends on how much it costs to teach educate one person without one compared to with one. If this can take them through a full course of primary education (and possibly secondary) then it might be more cost effective than a teacher - providing it does not get broken and repairs are not high.
<br/>
<br/>
And in third world countries copyrighted textbooks are cheaper (not sure by how much, but a lot less than over here) and they probably would use chalk boards to teach.
<br/>
<br/>
And then there's the problem of electricity, maintainance, training (if necessary), and of course - security. I'm sure each of those would get snapped up in an instant in a third world country.

And the kids don't choose to go hungry, and didn't choose their life.. But, if we are going to change the topic from 9/11 and the people that WERE KILLED (not just died), I'd suggest even before we send money/food to Africa, the U.S. should feed the thousands of homeless/starving people WE have.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

but in africa.. THERE IS NO FOOD or a building o_O (i overdrive a little bit.. but I hope you understand what I mean ^_^ )
<br/>
<br/>
about the 9/11:
<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Al-Jazera (arabic <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMERCIAL</span> tv channel) has presented a movie showing "bin laden" and his team talking about the 9/11 attack.. they say that they had done it...
<br/>
<br/>
I didnt see the movie yet.. but...
<br/>
think about it:
<br/>
<br/>
1) they showed a movie before.... (the one that you see in the movie @ the first post of this topic)
<br/>
It was "Bin Laden" saying that he done it..
<br/>
(Well.. there were prooves that the guy was NOT Osama..)
<br/>
So why are they showing another movie???? that has the same things as the first ones?
<br/>
I mean.. is this the second part of their theater? :D hahaha
<br/>
Do you think he would make 2 videos??? :D
<br/>
<br/>
2) remember: PROPOGANDA!!!!!
<br/>
its almost 9/11 again.. and suddenly: video's popup...
<br/>
u think it's coincedense??
<br/>
think again.. ;) its Propoganda.. to let people make more hate on the Islam and the Muslims......
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know for sure that this video of Bin Laden they showed on Al-Jazera yesterday, is just fake, like the first video they showed a long time ago...
<br/>
(remember.. Al-Jazera <span style="font-weight: bold">isn't </span> a Muslim channel! :) )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The media are doing a terrible job. They are all trying to make the most money they can and live off of making a bad name of Islam. When they report on terrorists being caught, they speak of "muslims being captured"  -placing our attention on muslim instead of terrorists. Yet when the IRA was bombing us they didn't call them christians.
<br/>
<br/>
But like the HtheB said, i think that africa's situation is much different to the homeless living here. Homeless people aren't starving half as bad, if they cleaned up they wouldn't look like people who were underfed.
<br/>
<br/>
And there is big question as to whether these homeless people don't want to be homeless. There is income support (in the UK) which is increased for people with no fixed abode. And there are people with money in the country who occasionally give money to them. There is nothing in africa - and it's also much more cost effective to help them since your ?2 can feed a family for a week (or whatever it was). And we are mining africa for diamonds and gold and whatever, giving them nothing back, so it's one of the first places we ought to give a little something back.

In the US, many homeless are crazy.  The asylums have been closed and many of them just don't have anywhere to go.  There are also people who are spending all of their money on drugs/alcohol and don't have what it takes to find a place to live.  They are happy to get money, but will refuse a muffin you offer them.

I knew a guy in high school who was willing to pretend to be homeless to get money.  He hung out in the mall with a hat.

I don't trust the charities.  A village in Italy collected donations and bought agricultural equipment for Africa (I think it was a tractor).  The charity told them to sell it and just give them the money.  I'm not sure how much money gets absorbed in administration.  At any rate, Africa
<br/>
needs a long term solution; not food today (and maybe debt tomorrow).

Diamonds are basically worthless.  Rather, DeBeers has been controlling the price for many years.  <span style="font-style: italic">You could give every person in the USA a cup full of diamonds.</span>  Most of the diamonds are kept hidden away- they are released slowly to keep the price high.
