Don't fluorescent lightbulbs work using chemical reactions?
<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn't be that unusual for it to glow in the microwave if it works with chemical reactions, because the heat increases the speed of the reaction. And in a normal bulb it heats up the filament, as if electricity was flowing through it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That is kinda wrong, it isnt a chemical reaction at all.
<br/>
AFAIK it is electricity passing through a gas, the gas becomes exited and emits some kind of particles. These particles hit a coating (like the coating on the inside of a CRT) on the inside of the glass and make it glow, microwaves also make the coating glow.

3 easy steps.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Pull apart a Microwave to get the heating unit and power unit.
<br/>
2. Use a serial interface to control a relay which activates the Microwaves power unit (Plugged in, of course), and which in chain activates the heating unit. (Microwave Transmitter).
<br/>
3. Use a WiFi-to-Ethernet bridge (Idea? Everyone is using standard WiFi hardware, what about a bridge?) to grab the signals and an application to control the Microwave Transmitter via the serial port.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I'd prefer the use of a PIC microcontroller to create a WiFi-to-Ethernet-to-Microwave bridge.
<br/>
<br/>
Note: A Microwave transmitter will be required, for both sides. And another Trasmitter for the other side. I take no responsibility for anything in this post. I do not in any way endorse this device. I will take no responsibility for it's actions. If you microwave your brain, don't come complaning to me. And no, I do not understand gibberish.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You sold her a new monitor, just because the cable was cut?!?
<br/>
Talk about ripping someone off...
<br/>
You could just have mounted a new connector to the monitor cable! It is very easy, and very inexpensive.
<br/>
If she cut the cable too short, then you would have to replace the entire cable, but that would still be way less expensive than a new monitor.

Ok, warning to everyone: Don't go to "Mymateo's Computer Store" if you don't want to have to pay for a new PC when you spilled coffee in your keyboard... ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, hey, what's with the personal attacks?
<br/>
<br/>
The monitor, I should mention, was about 5 or 6 years old.  And mounting a new connection ISN'T necessarily easy if you've never done it before, and don't have the parts or the tools necessary (I don't know if you need any specialized tools though).  We send people over to a local repair shop for those kinds of things, and the shop quoted her about 50 bucks (plus tax CDN) to fix it, and she decided to get a new monitor instead.  Even though her old monitor was in perfect working order, that doesn't mean it was going to stay that way for very long.  (And she cut the cable right at the very end, leaving the stub on the computer so yes, she had plenty of cable to play with, but that's not the point here either.)

Seriously, I find that very offensive.  I didn't sell her a new PC because her old monitor was broken by accident.  She bought a new monitor because she INTENTIONALLY damaged the old one.  Apples and oranges, buddy.  Better to say "Don't take your keyboard to Mymateo's Computer Store to get the coffee cleaned out because the minimum labour charge of half an hour ($30 CDN) costs twice as much as a brand new keyboard will" because it is, at least, the whole and honest truth.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'am sorry if I offended you. I just found it very funny that you sold someone a new monitor because the connector on the previous (otherwise in perfect condition) monitor was cut.
<br/>
<br/>
Your original post did not indicate the fact that she was given the choice between a repair and a new monitor, and the post read "(the monitor) was in perfect condition" rather than "six years old but in working order".
<br/>
<br/>
Your analogy of buying a new keyboard when there is coffee in the old one is not really a fair comparison. A monitor is $250, a keyboard is $15. Coffee often kills the contacts and electronics in a keyboard, making it impossible to repair. A cut connector is easily repaired.
<br/>
<br/>
You say something broken by accident and something intentionally broken is like apples and oranges? Not from a salesmans point of view. Unless of course she cut the cable because she was going to buy a new monitor from you anyway, but I doubt that was the case. And if it was, then your original post is not exactly valid, is it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The original post IS still valid.  I didn't include as much detail because it wasn't relevant.  The point I was making originally was that instead of simply asking how to unplug the monitor, she cut the cable, and that was very stupid.  And it's not like I begged and pleaded her to buy a new monitor.  Besides, I'm not a salesman, I'm a tech.  I get paid for FIXING things, not for SELLING things.  So if I can fix things instead of just selling a replacement, then I will.  Otherwise, I'd be out of a job.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since she cut the cord right at the end, it would be very easy for an electician to attach a new plug (or anyone else who takes the time to figure out what color wires go where). If she bought a new one, I think they should have offered to fix the old one for free. At least then she could sell the old one. I have a feeling she didn't know the easier alternative..

(This is not directed at you mymateo), but it scares me how much computer stores take advantage of people's lack of knowedge with electronics. I find when I go to a store often they start crapping on trying to sell me stuff until they realise I know more than they do and they start being honest or I just expose their lack of knowledge on the subject and make them squirm. It really annoys me, and makes me wonder how many suckers get jibbed by sales people. It's funny when someone tries to confuse you with techno babble when it's practically your second language!
