    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I remember visiting Namdoo's website about a year ago, reading about their game Odema that was under development and seeking a publisher.  Does anyone know what happened to that group?  It looked to be a pretty neat game, but now their website (http://www.namdoo.com) is completely gone, and I can't find any news relating to it on the internet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
