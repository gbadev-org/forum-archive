ps
<br/>
Check out the tcgold2ds project I'm working very hard on it and I would appreciate if everyone who read this thread try's the torn city gold ds /tcgold2ds project and all the other wads I've ported or made.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why do you confuse people by calling it Doom3 DS? I admit, that appending a "mod" is much better, but I suggest you call it DS Doom3 mod, for clarity and so that people don't confuse it with the other, unrelated Doom3 DS project.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, if you're out of ideas for Doom modding, why not trying to learn something new and learn programming? ;^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

<br/>
Tell you what.
<br/>
if I learn nds editing, in exchange you must learn wad editing deal?(then you wont be bothered with stupid question's. ;8^D)
<br/>
And who knows maybe you'll enjoy it more then me.
<br/>
I forgot to mention,I googled nds programming &amp; nds coding tutorial's and I found nothing good so a URL might be good.
<br/>
And no one's given me any feedback what so ever on my mods,please tell me what think!  8^O)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://top-car-images.com/1987-bmw-750il/" target="_blank">1987 bmw 750il</a> <a class="postlink" href="http://top-car-images.com/2003-bmw-m3-csl/" target="_blank">2003 bmw m3 csl</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess you don't get much feedback due to the same reason I don't do ".wad" editing: Lack of interest.
<br/>
I did my share of DooM mapping and I find it much more intersting and rewarding to create my own software.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to learn programming, you might want to search for C++ programming tutorials. Get Code::Blocks IDE (a package that contains an IDE, which is an "advanced text editor" spaecialized in source code editing and managing, as well as easily accessing a compiler) and the gcc compiler, which I recommend MinGW for (there is a combined C::B + MinGW install that contains all you need!)
<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, there is no such thing like NDS editing! Even if you edited the HW (= hardware), it would still be called "modifying" (or modding!)
<br/>
<br/>
I don't understand the following part:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>(sniper) 109 wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">(then you wont be bothered with stupid question's. ;8^D)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Don't misunderstand me: You first have to learn the C++ language (or C, I don't care) and that is best (and fastest) done on a PC (or Mac).
<br/>
Only after you have written some programs on your PC, you will have a chance of understanding the NDS and the concepts behind it.
<br/>
Then, you can take a look at the libnds examples' sources and try to learn how to program the NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.cplusplus.com" target="_blank">http://www.cplusplus.com</a> looks like a good place to start.
<br/>
<br/>
There's also a lot of information on this forum! You just have to reach out for it (= search.)
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and have a lot of fun learning! I shure had (and still have) - actually a lot more than making levels for some existing game. ;^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

jk, I just said that cause it would be funny. I might have tried the mods if I could get the game working on my DS to start with. I haven't put forth much effort though, as I am learning how to do collision detection at the moment and have no interest in it right now. I think the lack of on topic posts here answers for itself, but I could be wrong...<br/>_________________<br/>w00</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
