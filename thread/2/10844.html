    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well seeing the GBA cart modification that the led goes on when the power is on, well anyways, what about modifing any game cart for nds to support a led type thing when the ds is powered on when the carts inside of the ds. Now I don't know if there's a vcc on the nds cart, but I do know that there's the GND on it. So just solder to wires to the led, then solder the correct wires to the correct pins on the ds cart.

Also, I'm currently building a usb part for my Metroid Prime hunters cart, the only last problem is that I need to know where a white wire from the usb cord goes to onto the NDS cart. If you know, please tell me as soon as possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good point indeed, When I did my GBA card mode, I was using a semi-transparent GBA flash cart, it gave off a loverly blue glow from the bottom of the GBA-SP or NDS, but had little effect on the origional GBA because you couldn't see it.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't think of any good it would do to put an LED inside a DS cart, desides there probably being no space for one, it wouldn't show through the thigk grey plastic of the card, and if it did, you wouldn't see it for the top screen.
<br/>
<br/>
However, if this gets made, please post some photos of it. :)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In a broad sense, that is the part. The DS slot is designed for reading from a DS Game Card, which contains a ROM, an EEPROM, and a crypto circuit. The GBA slot is intended to power peripherals. USB needs 5.0 V, but the slots provide only 3.3 V, and only the GBA slot is large enough to fit the required transformer.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The only other problem is that I would need to find out where the green and white wires would go to on the Pololu device, so basicly, here's a picture that I drew of what the cart and the pololu device should be along with my battery pack.

<br/>
<br/>
dshacker: Are you wanting to make a USB Device or USB host adapter for the DS?  If you have the polulu module that Natrium42 used (same one I have, was something like $20) it is a device adapter.  You only need to hook up 3 wires.. RX, TX, and GND.. that's it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
