    <h4>#114274 - keldon - Sat Jan 06, 2007 3:59 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had a complete disaster. About a week ago I was organizing my hard-drive, so that meant merging all versions of my backups into one place so that everything was consistent, clearing junk from the desktop and <span style="font-weight: bold">removing redundant folders</span>. After some time I noticed a 'd:\documents and settings', and assumed it was from when the drive was the boot drive so I erased it.
<br/>
<br/>
However I had eclipse on drive d, which I assumed I placed in d:\eclipse so that I could run it without having to download it and set it up again if I had to reinstall windows. However it turns out that my workspace was in 'd:\documents and settings\keldon\.workspace', and I'm puzzled to see eclipse appearing to collapse the package hierarchy!!! I thought nothing of it, I assumed I never had anything other than small test code in that workspace, and it wasn't until I wanted my graphics engine that I noticed that got lost.
<br/>
<br/>
The only version I had was a buggy version that worked fine in the uni JRE but exposes a bug in the AWT plus I added tweaks and refined structures. I was not happy! And worst of all I was plagued by only having a jar file without any source code and no undelete was finding those files, so the jar file was taunting me with it's speed and smoothness.
<br/>
<br/>
But I think my lesson is learned.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
And as for dvd's, being only $1 per 50 discs more but 5 times the capacity it makes dvd's a much more viable backup solution. Besides you can create multisession dvd's, but yes I will certainly be making more regular backups from now on. I used to export after every significant update/bugfix and upload right onto my server; I think I've been getting far too comfortable these days.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Local harddrive mirroring will more or less prevent data loss due to hard drive failure, but it won't really protect you from a fire.  Chances are slim the two fires will happen at the same time in far away places- this is why remote backups are a great idea.

I will make use of the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.btdigitalvault.bt.com/" target="_blank">btDigital vault</a> facility as it does allow for 2GB of storage with the ability to share specific files and folders.

Worth doing, except that sometimes you need to distribute files to testers and other people who should not have access to CVS.  Giving the 070103game.rom works very well.  They'll know what version they are using when they report bugs, you'll know if they have the latest "stable" build, etc.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I always prefer a web-solution when it comes to saving important data. Even if you backup your things on CD/DVD: if a fire destroys your house, there's a big chance that both the computer and the backup are gone.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'm thinking of buying a 2.5" 60GB USB HDD(they're very cheap, starting from 70?) to carry all my documents/source/images(/music) with me. I'd take weekly backups to another drive that I keep at home and I'd use the USB disk on any computer I use. To protect the data, I'd use TrueCrypt for in case it gets lost.
<br/>
Pros:
<br/>
- reading your docs from a separate drive doesn't slow down your main OS HDD
<br/>
- use on any computer
<br/>
- safe(password-protection)
<br/>
- easy to backup<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://www.lifeisdigital.net" target="_blank">project website</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://www.kenvanhoeylandt.net" target="_blank">personal website</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The company I work for doesn't mind that if you encrypt it. If someone would be really anal with security, TrueCrypt can even create hidden partitions in empty disk space. You only see that there's a hidden partition after entering the correct password :)
<br/>
ps: TrueCrypt is open-source, has lots of encryption algorythms to choose from and can be ran from the portable drive without having to install anything, so you can make it auto-run when the disk gets attached to a PC by setting an autorun.ini file;<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://www.lifeisdigital.net" target="_blank">project website</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://www.kenvanhoeylandt.net" target="_blank">personal website</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Vich on Fri Jan 12, 2007 5:56 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

The problem is that there are two kinds of "anal with security".  The smart way (the data is safe), and the stupid way (if anything goes out the door, your job goes with it).  TrueCrypt can not solve the second variety, and there are a lot of unreasonable people in the world.
