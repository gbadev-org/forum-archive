    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't mean to be a bother (and I've searched all over the place), but I think I remember finding on these forums a link to a company that manufactured GBA carts. It might even have been the company that is manufacturing the carts for the upcoming competition.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd really like to get back to that company's website, but for the life of me, I can't remember how I got there in the first place. It's not that I want to get anything of my own manufactured... it's just that I'm curious as hell as to how much it would cost. =)
<br/>
<br/>
Would someone mind slipping me the website address?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
"Demonstration cartridges are available for interested developers, NDA neccassary."
<br/>
<br/>
Does NDA stand for something along the lines of Nintendo Developer Approval? Which would mean most of us cannot use this service :/
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone find's out how much these cost and/or what quantities they sell in, please post here or let me know :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Has there even been any news lately (say..in the last 15 months) from Free-Lancer Games about their cartridges? I noticed now that they have a picture of (what looks like) a finished product on the front page...not sure how long that has been there though.

Even though he asked who was manufacturing the cartridges for the competition in the subject, it appears that what he was really looking for was the URL to Freelancer-Games, which he got.
