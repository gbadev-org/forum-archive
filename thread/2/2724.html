<br/>
Honestly I don't see hobbyist programming in and of itself as causing any problems for Nintendo.  Its the associated piracy with hobbyist dev equipment that causes all this nonsense.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm optimistic though.  Its much cheaper to use a prexisting chip than roll your own.  GameCube Dev arrived through an exploit in PSO of all things.  I'm sure some crack in the armor will be found if they proactively design the DS to be 'hobbyist proof' for lack of a better term.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The first thing that comes into my mind is; "Yeah, right!". I mean, manufacturers always promise a lot more than we'll actually ever get into our hands. Dunno why, maybe to scare the other handheld manufacturers, maybe just to get people's attention.

Funny enough the second thing that came into my mind was: "Oh, that'll be just like two GBAs welded onto each other then!"

Sounds like you have read one rumor too much.
<br/>
<br/>
"Multiple banks" ? That was not in the press release I read, and I doubt N will go back to banked memory. The "Gigabit memory" refers to the maximum cart size. Not work RAM.
<br/>
Dual processors sounds crazy for a handheld. The only reason I can think of for putting two processors in the thing is that perhaps the DS can function as two GBAs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Of course, the reason may simply be that they decided it is pratical to have one CPU controlling each display instead of one CPU controlling both.
<br/>
And no, there is no way N will distribute games on flash media :) 1Gig flash memory is really expensive. They'd have to charge USD100 per game, and piracy would skyrocket.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So if it has two screens, where are they going to put the buttons? At least without it being huge. I guess it would work if they have it shaped like the original GBA, with the second screen where it folds down on top of the normal one. It would also be a nice built-in scratch protector^_^
<br/>
I wonder if they're different resolutions though. I guess it would make more sense to have them seprate if one is 240x160 for GBA compatibility and the other is higher for the new games. 
<br/>
And according to that Japanese paper, they're backlit too, so that's definately an improvement. Hope it doesn't soak too much battery power though.
<br/>
Giving you access to both CPUs is nice too, I always wondered what GBA would have been like if you could run the GBC CPU to do some extra work in the background.
<br/>
I hope it's not too hobbyist-proof though, it sounds like fun trying to come up with new ways to use the seprate screens.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

Yes, I know about the Ique, but they will not try that with the DS.

Hate to break it to you, but a USD42 flash memory will put a complete cart pretty close to USD100. And no, Nintendo cannot get significantly lower priced flash memories than you can buy compact flash or USB memories.

A ARM9 at decent clock frequency will be more than enough to create rather spectacular 3D for such a low resolution screen.

The disadvantage is that you need to build your 3D libraries yourself. People love programming the GBA because so many aspects of the graphical display (sprites, backgrounds, etc.) are already supported in hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
Other handhelds that have built-in 3D technology may attract more developers than a bare-bones CPU/video display.

Not necessarily. If a reasonable implementation of 3D graphics comes either in the BIOS or in the libraries distributed as part of the official development kit, then licensees have a situation similar to that of the initial PS1 and Xbox licensees.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I can only see games that do the "mario bros" trick and use two screens as one, so you can walk from one screen to the other.

I was also thinking about this - and had an intresting if unlikely idea:
<br/>
<br/>
why two screens? where do the buttons go?
<br/>
<br/>
...a unit with two touch sensitive screens and no buttons.
<br/>
<br/>
would be no good for most traditional video games, however, might be able to support a whole slew of new ways to entertain people ?
<br/>
<br/>
the unit could be very flexible:
<br/>
having the main display on one screen and a per-app custom control set on the other screen for mp3 player, movie player, pda type applications...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure some great games could be created - games that have an appeal far wider that those requiring dpad and buttons...
<br/>
<br/>
maybe with a socket to take an optional controller for traditional video games...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Two screens can be used for a bunch of things.
<br/>
<br/>
Imagine an Ogre Battle clone with the map on one screen and the battles on the other.  A lot of the Neo Geo Puzzle games were either player VS AI, or player VS player.  Instead of a split screen you could give each player their own screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Imagine metroid with an xray scope that uses the second screen, while the first screen is a normal display.  A link to the past that displays the light world and dark world on separate screens-  you can phase between them.

An old school Dragon Quest style RPG that shows the enemies on one screen, and the party on the other.

I'll admit that it is not a strong argument- I'm more or less exploring possibilities.  With a full screen you can display full score information or have a wider playing field.  Neo Geo Puzzle Bobble and Magical Drop 2 have full screen one player modes, and "half" screen two player modes.
<br/>
<br/>
From a game and interface design perspective, I'm not convinced that hiding the other player's data is not the best way to go.  This is not possible with a TV, but is a feature inherent to a portable.

<br/>
That depends on the the player.  My short answer is- "No, it should not matter whether the output is on one screen or two."  The way things should be and the way things are is not always the same.  By having two separate screens you force everybody (the players and programmers) to treat each screen as a separate portal into the game world.  I don't see it as much more than forcing a mental attitude.
<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of hardware related perks of having two screens.  First- if you don't need a screen and it can be turned off, that may well save battery power.  Second- if each screen has separate display code, and each operates on the game state (presumably in a read only fashion), then you can stick one screen with light display code and save battery power.
<br/>
<br/>
There is another funny (dev only) use for two screens I thought of- put the game on one screen and the debug/terminal messages on the other. =)  One could actually do something similar in a release game- push the text to one screen and isolate the action elements on the other.
<br/>
<br/>
You could also think of each screen as a window in GUI OS.  For example, imagine a cooperative multiplayer game.  One screen could be yours, and the other one could display what your friend sees.  You could scroll through your friends' (or even NPC's) screens using L and R, or set the screen to a status display if you feel like being "antisocial".

Depends on if they're in a symmetric multiprocessing layout with shared memory or in a Super NES style bullpoop layout with the second CPU's only access to the game logic being through a slow asynchronous parallel port to the other CPU.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As much as I'd like to know more along with the rest of the people, I think it be best that we just be patient, and let them spill the beans at E3. Remember, the competition is listening also, and there are quite a few months for either company to make changes (to counter the other's designs). However, I'd like to throw in my two cents...
<br/>
<br/>
(NOTE: This is just me thinking, so don't take it as anything official, or even something likely to happen)
<br/>
<br/>
I think the NDS has the capability of playing GBA games. The ARM7 CPU is just about the same as the GBA's CPU (except for it being modified), and perhaps it can be programmed to run at the same frequency as the GBA (perhaps to be able to get past the cycle-accuracy problem). I doubt there will be a GBA cart slot on it, but there is always an attachment that could be made (as long as it is not bulky).
<br/>
<br/>
I don't mind the fact that it has two screen vertically stacked, but I hope that they can design it to make the screen as close together as possible for it to act like one screen. If the resolution were ratioed much like the GBA (240x160 -- 1.5:1), then the lower portion of the upper screen could be part of the lower screen, while stuff like stats, dialogue, etc. could be on the upper portion of the upper screen (or vise versa). This is mainly because I didn't like how vertically the screen was small.
<br/>
<br/>
I also hope that each CPU isn't dedicated to a specific screen, because if one screen shows simple data like a map, or objective stuff, that won't require alot of CPU, so perhaps a portion of the slower CPU could be used for that, and the rest for the more complex stuff. Heck, even disable one of the screens, and set both CPUs for use on one screen.
<br/>
<br/>
As most people hope for, at least allow for another 2 face buttons. It would just makes things easier.
<br/>
<br/>
If the big N were to use any type of flash card for the NDS, they would need it set up (if possible) so that the portion that the actual ROM is laid in would be non-erasable/rewritable, and the rest would be for games save, customized data from in-game editors, maybe some MP3s.......the possibilities are endless.
<br/>
<br/>
I doubt that since it has two screen it would allow for 2-player games on one system. Sure, the other screen could flip around, and maybe an extra controller could be attachhed, but heck, I wouldn't want to be player 2, especially if the 1st player is unsteady with his/her hands, and I can't get a clear focus on the screen I'm using. Plus, I wouldn't want to be THAT close to another player, unless it was my girlfriend (if I had one).
<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, the NDS will soon enough be competing with the PSP. They are being released around the same time (late 2004), and they are both new to their fields (PSP with portables, and NDS with some other category according to the big N).  It's inevitable. This could be the reason why full, or even extra, information about the NDS is kept secret, because, like I said before, the competition is listening. Any change between E3 and the supposed release date isn't as much possible as from now till their supposed release date.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo has usually been inventive with it's products, making things that other companies copy in later months. and I think this may be one of those that become successful.

Dedicating a CPU to each screen seems like a broken way of doing things to me.  So long as there is some shared memory and a way of having one CPU interrupt the other, I'm will not complain too much if each cpu has exclusive access to one screen's memory display registers.
<br/>
<br/>
Without a CPU interrupt, I think that this thing will be a real pain.  In real life, I am able to say things like-  "I don't have anything for you to do right now, but I'll tell you if anything comes up." or "Go wash the dishes and tell when you are done."  I'd like to have the CPUs work in much the same way.  Alternative methods seem broken to me-  I really want an "I'm done"/"Time to get to work" interrupt.

<br/>
<br/>
That would be really nice, but I do not think that adding the extra face buttons will be the system's defining feature.  For the most part I have not been impressed with Nintendo's "controllers".  The NES was great, and the SNES was a step up.  One of my friends is convinced that the N64 controller was made for three handed people.  (I only have two hands.)  Although the GC controller is better than the N64 (IMHO), the layout seems a little unnatural to me.

<br/>
<br/>
I don't see how the PSP can compete with the GBA.  The price is too high.  Look at the N-Gage.  I think that the NDS will be in much the same boat.  Nintendo has no need to compete themself, and unless the NDS plays GBA carts I think that that is exactly what Nintendo will end up doing.

<br/>
Nintendo has done a good job with some products (that Pikachu pedometer), and a bad job with others (virtual boy).  If something is not supported by third parties, even if it is awesome, I think that the chances of it working out are slim (Super Scope).
<br/>
<br/>
Those are just my opinions...
