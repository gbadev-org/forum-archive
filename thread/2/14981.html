    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Linux and Windows will happily coexist on the same machine.  It's easier to dedicate a harddrive to Linux but it is possible to have Linux and Windows on the same drive.  It only gets tricky really when you have to install a bootloader.  I'd recommend putting in another drive, installing onto that and then changing the boot order in the BIOS to point at the Linux drive and then have an option in LILO/GRUB that boots Windows.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's why tools that come with Linux distros can shorten an existing partition once you've defragmented it in Windows. Go to Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools and defragment your C: drive. If you can get most of the red/green/blue stuff away from the right side of the "Estimated disk usage" box, you can claim that space in the name of Linux.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Like I said before, Ubuntu (a particularly new-user-friendly distro) has an install tool that will attempt to manage the partition resizing for you.  My hard drive was rather fragmented, I didn't run a defrag, and it still managed to claim plenty of space for linux, (after quite a bit of time doing stuff to my hard drive) so that makes me wonder if it has the ability to run the defrag for you.

Again, Ubuntu has a lot of nice gui tools and whatnot.  I'm not saying it's the best distro for everyone, but I'd highly recommend it to someone new that wants to mess with linux.

Part of it is the amount of stuff included, but a lot is also the fact that it tends to use smaller/faster/lighter versions of applications.  For example, Ubuntu by default uses Gnome and Compiz.Fusion for desktop/window management, which takes a decent amount of power to run nicely.  There are other desktop/window managers that are less powerful, or have less eye-candy, but are much snappier.  A lightweight distro usually sets up one of these by default.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They would tend to nowadays.*  Most distros (including Slackware) will install X (the gui system) by default unless you tell it otherwise.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Like gauauu says, Ubuntu is very good for beginners to Linux. I installed it twice; the first time it messed up the boot loader, but since then I have found out how to prevent that. If you feel uneasy about letting the Ubuntu installer mess around with your partitions, download and burn the Super GRUB Disc, whose ISOs can be found <a class="postlink" href="http://linux-live-usb.org/download/Super_Grub_Disk/?section=download" target="_blank">from this page</a>. 
<br/>
<br/>
That can recover your bootloader, be it Windows or Linux. It can also boot partitions, so if your Windows partition is unaccessible for some reason, you can boot up Windows and use it as normal (although I'd back up any important files in this case).
<br/>
<br/>
I found Ubuntu to be very useful for learning the basics of Linux; it's a great way to switch if you're a Windows user. The GUI is nice (and customisable), all the settings are easy to access and you can have multiple desktop environments on the same machine. If you find you're having trouble getting around the normal Ubuntu, try out Kubuntu. It has almost exactly the same things, except that it uses KDE instead of GNOME.<br/>_________________<br/>My favourite DS apps:

So Ubuntu should be used for mainly learning Linux? So I would use it for a while, then switch to Linux?

No, it's a full-featured linux distribution.  It's just well-designed with plenty of tools that don't all assume that you're a linux expert.  I know plenty of people who are quite comfortable with linux that primarily use Ubuntu

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Knoppix is a great Linux distribution to have around, even if it's just as an emergency boot disc.  It's a live CD Linux distribution, so you can boot off of it and run it.  I mainly use it to re-partition hard drives, and work with disk images.  I used it to copy my harddrive partition to a new drive.  Then you can even resize the partition you copied and fill the new bigger drive.
<br/>
It's also nice if you need to delete some stubborn Spyware that Windows won't let you take out.
<br/>
You can also use Openoffice, or browse the internet with Konqueror or Iceweasel [firefox].  But your wireless network card may not be supported by Knoppix.

Sure, you can use Ubuntu to learn about Linux and its differences. But it's meant to be a full-blown Linux environment, not just a learning tool. So go ahead and try it out; it can very easily co-exist with Windows on the same hard drive. My current machine is running Ubuntu 7.10 "Gutsy Gibbon" along with Windows XP Media Center Edition and I've had no conflicts between them.
<br/>
<br/>
The Ubuntu will attempt to automatically resize your existing Windows partition, then using the free space, create an EXT3 partition for Ubuntu's files and a swap partition, to be used if your RAM gets full (or, in some cases, it can act as normal RAM but much slower).
<br/>
<br/>
Again, as gauauu said, you can go to <a class="postlink" href="https://shipit.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">shipit.ubuntu.com</a> and have them send you a CD with the same contents as the ISO would give you. It can take quite a bit longer, but it should be a lot more helpful for you, since you are using dial-up.
<br/>
<br/>
Ubuntu is designed to be installed on a hard drive and run from there; the LiveCD provided can be used, in some cases, as a rescue disk for either Linux or Windows, but it runs much slower, and all applications installed within a session will be removed from memory when you restart. I think you also have much less RAM to work with, since the desktop environment AND the temporary filesystem for, obviously, temporary files, all are stored in RAM. I'm definitely no expert on this, however, so please correct me if I'm wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
Ubuntu comes with everyday software to make it as easy as possible to use Linux, even for a Windows user. Such software includes OpenOffice, Mozilla Firefox, AbiWord, Rhythmbox Music Player and GNOME CD Creator. I found the hardest thing to get used to with Linux is using the terminal, A.K.A. command-line, more often. Once you get used to it though, the computer's your oyster (or any other sea creature, take your pick).
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Just to explain a bit, it's recommended that you defrag your Windows partition to minimise the chance of getting some random disk error during partitioning.<br/>_________________<br/>My favourite DS apps:

Which software are you referring to? If it works with Linux, then it should work fine with Ubuntu. Also, remember that applications which GNOME or KDE can be used on KDE or GNOME respectively. For example, something like Ktorrent (which I think exists) can be run on GNOME as well as KDE.

Or did you mean that most software that is compatible with Windows can't be used on Linux? If so, then use Ubuntu alongside Windows. You'd be able to use either OS depending on your needs at the time.

Different Linux distributions are all the same OS (i.e. the kernel series), just packaged differently. In terms of drivers, so long as your kernel version supports it, the distribution doesn't matter. Assuming it's a recent driver version and your distro is kept up to date there's really no question - it will work. Not everything will work out of the box on every distro, mind you, but that rarely applies to drivers.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't like Ubuntu (for boring reasons) but it has a very good packaging system. If it's a popular app, chances are that the app you're looking for is available for automatic install by typing a simple command or two. You can install some drivers this way too.

It would be more difficult on Windows, especially 64-bit Windows Vista, due to the kernel-mode code signing requirement. If you use homemade drivers in Windows, you have to enable a special option at each boot, and you get ugly "Test mode" warnings at all four corners of the screen. Only paying $400 per year to VeriSign makes those warnings go away.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Ubuntu can certainly exist with it, although there have been a few reports over at the <a class="postlink" href="http://ubuntuforums.org/" target="_blank">Ubuntu forums</a> that some things have gone wrong with the bootloader or partitions. To minimise this risk, it's better to resize Vista's partition with its built-in partition editor. (I'm not sure what name it goes under in Vista, I'm sticking with my XP and Ubuntu to avoid Vista's DRM problems.)
<br/>
<br/>
You shouldn't have many problems with adapters and such, especially if they are common ones like CF or SD card slots or TV cards. As mentioned earlier in the thread, you can use ndiswrapper for any devices which don't have a Linux equivalent.<br/>_________________<br/>My favourite DS apps:

Usually porting Linux involves porting at least bash (the shell) as well because it's not very interesting to have Linux on there without being able to interact with it in a familiar way.

<br/>
As far as the GUI goes... that's a window manager on top of X windows. There is no one window manager (nor X windows for that matter), and while X has been ported all over the place, porting the window managers (especially the graphically enticing ones) is an exercise in bondage. And far less useful than having the rest of a Linux system ported, at least when Linux is desired in specific.

As far as I can tell, the assumption is that GUI development tools such as KDevelop will come with your GNU/Linux distribution, and you just need to point those at your project's folder. Then the GUI handles much of the command line stuff behind the scenes.

There is indeed a port of PIXIL which uses Nano-X (that's about the extent of my technical knowledge on how it works, hehe).  I've used it, and it's incredibly slow.  It's got an image-enabled web browser, an on-screen keyboard, access to the shell, a few games, and a couple other apps, but they're all so slow they're not really all that useful.  It's fun to mess around with for a few minutes, but for serious DSLinux use you'd want to go back to the regular command shell.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yup. For consoles, a big problem is that the GUI doesn't always translate very well to the hardware. For example, porting a major window manager, say KDE or Gnome, would be utterly pointless because you wouldn't have the screen space or processor speed... or RAM... to use them effectively, or at all really.
<br/>
<br/>
So it's Nano-X and PIXIL, which are targetted to small devices, and apparently still too much trouble for the DS (in this impementation anyway.) (Thanks, dantheman.)
<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, a DS-specific GUI could be very nice indeed, and under the right circumstances could perform very well and very usefully. It's unlikely that you'll find that sitting on top of DSLinux, but who knows.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's important to remember what Linux is, &amp; what it is not.  Linux is the kernel, that can be <a class="postlink" href="http://www.kernel.org/" target="_blank">downloaded</a> &amp; compiled by an flavor of a Linux OS.  Ubuntu, Knopix, Slackware, Fedora, Red-hat, Gentu, Debian, these are <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution" target="_blank">distributions</a>.  They are basically assorted packages.  You also have many shells (bash, Korn, c shell) to choose from.  Also apart from Linux is the GUI environment.  It is not embedded into the OS like you have with Windows.  The OS can launch XWindows, seperatly from the OS, &amp; you also have the ability to run a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_window_manager" target="_blank">window manager</a> of your choice.
<br/>
<br/>
I have always disagreed that Ubuntu is a good Linux distro to learn about Linux with.  Because it is so click-&amp;-go capable, a lot of users will get the wrong impression about what Linux is, what it's abilities are, &amp; they will be wanting (even expecting) it to handle their Windows applications (because it is so familiar to the eyes).  &amp; when all of this doesn't work as expected, they walk away, confused, &amp; aggravated, &amp; having a huge misconception as to what Linux really is.  That's why I say go with one of the harder (more manual) installation packages such as Slackware or Debian.  You'll learn a lot more about the OS, &amp; if you should get fed up with the lack of a package manager, you can always go back to Ubuntu, finding everything easier with Apt-get.
<br/>
<br/>
Please keep in mind, this is just my opinion from my experience with Linux, &amp; welcoming other users into the Linux world.  No 2 people are the same, so there is no "easy" way to tell someone how to learn.<br/>_________________<br/>-#2pencil</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I feel the same way and I keep my mouth shut most of the time because I have a lot of friends that just love Ubuntu. I'd be fine with it in terms of usability, but its set of  packages seems to be a little lacking (or was when I was working with it) so I stick with Debian.

In this case, the thing is obviously different; people understand that a PSP and PS3 are different things.  They look different.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that most non-techie people don't realize the role of an operating system.  They think, "this software works for a computer, I have a computer".  The real question is how to train the general public that this isn't the case?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you are referring to the Linux Live CD being slow, it all depends on your system.  Since the Live CD will use your RAM as storage, more RAM means a faster running Live Boot.  Less RAM means more swapping, means it'll be a lot slower.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if any Live CD Distros comes w/ the software you are asking about, but you could always download it to a flash drive &amp; mount it once the Live CD has been booted.<br/>_________________<br/>-#2pencil</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have finally downloaded/burned Ubunutu and Knoppix. I'm currently using this Knoppix Live CD. However, I'm having problems. My modem is apparently a winmodem... The driver is written by MS though... Is there any other solution for a Linux Conexant HCF Modem driver other than the Linuxant drivers?(Other than reverse engineering the driver and writing a custom Linux driver myself...) The Knoppix drivers available there are outdated... The kernel used for those drivers is 2.6.11/12... Is it a known kernal 2.6.19 bug with rt2570 chipsets/Nintendo wifi dongle with getting "operation not permitted" errors when attempting to change mode/channel, and iwlist displaying 0 available channels?(The GUI wireless configuration utility also complains that no wireless card is detected, although it lists wlan0...) Also, I tried compiling masscat's rt2570 WMB driver, but apparently I'm missing a DDK... Is there any DDKs available that aren't really large?(Non-ISOs?) No sound would play, yet the kernel detected my sound card... And when I try using the soundcard configuration utility, it complains about the kernel not being compiled with modular sound... Btw no2pencil, Wireshark is included with Knoppix.

When I attempt to read raw sectors from /dev/dvd1 or /dev/hdd, I only get zeroes. It's possible to read raw sectors with these devices, right? Reading /dev/sda or /dev/hda works fine. &lt;edit&gt; Never mind, zeroes were being read because iso9660 stores the "boot sector" at a later sector than sector 0. &lt;/edit&gt;

And when I attempt to compile nds hb, arm-eabi-ld fails to find -lg. PATH and ect are set to the toolchain locations on my hard drive, rather than /opt/.

Also, what software is used for capturing WMB packets on DSLinux?(And how to use the capture sw?) &lt;edit&gt;Is WMB pkt capture on DSLinux even possible? iwconfig can't set the mode to monitor... I have a Fw hack in the works, so this isn't really needed. Need to implement asm FAT writing and find where that pointer to the dynamically allocated banner is stored... :\ (There's a limit on the size of the DLDI, because I encountered issues with non-dldi code being corrupted. Dunno how large the max DLDI could be without corruption. Currently 4KB DLDI is allocated, and that works fine.)&lt;/edit&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
