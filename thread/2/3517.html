SC, could you please stop kicking me from the IRC channel. So i was in gbatemp at the same time. I know that alot of people feel they have this little personal crusade against piracy warring inside of theyre heads, but realise that what I do in my own time, without telling you about it, is private.

I suspect that a lot of piracy crusaders are ex-pirates that are trying to overcompensate for their feelings of guilt by persecuting others.  Even if they are not ex-pirates, I suspect that they persecute others in response to some insecurity or other negative aspect of their emotional state.

I spent about 2 years +- 6 monthes in severe depression.  (The dates are blurry, and I was depressed to a lesser extent before and after.)  If you claim that you are unhappy and that there is no reason for it, I'm inclined not to believe you.
<br/>
<br/>
My advice to anyone suffering from from depression or general feeling of inadequacy:  Try to figure out why you are unhappy.  You might have to stop denying something.  You might have to admit something to yourself.  Even after you figure out what the problem is, you may never admit it to another person.  (Probably better if you do, but know it is better than nothing.)
<br/>
<br/>
After you have some idea what the problem is- or might be, try to do something about it.  The only person who is going to take responsibilty for you is yourself.  Other people have their own problems to worry about.
<br/>
<br/>
I just saw a news report on how medication would be able to help a great many teenagers with depression.  My problem with that strategy is that most people are depressed for a reason, and that reason is not a chemical imbalance.  Medecation masks the underlying reason why a person is depressed.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I'm skeptical- that's my nature.  Frankly, my opinion is of no consequence.  If this is truly the case, a chemical imbalance may be to blame.  "Seek help if unhappiness continues" is the best advice I was ever given.  It's a bit of a shame it took years to meet a person that gave that advice.
<br/>
<br/>
Now that I think about it, my (potentially fanatic) long term goal setting and thinking about the future is probably a result a having pulled myself out of deep depression.
<br/>
<br/>
I do still have unhappy days, although they are few and far between.

Figuring out why you (the generic you) is unhappy not the goal.  It is the first step.  The goal is to become un-unhappy.  Between figuring out why and having magical results there is 'do something about it' phase.  Doing something about makes the results seem less magical.
<br/>
<br/>
I could see anxiety being perpetuated by performing analysis in response to anxiety.  I think self analysis has succeeded when one can form a statement to the effect of "I'm ... because ..., so ... is what I'll do to try to fix it.

I'm arguing that unless video games are the root cause of one's problems, they are just as valid a way of masking a problem (or suppressing the side effects of that problem) as medication or (make) believing in things for (a potentially manufactured) confidence boost.  (One could argue that postive thoughts can improve a person.)
<br/>
<br/>
If video games are the root cause of one's problems, even if they mask the side effects they might also aggravate those side effects.  In that case, other masking strategies might be more effective.  Merely a stated observation and potential problem with the video game plan.
<br/>
<br/>
I could be silly (read this as a joke) and state that I think that life is about goals and priorities.  When choosing the proper masking strategy for your affliction you should important things into account like the cost in time and money.  I have not tried the medication route, but I suspect that it is monetarily far more expensive than the video route for no other reason than that one needs to keep buying the medication.  Video games on the otherhand, when used responsibly, have a fixed one time cost but cost a lot more time.  When used irresponsibly video games games are the most expensive in terms of both time and money.
<br/>
<br/>
Clearly if one's goal is economize on both time and money, making things up is the strategy for you!  Living with an imaginary friend is a lot cheaper than getting one through medication.  Unless you really don't get along with your imaginary friend you'll have a lot more productive free time than game <a class="postlink" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=addict" target="_blank">addict</a> next door.  =P

Yes, but the first conditional jump replicates an if statement where if it does not hold then it jumps to the bottom. If it does hold, it then becomes a loop. Or maybe I am misunderstanding what you meant .. but this is how I see the code represented in higher level without using a while statement.

e.g. </span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">label1: if a &lt; 10 then

   jump label1

I think that works fine.  If the type is likely to change, would not using engine_t be a better idea?  It makes more sense to me if an engine is either a (a pointer to a) structured data type or function.  In that case my engine = yourengine would be safter? =P
