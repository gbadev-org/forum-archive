    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So yesterday I was reading a little bit about programming for the atari 2600.

<br/>
And I thought GBA programming was tricky :)

Anyone care to guess how much ram you have to work with?  128. 
<br/>
Kilobytes,  you ask?  Nope, 128 BYTES.  Ouch.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, to top it all off, you have to hold the display unit's hand through EACH scan line.  The graphics hardware is only smart enough to know about one scanline at a time, so you have to write a bunch of really fast code to update the registers for EACH line you want to display.

Nasty stuff, really.  Time to brush up on my 6502 assembly.  I haven't used that since playing with my apple 2c.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You might want to take a look at the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.xgamestation.com" target="_blank">XGameStation</a>. It's designed to help teach hardware design so it's design is rather simple in a very 2600-esque way. ie, no framebuffer, and NTSC/PAL are generated by timing-dependant software. I haven't picked one up myself just yet, but from what I gather it's somewhat like a souped-up 2600, at least in terms of video architecture.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, it looks pretty cool. I first learned game programming by reading Lamothe's books a few years ago. It's a great idea he had with his XGameStation. Like you said, it looks like a 2600 with more horsepower. Do you know if there is an free emulator available so one could look at what this thing is capable of doing?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the problem with the XGS is that no one else will be able to play your game and therefor it really doesn't make any sense to actually start developing for it.

Actually i don't think that GBA programming is any hard, the GBA actually is a very easy to handle device, it has 15 registers! That's really a lot and it's really good for the compiler. I am currently working on Pokemon Mini stuff and i noticed that using 2 8bitx2/16 bit and 2 16 bit registers isn't really easy if you want to do a *bit* more complex stuff. Today i was just writing a little effect for the GBA and i noticed how easy it is to code ASM on GBA where you have so many registers and then i returned to PM and it really got a bit tougher ;)
<br/>
Everyone who wants to do real tricky development should try to code something for the Pokemon Mini.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">BTW, those 3 registers were 8-bit.  To do any addressing, it takes 2 registers to read and the 3rd as dest (for most memory locations)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The 6502 has three internal registers, named A, X, and Y. On a system with a decent amount of RAM (such as the NES, Apple II, C=64, or Atari computer, but not the VCS), the 6502 can be thought of as having 256 registers stored in RAM bytes 0x0000-0x00FF. This "direct page" or "zero page" acts somewhat like a register file because of the addressing modes that you can use with them. However, if you're trying to make your program coexist with something else, such as a ROM BASIC interpreter or the Atari 2600's I/O, you'll quickly learn how other things can hog the zero page.
<br/>
<br/>
And no, it doesn't take all three internal registers to complete a read from an array in memory; it takes only two bytes of ZP plus registers A and Y.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Thanks for mentioning that.  I was so confused by Miked's comment about using all 3 registers for reading, but just assumed he knew what he talking about (since he does for all this GBA stuff).

<br/>
I spent 15 minutes staring at the addressing modes list of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.geocities.com/oneelkruns/asm1step.html" target="_blank">Assembly in One Step</a> trying to figure out which mode you (Mike) were referring to, afraid I had been doing it wrong this whole time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
