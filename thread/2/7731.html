    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I am currently creating a website that showcases homebrew game developers.  It will allow users to submit new games and rate games for a variety of different platforms (mainly GBA to start with).  Basically it will be an archive of completed games.  There won't be demos and incomplete versions.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to use a collage of graphics and characters from different homebrew games as part of the logo.  The don't have to be anything too fancy.  The goal of the logo is to show the diversity and uniqueness of the art in homebrew games.  Even a little coder-art might help get this message across.
<br/>
<br/>
My question is can I legally use graphics captured from freely available homebrew games and use them on the site?  Or should I get permission from the game's author/artist first?  
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if any of you have some art from your homebrew games that you would like to contribute, just pm me or drop a link to it in this thread.  Remember you don't have to be a great artist to contribute.  The site is about great games, not great art (although they kind of go hand in hand).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
Chris G.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've some homemade jewels for my bejeweled game. However, as the game is still under development I don't know that they would qualify... If you want them, they're yours. I plan to have the game itself completed in a year or so. (It will be massively expansive.) I like the idea as well. The archive here sort of works as a learning tool as  much as a showcase. What you're talking about is a final goal, so the two would go together, in a sense.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

<br/>
<br/>
A few questions about the site:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  does it support any sort of categorization and metadata system for games?  I'd be definitely interested in having a game category, and an estimated game length field (estimated amount of time playing before you finsih the game/see all the content).   (to distinguish between a 10-level side scroller, and a 1-screen action game).   One thing that I currently find frustrating about playing through homebrew games is you have to download a lot of stuff and just try it before you have the slightest idea of what the game is.....I know it takes more work to implement something like that, but I think it would add a lot of value...(maybe have some sort of system where users could provide that info along with their ratings)
<br/>
<br/>
2.  Do you need any help with the web programming?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Yeah it has a simple genre category and the games are also categorized by their system (GBA, GP32, etc...).
<br/>
<br/>
When a game is submitted there is a required "short description" field.  In that field, info about the game's length or number of levels could be added.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, users can rate the games and they can also write a review about the game that will show up on the game's page.  That way reading the reviews can give you an idea of what to expect before you download it.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as the programming, it's coming along fairly well.  I've set a somewhat ambitious goal of having it close to completion by the end of the month.  So right now I'm okay.  But I will definitely keep you in mind if I get overwhelmed.
<br/>
I'm currently working on the game submission form.  Specifically the uploading of screenshots.
<br/>
Let me know any other suggestions you have/things you'd like to see.
<br/>
<br/>
@thegamefreak0134: homemade jewels would be great.  Do you have a link to a screenshot? My email is my username @yahoo.com</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another good feature you could add is what type of game this is most like - if it is like any other. This would make searching for particular types of games a breeze.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
