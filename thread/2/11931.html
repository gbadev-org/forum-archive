    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, guys. I need some help. I am having trouble with a background image. It looks fine on my computer, but some of it is cut off on my friend's. I assume it is because of his resolution, but I wasn't with him when he looked at it. I do not know too much about using HTML or CSS, but is there a tag or some other way that I can make the background fit in the browser, no matter the resolution. This is for a myspace profile, but I am sure that doesn't matter.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The subset of CSS supported by Firefox and IE 6 provides no way to scale a background image. Wikipedia works around this by providing a background designed to extend past the right side and to blend into a pretty much solid area on the bottom. But given the garish layouts I've seen on many myspace pages, have you carefully considered whether your choices of background and text colors maintain readability of text?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

For <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Bowser" target="_blank">bowser</a> use fireballs. If by "bowser" you mean "browser", then you have to take into account people with window sizes from 256x192 pixels (Nintendo DS Browser, or cell phones) to 1920x1080 pixels (HDTV-style LCD).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

JavaScript code running on the PC can query the width of the window and download the appropriate background-image, if that's what you want.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

When you make a site for the PC, test it in IE6, Firefox, Netscape and Opera.  I believe that Mozilla is defunct.  Testing on Safari (mac) is probably a good idea, but if the site works with Firefox, Netscape and Opera, then it will probably work with Safari.  (At least I have not found any problems.)
<br/>
<br/>
If you want people to be able to print your site, you'll have to carefully consider how you want to go about doing that.  CSS does not work well with printers.
<br/>
<br/>
If I really wanted my site to work with PCs and low resolution devices (DS, cell phone), I'd consider makeing two versions of the site.

I'd treat it as something different for testing purposes.  At times Mozilla/Firefox/Netscape testing gave slightly different results.

I can't expect every site user to own Prince.  Even if it was free that would be a little far fetched.

In theory yes.  If you can make that theory work, fantastic.  It can be done.  In practice, 256*192 is <span style="font-weight: bold">small</span> any you may very well need to do something a little different.
