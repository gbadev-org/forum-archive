It's very nice of you, but why are you so much bothered by the websites that disable the blind from surfing on them? Are you one?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Fixed. Just because a work can't be perceived by a given user with disabilities doesn't mean that the user shouldn't be allowed to look for information to pass on to people who can.

I'm not blind, but for a while my only Internet access was through a text-mode browser. First I used Lynx then w3m. My stepmother also has a very good friend who happened to have lost her vision, and I tried to help her learn to use CompuServe but Window-Eyes screen reader software couldn't read the graphical buttons that the CompuServe client used. (It would say "Graphic Graphic Graphic Graphic" or the like.) I've had a vendetta against CAPTCHA ever since AltaVista installed it for the Add URL page, and the fact that W3C agrees with me just cemented this.

That's probably one of the reasons why most are just black and white.
<br/>
<br/>
May it be known, by the way, that the Microsoft Document Imager can often recognize the numbers in those security things at rapidshare.

Oh, and uhm... enjoy your new web space!

I got my own web host instead of using file download sites and have never looked back :)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

tepples, and alt attribute to the password picture would just invalidate the whole picture/password/anti-spiders idea, wouldn't it?

I agree. (Pasted here because phpBB won't let me split individual posts.)

Which is exactly the point. There are other ways to exclude harmful robots that don't exclude users with disabilities. The point is to strictly define what <span style="font-style: italic">behavior</span> you want to exclude and then coding against that specific behavior.
<br/>
<br/>
That does it. I'm splitting this topic to the best of my ability. (I can't split individual posts that talk about both MoonShell and rapidshare, so it won't be perfect.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
