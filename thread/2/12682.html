    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm just kind of curious what kind of response would end up here as to whether Gnirfleo, a homebrew Nintendo DS browser, is real or an elaborate scam.  Maybe we can take some bets even :-P  So far there is no evidence that it is real...the picture of it running on the DS could just as easily be a screenshot displayed on the DS...and it looks like it too...
<br/>
<br/>
Oh..one other thing...the apparent release date is very close to April Fools :)
<br/>
<br/>
Oh...I stuck this in offtopic since....I seriously question its legitimacy.
<br/>
EDIT: sorry....I messed up the poll...
<br/>
YES = It is Real.
<br/>
No = It's not Real.
<br/>

I'm not totaly sure why there hasen't been any say about it arround here.  It has been on drunkencoders numerouse times.  Though...either way, the "project" has quite a number of fans and people who are willing to stick up for it at all costs and also like to request Flash Support...

I wish I thought of doing this as a joke, considering it is a joke...I would have made it much more elaborate and would have had a great subject for a paper. :S</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, because ignoring caps(which he normally writes) will make us believe that it was done on an embedded device... &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

Does yes mean: "yes it's real", "yes it's fake" or "yes, it's either real or fake"?

If I were to parse this logically, I would get:
<br/>
"is [project] real OR fake?"
<br/>
<br/>
Or, as a boolean operation:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">( real || !real )</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">Which is always true, by definition.  I think he means "is [project] real?" because that question is meaningful and real is listed first.

It certainly appears to be vaporware and will continue to appear that way until a demo is released.
