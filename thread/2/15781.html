<br/>
<br/>
What do you use for emulation of gba and ds?  
<br/>
<br/>
I assumed I'd just use vba for the gba stuff, but I'm having a heck of a time figuring out how to get it to run properly...it either runs at 250% speed, or is choppy if I throttle it to 100.  It doesn't seem to have the Sound sync option that I need to run properly.  
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also curious what people use for ds, although there seem to be more useful options</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I use mednafen mostly for GBA. It's basically a multi-system emulator, I believe for GBA it actually uses the VBA sourcecode, but it runs a lot more stable for me. (I have the same problem with VBA, running at wrong speed, choppy, bad sound, etc)
<br/>
<br/>
For DS mostly I use desmume, but I hear there's a native iDeaS port to linux, that I haven't tried yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've been using hardware almost 100%. It sounds like Wine is a good option though, so maybe I'll start doing that... I'm already using it for other things.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How's the speed when you do that?  I tried doing Wine + VBA Windows, and the speed was pretty bad.  And I've got a pretty good machine I'm running on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can run VBA 1.72 at full speed with Wine 0.9.61. Make sure you set the rendering method to OpenGL. I have an Intel Core 2 Quad Q9300 and GeForce 8800GT. There are some issues such as it crashing when using File&gt;Open but for the most part it works fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
