<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo was simply hedgeing their bets, Gameboy2 would have come out if the DS flooped.
<br/>
Now the DS is a success we shouldnt see the GBA2 for quite sometime, by which time I would hope it has even more innovations then the DS has.
<br/>
(Gyroscopic Camera? Augmented Reality? Transparent OLED screen? Paralax Barrier 3D ? Headmounted even?)
<br/>
<br/>
All sorts of things will be possible in 2 years, when the prices come down.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It was a technology that people were not used to and I wouldnt doubt that it will make its way back some time.. Maybe as an add-on for Revolution.

<br/>
Augmented Reality or Paralax Barrier covers the "3D" ideas ;)
<br/>
<br/>
As for neural interface, Sony patented something about that, but they didnt have anything working at all, just a hypothetical idea they want to get their foot in the door with.
<br/>
<br/>
My own personal preferance is simply glass's with OLED screens on the lens, adding a virtual layer to the real world ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
