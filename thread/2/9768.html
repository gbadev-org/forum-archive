    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I once asked if there was a program that you can enter words and definitions into and it would alphabetize and save this data in order. I want to be able to make my own 'dictionary' of terms that I come up with. It's just for fantasy environments and places. So that I can catalogue the in order. Someone said that I can to this with a spreadsheet program with I finally got around to downloading and am ready to do this. The problem is that I have never really used a spreadsheet or atleast not since 8th grade and I don't know how to go about getting it to do this. Can someone summarize it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
