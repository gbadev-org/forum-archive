    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">QGA is a new game system designed to be emulated by everything.
<br/>
<br/>
I will post the QGA documentation in a few days. I started making a emulator in QBASIC, anyone could make emulator for other system, such as Nintendo DS, SuperFamicom, GP2X, GameCube, iMac, palm-pilot, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are part of it:
<br/>
* Has 9 buttons: Up-arrow, Down-arrow, Left-arrow, Right-arrow, A, B, C, Select, Start
<br/>
* Has a display with 16 rows and 32 tiles per row
<br/>
* Has 128 character-set, mostly ASCII, but also custom fonts (the QBASIC emulator does not support custom fonts and will display only ASCII)
<br/>
* Monochrome display and highlightable tiles<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why not just use an existing specification of a system to be emulated by everything? I'd say let's standardize on the Nintendo Family Computer, also called Nintendo Entertainment System. Either that or J2ME MIDP.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

There is 1 example of menu.
