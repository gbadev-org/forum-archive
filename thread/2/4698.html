    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I remember playing a saga megadrive(?) game I believe was called Streets of Rage, In the game you can walk down a street and fight goons by hand or with weapons (like led pipes) you pick up along the way. I've always wanted to play this game again but am not really sure what it?s called (Streets of Rage sounded familiar and seemed to fit the game so I assumed that was its name) or if it even was for the meagdrive. I know it would make and awesome GBA game but I?m not sure if it exists.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows of a remake of the game for the GBA (ROM or Cart) I was hoping you might share.<br/>_________________<br/>If something I have written doesn?t make sense, or is spelt incorrectly; I apologize.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Jake,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also fond of the Streets of Rage series, the somewhat contender to Nintendo 'Double Dragon' one :) 
<br/>
AFAIK, there is no remake for it on the GBA. However, there's a framework for such games ('beat-them-all') which is called 'Beats of Rage' (see <a class="postlink" href="http://senileteam.segaforums.com/bor.php" target="_blank">http://senileteam.segaforums.com/bor.php</a>). It is meant to be a tribute to that fantastic series.
<br/>
It was ported to many platforms. Unfortunately, I'm afraid it requires too much CPU power to run on the GBA. Maybe the DS will do it...
<br/>
Otherwise, you can get yourself a GP32 and play both 'Beats of Rage' and the original 'Streets of rage' series (there are 3 of them, my good man) with the Megadrive emulator, DrMD.
<br/>
<br/>
HTH,
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yup, you've remembered right. It was called "Streets of Rage" and was for the Megadrive/Genesis. It's one of my all-time favorite games :)  There was also a version for Sega's Game Gear (Is that what their portable was called over there, too?), and there were two sequels as well.
<br/>
<br/>
On the SNES, Sega CD (I think it was called Mega CD in europe?), and GBA, there's a *very* similar game, which is just as good, called Final Fight.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
