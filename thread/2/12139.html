<br/>
First off, how do you define "non-commercial use", and how do you define "redistribution"? Your reasoning behind these restrictions may help us draft such a custom license, as the most common templates permit at least non-commercial verbatim redistribution.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

 Basically if you plan on selling a product that uses the output from the application (or derived output) or the application itself should be prohibited.
<br/>
<br/>
 I said 'Redistribution' because even if you are using it for non-commerical uses I would still like to be the source of distribution. Meaning someone couldn't host the binaries with out first contacting me. (i know this isn't a huge issue but still)
<br/>
<br/>
 I plan on making a commerical license available when I get everything in order. I would have to setup all of the appropriate tax stuff when it comes to creating a company.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Copyright law alone will not allow you to restrict the output of a program unless the program itself copies itself into the output. Only contract law can do this, and you'll need to set up a requirement of registration before download in order to securely bring in contract law.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

 Are there stock contracts that I could use? I plan on consluting a lawyer for the commerical license, but I'm probally months away from being at that point. I still need to purchase some licenses myself for some software I plan on embeding.
<br/>
<br/>
 Do you have any suggestions on what approach I should take, basically I want to give the program away to people who dont make a prophit on it, and then charge the ones that do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Check out the MapEd license.  It had similar requirements, although I'm not sure if the license was drawn up by a lawyer.
<br/>
<br/>
I think you want to create terms of use that state the program can not be <span style="font-weight: bold">used</span> for commercial purposes.  You can then create a commercial version with different terms of use, and optionally better features.]
<br/>
<br/>
Download a bunch of programs and read what you are agreeing to.  The best plan is probably to read a bunch of other licenses, put one together on your own, and then have it reviewed by a lawyer.  Laywers cost about $100 an hour.  If you are serious about your license, this is money well spent.  Don't forget to tell the lawyer your <span style="font-weight: bold">intent</span> behind the contract.
