    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So there's a new book out there that attempts to tell people how to program for GBA.  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/retrogaminghks/" target="_blank">Retro Gaming Hacks</a>.  I saw this in my local Barnes n Noble, and flipped it open.  
<br/>
<br/>
There's a chapter near the end that gives a crash course in GBA programming.  I didn't take the time to check for accuracy, but hopefully it'll be better than Harbour's book, or we'll have another one to constantly tell people to avoid :)
<br/>
<br/>
I did enjoy that it mentioned <a href="http://www.gbadev.org," target="_blank">www.gbadev.org,</a> though!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm surprised Nintendo didn't give them a C&amp;D, but I suppose that any book publisising the homebrew scene can't do too much wrong, other than stir up a fair few FAQ-able questions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They may have.  Who knows, maybe the publishers lawyers said no.  At any rate, the gba is being phased out and it's not worth fighting over.

Even while it's still outselling the DS? And once the GBA is phased out, will flash equipment still be available? Case in point: When I first got into GBA homebrew, nobody was selling GBC homebrew equipment. I worry that by the time the Game Boy Evolution (rumored name) comes out, all the DS stuff will be Slot-1 flash cards and SD adapters.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

But the last time J Harbour tried to get his book published, which was fairly recently, he got shot down before taking off..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It even has ZZT, which I used before and it is very good. And even about printing manuals and packages for homebrew games, and other stuff. To make and sell GBA game, you can do the same for NDS game, just on GBA cartridge and use FlashMe or FWNITRO or Datel MaxMediaLauncher to run that game from GBA slot.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
