    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been wondering for a while why exactly it's called sprites. That it should come from the word sprite, as in elf/fairy, seems a bit far-fetched though it does make some rather vague sense. So I thought it may be a short form of something ... small pixelly rectangukuar image thingy element.......maybe not.....

Anyone knows where it comes from or what it stands for?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
