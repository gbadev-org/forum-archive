i'm not saying i really 'need' it :)

i just had no idea that such behavior can lead to ip ban :)

its just a convenient way for me to see are there any new posts in forums i'm interested in... like .... i'm working ... pop firefox window .. see there are no new posts in "ds development".. and continue to work :D

Unlikely because normal use has far more reads per minute than once every 5 minutes. Maybe there was more going on, could you have a bad bot on your computer that is pretending to be an auto refresh but is in fact a common robot constantly pruning the site for email addresses?
<br/>
<br/>
Either way there has to be more; maybe you're sharing an IP address with an evil bot or something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well that would be the point where you should reconsider your internet activities and possibly seek some anonymous therapy. But really I doubt any trouble would be caused by a 5-minute auto refresh of the main forum page. Though it is 144 views per 12 hour stint (assuming that he goes for 12 hours at a time), which does sound like quite a lot when you look at the figure.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wounder what method is used to determine to ban IPs..  It's normally very easy to determine if an IP is reading a single page, or scanning the whole site.  Not only will it show page hits but you will see large file size downloads as well.  If someone is just refreshing a page with one image that is 6.54kb, I don't think it would show up like a site scanner that would show it downloading all the images and any files available.
<br/>
<br/>
So, the real question is bandwidth.  How much bandwidth are you pulling from the server.  If it's enough for an admin to ban your IP, then whatever you are doing isn't a good idea, as bandwidth = money.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

yep ... i have gbadev tab open at work and at home ...

when i'm at home right after work that is certainly a possibility :D

edit: i just realized that its not actually possible ...

i'm just 9 hours at work .... at home i have a different ip
