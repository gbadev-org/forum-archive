    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I have had this book, Beginning Direct3d Game Programming by Wolfgang F. Engel, for quite a while. I haven't been reading it much because it is much to advanced for me. I really want a new book but don't have the money to get one. I was just wondering if any one would be willing to trade me for another book that covers a less advanced topic. Some of the books I am interested in are:
<br/>
(most desired first)
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
Programming the Gameboy Advance
<br/>
by John Seghers, Andre Lamothe (I really really want this one!)
<br/>
<br/>
Programming Role Playing Games with DirectX w/CD
<br/>
by Jim Adams
<br/>
<br/>
Isometric Game Programming with DirectX 7.0 w/CD
<br/>
by Ernest Pazera, Andre Lamothe (Editor)
<br/>
<br/>
Game Scripting Mastery
<br/>
by Alex Varanese, John Romero
<br/>
</ul>
<br/>
Also feel free to offer any that i didn't list 
<br/>
thanks
