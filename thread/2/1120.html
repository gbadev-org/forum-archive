do. Not to fix the game but just some general advice.

So what should I do, delete the project and never think about it again,
<br/>
learn more to maybe obtain knowledge on how to fix it, leave it for
<br/>
a few months and pick it up later?

<br/>
Has somebody experianced this before?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">stuck, well that could mean alot...
<br/>
Perhaps some more details would be nice... however if you are just like me, actually never wrote a game just a bunch of API and engines to use by the game... I would proabably end as I always do...
<br/>
However this Game for GBA seems so more fun and the API isn't huge, except for the tile couting system in 2D, that's a slow darn function with alots of muls... more then it should really be... perhaps a big counting function with no  muls what so ever but alot of ifs is to prefer then the 4 for loops looking something like this (not finished with the calculations yet)
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
 direction = -1*!(rows&amp;0x80) + 1*(rows&amp;0x80);  //Decide which direction the iteration should go to, counting either from back to front ot front to back
<br/>
 for(i = ((mge2d_camera_text_logical_x[background]&amp;0xFF)&gt;&gt;4)+!(rows&amp;0x80)*30;i != (mge2d_camera_text_physical_x[background]&amp;0xFF)&gt;&gt;4);i += direction) //start counting where the new tile row is and stop where the old.
<br/>
    for(y = (mge2d_camera_text_physical_y[background]&amp;0xFF)&gt;&gt;4)+columns+!(columns&amp;0x7F)*20;y &lt; (mge2d_camera_text_physical_y[background]&amp;0xFF)&gt;&gt;4)+columns+!(columns&amp;0x7F)*20+20;y++) //cell in the active column
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Plus alot more to uncount tiles... hmm it's really messy indeed...
<br/>
What am I saying... Well I'm saying try to do something else but code for a while (not too long because then you would loose your attention to your code, as I always do) just go around thinking about the bit your stuck at and start codeing in a week again or something and you'll see that it will be much easier as your brain has been doing alot of work with the problem meanwhile without you evcen thinking on it!<br/>_________________<br/>*Spam*

Areta is an organization of coders codeing mostly open source project, but there is alot of sections like GBA dev, Language learning communities, RPG communities, etc...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for your reply.
<br/>
<br/>
With stuck I mean that I don't know how to go further with the game and 
<br/>
how to remove all those compile errors.
<br/>
<br/>
So if I leave the project for a week and try again then maybe I can fix it?
<br/>
Okay, I'll try that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
