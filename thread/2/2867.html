<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'm going, as are a few members of my team.  I've been to E3s 2000, 2001, and 2002 as a member of the press (RPGamer.com), so I've seen a lot of cool stuff, but I think this show might be my best yet with the PSP, DS, Halo 2, Metroid Prime 2, etc.  I hope to make some contacts with the product aquisition folks at a number of publishers, so despite the mostly fun and games, I should at least be able to do <span style="font-style: italic">something</span> productive.
<br/>
<br/>
Now that it's closer to time, anyone else going?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
Simon, if a decent number of gbadev people would be there, you should arrange a get-together of some sort.  I know I'd be interested in that, what do you all think?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So you're not under an NDA yet, right? 
<br/>
<br/>
I do wonder if the current specs of the DS are actually accurate, that means that I won't need a new compiler, or set up another dev environment.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Anyways, my guess is that any specs you have are going to be pretty accurate as Nintendo will need to release it fairly soon.  Unfortunately I doubt there will be much hobbiest type sutff on it due to Nintendo's Emulator lawsuit...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The GBA is a much more modern system with great graphics and sound. Some of the most popular games ever are released for the GBA (like Zelda 3). I think it will live for many years to come. Especially since the DS is backward compatible.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you think the DS is GB/GBC compatible? :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would argue that the GBA will be around for a very long time.  The only thing that would hold the GBA back is that the DS can play GBA games.  I view the GBA as a handheld SNES, and hell, SNES is doing pretty damn good right now for being out for so long (at least, at my college it is).  I know my one friend doesn't play any 3d games and only sticks to SNES because it's the best 2d thing out there.  I suspect the GBA would be the same... but since the DS can play GBA games, that's like making a N64 that can play SNES games.

    <h4>#20556 - ampz - Thu May 13, 2004 1:40 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Found a bunch of hard specifications on Nintendos webpage:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.nintendo.com/e3_2004/ds/ds_overview.jsp" target="_blank">http://www.nintendo.com/e3_2004/ds/ds_overview.jsp</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Among the highlights:
<br/>
* The wifi IS 802.11 compilant. But it has a proprietary mode as well.
<br/>
* There is "wireless multiboot" support :D However, I guess chances are wireless multiboot only works using the proprietary mode.. Multibooting from a PC with a 802.11 card might be a problem.
<br/>
* 16 sound channels.
<br/>
* DS games can communicate with GBA games.
<br/>
* A DS game can access the GBA cart slot.
<br/>
<br/>
I think we can assume the DS comes with some kind of operating system, given the wireless communication stack, 3D API, and especially the wireless multiboot capability.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT
<br/>
I think Nintendo themself describes the homebrew potential of the DS better than any of us:
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">The code name of the new portable Nintendo DS refers not only to its dual screens, but also to the fact that it?s a true developers? system. When Nintendo made the rounds to the world?s biggest developers to showcase the potential of Nintendo DS, eyes lit up and smiles broke out. One group of engineers was even said to drool a little. </span></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Following up ampz post, I have read that Nintendo hinted at the possibility of having the chat program as an application that comes with it. It includes a paint chat as well. It most likely has an OS of it's own.

My only complaint is I would of liked the touch screen presure sensative like a Wacom tablet. It would be neat to draw on there some pictures. I can't wait to develop for it, if possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
