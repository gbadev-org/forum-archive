    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Im using a EXF advance 256 cart. And im wondering what exatly do  have to do for it work? I looked on different sites and all but it dosent really tell you and in the flash program there isnt any option for something like that. And i was also wondering that in all these pics they show of flash carts they got like 9 GBA games (and yes they were 8megs-16meg games) on it when it can only hold like 4 depending on size.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Look for a topic that has 8000+ views. Its posted by MadBob.

It has some instructions there. PogoShell with EZF-Advance isn't fully supported but most EZF-A people don't use it. There really isn't a need for it.

Three reasons:<ul><li>Some GBA games such as <span style="font-style: italic">Tetris Worlds</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Mario Kart Super Circuit</span>, and the <span style="font-style: italic">Super Mario Advance</span> series are only 32 Mbits. Did you mis-remember the Mbit size of one of your Game Paks or overdump it?</li><li>Some 64 Mbit games are actually a bit smaller; flash carts can usually deal efficiently with games that end in several Mbits of repeated 0xFF or 0x00 such as the first <span style="font-style: italic">Castlevania</span> for GBA, which is actually only about 52 Mbit. I learned of this when trying to rip sounds from ROMs in an audio editor.</li><li>There exist 512 Mbit and 1 Gbit flash carts.</li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
