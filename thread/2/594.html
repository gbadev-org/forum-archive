I've had a year of programming experience from college, and I was wondering if developement for the GBA would be a good/too hard place to start?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'd suggest starting by making games using the <a class="postlink" href="http://alleg.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Allegro library</a> for the PC.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think the gba is too hard of a place to start. I'ts not much harder or easier than directx programming. exept with gba dev there's not as much documentation available. If I were you i would give it a try and if it is too hard maybe try something else.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Personally, I <span style="font-style: italic">greatly</span> prefer console programming over PC programming. Besides, DirectX is an awful API for beginners (or anyone, really) anyways; if a newbie coder tried programming with DirectX as their first programming experience, they'd probably be scared away for life.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I feel that working with a console as a starting point would be a great idea--I started with QBasic and the works, and never really got an appreciation for optimization and efficient coding practices until I started writing alograthims in C++ :) It may be a harder path in the beginning, but the GBA is still relatively simple, very powerful, and will get you into a great standing-point for other platforms.

<br/>
Otherwise, GO OPENGL!<br/>_________________<br/>(Works for me!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't want to discourage you DuMan, but programming your first game on the GBA is hard!! Setting up the compiler, environment, gettingyour first pixel on screen... Let's just say the PC with ie. Allegro is an easier way...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh, I should know. Im still a n00b programmer  but can set up my own development envourement now, the efnet channel #gbadev has been a great help, could't have gotton so far without them.
<br/>
<br/>
Pm me if you need some help, maybe I can help you more then other since my mistakes are still fresh in my memory :).<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
