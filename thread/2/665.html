    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I find myself wanting to have a go doing something on a gameboy. I just can't seem to come up with an original idea. I guess it is hard to do, but I don't really feel as I want to do a clone of something else, mind you once you get into it I guess it's not so bad. Without any idea that is at least slightly different I don't seem to be able to start on anything. Is this a common problem or am I doomed?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I usualy get ideas pretty quickly...I just DON'T focus on creating something original! If a game idea is well "shaped", then it will become original in the writing phase, and popular if you are lucky.

If you wan't to see the design document for my game, then <a class="postlink" href="http://snowserver.no-ip.com/tharo/hostings/lordgraga/files/KlanWarsDesignDoc.txt" target="_blank">take a look</a>!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
But if you are new to gba, the best way to start is
<br/>
with some simple cloning, like paddle games and
<br/>
arkanoid, after go for a simplified rpg and platformer,
<br/>
<br/>
that's what i am focussing at.<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
