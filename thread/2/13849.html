    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I applied for "design a website" project for a company which later asked me to submit a quotation document.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, what are the contents of the quotation document? i.e. what points I should be covering to give myself best chance to attain that project.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, this will be my first project hence very little I know of.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Your "Quote" is basically a document describing what you'll give them and what they'll pay. Depending on how complex the project is, the document might be extremely short: basically a summary of the work and a dollar amount attached to it. There's also usually a payment term, such as "50% up front, with 50% due at completion", or however you'd want to structure it.
<br/>
<br/>
This doc is also commonly called "Statement of Work" or even just your "Proposal." Once your client agrees to the SOW, then you typically ask them to sign a contract that's legally binding.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're competing for the work, then this document is also an opportunity to highlight your skills, experience, etc. etc. You should give them a referral list of other web sites you've completed, a link to your company or portfolio site, etc. If you don't have any of those things, then I think your chances of getting the project are highly dependent on your personality. I'd call the client personally and chat with the decision maker. A personal connection is the only way that totally untested contractors get their foot in the door. If you don't have a personal connection, then try to create one.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if there's anything I can do to help. I'm always happy to give a hand to a fellow freelancer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First quote the price of domain registration and server space, maybe giving two or more prices of alternate options. The cost of website development differs from project to project, so you can say that your rates are anything from $200 to $2,000 depending on the scope of the website, for example a website such as "XYZ" would have cost $$$. After our first consultation I can give a quote based on the size of the project.
<br/>
<br/>
Really you can't quote anything before you know how much work it is. For example you may say $200 and it ends up being a months worth of work ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They should have told you what they want quoted.  If it's a simple static site, it would be lower then say, a custom php site from scratch.
<br/>
<br/>
They will usually take your quote and probably get similar quotes from competitors and then discuss which quote is the most bang for the buck.  But, if they don't provide the exact details of what they are looking for, it will be hard to quote or even compare different quotes.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd suggest you google for some free quote templates or software.  Normally, our quotes look similar to an invoice with additional detail of the dollar breakdown per item.  This way, they can decide what they want in the end, if it's worth the $$.  If you don't have specifics to quote, I would suggest you over quote.  It is always easier to provide more information then to come back after a quote and request additional funds.  Here is a quick example of what I would expect a "general" quote to look like.. of course, with made up $$.
