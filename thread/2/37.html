Hi, I'm Bob of Slough (London), UK. My past-times include drinking, travelling, reading, ripping apart computers and of course programming. I see the GBA as a final way into the game dev industry, as it's the only current console in which a person can hack together a good game without having millions of pounds and a team ;) No expensive grafix here, which is great coz I don't do 3D grafix...

Don't forget about cellular platforms. IMHO, the GBA is actually a pretty tough market to crack commercially. It almost seems like the publishers don't want to touch a 3rd party title unless it has a license attached to it, such as a movie or cartoon and whatnot.

<br/>
My name is Johan Burell and I'm 19 yrs old. I live in Sweden (in a suburb to Stockholm) and study programming and computerscience at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) <a href="http://www.kth.se." target="_blank">http://www.kth.se.</a> On my sparetime I usually hang out with friends, code, compose music, study and writes gamereviews for <a href="http://www.hype.se." target="_blank">http://www.hype.se.</a> Begun programming at the age of 12 using QBasic (well, who hasn't?) and continued with C/C++, Java, PHP, SQL, VB (only briefly) as the years went by. Have had Nintendo machines in my home ever since the NES saw the light of day and have spent countless hours with them in front of the telly. So therefore I got especially exited when I got hold of a FLA and a GBA. Gfx coding have never been so fun :). So now I'm involved in two gamedev projects, one on the GBA (as programmer) and one on the PC (as soundengineer/musician).
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a frequent reader of this excellent site, so therefore I'm exited to what benefit this "waterhole" for gameprogrammers could bring to the scene.

I wrestle at 112lbs....and 5'9"....ive yet to meet someone as tall as me at my weight.

<br/>
I love learning....dont do much with what i learn but once i can get organized (a few years from now....settled into a home, etc) i will be game deving for many years.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey All.
<br/>
<br/>
::CURRENTLY::
<br/>
My name is Jacob, i'm 14 years old, and i'm from eastern Denmark. My hobbies are programming (GBA) and playing wargames with my friends. I like "fantasy metal", like Blind Guardian and Sonata Artica. Right now i am in a shitty school with dumb kids (not me) and dumb teachers, which slows the learning process down a lot! I am currently trying to move to a private school.
<br/>
<br/>
::PROGRAMMING HISTORY::
<br/>
It all started when i burrowed a old book in the library, probably from 1990 (i was 11 or 12). It had a small code snippet for a PONG game, written in BASIC for C64 machines (it think). My brother had just burrowed a 8 mhz computer from my dads work, just for fun. I discovered that it had BASIC installed and i tried the code. But BASIC wasn't very well done and it had a horrible interface, so i closed it down... Then i found QBasic with some sample programs like gorilla, etc. I quickly learned small things like CLS, PRINT, INPUT, IF, GOTO and how to use string and number variables. Then i burrowed another book from the library about C++, that didn't learn me a shit, so i smacked it away and burrowed a QBasic book, which learned me a lot.
<br/>
I spent a lot of time with QBasic and other small things, actualy too long time. Then in 2002 Q2 i bought a GBA and tried to learn how to program C. It was hella easy to learn, and i think it is funnier to play around with it on GBA than on PC's. And after half a year i finaly figured out how to use a sprite :P
<br/>
Then i wanted to learn mapping, and it took a long time too...
<br/>
But now i think i have all the basics, so i can quickly follow everything up and make some good games...
<br/>
<br/>
That is it :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I just released my first GBA effort, "Thrust" a couple of days ago.  I hope you like it.
<br/>
<br/>
It all started in the 80s with the ZX 81 and Sinclair BASIC.  Then came the ZX Spectrum and Z80 assembler, then the Atari 800 and 6502 assembler.  After that came the Atari ST and 68000 assembler.  I spent my teens writing skeleton games (proofs of concept) for all these platforms before going to University and getting a real job.
<br/>
<br/>
My favorite arcade games are "Defender", "Dig Dug", "Mr Do!" and "Asteroids".
<br/>
My favorite ZX Spectrum game is "Manic Miner".
<br/>
My favorite Atari 800 games are "Rescue on Fractalus", "Bounty Bob Strikes Back" and "Dropzone".
<br/>
My favorite Atari ST games are "Thrust", "Xenon", "Carrier Command" and "Elite".
<br/>
My favorite PC games are "Half-Life", "Counter-Strike" and "MS Flight Simulator 2002".
<br/>
<br/>
I like the Gameboy Advance because, as an 80s-style platform, it's once again possible for a solo developer to build something that doesn't look too out of place with professional titles.

<br/>
My name is Henry and I live in Houston, Texas. I am new to GBA development but not to Hardware and Software. If you must know the truth, I am retired after a 32 year coporate career and now spend my time developing SW. I program in most current languages C/C++/ASM/VB.  I starting programming in ASM over 30 years ago while completing my Engr degree.  ( Okay, you can all now stop laughing at my age!)
<br/>
<br/>
Well, enough of that. I am an avid gamer ( turn based strategy/RPG mostly). I introduced my son to computers when he was 6, and he just graduated from college and is now seeking a Game Designer job. We build our own computers as a hobby ( just finished an AMD 2600 machine that is a screamer!)
<br/>
<br/>
I am currently learning GBA in order to port games from other platforms to it.  I sense that there will be a big change in the handheld market in the next couple of years due to Cellphones and PDA's becoming bigger items.

Pete aka Splam aka JCB (for c64 stuff)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm 34 (well, 10 days after this post so I may as well get used to it now) and live in the UK (currently west Wales).
<br/>
<br/>
Started coding basic and asm on the bbc micro, so long ago I can't remember what year it was.  Went on from there to do spectrum and (mostly) c64 stuff.  Started a c64 demo group (The Meanteam) and did about 40 demos for Compunet (UK bbs type thing, hard to explain if you never used it or don't know about the c64 "scene") won best demo writer 2 years in a row :)
<br/>
<br/>
Got hired as a games coder by a local company and have been doing it ever since,  ~15 years now as a coder + a producer.  I've worked for companies like Philips (I was an R&amp;D coder on their CD-i system, basically writing optimised code to make the most of it) and EA (producer there) and various indipendent companies coding on everything form speccy/c64, amiga, st, snes, megadrive, Mac, PC, CD-i, PSX, 3D0  etc etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently writing a couple of emulators and games for GBA and various tools for PC as well as 1 emulator for PC (which is currently on hold), also sorting out some new members for the Meanteam to do some new demos (after doing nothing on that machine for 15+ years, but the scene is still alive and it's still my favourite ).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hi I am brian from montreal, canada (im american though).
<br/>
<br/>
I am 19, I work for a local video game company on a few comercial projects for gba &amp; psx. I have been a part of the gba hobbyist scene since the gba was first shown off at spaceworld (we only talked back then).  I have a few freeware gba games &amp; demos to my name (under the nick subice) &amp; 1 commercial gba game to my name. I have not released anything for quite some time so hopefully I will be getting a new freeware gba game out this month. Hope you all enjoy it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I frequent the Console and PDA forum on Gamedev.net, and in all honesty you're probably more likely to find me there. The GBA independant development community is small, however, so I figured I'd at least keep my eye on this forum as well. I'll try to help out wherever I can, and hopefully you all will do the same!<br/>_________________<br/>-Arek the Absolute</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not to much of a coder. never touched asm or basic (ok i played gorilla once ;). I've done a little php, javascript, have pascal in school and wrote a 3d tetris while trying to learn c++/ogl. I'm from Poland (that's a country in E and almost in the EU).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm Peter and I'm 26 years old. 
<br/>
<br/>
After failing miserably to become a rockstar and realizing that I have to make some money to somehow to pay the rent, I started to program games for a company here in Gothenburg, Sweden. The first game I did there was actually made in a program called Klik&amp;Play (similar to Director). =) A kind of bizzare experience compared to C++.
<br/>
<br/>
Then after a few years I moved to Australia to work for a game company there. Much nicer weather but lots of dangerous animals. After spending three years trying to teach the Aussies how to pronounce my sirname (Pettersson) I gave up and moved back home to Sweden.
<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays I'm spending my days working on a massive online RPG for PC, but it's always a bit frustrating to work on a big project with millions of lines of code and 30 programmers (not really, but close =) )... so I relax by coding a very simple game on the GBA at home... Back to basics, almost like my old Vic20. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ah right, just seen this so i thought i might as well introduce myself! ;) I'm JonH, 21, originally from Norfolk, UK (home of Alan Partridge) but currently studying for a Multimedia Technology degree in Huddersfield (oop north like! its dirty up here!).
<br/>
<br/>
anyway, i got interested in games with the first Game &amp; Watch LCD games, then to the c64 where i started to create my own stuff with basic and stuff like GAC and SEUCK :) then the amiga came and lit up my world with all those flashy colours and slick blitters! found the demoscene and PD scene, started to code a bit of AMOS and blitzbasic before starting up a little PD library within the school with a bunch of mates. then everything moved to Windows, although i still kept all me old computer gear, pc just wasn't the same. Joined a demo group (CoolPHat team in case anyones interested!), coded some pc musicdisks and intros before discovering the joys of the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
got the gba when it was first launched, but waited a bit before getting the Flash Linker. Now i'm working on an Artificial Intelligence based GBA project for my final year degree thesis, and making everyone on the course go WOW when i bring my GBA in every friday to show my progress ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Currently trying desperately hard to get into the handheld gaming industry, which is no easy task these days. I even offered to work for free but no one was willing to give me a shot! Currently in talks with a small PocketPC game developer to work on some music for an up and coming game title. Got any jobs going, then let me know! ;)

<br/>
At night, I like to hack around on my OS X box and GBA.  Currently, I am working on drivers for the XG and Visoly USB linkers for OS X.  What started as a simple little project has now taken me into writing code for the 8051 processor that's embeded in both of these things :)  Eventually, I hope to get back to actually programming for the GBA, but for now, I'm happy to work on this :)
<br/>
<br/>
I've also done some stuff for the GBA in my spare time -- you can see the little bit that I've released at <a class="postlink" href="http://munsie.dhs.org/gba_code" target="_blank">http://munsie.dhs.org/gba_code</a>.

My project is making a GBA RPG maker. To explain more, it's a PC RPG maker (written in Java) that outputs the data entered by the user into a base RPG engine written in C++ which is compiled into a GBA binary. I start coding this week and have until the end of April to finish it, but I've done all the design already (I hope!) so it should be fun.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
