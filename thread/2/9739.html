<br/>
<br/>
I have made (much of) a GBA game in my spare time.
<br/>
Unfortunately the binaries aren't ready for release yet.
<br/>
<br/>
However, there are some screenshots at:

<br/>

and some videos at:

<br/>
(sorry, these are a bit slow because the filesizes are big).
<br/>
<br/>
I did all the coding and graphics myself (with help from gbadev.org, #gbadev and info from tonc).

<br/>
<br/>
Sumiguchi - didn't really have inspiration as such. I just read up on gba graphics, and then made something that would utilise what I had learned.
<br/>
The other ideas came along the way.
<br/>
<br/>
In another sense, my 'inspiration' was initially to try and get something published so I could leave my dull minimum wage job for something more interesting, however I'm not sure this is likely :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This looks really cool. Kudos for taking the "limitations" of the GBA and figuring out some essentially unique gameplay. I'm looking forward to playing it as well.
