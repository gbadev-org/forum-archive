    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what I gather, the official dev kit isn't all that. Then again, I don't have one.
<br/>
<br/>
It basically gives you all the docs and examples concerning the GBA. Its kind of like the CowBite spec but with all the information correct and examples of the RIGHT way to do things on the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
There is also some tidbits of info that homebrew devr's would never figure out but somehow do. (hiding sprites with the size double flag, multiplayer).
<br/>
<br/>
I think CodeWarrior is the "official" IDE for GBA development. But you need a licencse. Go to the site (www.metroworks.com) and take a look at what you can't have.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think it matters what libraries or compilers you use, as long as your game runs fine when NDA tests it.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Two nits: First CodeWarrior's publisher is spelled <a class="postlink" href="http://www.metrowerks.com/" target="_blank">metrowErks</a>. Second, though you do need a license from Metrowerks to run CodeWarrior, and you need a license from both Metrowerks and Nintendo to run the special CodeWarrior for GBA package, you don't need a license from Nintendo to use retail CodeWarrior with a GCC distribution such as DevKit Advance. Heck, I used to have CodeWarrior on my old Mac.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But does the kit offer stuff like an official emulator, graphics converting tools, and map editors? Actually, I went to the codewarrior site and looked it up. It didn't say anything about graphics tools, but after you get the license from nintendo, you get a modified GBA hardware something about an IS-AGB-Emulator Software and IS-AGB-Debugger. And you definately get a Game Boy Advance Developer Toolkit which might have a lot of yummy goodies that us free-lancers could only dream about. Anyways, that's just my two cents.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The IS-AGB-Debugger and IS-AGB-Emu are from Intelligent Systems (the ones who made Advanced Wars). They also have an offical Editor, IS-AGB-character wich is mostly used i think. You can obtain the old IS-GBC-Character (for gb color) on their HP for free. 
<br/>
<br/>
here is their site:

<a href="http://www.intsys.co.jp/" target="_blank">http://www.intsys.co.jp/</a>

There was another offical editor but i forgot the name.

Is this any better than the GBC image conversion tools developed by the homebrew community?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's mainly to make maps and sprites for gbc i think. I cant say if its better than the homebrew things because i never does anything on the gbc. I looked at it once but i didnt really understood how it works but if you know how to do things with it it should be a really good editor.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Intelligent Systems hardware isn't.  I can't think of worse hardware except perhaps their GBC and DMG stuff which was worse.  Tracing in the thing is painfully slow and no read/write to memory breaks.  It also likes to crash alot.  Bleh.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think Nintendo hordes the good tools to themselves then, right?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can't speak about the Nintendo tools, but the shop I worked in used SN systems equipment, and it was great.  You can check it out here: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.snsys.com/GameBoyAdvance/ProDG.htm" target="_blank">http://www.snsys.com/GameBoyAdvance/ProDG.htm</a>.  You still need to be a licensed developer to buy it and it is 2.5k U.S., but worth every penny if you are developing games for a living :).
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: just checked the prices again and they changed since we bought the equipment.  (were originally 5k)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">but how do these all compare to the NO$gba package ??!? It's free one has a great debugger - - a basic assembler, great documentation, and free c compilers are fine, if not perfect at their state already.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the graphic state tile designer was great, but they canned it for the gameboy - maybe someone needs to redevelop that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
