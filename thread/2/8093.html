    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
You may have read a post I made not long ago about a website I am working on for homebrew games.  On the site users can rate games, write reviews, submit games to the site, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
The site will be ready to launch either this weekend or early next week (depending on how much I get done this weekend).  So now I am going around getting lists of some of the better homebrew games so that I can add them to the site before I launch it.
<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping some here could help me.  I just need a few lists of some of your favorite homebrew games.  Even if you can only think of one, post it here.
<br/>
<br/>
The only requirement for the site is that the games be complete and fully playable.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.
<br/>
<br/>

Blast Arena Advance.

Another World (out of this world clone)

Battle Picross

Another puzzle game, I forget the name, where you have to build a bridge help an egg roll across the level...anyone remember this one?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How do you say that?  gow-wow?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the list of games.  I've played a few of those.  Haven't played the egg game though.  Sounds fun.  
<br/>
<br/>
Is it okay to use that Another World clone?  That is a sweet remake.  I wouldn't even know where to begin making that game.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll be sure to add those games to the site.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Heheh, that's the funny thing, I'm not even sure.  It originally came from me making fun of the character Gau on FF3.  It's been pronounced over time as:
<br/>
gow-wow,
<br/>
gwaaaah,
<br/>
and my personal favorite (although nowhere near phonetically correct):
<br/>
gooey-ooey

No clue.  I know the author got permission for the clone...it's completely legal, but I don't know about other people redistributing it.

Aha, I found it.  It was called ClacQ, developed for some competition somewhere (I think in 2003?)
<br/>
<br/>
You might also take a look at TradeWinds...It's a pretty well-made complete game, but I could never get the hang of the controls, so it just annoyed me.
<br/>
<br/>
There was another fun puzzle/action game for that same competition called MalerMeister, unfortunately the lack of a save feature really hurt its fun factor.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

this has a high nitpicking-factor, but what the hell ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Another World isn't a clone of Out Of This World - it's the same game. It was released as Out Of This World in the US, while the title was Another World in the rest of the world. The gba-version started out as a clone, but as Eric Chahi joined the project and gave away the original sources, i'd categorize it as a port now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tepples, tooting your own horn is fine.  I encourage developers mostly to submit their games to the site.  They would have the best screenshots and could provide a nice description of their game.
<br/>
<br/>
-- tetanus on drugs 
<br/>
-- luminesweeper 
<br/>
<br/>
those games are plenty polished enough, and I'll add them to the site.
<br/>
The games don't have to be perfect.  They just have to be complete and playable.  If you used stick men, but the game plays like Resident Evil 4 then it would be fine.
<br/>
I guess playability is the most important factor.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
