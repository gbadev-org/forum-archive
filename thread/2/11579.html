    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just to let you all know, NewFolder productions (consisting of myself and a few others) has a page. This is where the SmashBros. ADV project is going to reside, although I will still consider that to mainly be a gbadev project. The base url for the site is:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.darknovagames.com/newfolder/" target="_blank">http://www.darknovagames.com/newfolder/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
You should be able to find the forums easily enough to begin with. I post this mainly because I have never run a forums site before, and would like help from the admins here in effectively administering my own. Thanks for any support or comments. (I\'m thegamefreak0134 there too, that\'s kinda universal for me.)
