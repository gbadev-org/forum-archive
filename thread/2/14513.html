    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Recently the urge to leave my fatherland and go visit the world has increased. In the end i'm _just_ dreaming of distance countries - at least until the diploma is finished.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to go see the outbacks of australia and the dust bowl in america. Standing on top of Uluá¹Ÿu or harvesting cereal in fields that doesn't end until the horizont.

Living and working with a selected few in the middle of nowhere, but the broadband access to the world just a click away.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds stupid, but I've always wanted to go to Antarctica and drag a sledge across it. I'd love to see the extremes of this planet and going to a place like that (even for a couple of days, not necessarily six months) would be essential.
<br/>
Y'see after seeing Star Trek 6 (The Undiscovered Country) in the cinema, and seeing those huge sweeping shots of Rura Penthe (aka Alaska) as the three of them walk along those huge ice cliffs I've been like "wow". I'm sure I'd be bored of being there after not a long time though.
<br/>
Plus by going there you'd be able to have the cool/essential face-off between yourself and a shapeshifter, and pull the "don't shoot me, shoot HIM! HE'S Kirk!" etc. Yeah.
<br/>
<br/>
For those who need a refresher, here's a tiny pic of that shot. I'm too lazy to get out my DVD and rip a ten second clip :-)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Australia and New Zealand... especially the latter, and Peter Jackson's latest ones have just emphasized how amazing the nature can be over there. Similarly, but much closer I'd like to visit Iceland. In general, I do find hiking in the wilderness much more appealing than visiting any big cities (although there's exceptions).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've always wanted to go to Japan for a while, and probably Europe after that. Problem is I only speak English. :-( Seeing those Egyptian pyramids would be pretty nice too.
<br/>
<br/>
Canada is pretty nice but I want to see the rest of the world too! &lt;_&lt;

This shouldn't be a problem within europe. (Except probably for france)

Have a walk through the cities of germany, and you will see more english words on the shops then german :D<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's a whole lot of places in the world you can go, and get by, if you are flexible, willing to learn, and willing to ask for help.  Luckily for us, English is learned as a 2nd language in a huge number of countries of the world.
<br/>
<br/>
I spoke only English, then moved to China for 2 years, and took a tour of a number of the Southeast Asian countries.  Didn't have too many problems.  I highly recommend doing something like as unto that...it really changes your perspective on the world.

Well i know some more activities that lead to that, but those can not be advised to do :p 
<br/>
<br/>
I can count the countries i've been to with my fingers.

<ul>
<br/>
<li>Belgium
<br/>
</li><li>Denmark
<br/>

<br/>
</li><li>Tschech. Rep.

<br/>
The neighbour-countries (beside spain, well some ppl say that the spanish isle "Mallorca" is the 17th german state)
<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, in 2003, with the beginning of the second Iraqi War, i served for allied cooperation on a wee bit of USA in the middle of germany, so that doesn't really count. (Me@Love with PX btw ;) )
<br/>
<br/>
Beside that i have relatives in "the sunshine state" (cousin) and in south africa (a far related aunt) but i've never visited them there.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Of course, this means you have to meet &amp; know someone from said country in advance, which is not always easy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You could start with <a class="postlink" href="http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Wapanese" target="_blank">Weeaboo</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Wapanese" target="_blank">Weeaboo</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanophile" target="_blank">Weeaboo</a>, and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wapanese" target="_blank">Weeaboo</a>. That should give you some leads to start researching Japanophilia.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I want to go back to Japan and get married next time.  That ought to be a good number of steps toward a bunch of my life goals.  If anyone else is looking at Japan, see if your country has a working holiday agreement.  That is how I went last time.  The USA doesn't.  Canada does (I'm a dual citizen).  Germany does.  Korea does.
