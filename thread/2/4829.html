    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anybody know of a good site with PHP resources like scripts and tutorials etc. ? I have to learn PHP cause I just got myself a web site contract and they need it done in PHP. In the past I did some JSP/JAVA and PERL but it looks like PHP is getting widely in use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a href="http://www.php.net," target="_blank">www.php.net,</a> the official site, rocks if you just need function documentation and such. There is a contribution feature that has allowed PHP coders to post snippets with how to use each function to solve a variety of problems. If the documentation doesn't make it clear how to do something, chances are some other coder has shared their solution.
<br/>
<br/>
The site also has links to a variety of other resources.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're comfortable with JSP and Perl, you'll be fine. PHP is relatively simple, and flexible. Its "standard" codebase is huge, so you can usually find functions that do what you need.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also, don't overlook <a class="postlink" href="http://pear.php.net/" target="_blank">PEAR</a>, a code repository with tons of stuff to help you.   
<br/>
<br/>
Stuff like HTML Quickform really speeds up developing form based sites (it's saving my butt on a project at work as we speak), and DB, which helps to abstract some database code, in case you need DB portability.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's a great pice of software and it's free. I develop all my websites with it since my friend told me about it.
