    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone with enough coding skii attempted either a PDF reader or Marcomedia Flash player for GBA, I assume GBAMP would be needed, but I think a flash player for GBA would be cool, yes I know the GBA isnt too fast, but there isn't much need for antialiasing or anything like that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The use of splines, semi transparency and tweening makes flash too computationally expensive. Not to mention the amount of available memory.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wonder if, theoretically, it might be possible to have some sort of "compiler" that would transform certain types of flash files into a special pre-rendered format that the gba could then handle.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, that would be ridiculously difficult, like any sort of pre-compiled emulation would tend to be.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is something like that for the gba already, I think. I remember them using a sprite from mario in one of their demos; I think they're called 'gau gau's.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
