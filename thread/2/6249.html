    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would really like to know if gbadev.org is going to hold another compo for 2005.  Regrettably, I was unable to participate last year and missed compos on other sites because I have been way too busy with school.  I am currently working on creating a game and I would like to see how it will compete against games other people have made when it is finished.  If anyone has any info or if there is already a post on this topic, please let me know.  Thanks!<br/>_________________<br/>Nihongo o hanasemasen!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
