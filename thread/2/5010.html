    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to get cheat codes for the above game.  One person listed 16 digit cheat codes.  Unfortunately I bought a Game Shark which uses 12 digit codes.  He mentioned these codes worked for the Visual Boy Advance.  Is there anyway I can get these codes to work on something.  It's kind of foreign to me.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.  Patti</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
