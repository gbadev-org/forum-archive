    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to use my DS as a Navigation and video-entertaining system in my car(Toyota Corolla Verso) but my prob is that I have no idea how to "attach" the dS to my dashboard.
<br/>
So is there a bracket(or clamb) for car-dashboard which fits the DS(maybe even one for cellphones?).
<br/>
It should be very broad(cause of the DSses size) i guess.
<br/>
Anyone else played with this idea?
<br/>
<br/>
slightly off-topic:
<br/>
Is there a audio-system for cars which has "audio in(cinch)" sockets on the front-panel?I want to use my DS also as MP3 player(with Moonshell).
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance for answers
