Manga have even allowed us to have the first episode of Astro Boy for free and rent Ghost in the Shell for $1.99! The interface looks nice, although they could have learned a few lessons from smaller video sites.
<br/>
<br/>
But with 1 million unique users already I think the Azureus team may be onto a winner. And maybe one day we will not be region restricted!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Scifi.com has the same thing stopping us from watching the latest episodes of Heroes.

Well the BBC (British Broadcast Channel) have struck a deal with them, so the beeb think it is legal!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At least in the UK... I haven't had time to check it out yet, I'm guessing these  files are DRM'd. What kind does it use? Do they make you use their proprietary software for viewing? (wait, you said Azureus... does it download using the torrent protocol?)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would suspect that you download through the torrent protocol and you may need to use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/" target="_blank">VCL</a> (since it seems to be recommended), however you may be able to run them in windows media player. I think VCL is recommended as they want to keep their package cross platform.
<br/>
<br/>
If BBC are involved then they are most likely using DRM; there are plenty around and C4 and Sky are also using similar schemes utilising p2p.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've noticed that the system can be abused a little because they still [currently] allow people to list their own videos; and though they block illegal things from the tracker they only need to reupload the torrent since the hash will be the same.
<br/>
<br/>
Only a theory, unless the tracker also bans the particular hash; but then people need only create a hash with an additional file and it would be compatible with what was downloaded! But I suspect that soon Vuze may be restricted to controlled content only; otherwise it might make it appear like a traditional pirate network and scare away more partnerships and deals.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But like I said, the system can be abused in a very clever way so once someone cottons on the the method I suggested, the Azureus team will either have to come up with a solution to identifying such violations (for which where is a simple method) or place higher restrictions and implement a tighter system.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
