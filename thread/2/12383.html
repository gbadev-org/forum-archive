    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi I have been searching for almost a week for the answer to this question. Please if anyone know the answer, help me out.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a supercard SD, a gameby advance and I am trying to figure out how to create .sav and .sci files for .gb roms. I am running the software that came with the card, its simply called "Super Card." Super Card patches and creates .sav and .sci files for .gba roms only, but does not work with .gb and .gbc files.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried to just copy and rename them to match to .gb file I want to save. I have tried to create a blank text file and rename it to a .sav and .sci file. Neither of these attempts worked. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

First off, which .gb roms are you talking about? What are their names?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I dont really care much about any other files, as long as I get this one and the lsdj file to work</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
