I can't tell if the people who draft these laws are just clueless or if they are aiming for <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four" target="_blank">1984</a> (or both).

If you don't live in the USA, feel to post a link to the insane legislation that exists or is being considered where you live. =P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In france we had the HADOPI law (for anti-piracy), which was adopted just before being defeated by the constitutional council. They found that the law violated the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and in particular the presumption of innocence, separation of powers and freedom of speech.
