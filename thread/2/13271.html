    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I've nearly finished Quake and I'm a-wondering what to do next with my DS - if anything at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Y'see I'm wondering if I should bother finishing Quake2 after Lynx made that thread about DS development being thankless - he's totally right, and you should really only do it for your own enjoyment. Spending hundreds of hours writing something just to have some kid email telling you he's dissatisfied with some part of the game you spent a lot of time making playable doesn't sound like enjoyment to me! Although these few comments are outweighed by many many more people who have said thanks (so I'm not too bothered by that).
<br/>
But more importantly, for those who have done ports know that it takes a lot of time and endlessly reverse-engineering code is a slow process. Plus I'm a (console) games programmer 9-5 anyway and programming 12+ hours a day can get pretty horrific and takes its toll on you! I looked like a zombie for 10 weeks from pre1-&gt;pre2; definately not enjoyable!
<br/>
<br/>
On the flip side, I'd love to see Q2 running as well as Q1 does. I just don't know if it's worth six months of going to bed at 1am every day... (however I'd know exactly what I'm doing this time!)
<br/>
<br/>
This doesn't mean that Q1 ain't gonna be finished, it's just that I'm unsure about Q2.
<br/>
And if I don't do that, what AM I gonna do with my DS? I did really consider doing that N64 emulator, but it'll NEVER run at decent framerates...so is it worth the effort? I was also thinking about writing a proper video player (think mpeg etc)...but I'm not sure if the DS has enough computational grunt to make it worthwhile... Plus then there's that ad-hoc lark...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm kinda stumped - I can't be the only person who has faced this decision before ;-)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

We even had a guy releasing a CS mod of Quake, not crediting us, not releasing his GPL source, and even including the full Quake data files with their port. What boundless ignorance.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Simon: If you're doing this to get respect in the community, I'd say you're doing it for the wrong reasons. The internet is the internet, it'll always be a network of clueless fuckwads trolling around, with the occasional OK guy popping by every now and then. When it comes to pressure from the community for releases, I think the answer is even simpler: just don't promise anything. State your intentions and progress, sure, fine. But stress that it's a project you're working on whenever you feel like it.
<br/>
<br/>
You shouldn't do this as a community-service, but to satisfy yourself. Even doing releases can be looked upon as an ego-thing; exposing your work. And I think this is a healthy point of view. You won't tire yourself to death that way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I know what you mean. I also know how it is especially when you do somebody elses work it kinda gets to you that it is not your creation but hey then again it is something.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I came here with my porting idea also ( which I will start once I pick my head up get some work on paper done ) and when I get the chance I am going to do it but programming is not my gig and the game is not my game so I put myself first not anybody else besides my cherished ones.

Just don't let <span style="text-decoration: underline">it</span> get to you. I already gave a name to my own demons and I know what I must do to accomplish my mission even if it might be in vain ( which I am praying it is not ) but at the same time I not going to burn up on re entrey.

<br/>
creating software (like q2) just for yourself is pointless, so you'd do it to share it with the community. i think you're already a scene legend, so even more respect is not needed. :^)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Aack! Don't leave! This of course is what I want, and like what everyone else said, do what you want. And as for the Q2 thing, I only think it would work out (without you ripping your hair out) if you got together a team to help you. Even then it would be difficult. Its true, there are a whole ton of negative voices out there, but thats just because they're all ignorant to everything in the development process. Critics come by the butt load, and the majority of them take any chance they get at, well, criticizing. The only thing you can get out of flaming out the ignorant, self-serving kiddies is stress. I guess the only thing you can do is have a prewritten reply to any such emails you might get.
<br/>
<br/>
And as for this being a thankless community... everyone's pretty much right. It's small, and mostly full of pirates. It's not fair that your work should be compared to the commercial games and apps. There are those of us who do appreciate the time spent on, basically, gifts. Thats what they are, is gifts for everyone to take. People don't realize this though, they think it's your job, your only goal in life.
<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, not too much we can do to change that. My suggestions though... Take a break first of all. Then (people might hate you for this) DON'T attempt Q2. It would take forever, there would be stress involved in coding the beast, not to mention the aforementioned kiddies asking "are we there yet?!?!?" Also, I fear that an N64 emulator would draw more flaming emails into your inbox... What I think would maybe be the least painful, and actually probably the most thankful, would be an ad-hoc lib. Blah, blah I know nothing of network coding blah... But it wouldn't just help Quake, but anyone else wanting to do any ad-hoc business. (File transfer plug-in for DSO anyone?) But, again, do what the hell ever you want to.
<br/>
<br/>
And if I ever seem ungrateful in the least for whatever you've done, don't. The possibility of a Quake port is the main reason I got my Supercard. When I found that the first announced one was pretty much dead, I was disheartened. But then your first 'Quake, yeah' post gave me hope. (Geez I sound sappy don't I?) But yeah, morale of the story is I appreciate your work.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. If you do end up quitting DS programming entirely, you should consider jumping on the Wii bandwagon once it starts rolling ;) (I'd still test for you :P)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

It might be better to try implementing the DSP-1 coprocessor into SNEmulDS first. That, and an ad-hoc lib so that developers can add multiplayer without users having to carry around a 12VDC powered access point.

Yeah I think maybe a break couldn't hurt. Somehow I need to wangle a complete break from programming...but being a programmer during the daytime makes this a bit of an arse!
<br/>
<br/>
If I was to code something, I'd like to make it small/medium size, but coded completely from scratch by me. I think Lick's got the right idea by writing these small but pretty useful bits of code, for everyone to use.
<br/>
I'm pretty sure that I will be back on Q2 at some point though, as I know I could make the game playable after just a couple of weeks of hard work... A team of people doing it would be pretty useful, once it reaches a certain point, however the first half looks like a solo-coder effort ;-)

I don't find DS development thankless either, if you really enjoy working on something and even one person appreciates it I find that is all the reason needed to continue.

I get a lot of comments every now and then saying how a Macintosh emulator is pointless or how (blah) can do (this) or (that) better but honestly, who gives a shit?

Just write stuff for yourself, if people happen to like it that's fine but don't back down to negative assholes who give nothing back anyway.

As for the N64 emulator, look at it this way.

If you really want to code it and think it would be a fun project then go ahead, I ported Mini vMac knowing it will never get full speed and I am very happy I did.

Absolutely. If the game is any good, well done to them. And I'm not such a language snob that I don't believe anything good can be programmed in lua (we use it in work to great effect). But most PSP lua games are awful, leading to the decent stuff getting lost in the noise.

Indeed. The old version of AR is hard to find in the UK, so I'm forced to go the SD Media Launcher + SDLoad.dol route. It's not too bad once it's working, but I'm still wrestling with compiler issues.

Painting lets you get feedback from friends and family and coworkers, so I found it to be very rewarding from the social aspect.

Another thing I considered was writing, but writing a book seemed like it would be similar amounts of work to writing a game. Plus then you need to worry about getting it out to people, having it published etc.

and he apparently doesn't know you're already working as a (console) games programmer in real life and you don't need to convince anyone to "get into the industry" anymore. ;^p and he's obviously omitting the fact, that you've already made quake playable - and available to everyone. poor soul. ;^P

<br/>
<br/>
there are also ignorant ppl who simply *ignore* stuff just to be right. imo, ignoring is not allways the same as "not knowing". ignoring is more of a concious process (if it's not, you're probably metally ill). you see a thing, but you convince yourself that it has to be different. that's quite difficult to explain, but i am sure there's a standard definition for it.

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Ignorance is a lack of knowledge. Ignorance is also the state of being ignorant or uninformed. For example, "Bill lost the debate because he was ignorant of that subject." In such a case the term is not pejorative, and may even be used as a self-descriptive term, as in, "I am ignorant of English history."
<br/>
Another definition states that ignorance is the choice to not act or behave in accordance with regard to certain information in order to suit ones own needs or beliefs. For example, "I know better but I choose to ignore that and act in a way that behooves me." Ignorance is sometimes misinterpreted as a synonym of stupidity, and is as thus often taken as an insult, when really it is not.

In many if not all cases, ignorance is seen as a pleasant alternative to harsh reality.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">from wikipedia.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by silent_code on Fri May 25, 2007 6:24 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

What usually happens is, you say "ok that's it I give up" and go off and do something else (read some books, finish playing some 100 hour RPG, learn a language, fix some bugs in some open source program you use, whatever). 
<br/>
<br/>
Then one day you think "wouldn't it be cool to see X on the DS..." and you start fantasising about some new DS project. It keeps you awake at night, thinking about the cleanest design to get it done, or how you could use DS hardware to do a simple but cool effect... and so it starts. And before you know it, it's 1am and you're working on your new DS project. :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I do the same thing myself, I'll only release something if I think it's impressive in some way. That and it would mean I would have to create a website and decide on what my alias/identity/name is, and that is a very serious task (IMO).

Couldn't you put some of your projects on SVN and have other programmers/engineers contribute?  I have to say, many GNU projects would have never gotten off the ground if it were not for CVS/SVN etc, and contributions from the community.
<br/>
<br/>
Why do us Engineers and CS folk always want to take the hard road?  K.I.S.S.
