Ok, ok, ok, I guess my alluding to it has drawn more attention than if I had just said it straight out. So, explanation:
<br/>
<br/>
By "*cough* die-hard anime fans *cough*" I wasn't intending to insult anime fans, and I was including myself. I was referring to what I had mentioned as the "TV network over here that lost my viewership over some childish stunt they pulled on the 1st". Ie, the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_swim" target="_blank">Adult Swim</a> block on Cartoon Network. It's explained in the trivia section of that link, but what isn't mentioned is that a lot of the comedy fans thought it was funny, but there was backlash from a lot of the anime fans (withholding Bleach, Blood+, and Eureka 7 from <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku" target="_blank">otaku</a> can be dangerous ;) ). I was none too happy about it myself (but really that was only "the straw that broke the camel's back" in regards to why I stopped watching).
<br/>
<br/>
Soo...sorry for veering this so ridiculously far offtopic.

I must admit that...Mecha isen't really my thing.  The majority of the anime I have seen is stuff that 1. Most of the so called anime fans haven't seen and 2.  mainly consist of comedy...  I like my comedy :-P.  I just...really like the characters in Eureka...ever since the first episode I grew an attachment to all the characters for some reason.  Also...things start to make sense after about 10 episodes or so once you put two and two together...it's nothing like Ghost in the Shell, Egro Proxy, Etc. in terms of being comfusing...

When you say you've never really gotten into one, do you mean you've never gotten into a subbed anime?

I've actualy watched very few dubs...really, the only dubs I ever watched were just stuff i saw on TV before I was even into anime.  It's kind of weird though...now, it's awkward for me to watch something that doesn't have subs since i'm so use to it.

I meant I've never gotten into one of the debates. I hear they can get rather religious at times.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don't have particularly strong feelings one way or the other. Given a choice, I tend to gravitate more towards the dubs just because with subs it can take awhile to get acclimated to shifting your attention back and forth between the main screen and the captions at the bottom (this can get insanely hard in some of the more hyper shows like Kodocha). And as much as I hear complaints about the English voice actors, there's only one case where it's actually bothered me enough to cringe and dive for the remote to turn the dubs off (Ai Yori Aoshi. Although, that's just an all-around half-assed manga-to-anime treatment, anyway. It's drawn and animated like cheap crappy 'H')
<br/>
<br/>
But that said, I do really like the sound of the language, too. And sometimes I'll watch on sub just because of that, or to try to pick up on some of the language (I've forgotten a lot of the Japanese I learned in college).
<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed though, that subs tend be more of an accurate literal translation of the actual words, while dubs are more of a translation of the intended meaning. So at times I'll watch sub+dub together or switch back and forth, just to get a better feel for the whole package. It almost gives you a sort of a "behind the scenes" perspective on it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I find dubs almost always pick terrible voice actors. They rarely if ever fit the character, and in some cases (Ranma), just make me want to stab my ears. They also tend to deviate pretty far from the original script (Inuyasha).

It's not hard to get used to subs, but they can be a bit of a pain at times, especially when you can't find a good font/size that makes them readable without being annoying.

I watch tons of anime with subs on my Ds...though, they were all hard subs.  Soft subs (i think i'm getting my terms straight..) should work just fine with some tweaking, there was a post about it not too long ago on here.
<br/>
<br/>
You know the funny thing though...i don't remmember ever spending too much time getting use to subs and now...it just...i don't even notice they are there. :S  Maybe i'm weird.  By the way though...disney dubs seem to always be good...But Disney has good voice actors and lots of money...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was specifically referring to dubs of anime.  Not in general.  I don't know any other non-anime specific companies that dub anime other than Disney...and Disney only does so much (really, just for the Studio Gigli...or whatever it's called...which is like the Disney company of Japan...but it's not Disney...).  I've never heard of MG, Warner, Universal, etc. doing anime dubs.  Anyways...if any of those other companies dub anime...they haven't done much of it.  It's the anime-specific dubbing companies that hire stinky voice actors then ship it out for a profit.

Yay for whatever makes the most money!
<br/>
<br/>
As for the market...I don't know...There are quite a few anime fans and it seems to get popular more and more.  More and more often I see the lease likly people into anime.  Though...the part about them willing to spend a ton of money seems...awkward.  By the way though, manga is fairly cheap.  They usually go about $9 a volume...though, i don't read much manga.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, for the most part, i'm happy with the fansubs...there are a lot of very good groups...then there's some very bad groups..and further more...sometimes with the bad groups you don't even have the option of buying it from a US company who subbed it, since it's not even aviable.  Kodomo No Omocha comes to mind.  Actually, I think episodes 1-20 may have been sold, but it's very doubtfull the whole 100 episodes will ever been released and the funsubs stink..well, a large sum of them.

Yay, another Kodocha fan :) I do know they've definitely put out at least a few dvd volumes in english sub/dub, I've seen them around and watched a few. Though, I don't doubt you that it isn't the entire series.
<br/>
<br/>
I gotta ask though, since you're more used to watching in sub than I am: When you watch Kodocha in sub, are you able to actually keep up, or do you still end up pausing/rewinding a lot like me? Just because Sana-chan is one hell of a spaz/motormouth, even for an anime character (of course, that's part of what makes her character so fun to watch).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.

I gotta ask though, since you're more used to watching in sub than I am: When you watch Kodocha in sub, are you able to actually keep up, or do you still end up pausing/rewinding a lot like me? Just because Sana-chan is one hell of a spaz/motormouth, even for an anime character (of course, that's part of what makes her character so fun to watch).</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
I never had a problem 0.o.  The only problem I ever had with keeping up ever was the few times in Excel Saga when Exel started talking insanely fast (i feel bad for whoever was translating that).  Though even that, I diden't have too much trouble.  Subs seemed to have increased my reading speed actually.  Though, Always seem to read the subs at the right rate, very rarely do I read the subs too fast or too slow, well, at least it seems that way.  It's hard to explain :S

You know when I said I see a lot of unexpected people into anime...a large ammount of those people were girls reading shojo (You know....boys like some shojo...Full Moon O sagishate is also one of my favorite series...it's also one of the few manga that i've read...though, yes, shojo means girl...but whatever...i'll read/watch what i want :-P).  Anyways, if you mean, is there money you translating it and trying to sell it (considering you obtained a license), then probally not...though, the big companies are goign to go after things that are goign to sell the most.  Those may not sell as much as other things.  But, i'm sure the big companies could make money off it if that's what you mean. You know though, I woulden't be surprised if some of those that you mentioned have been published in US shojo magazines.  
<br/>
<br/>
Either way...there's always the fan translated ones (though, i don't know if there are scanlations for those...).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The CCS subs I have seems pretty decent...though, I think they are all softsubs (too lazy to check).  As for swearing...considering (from what I know..) there arn't really many short swear words like we have in the language...and, thus, I very rarely see swear words used in translations, the only one being Black Lagoon...though...half the time in that series they are speaking in broken up, stinky acented, english, so...yeah.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, with hard subs, there are some really good groups out there.  Also, chances are, there are multiple groups subbing an anime, so you can always look into the reputation of the group and or the comments for the translations/video quality/whatever of the groups subbing the current anime and then decide which group has stinky translations, which group puts their subs in bright yellow text, and which group is just right.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I ende dup checking who subbed the CCS series I have..it was O-A fansubs, or OmegaAnime and they have quite a high rating on anidb...and...they are soft subs.  You may want to grab them if your or a CSS fan or buy the series (I think you can grab box sets fairly cheap now...I may pick one up actually if i can find one that isen't redicoulously expensive...though...probally not.).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways...conclusion:  Don't automatically say ALL fansub groups are bad...though, there isen't excactly a high number of quality groups either...but, I have seen very few series where I was overtly disastified with the subs or quality of the video....of course, there's always those little things though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Like, WTF? Group and name prefix makes sorting difficult. Use of "?" character means you can forget about doing anything to these files from Windows' command line. Total lack of spaces (why?) means listings get stretched to kingdom come. Total lack of uppercase (again, why?) is just silly. Suffix "__mg_dvd_rip_" is fairly useless: it doesn't need to be on every filename (use a readme or something), and who cares? Finally there's like a CRC32 or something, which is pretty dumb when you're distributing via <a class="postlink" href="http://p2p.ytmnd.com" target="_blank">PP2P2P2PP2P</a> which (assuming any decent client/protocol at all) does hash-checking already.

Anyways....who in the world distributes anime off of p2p ...then again....why are you using p2p to begin with.

...Either way, you are complaining about the wrong things.  First of all, the group most likly does NOT distribute their files via P2P, it's most likley either through IRC or Bittorrent.

First off, I dont' see what unsensible about the naming system.  Underscores and no capitals are nothing uncommon...plus, it's easier to work with those underscores and no caps at terminal...well, I don't particly like using quotes.  Also, a readme file would be stupid.  Why archive a readme file and the video together, when you could just have what you need in the filename?  Or...why have to deal with a bunch of readmes and files in individual folders when downloading invidivual episodes? Groups tend to release the files one at a time...and sometimes they will package them all up once the series is completed.  If they renamed the files for the packaged version though, then, if someone wanted to seed an individual file to someone, they would have to find out the right file name.

That do what?  Drop things after they have been overtly exhaused and thus become no longer interesting, especially considering the fact that no sides are goign to win and the argument isen't that big of a deal to begin with and the only reason it occured was to waste time so you can come up with an excuse to go to bed later at night by typing a very long run on sentence?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why are you trying to win? That is counter productive and is deeply flawed as it assumes you are right and the other is wrong and makes you dismiss what the other person is saying, hence unproductive.

Considering that the film is going to be shared on different networks (including bit torrent), proper naming and packaging is good to have from the start. People will search for their movies, and if the filename is all they have to go by then something good would contain the series, episode number, series title, (sometimes) episode title, and the type (e.g. DVD Rip/ Cam / VCR / TV Rec)

First it was just about anime in general, then fansub groups and their releases, and now...your free to start a new disccussion.  So currently, the discussion is about absolutely nothing. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not necessarily, it is about the naming schemes used on p2p; although it will not solve anything. Still an interesting discussion considering we have people from to opposite sides of the fish tank. Makes you think, setup.exe, productNameSetup[Ver].exe, or CompanynameProductnameVer.exe?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
