<br/>
<br/>
And... no.
<br/>
<br/>
Although, I guess there are a few cases where it's not evil and a few places where it's legal.
<br/>
Still, I doubt it is possible. Though I do understand there is some sort of effort to get it working (though I know nothing about it... I don't think they've done much).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can see this being useful if you had your Supercard in the system at all times and didn't want to have to carry around the browser memory expansion cartridge. Of course, if you're using the real DS card, there's little you could do to hack it to work on Supercard, short of possibly loading and patching in RAM like the Mario Kart hack.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know if this is legal or not but this is my situation and why I want the DS browser to work on my M3
<br/>
<br/>
I imported the Jap version and have the ram pak etc but I don't know japanese, I can work the browser ok but english would be nice.
<br/>
<br/>
Now that an english version was released in Europe, I could downlad that rom and use the browser in english.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
- you dump it yourself, using your own tools (e.g. M3 Dumper)

- use the unofficial English translation (which, I hear, is just as good)

Using the (E) ROM is illegal.
