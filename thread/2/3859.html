    <h4>#24730 - Lord Graga - Tue Aug 10, 2004 5:10 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heya.
<br/>
<br/>
Having recently started at a new school with higher requirments to the students. One of them is to take a lot more notes that I usually do, and if I do them in hand, I am very very sure that I will somehow manage to lose most of my notes at the end of the year. Besides, it sucks to sit with a few hundred silly little pieces of paper and sort them out, or search through them to find some special information.
<br/>
<br/>
So I came up with the idea that I needed a notetaking program for my laptop. It would need to have a good search function, and maybe loggin function for each file (i.e: created on [] and last modified[]), so that I wouldn't need to type it in myself.
<br/>
<br/>
Have any of you ever heard of/used such a program? It doesn't matter at all if it's for Linux or Windows, as long as it's good.

And... attend a school that is more progressive. Note taking isn't a reliable indicator of comprehension or retention. About the only thing it indicates is how well you take notes.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you are best off using Open/Microsoft Office on your laptop; but yes, it is about how well you take notes. And generally speaking if you type slower than you write, as some people still do, then you are better off with your hand.
<br/>
<br/>
You can write notes on the day; and when you get home put them into your folder in order, and basically have a contents page and add to that; that way you know what's in your notes at a quick glance, and everything is in order to look back to revise from.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm... off topic indeed...  Is your laptop GBA compatible, 'cause if not you're in the wrong forum.  But look at all these helpful folks!  I applaud the kindness of strangers.
<br/>
<br/>
Er, uh...  I would have to agree with the masses here.  Open Office (formerly known as Star Office) is a free download from Sun (the Java people), and you can find it at <a class="postlink" href="http://download.openoffice.org/1.1.2/index.html" target="_blank">http://download.openoffice.org/1.1.2/index.html</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
As for sorting, I would highly recommend just keeping organised.  
<br/>
- Name your folders by subject and/or date by month
<br/>
(ie. C:\Physics\Aug-2004\)
<br/>
- Then name your individual files by date then topic
<br/>
(ie. C:\Physics\Aug-2004\23-Notes for upcoming test on inertia)
<br/>
<br/>
This will make things very easy.  Just use [WIN]-F to open Windows' Find feature (or use the start menu-&gt; search, or if you're using linux/mac, I'm sure there's a file search function somewhere), and type in INERTIA.  You will be greeted with any notes you have on inertia, and the folder it's in will tell you when you took the notes.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope I've been helpful!

Yes, he develops for the GBA. He is the same Lord Graga that won the second <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pdroms.de/" target="_blank">PDRoms</a> competition.

So excuse me if I don't know Lord Graga.  I don't spend every waking moment reading posts and about past competitions that happened before I knew they existed.

As for my "Huh?" comment, that was because the reply of "Lord Graga; Lorg Graga, don't think I've ever heard of him ;D" was a bit of a mystery to me, as it would be to ANYone who has never heard of Lord Graga.

Anyway, back on the topic: Most of the methods that you are describing only includes search for the filename, and not words inside the file itself. This would be greatly appreciated, because if I, example, did a report on the physics of electrons, then I would possible have some information in files which did not have "electron" in their filename, which would mean that I would not get all the information that I had compiled.

Use *nix or a cygwin installation.  Become familiar with <span style="font-weight: bold">man</span> pages.  man grep.

Anyways, if you want to search within files for specific words, then the Windows find function allows you to specify files either by name or extention, then to search within those for specific words.  But for any other OS, I'm afraid I don't know anything.

<br/>
The "super intelligence" comment was made in a reference apart from whether or not someone would understand what you said about Lord Graga.  Just saying you seem to think you're "all that".
<br/>
<br/>
BUT knowing Lord Graga WOULD have to mean that I've read some of his posts, and for me to have done that, I would have had to either search through all the forums (I only go into the ones that interest me), or look at his profile and research his forum activity (I didn't CARE enough about it to bother - it was only a comment in PASSING for crap's sake).  Besides, I was being very sarcastic in that particular post.  (Who would spend every waking moment reading the forums?  Or even a good portion of their free time?)

<br/>
So... in order to KNOW Lord Graga, know that he devs for the GBA, and know that he has posted roughly 346 times, mostly in other topics, only requires "just a little nudge of logic"?
<br/>
<br/>
Tell me...  I have a friend named Brian.  He want the best wire to hook up his stereo.  Now, only using logic, determine that he has eaten 1,318 hamburgers in his lifetime.
<br/>
<br/>
What is your idea of logic, anyways?  Does anyone else think that he's being a little unfair here?  How can so much come from saying "P.S. Do you dev for GBA?"  and then "Huh?".  It's not like I refused to help until I found out he was one of us, it was a mere question out of curiosity!

If I were you (and I was once... sorta) I woud just grab a decent A4 ring-bound folder and hand-write everything.  Keep different lecture courses on different sheets.  Tabbed separators help.  Write neatly and you'll be able to find stuff.

I carried around a single 2-inch wide folder for each of my 3-years with all my notes in it.  No worries.

Folders can be bashed about more than an expensive laptop, and being in Europe, presumably you have bars on campus and may spend a sizeable number of hours there after classes.

<br/>
Exactly.  Science courses (maths, electronics, computing, physics, chemistry, biology) make heavy use of formulas, diagrams, symbols, etc. and PDAs and computers really do suck at trying to faithfully jot down anything like that.
<br/>
<br/>
Everyone and draw a diagram on a piece of paper.  Even if you make mistakes and scribble.  Computers really are arse compared to pen and paper.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a laptop and I have a PDA.  My laptop I use for programming and writing Word Docs (with Visio diagrams when needed) and my PDA I use to keep contacts, appointments, etc (but I find myself using it less and less - I'm an engineer - not a businessman/salesman who has constant meetings).
<br/>
<br/>
For note taking, doodling, or sketching out ideas, I always always use pen and paper.  Word and Visio are for when I'm done thinking and have to present my ideas to others.
