(Random response because I'm too lazy to get up and go to bed instead: Ouch, that sucks. I used to take ritalin, but had to stop a few years ago because it tends to affect adults differently. It started making me so jittery and wired I felt like I had drank a gallon of pure espresso. It let me focus *really* well, but too bad I couldn't sit still at the PC longer than 5 seconds before bouncing around the room - literally.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

All you guys who took Ritalin for Asperger's; was it presenting in combination with ADHD or something?

gb_feedback: Although I figure I probably have same minor Asperger-like symptoms, I don't really have Asperger's. I took ritalin (and now strattera) just for plain-old ADD (non-H).

It was initially presenting <span style="font-style: italic">as</span> ADHD before Asperger syndrome was widely diagnosed. But it turns out that Asperger syndrome and ADHD respond to the same sort of stimulation, either directly (with stimulants such as Ritalin? methylphenidate or Adderall? amphetamines) or indirectly (with norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as Strattera? atomoxetine).

You certainly come across as being focused. Tell me, do you take your Stratteraâ„¢ at weekends too?

In my day they hadn't invented these conditions, so I know at least two people who clearly have Asperger but don't know it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's an illusion. You don't see the fact that I have slashdot.org, ddrei.com, PIRACY-DOT-COM, nesdev.com, and bemanistyle.com boards open in separate tabs at the same time I read gbadev.org or that I frequently open several threads at once. On the internets, nobody knows you're a dog.

Yes. As with any reuptake inhibitor, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.crazymeds.org/strattera.html" target="_blank">you're supposed to take atomoxetine regularly</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I've never been any good at memorizing. Sometimes if I use a piece of info often enough it'll just stick (like my social security number, for instance). But I can only seem to memorize stuff as a side effect of using it, not as an intentional thing.  I tend to use API references a LOT when coding ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Personally I suffer from manic depression, which these days is called Bipolar disorder.

Rather than take drugs, I prefer to take vitamin suppliments and the like.

Of course, there is always beer, which is sometimes my only saviour!
