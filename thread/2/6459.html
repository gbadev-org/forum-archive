Same here, but with the PGB first (Pocket GameBoy).  It came with DonkyKong II or something (I don't recall the actual name, but it was a small yellow cart with Diddy and Dixie).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Didn't they have "We Card" back then? Or does your state's law prohibiting sale of alcohol products to minors not apply to isopropyl rubbing alcohol?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The back of the NES carts recommended that you don't use solvents like alcohol or benzene, so I just used a q-tip dampened with water.  I would always get the most interesting looking green residue after cleaning the cart.  I would subsequently spend about 15 mins blowing into the cart and the system, banging on the system, and sliding the cart inside of the system so it aligns properly, etc.  Rental games were a bitch to get working though.<br/>_________________<br/>Nihongo o hanasemasen!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

True, but the manual for Nintendo's NES Cleaning Kit recommended using isopropyl rubbing alcohol if water doesn't work.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Heheh, I tend to be backwards with everything. I had an N64 before I finally got a SNES (I just had the Genesis during the 16-bit era.) And I've beaten Mario Sunshine twice, but still haven't gotten around to finishing the N64 version of Mario 64. :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.

I found the best thing to do is to get a game genie.  Where you piggyback the NES cart onto the Game Genie.  The games seem to work better that way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was a Nintendo fanboy back in the day, but I think I like Sega more than Sony and Microsoft.
