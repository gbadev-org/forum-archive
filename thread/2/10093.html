<br/>
I think t'admin should consider creating a forum purely for long threads that deal with support for specific applications. There's the Moonshell and ScummVM DS threads stickied in the DS Development forum for example. However, there's numerous other apps that fall off into the second page of one of the three DS subcategories, and then folks post a message saying 'I wonder what ever happened to X', assuming that it's just been cancelled. This way, apps without a website can have a central hub of information where people can look. (As long as they keep the front page of their thread up to date)
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the subforum can be open for replies, so people can ask questions on the application, but creating new threads is disallowed, and threads can only be moved there from one of the other DS subcategories.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
