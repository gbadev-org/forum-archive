    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The source for playing dpg is included in Moonshell, I don't think it would be astronomical feat to get it working in a Win32 application or make a plugin for another existing player on that platform. Only that someone would have to do it. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, I've found the thread I was thinking of.  However, I was mistaken.  The thread is for viewing .gbm and .gbs files on your computer, not DPG.  Anybody still interested?  It's on YarrHaven, so I'd have to quote the various posts instead of giving a direct link.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It <span style="text-decoration: underline">IS</span> possible to play DPG's on your PC, here is a direct link to the software - <a class="postlink" href="http://utorrent.com/DPGplay_v2.1.7z" target="_blank">DPGplay</a>. I will not link to the site I found the info and the file on, as it deals with dpg sharing. Just load your DPG and it will demux the file and then play back the video and audio at the correct rate.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
