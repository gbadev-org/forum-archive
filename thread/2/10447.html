    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For those who don't know, there are patents on 1 click buying and the T9 disambiguation code that features in mobile phones. The only problem with them is that their algorithms are obvious at the time.
<br/>
<br/>
The T9 problem appears in programming competitions. And despite many coders never coming across this before, it is often solved within the first 30 minutes, highlighting it as a piss-easy algorithm which is blatently obvious.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't even get me started on one click buy.
<br/>
<br/>
But what does this mean to us? If you use T9 disambiguation then you must pay the patent holders. The algorithm is so obvious it feels like we are all cheated.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Beat them</span>
<br/>
The two patents should be overthrown
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Join them</span>
<br/>
Write your own stupid patent that is blatently obvious but just has had no need to be implemented, and create a use for it.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Refine the process of patents</span>
<br/>
For patents in specific fields, experts around the world should be consulted to detirmine whether the idea is novel, or obvious to the industry.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In other words, create your own patent that replaces the need for theirs, and then GPL (or insert whatever "free" use liscense you want here) it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This may not be possible if their patents are broad enough. Unfortunately, USPTO examiners have shown themselves to be incompetent in rejecting overbroad claims.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

That's just what the system says to keep us quiet. There is no "right" about one click buy and T9.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
