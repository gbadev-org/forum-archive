    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, well, as you see from the subject this is not a GBA question, but a general topic about getting a degree in the states...i found two requeriments for the M.S in C.S. Program
<br/>
<br/>
As a minimum requirement, all applicants must: Have achieved proficiency in the English language. Non-native English speakers must provide a minimum TOEFL score of 550 (paper exam) or 213 (computer exam). 
<br/>
Have completed a Bachelor?s degree with a minimum of a 2.5 cumulative GPA. 
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right now I know this:
<br/>
<br/>
Letter grades are commonly given the following values: A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0.
<br/>
<br/>
well, we don't use letters for grades...we use percents...
<br/>
90 - 100 = A (I guess) =4
<br/>
80 - 90 = B                 =3
<br/>
70 - 80 = C                 =2
<br/>
&lt; 70    = F                  =0
<br/>
<br/>
in some schools the lower value to get a D is 60, but not ours :( that's why the letter D doesn't show in the graph...;-)
<br/>
<br/>
well now the weight given????????? **confused!!
<br/>
<br/>
Find out the weighting given to each course.
<br/>
Some schools use course hours per week instead of assigning a weighting to every
<br/>
<br/>
in our school we have two systems, the hours per week and the credits, a course with 4 hours per week has 8 credits, a course with six has 10, a course with 2 has 4 credits...
<br/>
<br/>
next step: Multiply the point value by the weighting to determine the grade points for each course.
<br/>
<br/>
I will choose the hours per week to make an example...
<br/>
<br/>
let's see...my Operative systems course has 4 hours per week...I have to multiply that by the number on my grade...well that's 3. 4 * 3 =12
<br/>
12 grade points in that course.
<br/>
<br/>
now I have to do the same for all the courses...
<br/>
<br/>
then add them together
<br/>
<br/>
then add all the weighting up to get a total weighting. (I guess is talking 'bout my weighting)
<br/>
<br/>
finally divide the total grade point by the total weighting to get your grade point average.
<br/>
<br/>
Am I right??<br/>_________________<br/>All human wisdom is summed up in these two words, - 'Wait and hope"

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you plan on doing a Masters and a batchellors then a better option is often the MSCi - which is a 4 year course of batchellors + masters. Its strength is that the third year and forth year correspond with each other giving your course more focus and being able to interlink modules.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
