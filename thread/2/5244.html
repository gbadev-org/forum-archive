    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So living here in China, I see some odd stuff for sale here and there.
<br/>
<br/>
The most recent thing I noticed was a little gadget that plugs into your GBA like a normal cartridge, but it had audio and video in, and it turns your gba into a little tv output.
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about buying it, but I realized I couldn't think of a single practical purpose for me to own one.  It sure looked cool though.
<br/>
<br/>
Although what I really want is the opposite..to play my GBA on a tv (without buying a freakin' gamecube).
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of weird stuff, has anyone heard anything about homebrew for the iQue?  They're pretty cheap here.....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is a device that lets you output the GBA screen to TV, I think I saw it on Lik-Sang once.
<br/>
<br/>
About iQue homebrew, it's very limited outside China since the iQue is not avaible unless you buy it over the internet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is a French device (I think it was French, because it was called "TV de Advance" or something similar) that lets you play a regular GBA on a TV.  It requires you to pull apart your GBA, but that shouldn't be anything too scary for a developer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

'de' is also a Japanese postposition which overlaps the meaning of Spanish and French 'de' somewhat, but because Spanish and French are VO (verb object) and Japanese is OV (object verb), the nouns separated by 'de' change places. What would be "FOO de BAR" in Spanish or French would usually be "BAR no FOO" or "BAR de FOO" in Japanese.
<br/>
<br/>
"TV de Advance" is probably the device you want, but it has a con: because of its cheap NTSC encoder that clock the pixel buffer and the color subcarrier off the same clock signal, it does compress the screen horizontally by about 10:11.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">or while we're at it, de in Chinese implies either ownership or an the application of an adjective.
<br/>
<br/>
So TV de Advance could be Chinese mean the Advance belonging to the TV.
<br/>
<br/>
Wardrich, that's the exact item I saw in a shop here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
