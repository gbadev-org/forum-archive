Actually, yes and no.  The Linux Kernel isn't going with it because Linus isn't going to switch, but all of the GNU tools (basically, a ton of crap that is just refered to as part of Linux even though it is <span style="font-style: italic">really</span> GNU/Linux) are going to V3.  And if I understand correct, any FSF "funded" project will also be going to V3.  So, unless a ton of people start writing GNU and FSF software replacements, the Linux kernel will be useless.
<br/>
<br/>
If in fact the FSF goes with V3, it will be known that they have went completely insane and will be the reason for their own demise.  Check out the information made available on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.linux-watch.com/news/NS5561540450.html" target="_blank">linux-watch.com</a> for a summary of the issues with V3 and what it's effects may have on the OSS community.  And why the major money providers to OSS will stop providing that money, as they have tons of patents at risk.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, it'll just be a kernel under GPL v2 with a userland under GPL v3. There's no problem with this, as Linus has agreed not to consider syscalls from user space to kernel space as "linking" per GPL v2. I develop <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/lj/" target="_blank">LOCKJAW</a> using GNU software (Coreutils, devkitARM GCC, devkitARM Binutils, MinGW GCC, and MinGW Binutils) under a proprietary kernel (NT 5), and even if Coreutils, GCC, and Binutils go to GPL v3, there's no problem due to the operating system exception in GPL v2 and in the GPL v3 draft that I read.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Except that if you are a large company, and half the the OS you want to run is under V3, what decision are you going to make?  1) get rid of it all, as there is to much risk toward your companies patents, cease spending money on any OSS projects. or 2) keep using it, hope that your don't lose your patents (which many companies create thousands of new patents every year) or violate some other half-baked idea the FSF came up with.
<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, any company that owns a patent will not use any V3'd software.  It's easy to say just fork it all, but it's not easy to do, as you have to double all the developers for every project the FSF makes V3 and any other project that some idiot decides to make V3.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem I see, is that big companies are spending lots of money on OSS development, and that is going to stop.  Do you think apache would be where it is today if it was just some kids working on it in their basement?  Same with MySQL.. these are professionally paid programmers working on this OSS and when that ends because the companies funding it gets kicked in the nuts by V3, who's going to fund these projects then?  Joe making $150,000 a year to write OSS isn't going to continue because he thinks it is fun.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Run GPL code and your code in separate programs. Per the "mere aggregation" clause of the GPL, separate programs on one hard drive do not bring your code under the GPL. I have both devkitARM and <span style="font-style: italic">Tetris Elements</span> installed on my PC, but the presence of devkitARM does not affect the licensing of <span style="font-style: italic">Tetris Elements</span>.

<br/>
Then don't distribute software that includes both your patented processes and someone else's GPL code. Only when a patented process and GPL code are combined into one Program does that specific patent become subject to GPL v2's implicit license and GPL v3's explicit covenant not to sue, and this covenant is limited to "essential patent claims", which the GPL v3 defines as follows:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Those suggestions might work for a mom and pop shop that registered a patent, but not for a billion dollar company with million dollar lawyers.  Keep in mind that every law and license is up for interpretation.  It's the lawyers job to make the judge agree with your interpretation.  If the judge doesn't, your in big trouble.
<br/>
<br/>
What I'm talking about is companies that spend lots of money on developing OSS, not just using it.  They are the reason some of the software used every day is to the point it is.  So I'm not talking about any propriatary software, I'm talking about patent owners creating OSS and funding OSS projects.  And if they sue to inforce a patent (which, I believe is required to maintain that patent), they violate V3.
<br/>
<br/>
So, let's just use Google for an example, as they spend money on funding OSS projects and I'm sure they own some patents as well.  Do you think V3 is a threat to Google?  Do you think it would be in Googles best interest to continue funding OSS projects?  Do you think it would be in their best interest to use OSS that may contain V3 licensed code?  Should a company the size of Google even put themselves at risk at all?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Heck NO!  That's like saying lawyers are good people..  :)  But, when you need one, they can be your best friend.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my point is that although everyone hates software patents, not all companies that have them are bad, or doing it to screw everyone (although there are companies that are).
<br/>
<br/>
But, there are companies that own software patents, yet sink tons of money into OSS.  And that, believe it or not, a lot of OSS projects are funded by companies with software patents.  If you restrict these companies from using OSS, they will stop funding OSS projects.  And like I said before, developers making good money aren't going to continue working on an OSS project because they think it's fun.
<br/>
<br/>
Attacking companies with software patents isn't going to resolve anything, nor stop them from registering more patents.  They would have a better chance forming a fund to buy software patents to make them available, or to not enforce them so they are desovled (if that in fact does happen, I know it does with trademarks, I'm not really sure with patents).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I might get money just by selling this stuff, but if a Chinese person really does it in a better way than I do it and for a lower price, then the Chinese way may be better (I would still like other people to be able to do it as well, though, it can't be left exclusively to the Chinese!). I might make profit, but not all of it. I am not the person to be greedy, I prefer to be fair, and do unto other as you would have them do unto you.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is nothing wrong with patents, liscenses, trademarks, etc.. They just need to have decent processes to keep them from getting to the point they are at.  So, complain about the processes (or lack of) and not the laws.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here is my take on patens, copyright and such things: On the one hand it is necessary to get companies to do research, as Lynx said. On the other hand it opens up the doors for people to think "What can we theorize about without ever having the intention to produce something, so that we can sue someone, who actually comes up with a functioning design of this."
<br/>
Patents do have a lifetime, so that they don't create indefinite monopolies, but eventually help out everybody.
<br/>
<br/>
A balance needs to be found that protects companies' investments and also gets rid of the leeches. Personally I liked the old system where the patent needs to have an inventive step. One click buying doesn't really have that in my layman's opinion and therefore shouldn't be patentable. Also, I would reduce the duration of copyright to the same duration of patents, namely 20 years. The duration of software patents should be significantly lower, as the generation change occurs earlier. A number that was discussed before was 5 years and I agree with that.

<br/>
Perhaps there could even be a rule that 10 years after publishing a commercial program the source code of that program has to be opened.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Optihut on Sat Feb 03, 2007 6:35 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Then you'd have no "commercial" programs, as companies would be getting sued for stealing code..  Right now, a closed source program can have all the stolen source it wants.  Once it's source was released, people would see it.
<br/>
<br/>
You know the people giving patents are like 80 years old and have probably never even touched a computer.  Good thing they have secretaries or we'd have to go to an office to search through all the paperwork.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just out of curiosity, how common is it for companies to actually steal other people's code? I would think it's a rare occurrence, but perhaps I am being too optimistic.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wikipedia lists two lawsuits launched by Apple against Microsoft, one in 1988 and one in 1995.

That was over copying elements of the user interface. Nowadays, the precedent in US case law (<a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_v._Borland" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: italic">Lotus v. Borland</span></a>) is that user interface elements are generally "functional" and not very copyrightable, leading to the use of patents and design patents instead.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
