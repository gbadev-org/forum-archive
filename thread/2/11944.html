It's his fault for giving up on his project because someone makes a stupid joke. The joke's not his fault, the getting upset and giving up is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Bottom line, homebrew devers are doing this become the like what they do.  When something that is basically a "hobby" becomes a hassle, it is no longer fun.  If it's no longer fun, why keep doing it?  Everyone makes their own decisions based on whatever they think and his decision should be accepted even if you personally don't like it.
<br/>
<br/>
It only takes one person (again, not refering to the blog post) to push people past the edge and it's easier to just quit than to deal with the stupidity.
<br/>
<br/>
Another example would be with LiraNuna and his #learn2d channel.  It didn't hurt anyone for him to do that, and he was only trying to help.. But, when he gets harrassed by an idiot or two, it's easy to not deal with them, as he's not really gaining anything by trying to help.  So, all the newbies that could have learned something from him are the ones that loose, the idiots didn't plan on learning anything anyway, just wanting try to start crap like they always do.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Something not entirely different happened to me while I was developing the PC predecessor to LOCKJAW: The Overdose in 2000. The developers of Tetripz, the DOS game that inspired TOD, called me a "lamer" for copying their idea. (It was resolved amicably when I agreed to include a credit for Mute Fantasies in the documentation for the PC version.)

This is one reason why we shouldn't attack people who develop competition to existing programs (e.g. MoonShell vs. Licks Media Player). If there is another organizer program for the DS, there's less incentive to take one's ball and go home and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?DissuadeReputation" target="_blank">DissuadeReputation</a> against people who exercise their rights under the GPL.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

We shouldn't attack people at all.  If you don't like it, don't use it.  If they are asking for feedback, and you provide positive feedback, that is one thing, but attacking the creator of something you received for FREE doesn't help anyone.  this vs. that is just stupid (meaning, attacking the author saying something else is better than theirs so they may as well just give up, kind of thing).  I mean.. I still use MightyMax's multiboot loader on my GBA MP.. Is Moonshell or DSOrgainze better?  Maybe, I like what I like and that's that.  Joe likes DSO better than Moonshell.. good for him, that's no reason to attack Moonshell.
<br/>
<br/>
Moonshell - Great!  keep up the good work
<br/>
DSO - Great! wish it was still alive
<br/>
Lynx's Compo Entry - Crap! Maybe, then don't use it!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
