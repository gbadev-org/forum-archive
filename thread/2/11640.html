    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there an emulator out there that can emulate the sound functions of the Super Gameboy enabled games? Everything I\'ve tried just does the palettes and the border, but doesn\'t have support for all of the little extras. I mainly want to see what it sounds like for some games I have that I\'m relatively certain have the sound features. (I\'ve heard recordings.) Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried nocash to no avail. The graphics functions work great, the sound functions do not work great. I know that it uses the super nintendo\'s sound banks, so maybe there\'s a way to get a ROM of the super gameboy, and then mount the gameboy ROM onto it? I\'m not so sure that will work, because I think the super gameboy had real GB hardware...<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">incorporate an entire gb emulator into a snes emulator. or a snes sound processing unit and a little bit of a snes emulator into a gb emulator.
<br/>
<br/>
*giggles*
<br/>
<br/>
or just get a super gameboy and gb game off ebay for $20? it's 100% more likely to happen then the marriage of a snes and gb emu that does super gb/snes integrated stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nah, I see his point. VBA emulates them separately. It sets the flag for GBC on GBA, but that\'s about it. You would need to make something special for this I\'m afraid, and I\'m going to have enough trouble with my emulator getting code to run at all for now. I\'ll consider inplementing it though.
