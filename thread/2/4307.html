    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't help you there, but I can tell you I haven't even seen an emulator that supports the comms port, wireless or not.  Doesn't mean it doesn't exist, but it does suggest that since the more popular AGB emulator VisualBoy Advance doesn't support it, it's not very likely.
<br/>
<br/>
But good luck on your hunt!  Let us know if you find one, I'm sure several people would love to get it!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Er, I mean... I didn't know no$ had a free GBA emu.  Last I checked (which, mind you, was probably a year ago), you had to pay big bucks for the no$gba debugger and there was no free version.  Guess I need to keep track a little better...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
