    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys, I am in the process of writing a browser-based RPG for my website and I was wondering if any of you would be interested in helping out with some testing. I have a working game engine with some things to work out still, but the game is playable. The UI is pretty clunky, but it is just for testing, the final UI will be much nicer. 
<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for about 10 - 15 testers for now, please emial me at "bob at landofbob dot com" with some info about your background and I will choose from there!
<br/>
<br/>
