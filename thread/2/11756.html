That's good, but I don't think anyone actually uses a real NES system anymore, just emulators<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You are right. Good for check for full compatibility. But I run homebrew NES software on the emulators.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Bananmos of nesdev.com's board shares your view. But the problem with this is that people who play games on PC expect 3D graphics. Some people develop for NES because they prefer the 2D style, or because they have team members who can draw 2D cels but cannot make 3D models, or because it's easier to pull off a meaningful 16400 byte demo on an NES than on Windows.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Not true. I play several 2d PC games. Some examples are <a class="postlink" href="http://www.soldat.pl/" target="_blank">Soldat</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://gusanos.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Liero</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ufoot.org/liquidwar/v5" target="_blank">Liquid War</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/windows/rr_e.html" target="_blank">rRootage</a>. Soldat is especially popular at lan parties. Oh, lets not forget the 2d <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_%28computer_game%29" target="_blank">Worms</a> games. Those are insanely popular, and many people prefer the 2d versions over the 3d ones. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gunbound.com/" target="_blank">Gunbound</a> deserves a mention as well.
<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I do agree that 2d games are a small fraction of all the pc games played, but it can't be ignored. Soldat has a big following, and almost everyone (at least around here) has played Liero some time in their life.
<br/>
<br/>
The real question is, will your game be more funny if it runs in a NES emulator or natively? Actually, that isn't the only question. Will it be more technically challenging to make a game for the NES than for the PC? If that's your biggest concern, I fully understand wanting to make games for the NES. Programming 6502 assembly for the NES is vastly different compared to C++ for the PC.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<a class="postlink" href="http://www.manifestogames.com/" target="_blank">Manifesto games</a> has a lot of 2D games.  They are operating under the assumption that there is money in <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail" target="_blank">the long tail</a> video game market, ie lower budget games.  Many 2D games would fall into this category.
<br/>
<br/>
So far as I can tell, there is gap of games that are not being made.  Cell phone game budgets went up to about $50k, last time I checked.  DS games are probably at about $1m+, low budget games probably start at $500k.  Console games are said to be at $15m~$20m.  Advergames and the like are at the very low end of the scale.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess there might be two gaps... the $50k~$500k gap and the $1m~15m (closer to $3m ~ $10m?) gap.  There might be another gap between web/advergames and cellphone games.
<br/>
<br/>
The $50k~$500k range actually strikes me as the most interesting place to be as a developer.  A high quality 2D game probably lives somewhere in the $100k~$1m range, depending on what your scope is.  (You can always spend more.)
