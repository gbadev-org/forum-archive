    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys, just thought I'd share the wealth, so to speak, with those of you who haven't already stumbled upon <a href="http://www.cheapassgamer.com." target="_blank">www.cheapassgamer.com.</a>  The main part of the site is a forum where people post deals on video games.  A lot of stores like Best Buy and Circuit City have clearanced out games on multiple occasions this past year for as little as $5.00 each, and there's usually advance notice of what a lot of stores will have on sale in their weekly flyers.  I know this sounds like a spammy advertisement, but the majority of the forum-goers here are pretty cool and I wanted to spread the word.  Nowadays I buy more games than I have time to play (it's a horrible habit, I know), and this site has help me keep the costs down, at least.  Okay, no, that's a lie, I probably spend more now than I did before.  But I'm getting so much more for my money, it's worth it. =D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
