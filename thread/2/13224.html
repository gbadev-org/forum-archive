    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi!
<br/>
i was just curious about how old gb games are run on the gba? anything pre gba used a z80, is that right? so does the gba emulate a z80?
<br/>
thanks in advance for any answer!
<br/>
greetings!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I remember correctly, the GBA actually contains the hardware of a GBC as well. When you put a GB/C cartridge in the GBA it pushes a switch in the slot that changes it from GBA to GBC mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">a-ha. thanks! so it's more like the ps2 having the ps1 processor (as an i/o processor) that runs the games in ps1 mode. (ps3 is rumored to have a "whole" ps2 inside, because the emulation software has not been ready when the hardware was being finalized.)

:^) duh! i just checked and it really contains a z80! boy! now that's why the nds (as well as the gba micro!) won't run pre-gba games (although it could emulate them!) - it abandoned the z80.
