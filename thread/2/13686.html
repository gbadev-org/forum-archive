    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Believe it or not, I am actually enrolled at Digipen Institute of Technology. (That fancy school Nintendo recommended to me. Well sort of...) I will get to see first hand if it's any good at all. Considering that you spend all 4 years working on various game projects, it should prove to be lots of fun.
<br/>
<br/>
My major is a Bachelor of Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation. Basically, the nitty-gritty of programming a game, and all of the physics and mathematical theories involved in making games work. Considering that this community helped me to program my very first project, and I have since muuuch improved in skill over the years, I think I can get a lot more out of this school than most, mainly because I already have a good idea of what to expect. (Assembly is not taught until third year, and I already understand it quite well. o.O)
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think. I'm going to Redmond this week to visit and get situated. (I've already enrolled and payed the fees, it's a done deal.) I'm considering keeping y'all well informed, as I may need some help in specific areas. (mainly classes and encapsulation, because I firmly believe that they are spawn of satan.) 
<br/>
<br/>
Happy!

<br/>
Last year ( or was it the year before that) they got GCN devkits from Nintendo to give students a chance to develop.... I forget the rest. I forget how they are working with Nintendoi again.
<br/>
<br/>
I told my college advisor about Digipen and it she said it was proprietary school. Meaning a school that makes more profit then teaches like Gibbs or art istitute.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I really wanted to go "Savannah College of Art and Design" where one my favorite idol artists Michael Poe went. However things did not pan out that way.
<br/>
<br/>
That is great your going to go digipen. I wish you the best of luck in your success and that we meet not in the cross roads of life but the feild where dreams and hopes is born.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.
