    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I just found out about this watch coming out from fossil that uses Pam OS and has all these cool features that sound awesome.
<br/>
The fact that really caught my eye was that it plays all Palm OS Programs. This means emulators. Gameboy On Wristwatch!
<br/>
Gives a new Spin on the idea of the old nintendo Game &amp; Watch!
<br/>
It might play at low speeds, but hey, think about it. 
<br/>
Zelda on your wrist,
<br/>
Mario on your wrist,
<br/>
Anything on your wrist!
<br/>
It's possible now.
<br/>
Anyone up for developing a new Palm OS GB Emulator?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have you visited the palm site?
<br/>
or did a search for a palm os gb emulator,
<br/>
because there already out there,
<br/>
but sure someone could right one for the gba,
<br/>
which probably isn't available on palm os yet
<br/>
(correct me if i am wrong)
<br/>
<br/>
but why play on a watch? If i have a gba with a bigger screen?<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
