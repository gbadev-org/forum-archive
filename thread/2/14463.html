Yes, I'm afraid so.
<br/>
<br/>
I find the phase "extremely buggy and rather limited in capability" to be rather exaggerated.
<br/>
<br/>
Every one of the commercial GBC developers I knew who used no$gmb was *extremely* happy with it. Many of us tracked bugs that would have been impossible to debug without the aid of no$gmb.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not even sure why you choose to complain so loudly about it either. Are you deliberately setting out to try to tarnish Martin's reputation?

    <h4>#144650 - HyperHacker - Mon Nov 05, 2007 11:02 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just wanted to know why so many people praise No$GMB without any mention of the numerous bugs. It's been a while since I've used it but here's what I can recall off the top of my head:
<br/>
-Failure to handle spaces in paths in some places. Loading a file from F:\Games\Game Boy actually creates the directory F:\Games\Game for some reason.
<br/>
-When tracing, it leaks memory until eventually the interface breaks, drawing in the wrong place, with the wrong font, etc.
<br/>
-Every now and then - often after installing Visual Studio - it will just stop working entirely until I put it in Windows 98 Compatibility Mode, or take it out if it already was.
<br/>
-Trying to put a breakpoint on code in RAM crashes the program.
<br/>
-I have never been able to get it to load ROMs from the command line. At best it will try and say file not found. Only loading from within the program works.
<br/>
-Gameshark codes often just don't do anything. It's not that the codes are broken - sometimes they work, and they're just fine in other emulators and real hardware.
<br/>
-Print Screen is hardwired to save a screenshot, but doesn't override the default behaviour assigned by Windows, so every time you take a screenshot of the game, your clipboard is replaced by a shot of the entire screen.
<br/>
Does nobody else have these problems? Indeed it's a great program, but with so many bugs, it gets to be a pain to use. I just find it difficult to believe that either nobody else has these problems, or they never bother to mention them.
<br/>
<br/>
As for "limited in capability", the biggest issue was not being able to break on reads, only on writes. IIRC breakpoints on I/O registers didn't work either, and there was no support for the GBC I/R port. You also couldn't use anything but the ASCII character set in the memory viewer, which was a pain because Game Boy games rarely used ASCII. Having the memory viewer update while the game runs, instead of only when it stops, was another thing I yearned for. Yeah, it's powerful, but I so often found myself wondering "why doesn't it support this?"
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, No$GBA is certainly better in both of these aspects, having fixed most of the bugs and added more features than you'd ever need.

Your game could have used the workaround used by several NES Mega Man games: store Latin strings as ASCII in ROM, then translate them to whatever Latin encoding the game uses when displaying them. Or are you talking about kana encodings?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

As compared to what?!?  The POS Hardware that Nintendo supplied?  LOL!  That thing sucked so bad.  Before we had no$, we were literally doing printf / crash the game on purpose to view state type debugging.  That emulator made us x100 more productive.  Hell, without it, we wouldn't have been able to do any of the cool scanline tricks we came up with.  The only limitations we consistently ran into were the fact it only supported 256 colors so some of our hi-color images looked funny, it didn't 100% emulate the failures that occured during serial communications, and if you set a break-point in a RAM area, it could screw with game execution.  It offered soooo much more though.  Exceptions, breaks to memory read/rights conditional, the vram viewer, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
No$ advanced the state of the art of GB/GBC development.  Look at some of the crap we did in Harry Potter Chamber of Secrets some time for some crazy ideas.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, it has bugs.  No, I do not find that limiting.  It was not "extremely" debugging nor rather limited IMO.  It vastly expanded what I could do on GBC for next to nothing in cost.  Same for No$GBA, but not quite to the same extent.  No$ for the DS is still a bit too early in development for me to throw away my hardware debugger there yet, though I have no doubt that it will within a year.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just starting out in GB development and have used no$gmb (the free version) for a couple things. Only came across a couple of those bugs myself, most notably the tracing memory leak. That and the RAM breakpoint bug are the only ones that would bother me really, but then again I'm still inexperienced.
<br/>
<br/>
@stampede_dude: I'm using the win32 version right now. Do you know if the DOS version of the <span style="text-decoration: underline">debugger</span> doesn't have these bugs?
<br/>
<br/>
What other GB debuggers are there? I know of BGB... how does that compare to no$gmb?
<br/>
<br/>
HH, are you capable of coding your own debugger? It seems like it might be a good project related to Game Boy development.
<br/>
<br/>
And tepples, I stick with the DMG/CGB as a hobby. As I understand it there's a much larger difference between CGB/AGB ASM than between NES/SNES ASM, after all -- yet people still do NES dev. Right now I have little interest in AGB coding, though that may change (and it's really not a big deal).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
