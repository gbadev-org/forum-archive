    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">These things really bug me. The threads where you have a gazillion pages, about a particular app. It defeats the whole purpose of having a forum in the first place, of being able to make separate threads, with different topics, for easy browsing.
<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is once a thread hits 10 pages, forum.gbadev.org should offer them to make a small sub-forum. It doesn't have to be visible from the main page, so as to not clutter things up. 
<br/>
I'm thinking we need forums like:
<br/>
moonshell (15 pgs)
<br/>
beup (67 pgs!!)
<br/>
ndsmail (31 pgs)
<br/>
nitrotracker (23 pgs)
<br/>
and so on.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather have 10 forums with  20 posts each, then 10 posts with 20 pages each.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree. A huge thread becomes a pain to read through, and information is most likely repeated over and over (I don't know, I don't have the patience to read through them).

<br/>
Little sub forums would be way better.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, beup would be around 87 pages, but tepples divided it twice before. Plus a World Cup spinoff. I must agree it's partly my fault, because I put all releases there instead of in individual threads, like DSFTP. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure subforums would be an appropiate solution, I'd go for more active division in multiple threads.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://akzeac.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://akzeac.blogspot.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">but for beup, if we were to split it up, it may become like 20 or even more posts. some people might not be interested in beup, and not want them to clutter up the forum.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That would help out a lot, especially since the dsdev site is not blocked here. (gbadev is, and the \"dsdev forums\" are the gbadev forums, so...
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to set up a forums section devoted to nothing but gbadev and dsdev projects. That way, we could have an \"Announce your Projects\" section here that pointed to a section over there for more specific info like updates. That would certainly clear the clutter from the game design section and leave it open to say logic problems, as opposed to the project announcing section that it\'s sort of become.
<br/>
<br/>
My problem here is that I do not know how to set up a forums site. Is it easy enough to do with limited experience? I am learning how to work with and write php scripts...
