    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Anyone know how to get your game/demo announced on the front page?  I emailed <a href="mailto:news@gbadev.org">news@gbadev.org</a> a month ago, but that didn't seem to do it...

<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks Simon!  I saw that you were on vacation, so I wasn't sure whether I should just keep waiting, or whether to email you again...but didn't want to spam you if you were planning on getting around to it :)
<br/>
<br/>
I'll shoot you an email.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What I can do on my server (provided by one.com - others may vary), is get a list of referrers to files and directories.
<br/>
That's how I keep track of how popular my site is (not really - which is totally ok with me :^D ) and where my stuff has been covered and linked from. ;^)
<br/>
Of course, that only works when you have your own server (even a virtual one will do, as long as the software is installed and properly configured by the provider.) :^\
<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess, the folks at gbadev.org could also do that (if their list is longer than mine... which is quite short - around 30 "top" entries, non configurable), but I don't think I *would* actually do it, because that would potentially generate mass requests of the same kind. ;^)
