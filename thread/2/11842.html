Compared to consoles, PCs have very few multiplayer games that allow more than one player per machine. Players are expected to buy multiple PCs and put them in a LAN. Dare to compare:
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">PC:</span> Four players on one game, $2500 for four PCs plus $160 for four copies of the game with unique CD keys = $2660
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Wii:</span> Four players on one game, $350 for console (even at inflated eBay pricing) plus $500 for decent size TV plus $50 for game plus $180 for three extra controllers = $1080
<br/>
<br/>
Your eMachines PC has a DVD plus-dash burner, but it has no Blu-ray Disc player. As of right now, the PLAYSTATION 3 console is the cheapest Blu-ray Disc player, which is a bonus for Hollywood movie fanatics.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

That's awesome.. how often do you have 3 other people over to play games with you?  And how big is your living room to have 4 people swinging remotes around without knocking each other out?  Anyway, I was just showing what $600 will get you for a PC.. if you want to do the same comparison, you have to be more resonable.. You can get a decent machine that will play most games available for around $300-400 with an LCD monitor.  Sure, it won't be HD or at 1024x768 (or maybe it will).. but neither is the Wii..    Also, many multiplayer PC games only require one purchased CD for multiplayer play or one CD for up to 4 network players.  And what if you want  to play a 32 or 64 player 3d shooter?  Does the Wii support that?  Oh.. and I'd love to see 4 player Red Alert on any console..  It's bad enough you can see what screens your opponent is picking on football games.  Sure, you don't know the exact play, but you can narrow it down.
<br/>
<br/>
So, PC: 4 computers = $1,400 + $40 game (or free with online games like RTCW:ET) + $20 hub = $1,460
<br/>
<br/>
I can only imagine how much "more" fun 4 people could have by spending the extra $380.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, before we end up comparing all kinds of stuff.. the Wii seems to be the only console that want's to do <span style="font-weight: bold">it's</span> job.. and that is be a gaming console.

That's true, but neither does the Wii.. which is why I'm confused you even brought the Wii up..  Anyway..  Funny how the company that is "brute forcing" the Blu-ray standard just happens to sell the cheapest Blu-ray player..  I wonder how much the PS3 could have been if they didn't put the Blu-ray drive in it?
<br/>
<br/>
But, let's talk HD content instead of an "up and coming?" potential HD standard..  How much would I have to spend on a PC that can do the following:
<br/>
<br/>
Hook up to a TV using HD
<br/>
Play HD content (whatever codec/media)
<br/>
Do all your standard internet stuff
<br/>
Let you write term papers on it
<br/>
Let you play thousands of free downloadable games
<br/>
Let you run thousands of free downloadable apps
<br/>
blah blah blah.. The list could go on and on ... and on..
<br/>
<br/>
Hell, you can buy a used car for $600.. can the PS3 take you to the mall? ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Point being, bang for the buck.  Sure, a stand alone Blu-ray player may be $1,000 and if you buy a PS3 just for the Blu-ray player then you save $400 and good for you..  But aside from one very small feature (being that I think we are talking about gaming, not watching movies) the 3Ghz PC for the same price is just a "smarter" purchase.  But, being that we are spoon fed what to think by the media, people are willing to spend anything on a "toy"..  Or maybe I'm just to old and think $600 is a lot of money.[/b]<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In Japan, many people bought PS2s for the DVD playing facility.  Sony is trying to recreate that effect.  The market seems artificial and I don't think it will work.  I don't want a Blu-ray disc player.  I could be wrong.

I doubt it.  $600 is a lot of money.  Depending on where you live, $600 pays the rent.
<br/>
<br/>
Sony was the default choice.  If they had just made a game console, then they probably would have been gamers number one choice.  Somehow they managed to price themselves out of the top spot.  At least, that is what I think.

Now this one I can totally plead "to old"..  But, that is true.. Kinda like with GTA, I almost bought a PS2 just to get that game.. but, was able to hold off the extra 6 months or so to pick it up for PC instead.

I'm pretty sure DVD players were more expensive than that at the time.  I distinctly remember reading people who justified their purchase with the idea of "well, think of it as a $150 game player and a $150 DVD player, so you're getting a good deal on both of them"

True, there exist genres that don't work well on consoles due to technical limitations. But is there a technical reason that the traditionally console-only genres can't work on a home theater PC? Or is it just politics?

Friends!!! I never bought my GC to play it everyday, so every couple of months for about an hour when my cousins come round to play with my little brother and sister they bring smash bros and I kick their butts on it. And every once in a while I play my dad at soul calibur and other people on ISS.

Maybe in the school days it was more often that there would be more than 4 people in a room who would be willing to play games.
