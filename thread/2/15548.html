<br/>
<br/>
since this is the only forum i'm registered with, i'll post my question here and i'll hope someone will know the answer.
<br/>
ok, here we go.
<br/>
<br/>
i want to add gamepad / joystick support to my PC (currently win32 only) framework. i know how to interface the controller etc. (via Windows Multimedia), but what i couldn't find information about how to utilize the force feedback (a.k.a. rumble) functionality of some products.
<br/>
<br/>
i know it's possible to do it with DirectInput, but i'd rather like to not deal with DirectX (although i could do it easily, i have all the resources needed available)... it's just a matter of "taste", you know. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
so, if anyone knows where i could find some info (i've already googled, wikied, MSDN'ed and whatnot, but didn't find any usable information, that wasn't DI related), i'd be happy to read about it.
<br/>
<br/>
as always, thanks in advance! :^D<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released
