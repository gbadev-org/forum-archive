So, what do you guys think? I am somewhat interested and excited to see what happens. Do you guys think it is likely that Nintendo will ever open up development of DSi apps for independent developers to release their software in the way Apple has with the iPhone? Due to how Nintendo seems to handle things like this, I personally doubt it, but a man can dream.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I suspect Nintendo is even more draconic.

Anyway, it's certainly looking like the process is similar to the WiiWare process, from... things... I've heard. I do wish they'd make it into a more open market for developers, at least as open as Apple has (despite all the complaining I can do about the way Apple does things.)
<br/>
<br/>
BRP's article (unsurprisingly) doesn't go into the proportion of licensing costs or anything like that. I'd like to see them make DSiWare more attractive for developers than paying for carts. Any indy dev blog about a DS title will make some mention about how surprisingly expensive the carts are.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I may write some apps for the Storm when that store comes out, but it uses java as well and I am not the biggest fan, though it has its uses.

Interesting news. However, I was kinda hoping that they would have gone all out with a version of the Wii's VC for the DSi with titles from consoles that we believe can be ran on the portable (obviously the N64 is out of the question). Maybe they still will.
<br/>
<br/>
The fact that they announced being able to play GBA games on the DSi via SD card makes me wonder about what's under the hood. You think that the only thing removed from the DSi in terms of GBA hardware is just the slot for it? That perhaps the GBA mode still exists? And what about transfer rates on the SD slot? I have my doubts for GBA games to be running straight from them like a normal cartridge, and not being pre-loaded into the RAM (or into the flash memory). If pre-loaded into RAM (not flash memory), then I would assume that titles 15MB and under would only be allowed.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Knowing Nintendo, the decision is a bid to see what catches on. In that sense, I would think that they didn't do any more damage than removing slot-2, but I suspect they probably didn't do too much to help besides the RAM, which I believe they needed anyway for other things.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping we get a lot out of DSiWare, though (publicly) Nintendo's pushing smaller scale stuff from that direction (with the exception of the GB/C/A stuff... mixed messages.) I can't help but come back to the thought that DSiWare is an excellent escape from the cost of carts, and developers ought to like that. The SD slot is obviously SDHC, so it's not like storage is a real concern.
<br/>
<br/>
So who knows what Nintendo will do? I sometimes get frustrated when they don't do enough, but once in a while I remember that they do a lot of experimenting and some things simply never come to fruition.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Heya Brendan,
<br/>
<br/>
Not to hijack the thread, but...
<br/>
<br/>
The Android SDK integrates nicely with the Eclipse java dev environment. I've been mucking with it and it's totally awesome, but I haven't actually published a game to the marketplace yet. Probably the biggest barrier to real development is getting the hardware, which costs something like $500 for a "carrier neutral" phone. (The SDK has a nice emulator, but we all know that hardware testing is the way to go...)
<br/>
<br/>
There is no approval barrier for the Google store, but it costs $25 or something to join, and then I've read (but not confirmed) that there's a 30% "processing fee", so if that's true then in that regard it's no better than Apple.
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, there are way more iPhones than android phones, but analysts expect that to change in coming years. Personally, I think that there's an opportunity for small companies to get in on Android now, make a name for themselves while the market is young, and do well down the road, but I haven't yet heard any developer success stories like have been on the iPhone.
<br/>

Yes, I downloaded the SDK and mucked around with it for a bit.  My biggest gripe is that it is Java.  I was hoping to tie Lua to a project.  Not that there are not Java compatible scripting languages out there.

Hardware testing is the way to go, but you don't need the hardware right away.  And price aside, the DSi and iPhone basically fall into the same basket.

<br/>
The approval barrier could be a hassle to think about for a small outfit.  I have read that it can take months for even simple applications to be approved.  FWIW, Apple's approval provides the illusion of security for people who do not care to research before they buy.

<br/>
I agree with the analysts.  If you are looking for pioneer advantage, Google is the place to be.  Not only is Google huge with a corporate culture that encourages staying with the times, but I think Google's easy registration system is the correct way of doing things.  I expect it to catch on.  Who knows, maybe the price of hardware will go down eventually.

The first one looks promising, as it is a native Java implementation - but says it is J2ME only. That may work in its favour if you can get it to compile on the not-really-Java Android.

I found that one.  The native app tool chain for the first phone is out, but I suspect that one may give up some portability by using it.  Also, I'm not sure how one would go about accessing things like the GPS without going through the Java API.
