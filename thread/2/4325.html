<br/>
With the DS supposably able to go online, and certain games were created in a way that they'd have level editors and similar things, how cool would it be if the UCD you create could be transfered onto your computer, or onto the internet for other people to download? The ultimate trading and gaming experience! Plus the 2 screens and touch-screen would come in handy for the editors. Although it would be a great idea, you'd have to be by a WIFI connection whenever you wanted to reload UCD for a game. That is where the GBA cart slot could be useful if a storage device were attached to it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps my mind has too much sugar injected into it (dang Halloween candy!), but I think it is a cool idea.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nope. That would likely enable GBA game piracy unless they figured out a way to make it non-bootable.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think he's talking more about a GBA-HD, for storage only.  Another way you could do it (I don't know how, but it's a theory) is to have not a cartridge, but a device attached.  It would check a certain area of the DS's memory, and record data when certain conditions are met.  That way, the DS doesn't actually write data to the cart-thingy, it reads it my itself and writes it to itself.  This would also allow for non-bootableness as long as one of the conditions is that it is in a DS running the UCD software.  (I like that... UCD... good one!)

I dunno if it's plausible, or even possible, or even worth it, but hey that's what the smart people are there for.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks for clarifying. Something just to use as storage, but with obvious limitations.
<br/>
However, like a HD, it would have a kind of file-system (like a memory card), in which each file refers to a certain game. Each file would have a header filled with what game it was created from, the type of UCD it is (level, weapon, etc), and etc. Plus, there could be a program on the storage device that will allow for transmitting of the UCDs to and from a computer or whatever online interface that Nintendo or whoever is cooking up.

This just goes to show that I'm really into making stuff for existing games.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think I see even more of what you're planning.  I think that would be awesome!
<br/>
<br/>
Imagine, being in a Warcraft type game, and actually using the stylus to take a peice of hot metal, and pounding it into a weapon.  It could be rendered in 3D, then transformed into a 2D animation, stored on the UCD-HDD, and/or transferred to other DS/Online/Computer for storage, or to people you're playing against.  Making your own flag, even recording your own voices!
<br/>
<br/>
I gotta say, you've just taken the new features of the DS to a new level with one simple idea.  My goodness, I can't wait until the DS is cracked and all this becomes reality!  (Or at least, CAN be reality... I wouldn't put it past Nintendo or one of the major 3rd parties to do something similar...  probably just online stuff though... pity)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
