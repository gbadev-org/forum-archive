    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Im a gba user who just getting interested in other uses for my gba and was wondering if there is any possibility of connecting a GBA to a hard drive mp3 player, the reason being that my mp3 (40gb) can store any file type, text, pics, movies ect and I thought how good it would be to store movies, pics, roms ect on my mp3 player - connect it to my gba (with flash card) and stream movies over somehow or pick from thousand of roms on the move.
<br/>
<br/>
Everyone I've spoken to says it cant be done but I live in hope.
<br/>
