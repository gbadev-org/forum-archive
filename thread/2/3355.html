You have to expect some of that when literally thousands of people visit the site each day. I do agree, though, these forums are much cleaner.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

None taken :P

I agree, though, it's not perfect. But it's the end-all be-all of game development. Ask a question on just about and you get <span style="font-style: italic">some</span> sort of answer within 10-30 minutes.

The group here is absolutely great, don't get me wrong. I love you guys and I whole-heartedly agree that it's a much cleaner forum. However I am a little surprised to see so few people visit GDNet frequently, if for nothing more than the broad range of capabilities the forum crawlers there possess.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">When you find yourself in the company of a halfling and an ill-tempered Dragon, remember, you do not have to outrun the Dragon... </span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think few people visit gamedev.net around here because all of us pretty much know how to write a game on some platform. It's just that writing one on the GBA is what eludes us.
<br/>
<br/>
And these forums are free of VERY beginner C/C++ programmers. The semi-colon and binay logic problem doesn't appear as much here as it does in my first year C++ class, of which I am glad.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">gamedev.net never really was my cup of tea. I couldn't get much exited about yet another scripting language or image library. I used to check <a href="http://www.flipcode.com" target="_blank">www.flipcode.com</a> every day but it seems kinda dead now except for the Image Of The Day. 
<br/>
I think the only thing I've ever used gamedev.net for was for a Direct Sound tutorial, and more advanced programming related articles I can't find on gamedev, which seems to be focused on beginners (correct me if I'm wrong).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
