    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think a panel de pon clone game should be made with some more functions, possibly:<ul>
<br/>
<li>Level up to 9999 (level 99 is still too slow)
<br/>
</li><li>Screen spins like in Rotris, or moves like in Tetanus on Drugs
<br/>
</li><li>A ball bounces around the screen, bouncing off the blocks and the sides and top. If the ball falls off the bottom you lose, and if the ball hits the cursor, it goes through but it also makes it you can't move for a few seconds (and possibly, within that time, the blocks will reach the top or the ball will fall off the bottom)
<br/>
</li><li>Any combination of the above.
<br/>
</li></ul>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The main problem with making a PdP remake is that, much like with Tetris, getting the "official" physics working on an authentic level is rather difficult, especially since each official PdP-style game tends to have different physics as it is.  Things like the number of frames it takes to swap two panels, amount of time to hover before falling, amount of time it takes for three blocks to clear before the blocks above fall, etc.  This is a game based entirely on timing, and so expert users of the official versions can easily get frustrated when they cannot pull off the same tricks in the clones.  TettattDS comes remarkably close, though it still is not entirely authentic compared to the original PdP.
<br/>
<br/>
As for other suggestions, user-customizable blocks would be pretty interesting.  Perhaps add some more interaction with whatever character is sitting off on the side.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It wouldn't be quite as difficult if tetrisattack.net had some pages that document the PdP physics as well as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tetrisconcept.com/wiki/" target="_blank">tetrisconcept.com</a> documents the Tetris physics.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
The trouble is that if you can configure <span style="font-style: italic">everything</span>, then there are billions of different modes. I'd estimate at least a few trillion combinations in Lockjaw alone. Nobody has the space for billions of high score tables, or even the time to look through the 200 high score tables that you actually have an entry in. But a game could define a "mode" as a specific combination of settings (e.g. "like NES Tetris" or "like Tetris The Grand Master" or "like Tetris DS"), allow the player to choose to play either a regulation mode or custom settings, and then not track high scores for any combination of settings that isn't one of the regulation modes.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
