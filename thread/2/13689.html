    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I want to connect a Wii to my LCD monitor because it's bigger then my TV. I found <span style="font-weight: bold">[URL removed by MOD]</span> converter that should work. I was wondering if there is something cheaper. Then I found <span style="font-weight: bold">[URL removed by MOD]</span> but I'm not sure if it's going to work. Can somebody with more technical knowledges in the video signals and cable help me figured out what i need. It also need to have stereo out.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Your converter should be able to do the trick, just make sure it's designed to go from VGA to RCA (vga = monitor, rca = TV/VCR red white and yellow things) and not the other way around, as the other way around is a lot more common of a use for such a converter. (silly people trying to hook a computer up to a TV...)
<br/>
<br/>
As for the sound, you'll probably need a separate converter if you plan to use your PC speakers. Or you can do what I did and run it directly to your stereo. (I say this because most computer monitors do not support sound input through the VGA monitor cable, it's pretty much there for video and nothing else.) You can get something that will convert the Red/White audio cables into a 3.5 mm headphone jack at radio shack. It's a rather useful thing to have actually, I have two.
<br/>
<br/>
It would really help if we knew what converter you were looking at specifically, you haven't given us a very good description of it. (A brand name or model number usually helps a bit, or perhaps a picture.) Someone else here might be able to give out some more pointers too, this is just general advice here.

#1 will work. It is a Component video (YPbPr) to VGA converter. That means that, as a bonus, it will let you use your monitor with any device that outputs in component video (e.g. a good DVD player). This product also seems to have substance behind the price - you won't have to buy component cables separately.

You can later use these component cables, when you get a big expensive TV with progressive scan, etc. ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
#2 will not work. If you click the Enlarge picture (on the Divineo website, which apparently I'm not allowed to link), you will see it only has 4 inputs, which are the proprietary Xbox, PS, and GC cables (the 4th is a mystery to me). AFAIK, the Wii output cable is not the same as the GC cable (correct me if I'm wrong).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, #1 only outputs in VGA. #2 has outputs for VGA, composite, and S-video. Neither have DVI output which I prefer for LCDs, but as long as your LCD monitor has VGA input it's fine.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 10px; line-height: normal">DS Lite white, R4DS, 1GB Kingmax microSD</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't even own a separate TV; I used to have an ATI All-in-Wonder that I used to watch TV through my computer. It also served all my audio/video input needs, so I never needed one of these converters that naleksiev is looking at ;-).

Actually you've got it backwards. You want <span style="font-weight: bold">X to VGA</span>, *not* VGA to X. And using a RCA cable as input (X) is the worst choice in terms of video quality. RCA = composite video (1 wire) + stereo audio. In terms of quality, composite &lt; S-Video &lt; component/YPbPr (3 wires). Fortunately, neither of those products go through composite.

*smacks forehead* That's because there IS no audio signal on a VGA cable.... ... 'V' stands for... oh forget it.

This is what I recommend as well. The cable is extremely simple and can be used in either direction.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 10px; line-height: normal">DS Lite white, R4DS, 1GB Kingmax microSD</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you do this, I would recommend putting it through the line-in on your computer, or at least hook it up to PC speakers that have a volume dial directly on them. I tried to do the above to use headphones with my TV, taking the RCA audio signal directly from my DVD Player/Wii. Besides there being no volume control, I got all kinds of weird interference, high frequency sounds on the Wii were buzzy, and menu functions and chapter skipping on my DVD player made weird beeps of feedback.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Technically, #2 could be the best solution if you are looking for low price. You could take it apart and solder a composite socket on there. Of course you would need to find the pinout for the gc, xbox, or ps but it SHOULD still work if you want to put a little effort into it. I am actually thinking about doing the same as I do not have $100 to spend</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
