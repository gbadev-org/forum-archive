<br/>
<br/>
I've been toying with the idea of attempting the impossible task of a SNES emulator for the GBA... however realised that since I have only a few months GBA programming experience and no SNES experience at all that this probably wasn't the best idea for my first major project *lol*
<br/>
<br/>
So then I though, why not port an existing game? Possibly my all time favorite SNES game would have to be Final Fantasy 6, so I'm considering attempting to port it over to the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
My question basically is does anyone know where I could get the graphics used in the game as well as a script from the game? (The sound I believe I can get in the form of midi files, but if anyone has any other suggestions about it, this would be greatly appreciated).
<br/>
<br/>
I'm aware of the fact that this probably isn't entirely legal in terms of actually releasing a game :) However it is mainly designed to be a learning experience... as well as a way to get this great game onto the GBA!
<br/>

<br/>
Anyway, open up the FF6 ROM in a tile/sprite editor.
<br/>
<br/>
It's up to you to rip the FF6 ROM, but you can find tile editors at <a href="http://www.zophar.net" target="_blank">http://www.zophar.net</a><br/>_________________<br/>Out of Order.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the reply. Yes, it's a difficult task, however my primary focus is basically the engine behind it. I need a game to model around it as I test it, so I figured I might as well use something decent for it :)
<br/>
<br/>
Basically I'm working on the spec for a tiling engine for GBA. Not much at this point, mainly conceptual, however I've made similar things on PC, so hopefully won't be overly difficult... hopefully *lol*
