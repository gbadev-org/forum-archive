It's a turn-based fighting game where you control your characters by moving limbs with the mouse.
<br/>
(Turn-based, remember - not like Ragdoll Kung-Fu in the slightest!).
<br/>
<br/>
You know what I'm thinking ;)
<br/>
I unfortunately am not ignorant enough to request that someone do what I'm thinking.
<br/>
It would be difficult to make, too; there is a lot more behind this game than it seems at first glance.
<br/>
But... may the wheels turn. (And have fun!)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

If you throw one or two thousand dollars on the table and you are reasonably organized, you can probably make something fairly presentable... ...although I guess that assumes that you are a reasonably shrewd and competant manager.
