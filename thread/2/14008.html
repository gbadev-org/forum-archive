I've been looking forward to this bank holiday weekend - the sun has come out, three-and-a-half-days off work, etc etc but the game is SO good that I'm finding it really hard to not play it for ten hours straight!
<br/>
I've not done huge game-play sessions like this in years :-)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was a victim of iffy copy protection, I even got them to send me another disk just in case - so the only way to play my game was to download a cracked version of the CD release (which I might add has less features).

I've heard a lot about how this game is meant to be so great, I'll have to check it out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's totally teh awesome, and it needs to be played. I was dubious about the gameplay after trying the demo, but the actual game is a whole lot more involving. Although it's not perfect, it's gotta be one of the best shooters I've played since HL2!
<br/>
<br/>
And the only copy protection-related problem was related to activation - apparently the servers were getting hammered on launch day (I got it on the UK launch day) and it took a while to unlock it.
<br/>
Also there seems to be hoo-haa from some real pedantic people about the widescreen support, but I think they're just making noise for the sake of it. I'm playing in widescreen and it seems fine to me...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Ken Levine is right to laugh at the people who want to play the game through a fishbowl.  How frustrating it must be as a game developer... but he's cool-headed enough to let people spoil the aesthetics however they please.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: It's even sadder when a rootkit hoax to generate web traffic is eagerly swallowed up by people looking for something to be upset about.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Most online Quakers (Quakeworld, as in Quake 1) set the FOV to 120+ (as opposed to 90). It makes it look rather trippy.
<br/>
<br/>
Though come to think of it, (I confess I no nothing of Bioshock's story, etc.) But isn't the main protagonist wearing some kind of an old-style SCUBA suit? Wouldn't that make it look like a fishbowl anyway?
<br/>
<br/>
I really wish I had a better PC so I can try it out, HL2 remains my candidate for best-single-player-game-of-all-time... Not that I'm waiting for it to be beat, I am mighty determined to have a better PC by the time the Half-Life Orange Box comes out... (Ooh, sweet Portal glory...)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
