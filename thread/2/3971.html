    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would like to find a program, which can be used as a thought organizer. Notepad isn't exactly what I am looking for.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Requirements</span>
<br/>
<ul><li>Able to add notes, pictures, and other data with labels and descriptions.
<br/>
</li><li>Graphical interface with the ability to link and group items with parent-child architecture. (Like the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ice.org/tutorials/jamie_tutorial_01_images/hypergraph.gif" target="_blank"> <span style="font-style: italic">Hypergraph</span></a> in Maya)</li></ul>

I have been searching for this to keep track of my game ideas, daily schedule and any random thoughts I have. So does anyone know of a program like what I describe?
<br/>

It appears I didn't search hard enough. It's probably because of the lack of sleep but I typed "graphical organizer" which then lead me to the term which I used so often in school, "mind map." Eventually I came across this free software called <a class="postlink" href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">FreeMind</a>. After playing around with in for a few moments I knew this had to be the answer I was looking for. I thought I might post the link here in case someone was interested in it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
