Hi all well to those of you who are still visiting after the 6 days of downtime, Last Wednesday the server was running fine when i left it at 3.30pm but when i returned at 6pm there was a problem with MySQL, now normally the server fixes itself thanks to work Martin64 did on it to reset itself if the need arises, i left the server 3 hours but it didnt reset itself which was strange. I tried to reboot using putty but i couldnt connect.
<br/>
<br/>
So i went into the servers control panel and rebooted it through there, now heres where something strange happened because the server set itself into ReadOnly Mode (to those like me who dont have a clue what that means it basically means that the server is down.)
<br/>
<br/>
The timing of this was a major blow after the nearon 2 days downtime only a few weeks before when the server was restored because of problem some due to a phishing attempt on the network.
<br/>
<br/>
Our server admin and all around great guy Martin64 was away on holiday in London last week and only arrived home today. I sent tickets into the hosts but discussing the problem with Martin64 he was told the best solution was to backup and restore again. He has been running tests on the hardware to diagnose the problem but as of this time no clue as to what caused the hard drive to go into readonly mode.
<br/>
<br/>
To all the visitors to DCEmu UK i apologise profusely for the downtime, it hurts me just as much as an homebrew fan looking for the latest news and updates.
<br/>
<br/>
Im sure even the rivals to DCEmu UK will be glad to see us back as competition in the Homebrew and Emulation scene only makes for a stronger scene in the end.
<br/>
<br/>
Now hold on tight because we are going to be newsposting massively to ensure every release is posted.
<br/>
<br/>
again im sorry for the downtime but it was out of all our hands.
<br/>
<br/>
Lets get DCEmu UK back to normal asap.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks as always for Martin coming to our side in our hour of need.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"><br/>_________________<br/>check out my projects:
