<br/>
Besides you perform much better when you motivated. It is one of the reasons why schools give children regular breaks; and though you are not learning, you are still processing information so a lot of the rules for learning apply to work.
<br/>
<br/>
It is much more efficient to spend 50 minutes an hour in front of the computer doing a lot of work well than 60 minutes an hour in front of the computer doing a bit of work okay.

Food and drinks helps too; just don't get fat in the process. A 5/10 minute walk can help, it gets the blood flowing and allows you to clear your head.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I believe that almost anyone can learn to write C++.  It's like learning a spoken language - at first, you expect it to be difficult, so you take five minutes to construct a sentence before speaking it.  Once it finally 'clicks', it becomes second nature, and you don't have to think at all.  You will be able to think of a game, and pretty quickly work out which objects need to be made into classes, where you need your loops, how all the parts of your program should fit together, etc.  You just have to keep at it until you reach that stage, rather than convincing yourself that you aren't smart enough to learn it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I know of virtually noone who goes to post secondary school to get an education.  The value of post secondary school comes mostly in A) the chance to setup a social network that you can tap into for the rest of your life, B) the chance to do group work, and C) a piece of paper that says "hireable".

So what are you saying?  I don't have half a brain?  j/k..  I disagree, unless you mean what I am going to enter into the drunkencoders.com Christmas compo makes me a programmer.  Because, I did write the whole thing myself from scratch.. then I asked for a little help from Phoenix Rising.. and now I don't undertand half the code.  He gets like that, because he has been a professional programmer with 2x years and I think his mind processes life in C++.
<br/>
<br/>
But, my point is how you define 'learn to program'.  Just because I'm writing some crappy game using PAlib doesn't make me a programmer in my honest opinion.  It's when you see stuff like this:

And this program has 49 .c, .cpp, and .hpp files.. and it doesn't even do anything real yet (personal opinion, I doubt PR would agree with me).
