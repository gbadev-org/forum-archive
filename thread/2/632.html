<br/>
Just surfing the net, and discovered this website. Since I'm interested in developing a game idea of mine, I thought, why not?
<br/>
<br/>
Just before I get started thought, I need to know a bit about Devkit, and all the required documentation. When I looked on the site it nearly overwhelmed me to see how many documents and such you had.
<br/>
<br/>
What language is this programmed in? Do I need any special sofetware (e.g. C++ or C studio) or can I just use the devkit?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you done any PC game programming?

The GBA is typically programmed in C, with some assembly subroutines.

Devkit Advance is a cross-compiling build of the GNU Compiler Collection, hosted on Windows or Linux and targeted to the GBA hardware.  All you really need to make it work are a text editor (for writing code and makefiles), a paint program, an image converter, and an emulator (for testing the program).  I'd suggest Emacs, GIMP, and VisualBoyAdvance on both Windows and Linux platforms.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I've used visual basic, html, YaBasic (which constructs basic games for the PS2, donncha know), but I've not really done anything with C or C++. Luckily, a few of my friends have.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
