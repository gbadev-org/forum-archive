We are on itunes! Just go there and search NDS homebrew and you will find us. And also, if you were dissipointed with the suckfest of episode 1, I really think this episode is decent.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd hardly call a podcast inovative, If you stick just to homebrew, then your show could easily compliment <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dualscreenradio.com" target="_blank">this guy's show</a>, He sticks mostly to commercial news on the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, its innovative in the sense that noone has done one. There are like 10 different DS podcasts, DS radio is the best though. There are like 100+ video game podcasts. There are no DS homebrew podcasts.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, me and the guys recorded episode 1 last night. The quality will be very good and clear, and I think the content was good also. We talked about the terms flash cart/passme/wifime, all the different brands of flash carts and their pluses and minuses, we breifly talked about the neo myth, and we also said how to find out id your DS phat can do 4 light settings. If we are lucky, it will be up tonight. It might be delayed untill tomarrow-friday though. The website it <a href="http://ndshomebrewcast.podomatic.com/" target="_blank">http://ndshomebrewcast.podomatic.com/</a> . I might buy a domain like ndshomebrewcast.com and redirect it to the podomatic site. But for now, thats all ya get.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, we do not support piracy. We talk about compatability of roms and such, but those are only roms that we have backed up. Thats what I was talking about in the ninja flashpass preview.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, a bit of bad news. We are not releaseing it tonight, do to me forgetting to taking out our 5 minute prep in the begenning. As I type this, I am encoding it into mp3 again. The file will be around 60 meg. But a 99% chance of a tomarrow release. Which means, anything like my computer breaking, podomatic shutting down, or me dying will prevent it.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you look at our current icon and think it sucks, you are right. If anyone with some nice photoshop skills can make either a icon with flash carts on it, or just a DS like the one there, you will get a spot on the show one night for doing it. It has to pass mr_cow's seal of quality test though. Email them to the address.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And should be..  Backup is just another way of saying warez without wearing an eye patch and a parrot.  Yeah.. I know, having all the games I bought (wink, wink) on one media would be nice, but part of purchasing a game system that uses game cards is having to swap in and out the games you buy.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, we kinda had to talk about it. We are aimed at homebrew, or we would have named ourselves The NDS backupcast. We talked about all the different flash carts and just mentioned how their compatability is.
<br/>
<br/>
It was actually kinda boring. I wanted to get it out of the way though so we didnt get emails "How many roms can the M3 play" and stuff like that. Episode 2 will Have guides on flashme, news, and a large homebrew section. And from then on, we will just have news and new homewbrew releases.
<br/>
<br/>
We dont want to talk about backups or piracy mainly cause, we dont want to get our asses sued.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are these broadcast live?  The mp3s on the site should be totally edited.. No reason to stop saying "uhh", just edit it out!  I think you guys should study some news.  Quick, clear, and to the point.  It sounds to me like a few guys sitting in a basement just talking about NDS homebrew.. if that is what you are going for.. Good job.. but if you are hoping to get to a "professional" level, you have a lot of work to do.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
