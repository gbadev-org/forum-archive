I started GBA programming about a year ago after my wife bought me an SP and I fell in love with the thing.

<br/>
The funny thing is that I've spent FAR more time programming games than playing them. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm... I'd actually be really curious to get a run down of what they DID teach you in your CS program. Many of the professional programmers I know say that college did little more than teach them the right vocabulary. The real stuff they learned on their own or on the job.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Started coding years ago when I moved to a new city and didn't know anybody.

I was too late for the days of 8-bit computing, and by the time I got started you had to compete with id Software.  GBA seems like my last chance to participate in a market where simple but high-quality games are still viable.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Scott,
<br/>
I agree with what your collegues say. All-in-all college taught me how to <span style="font-style: italic">teach myself </span>the skills that I need to get the job done. Which is not a bad thing... I believe the two classes that taught me the most were my Programming Languages class where I had to complete one Semester Long Project where we created an interpreter in the Icon Programming Language that would interpret any valid Scheme code to its equivalent core expression. Then we did two other projects at the same time as the Semester Long project, one in Occam and another in ML that was a type-checker. Basically this taught me how to juggle more than one project at a time along with juggling other class projects. I noticed after this class I wasn't afraid of taking on seemingly large projects.(although I pulled many allnighters and drank many a mountain dew)
<br/>
The next class that I believe taught me most was a Special Projects Class 
<br/>
where I interned at Center for Business Information Technologies (cBit)
<br/>
working on a Search Engine for NCURA. This "internship" taught me how to be "professional" and research at a Graduate level and meet deadlines. I learned alot from this, it was an invaluable experience.
<br/>
<br/>
But this time two years ago, the programming future seemed bleak for me until i started getting motivated to take advantage of opportunities.
<br/>
<br/>
So all is well now...
<br/>
The Masters program at UL-Lafayette is ranked in the Top 50 Computer Science Programs in the nation which isn't bad. The best thing is that alot of these Grad Professors teach the undergrads which is a great experience for us.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I program the GBA because there is no real chance to program games for PCs unless you're a real math freak. I tried to write D3D apps before, but i didn't succeed because of all the complex math involved... Math is also the reason why i did not yet start my own 3D engine for the gba, i only managed to write a simple voxel renderer on my own.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm a web application developer in a french administrative entity.
<br/>
<br/>
I intend to quit to enter a game development company 'cause after 3 years of work here, I spent more time on script language for web (VBScript for ASP, Javascript) than on a really strong langage used in the computer industry like C/C++ for instance
<br/>
<br/>
I started to program on the .NET platform in C# fex months ago and really enjoy that one 'cause I could code Web Application with the same logic (+OO) than a computer application.
<br/>
<br/>
So I really decided that web stuff was over for me, and turn back to my C/C++ book.
<br/>
<br/>
As I always wanted to create my own RPG (I used RPGMaker before), I decided to masterise the langage and game development techniques by making it real.
<br/>
<br/>
I searched for a pretty cool and easy platform for some time, and one day, I saw the light!
<br/>
Shinyaku Seiken Densetsu on the GBA!
<br/>
<br/>
A dream for me, to see the first FF series opus remaked on this tiny console with shiny graphics.
<br/>
I noticed the game elements are simple (but efficient in gameplay) so I wanted to create an (A-)RPG in the same spirit.
<br/>
<br/>
My relationships in a french RPG fans community allowed me to know many person who each have their own capacity usefull in a project like that.
<br/>
Then I encoutered a professional developper who becomes my guru and my friend.
<br/>
<br/>
So, hands in hands, together with the team, we decided to create a mini-Seiken game, with custom graphics and sounds ^^
<br/>
<br/>
Note that I don't have any "degree" (I'm french and I don't know how to say "diplomes"....qualifications?) in computer programming.
<br/>
Anything I know comes from many hours spending to learn on different medias &amp; supports (doing less sport ... lol).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know that you would know about the profession, but everything is linked each other...And I love talking about me lol
<br/>
<br/>
Last thing to say is that the knowledge of many persons here on this board bring me a lot, thanks ^^<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So I guess your methodology is: Search the system for any capabilities that can potentially be used incorrectly, and then remove those capabilities.  When the system has so few capabilities that nothing can go wrong (that we care to check), mission accomplished.

Ah, those were the days. No forum, only a few stray tutorials to at least try and get something to compile. Seems like after I first discovered GBADev.org and toiled with getting it to work for a while, I gave up until a few months later. Then I gave it another shot and plotted a pixel in mode3, and was hooked from then on.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

I suggest you read as well.  The C book I learned from is:
<br/>
Practical C Programming by Steve Oualline, ISBN 1565923065
<br/>
<br/>
Code Complete by Steve McConnell is an excellent book on programming practices.  Don't let the Microsoft Press label scare you, there is a bunch of really useful information here.  The author goes into why gotos are considered evil- some I had wondered about for a very long time.  Code Complete will be out soon, if it is not out already.
<br/>
<br/>
If you feel like becoming a really good programmer, read Donald Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming".  I think that anyone who even considers programming seriously should own and read at least the first volume of this series.  Skim or even skip the math in section 1.2 if it is too difficult for you.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm ultimately between jobs right now.  (I'm working at a relative's restaurant.)  I'm self taught and self teaching- this is ongoing.  I've been programming for four or five years now if we discount the dabbling I did in C64 BASIC as a kid.

On Windows, I had to debug several crashes where running from the explorer it would crash, and run perfectly if run from within Visual C++...

I would also add that cell phones are - for the moment - more viable than  GBA. There are some exceptions, but if you want to publish stuff on the GBA, you have to work for someone. With cell phones, you are still able to publish yourself !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Amongst them, I found a complete install of GCC, Borland Builder C++6, and the plugin to control GCC from within Borland Builder. This one connecting its GUI with the emulator. In five minutes, I had a Hello World running. Reading the documentation, it shows that you have breakpoints and watchpoints available through the emulator !!! In short this complete package seems to be far more efficient and user friendly than anything we know on the GBA... Of course, we work with free tools, and people doing these tools can not compete with Borland and Nokia, but it seems that you have access to a very nice and powerful package for free !

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can just as well make it public now even though I'm ashamed to say so (ahrem, Lord Graga :-): a year ago or so I was making a huge program with codename GNES (Gameboy Advance Entertainment System) but somehow I managed to stop developing it... :(
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, GNES was supposed to be a complete development environment, including a Basic language with *lots* of routines, a development environment called Golden Environment, including custom-made editors, built-in Click &amp; Play that would insert code, etc. etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I did the compiler+assembler and most routines (in asm), I did the editor, the workspace, but for some reason I quit it; mabey because of intense exam studies? But anyway, here you can see some screenshots of both the Golden Environment and some games made with it (and yes, it had support for Mario-3D maps :-)
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
So now I'm thinking of mabey instead use it for Click &amp; Play...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got my Bachelor's degree in computer science from Southwest Missouri State University.  As far as profession goes, I guess I'm hard to peg into a category...  I've started up a game development company and my team is working on our first GBA game.  Since we're unlicensed and have no publisher, perhaps "semi-professional game developer" would be the most accurate.
<br/>
<br/>
I've heard a lot of nay-saying about the odds startups have of breaking into the GBA market.  A lot of the concerns I've read are valid, but I fail to believe that if our company can create an interesting IP, a solid game, and a good business plan--all of which I'm confident we can do--we won't be able to find a publisher.  That may sound a bit arrogant, but to do what we're trying to do, I think one needs to have a whole lot of confidence and even a little arrogance, too.
<br/>
<br/>
If happen to be wrong, and we can't find a publisher, at the very least I'll be able to use the demo--and the experience I gained from coding the game--to land a job at an established company in the industry.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm a programmer for a company in Santa Clara, CA. Most of my work at the moment is Perl and DB stuff, so I wanted a way to practice some C, and also to get some use out of my GBA. I mean, it looks nice and I'm happy that I own it, but I don't actually play it much.
<br/>
<br/>
I also like doodling so I figured I could make my stick figures and happy faces attack each other on a GBA and that's better than on paper. 
<br/>
<br/>
Been out of school for a year, started CS, finished with Economics and a minor in CS. If I could do it over, I'd probably double in Spanish and French or just go for a BFA in Illustration/Animation somewhere.
<br/>
<br/>
When I'm not working, gba programming, doodling or reading, I'm at the fencing club or at the gym, trying to get healthier for fencing.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I graduated from college with a CS degree in 1976, got a masters in CS in 93 and worked in the computer field since 78 and the computer telephone field sine 94.  When the telco market crashed and the company I was working for let 2K of us go I was unemployed except for consulting for 1.5 years.  I am now working at Full Sail in their Game Design Bachelors program teaching machine architecture and software optimization.  I just started a class as part of machine architecture that will use the GBA as and example of targeting software for console development and teaching ARM assembly.  We are using VHAM for the IDE and no HAM libraries to make sure people understand what these libraries to for you.  I am non visual type of coder (command line - no mouse - no graphics) so the graphics part of this system are the ones I have the least experience with and no one would hire me to design the visual portion of a game.  I do not have problems with the other areas and I hope to get better on the graphics side of this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
