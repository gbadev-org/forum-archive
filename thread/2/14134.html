    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello. It's been a while since I have posted here. I am currently taking a asm class and they are using TextPad as their IDE, but I want to use PNotepad. My question is what do I search for to learn how to setup the IDE where I can link, assemble, and bring up the debugger from PNotePad. I don't have experience figuring that stuff out, other than following step by step instruction. I don't actually know what I am doing. My teacher said to look at the help file, but PNotepad's help file is incomplete.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No it doesn't. The devkitPro installer sets it up to run make which uses makefiles. Pnotepad can run anything that can be executed from the command line and capture it's output.
<br/>
<br/>
Jake, can you give some more specific information on what you need to do?
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I prefer using make to drive multi stage build processes but there are other ways to achieve the same functionality if the tools are relatively simple.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry it has taken me so long to reply. What I basically have to do for the class is run the .bat file that the teacher made and then the debugger. The way this is done in TextPad is that I make a new tool called AL.BAT with the parameters 'AL.BAT $BaseName' and another called Windbg.exe with the parameters 'Windbg.exe $BaseName.exe' and that's it. I just need the equivalent for PNotepad. I'm sure this is something really simple; I just don't know what I am doing.

Thanks for the help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, I've gotten in to work if I am in the software folder, but I want to know how to be able to do it from any folder. I have tried changing the folder box in the add tools window to %d, but that didn't work. I have also tried adding a path to AL.BAT, but that didn't work(perhaps I did it wrong). Here is what I have now:

Also, I don't know much about .bat files I guess, so I'm not sure if I need to change something there. I have been reading over it, but don't see anything I should change. Here is the batch file:
<br/>
<br/>
ml/c /coff /Fl /Zi %1.asm
<br/>
link /debug /subsystem:console /entry:start /out:%1.exe %1.obj c:\80x86\Software\io.obj c:\80x86\Software\kernel32.lib</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
