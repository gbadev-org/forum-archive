    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am looking for a development community to join. My aim is to experiment with skinnable cross platform guis - although I would also like to have a <span style="text-decoration: underline">really basic</span> audio stream with low latency. I have no qualms about joining any of the public licenses that would force me to provide code.
<br/>
<br/>
I do not mind being restricted to only windows, especially as I have had too many complications setting up linux with my graphics card without resorting to 'four letter words'.
<br/>
<br/>
I am considering wxWidgets as it will make it easier to have anything I create cross platform. I really do not know where to start. I have some experience with wxWidgets at uni - we had to develop graphics enhancing programs, but we were not doing anything special. I need a responsive display, so I am unsure if I would <span style="text-decoration: underline">have</span> to use directX (which I have worked with a little with c#).
<br/>
<br/>
That's why I need to find a viable community that is as strong as this place. I don't want too much choice, I just want a solution to enable me to develop without too much hassle not related to the coding, and a community to support me with new areas. I have googled before and can't find anything concrete.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have something in mind, but would rather experiment first. I create music, and would like to try to develop a simple app for hip hop beats creation inspired by the akai mpc hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
Look at how just blaze creates a beat using his mpc in this youtube clip (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7wZD1ewxB4" target="_blank">click here</a>). The mpc isn't doing anything special, but it works as a stand alone app for creating beats.
<br/>
<br/>
I have ideas about how file formats should work, and the options for file exporting to prepare for mixing, how to manage audio samples, and a lot of other things. But I want to start off with small achievable tasks with the main goals in mind; and my first task is to find a simple medium to work with. So initially I will be experimenting with the API's without having such a big ambition.
<br/>
<br/>
I am quick at developing code and solving problems; but I still have small goals so that I can only either carry out my given tasks, or exceed them.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: and I say I am experimenting as I would hate to announce my interest in a project I did not complete. That would look bad.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

have you looked at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtaudio/" target="_blank">RtAudio</a>? Does it furfill your need for audio-streaming? wxWindows is quite good for the gui-part.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">RTAudio looks like a great candidate to use for the audio stream. My main concern is finding a viable community.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also I think my problem is how I am putting together my dev environment. At uni it is seamless and compiles really quick. To get the same code to work both at home and uni on linux and windows I had to install dev-cpp and download all of the plugins, and then borrow some of the lines that the dev-cpp makefile uses and put it into mine when compiling on windows.
<br/>
<br/>
But on windows wxWindows compiles much slower than it did when I was on linux, also I have too many troubles getting debugging working and the likes, so any good forum or irc channel that you know of would be great.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have yet to see an app where skinning was a good idea. Just give me a standard rectangular window which matches all my other windows and widgets, and follows basic UI practices. (For example, 'turnable' knobs don't make sense on a GUI. Put a standard slider bar in there instead.)

For what I am doing you really do not want slider bars instead of knobs. Packages like reason and fruityloops live on having knobs.
<br/>
<br/>
Consider that a standard mixer, 16 channels, each with one slider, 4-8 aux send knobs, pan knob, and 4 eq knobs. You really would have a big challenge making that work with just sliders.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Cubase uses sliders, but not like normal windows sliders. The aiming at the slider adds time to seeking for the point and then dragging to your desired position; and it also feel 'crap' compared to the alternative.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I am not thinking about skinning in the sense of windows media player, and I have no ambition to begin with some fancy looking app. But if this reaches a point of completion then the look of the interface would be something to think about.
<br/>
<br/>
But first stop are the communities, and getting wxWidgets and everything else to work with my debugging IDE and makefiles. I didn't like using dev-cpp because it compiled the entire project each time and took too long to compile something that compiles quicker 'real' custom makefiles.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: although flash's pop up sliders are good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But back to the original question, does anyone know of any <span style="font-weight: bold">solid communities</span> to join? The main reason is that I find myself spending all of my time trying to get something to work with out of date help. The wxWidgets/eclipse walkthrough is out of date and does not work at all, which means that I cannot get the debugger working so I might aswell be using any other text editor.
<br/>
<br/>
And once I am within the community I can take their recommendations and now end up getting stuck in the configuration.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, but its not just .NET. They also deal with MFC and general C/C++. It may not have anything on wxWidgets, but its got a good deal of generic and Windows programming examples (mostly Windows).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
