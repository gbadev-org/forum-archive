If media companies couldn't have ads they wouldn't exist! That's why TV have commercials every 15 minutes. That's why we have "soap operas" and not "operas", after a soap company sponsored a popular run of them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And for what reason would you conclude that? I have seen splash pages, but it is not constant to every page. For example I have not seen a splash page at all from clicking on your link. I even went onto their site (just now) and clicked on several articles, including the Super Mario Galaxy Review - guess what? no splash page at all, and that's for a highly anticipated game.
<br/>
<br/>
Now as an exercise, go onto NBC and try to watch an episode of HEROES; it features a splash page style advert within the flash video player (at least it was when I used to use it). Here's another one, look at the HEROES online graphic novel, again Nissan advert on the first page. Listen to the radio, watch a music channel, ads are forced in the same manor as [compulsory] splash pages (that I remind you does not occur in the typical user experience of IGN).
<br/>
<br/>
It's not about being <span style="font-weight: bold">greedy</span>, without the advertising revenue they <span style="font-weight: bold">would not</span> exist. Sure you <span style="font-weight: bold">could</span> operate on a purely voluntary basis, but let's be serious; the world is not like that, not at least the competitive world of news media where the quality level of a competitive brand requires a high investment of time and [therefore] money. Think about it, take away advertising and you can say goodbye to 90% of the Internet (including google, youtube, myspace, and facebook).
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit</span>: Actually that's not entirely true - in theory. In practice a free alternative would require the cooperative efforts on par with the corporate equivalent, but tenfold the amount of people involved (since you are unlikely to have a large amount of full time commitments). So in theory it is more than possible for it to happen, it just would take someone to pursue (and lead) the vision with the right marketing to draw support.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
