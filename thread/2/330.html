    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is sort of related to another post I put on this board.  My question is: if you heard that a remake of the original NES Metroid was coming out for the GBA with updated graphics, would you consider buying it?  Either way, please try to state why.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If a port of Metroid 1 to GBA were facelifted to look as good as Metroid Fusion, I'd buy it.  But because of the larger world size that a GBA cart can hold vs. an NES cart (Metroid 1 was 128 kilobytes), it might actually be better to include both Metroid 1 and Metroid 2 in one Pak along the lines of Super Mario All*Stars.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">apparently, if you complete metroid prime on the Gamecube, then link it to a GBA with metroid fusion, then you get the full NES version of metroid on the gba. i think i read that in either gamestm or edge just recently.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You get to play it on the Gamecube, I don't understand why they didn't let you play it on tha GBA instead though. The game is 128kByte, an emulator shouldn't even take the rest of the 128kByte in the GBA. I think the coolest would have been if they sacrifieced 256kByte of the 8MByte in the Metroid Fusion game to have an emulator and the original Metroid incorporated.
<br/>
If you have a XBOO cable or something similar try out PocketNES with Metroid, I think it should work by just sending it over the cable, not sure though.
