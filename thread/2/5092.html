    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, as stated by the compo rules, you can't be able to download any of the games before the cartridge is sold. (i think there's a 6 month wait, but I am not sure).
<br/>
Anyway, cartridge is supposed to be $12 so buy it :p I will !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
