Ok, criteria... 
<br/>
<br/>
1) You have complete control over the hardware 
<br/>
2) The hardware doesn't change 
<br/>
3) You are working with the hardware, not an API 
<br/>
4) The hardware is designed for games, making it easier to make them 
<br/>
5) The community is very helpful 
<br/>
6) No Bill Gates to create a monopoly (unless Microsoft releases the X-Boy) 
<br/>
7) It's really easy to find source for a complete game/demo 
<br/>
8) You learn a variety of things that doesn't happen on a PC, like optimizing code, profiling it, etc. 
<br/>
9) It's actually possible to create a working engine suitable for games by yourself 
<br/>
10) The minimum requirement for playing a GBA game is a GBA and the game. 
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
The items in your list are more like supporting arguments than criteria.  One example of a criterium that seems to fit some of your points would be "How much control the developer has (more is better)".  The idea is to define the things that determine what "better" means, in a way that allows a direct (though possibly subjective) comparison.
<br/>
<br/>
I agree with all the things you listed except the point about optimization and profiling, as those are very relevant for PC development (and I'm using the term "PC" broadly).  Also, about the monopoly thing, OpenGL is platform-independent so it only applies to D3D.
<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, all your comments about GBA development versus PC development could be summed up with:  "When trying to make a game that will succeed in a competitive market, it's easier to develop for GBA than PC."
<br/>
<br/>
And I think that's true.  Because PCs are more capable, and there are developers that are trying to exploit those capabilities, it can be hard to keep up.  You have to be willing to accept the added complexity that is involved in a more powerful system, and then tame that complexity.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, none of that seems to justify using a generic term like "better".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And a flash cart, which many minors cannot afford. Somewhat counter-intuitively, it's almost easier for a child to get a parent to buy her a new PC than a GBA and a flash cart.

Not a misread so much as a complete lack of understanding.  I don't know how one checks whether a pointer refers to a valid object, or why such a thing should be necessary.  If a pointer can suddenly become invalid, then the program shouldn't have access to it in the first place, and instead should be given (as you mentioned) a handle.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I said playing, not developing. Most people who want to play 3D PC games can't because their PC is too slow or soemthing else. 
<br/>
<br/>
Would you rather spend $200 and know that all the games designed for it work very well or upgrade your PC knowing that it may not work at all (because of all those system configurations)? Today's blazing-fast PC will be obsolete in 4 years.

The difference is that on the PC, small development houses can self-publish. If a small dev firm wants to distribute a 3-level demo of a GBA game for no fee on the Internet, the player is going to need a flash cart.

It's been a while, but there was a free toolkit last time I looked into J2ME games for cell phones.  Here is the link I have.  It's a little old:

<br/>
<br/>
I think that most of the linux/unix devkits are either free or inexpensive.  I think there is a free Java/C++ devkit for some Symbian platform.  I don't recall if it was a PDA, or specific cell phone though.

Why do you need to be able to print to develope J2ME games?  When I have run linux boxes, they have always been dual boot windows/linux.  There are linux setups that can operate on the FAT file systems. (Assuming that is what windows still uses.)  I'm not 100% sure if one can access their windows data from the linux boot, but I suspect that is the idea.

<br/>
<br/>
If one wants to use thier peripherals under linux, checking for compatability is important when buying them.  Assuming you want to run linux, you could try to pick up some older supported peripherals either locally or on eBay, or do your printing and scanning using Windows.
<br/>
<br/>
You can get computers cheap these days.  I like <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pricewatch.com" target="_blank">price watch</a>.  This is actually a void arguement, but the only reason I'm not running linux is because I went too cheap on my computer.  As an alternative, you could get another hard drive and dual boot that way to avoid general mucking about.  If you want to use the scanner to import images, getting them from the windows partition to the linux partion may be a bit of a pain if they can't fit on a floppy, but it can be done.

If you have a decent computer and a broadband line, you can start coding for 0 dollars, with a very powerful integrated environment (GCC, GDB, Borland) by visiting Nokia.
<br/>
I have a friend who just setting up a company to sell his game (done in J2ME), and the SDK was free as well, from SUN this time. It cost him the price of a cell phone and a USB cable to transfer the jad file...
<br/>
<br/>
So Java or C++, you can go for free on cell phones !
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: my friend also had to pay for registering his game design and all the associated material they generated... not sure about the word "register" here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You could take 98 off the laptop and install it on a faster machine.  I'm arguing for doing things cheaper in general.  Your case will have it's own set of restrictions.  It actually sounds like Windows is not an issue for you.

Sorry.  I didn't look hard enough.  I skimmed the page and searched for "expire".  That expiration policy is just plain broken.  I'd avoid BREW on principle alone.  Is BREW a worldwide thing?  Or is it area restricted like WAP?  (WAP was?  I'm not up to date here.)

<br/>
The thing I like about JAVA is that it uses Unicode.  That facilitates localization.  JAVA also runs on an OS independant VM.  That makes localization really easy if you know what you are doing.

My argument is that one wants a worldwide potential user base.  If one can't manage that, he or she can settle for the English speaking population. =)

<br/>
I realize that you said "could not save up for", and that indicates ability, but I would like to point out another thing.  With no other income (in other words one either not married or one's spouse does not work) one will not be able to get a home load.  Even if one intends to put 90% of the income towards housing, the bank wants to see that the mortgage can be paid on about 25% of the income.  Divide the mortgage payment by four to get the approximate amount you'll need to make a month in order to get a loan.  (I don't approve of this system. =)
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is actually looking at minimum wage job, even McDonalds pays more than that at the very worst.  My first job was minimum wage plus tips.  Thats usually better than plain minimum wage.  Phone work actually pays fairly well, although it can suck sometimes.  I'm actually looking for work at an inbound call centre right now, failing anything that is actually computer related.

<br/>
I disagree. Assuming one is whining, there is no way that person can help <span style="font-weight: bold">me</span> with his or her whining.  The only person one can help is him or herself (and potentially others that are actually bothered by third party whining.)  Life isn't fair.  Whining about it doesn't do anything.  If there is will, there is a way and at least a partial solution is always out there for those with drive to take advantage of it. /rant
<br/>
<br/>
My point is that if you think you might be whining, your not whining helps you, not me.  Actually, getting a job helps you and not me as well.  I'm between jobs at the moment.  I'm registered with a temp agency that seems to be useless.  I have go through the classified ads.  I live in Wisconsin, and I'll be checking out Wisconsin job net.  When and if all that fails I'll head out and fill out applications and drop off resumes like crazy.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have a degree, you can apply for the JET program.  You'll make far more than minimum wage even after the difference in cost of living is accounted for, and you'll have a cultural experience at the same time.  With a nothing more than a degree you can actually teach English over seas in a bunch of places.  My father is teaching English in China at the moment.
<br/>
<br/>
Back to the original topic, Bomberman did the research and found out that we can make games for Nokia phones for a very small amount of money.  Getting started is even free!
<br/>
<br/>
One could also make JAVA games to played in a web browser.  It's probably not money making, but it's game making.

<br/>
That depends on what you want your degree to do for you.  Do you want a job in your field?  Yes.  Is a degree going to help you get one?  Probably not, although it can get you past the first filter.
<br/>
<br/>
People get promoted because they have a degree.  People get paid more for having a degree.  There are options open to people that have degrees.  It doesn't matter what the degree is in.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the system is broken, and so far I have not participated.  I'm self taught and I don't have a degree.  It makes things more difficult.  My advice to anyone is if you want to operate in the system, get a degree or formal training of some sort.

The goal is to create a framework that can be localized easily.  That way, when and if one has the resources to pay for the translation it can be plugged into the existing framework painlessly.

<br/>
You could consider non-mode seven effects, or alter the game in some other way.  You could also start with a new concept altogether.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested I've been thinking about the tetris concept as a special case of another framework.  If our game pieces are M block shapes that fit in an M by M grid, and M is 4 we have tetris.  One could write a game where M is not 4, or where M can even be set in the options.  Here is a routine for growing the game pieces:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">G0. [Start empty.]
<br/>
   Start with a clear M by M grid.
<br/>
G1. [Initialize - set first cell.]
<br/>
   Fill cell(M / 2, M / 2).
<br/>
   S &lt;- 1.
<br/>
G2. [Test for completion.]
<br/>
   If S == M, the routine terminates.
<br/>
G3. [Select a random cell.]
<br/>
   X &lt;- random integer from 0 to M - 1.
<br/>
   Y &lt;- random integer from 0 to M - 1.
<br/>
G4. [Filled already?]
<br/>
   If cell(X, Y) is full, go to G3.
<br/>
G5. [Not adjacent?]
<br/>
   If cell(X, Y) is not adjacent to a filled cell, go to G3.
<br/>
G6. [Fill cell]
<br/>
   Fill cell(X, Y).
<br/>
   S &lt;- S + 1.
<br/>
   Go to G2.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
My goal was to provide the routine in a format that can be translated into whatever language and format meets the authors requirements.  As M increases, the shapes become more circular and blob like in appearance.
<br/>
<br/>
The version of tetris I have for my famicom uses a playing field that is 5 * M high, by 2.5 * M wide.

Forum moderators "are actually bothered by third party whining."

<br/>
My point is merely that one can complain about the state of affairs, or one can do something about it.  The former is whining by my definition.  It is an unproductive activity.  One can almost always do something about an unfavorable state of affairs.  It may not be a complete solution, but something can almost always be done.
<br/>
<br/>
What forum were you banned from?  I'd have to describe the particular moderators that banned you as "foolish monkeys".  Different people (moderators) and different places (forums) are just plain different.  It can be frustrating to figure out how different people and places work, but that is part of life.  I don't think you have to worry about being banned from forum.gbadev.org for 'linking to web sites containing binaries of programs for game consoles' so long as those programs are not commercial games or other copywritten material for which you do not hold the copyright.
<br/>
<br/>
I have seen others here mention sites that contain GBA programs they have written.  They have not been banned and continue to post.  I don't think anyone here will mind, moderators included, if you link to or otherwise mention your site.

Again, what kind of positions are you looking at?  The economy is slow right now and there is a good chance you will not be able to find a job in your field right now.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as computer skills in particular go... I'm not sure if you have the money to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.computer.org/join/" target="_blank">join</a>, but the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.computer.org/software/" target="_blank">IEEE Software Society</a> offers various distance learning courses.  I see <a class="postlink" href="http://www.computer.org/distancelearning/MicrosoftDatabase.htm" target="_blank">(Microsoft) SQL Server 2000 System Administration</a> in the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.computer.org/distancelearning/catalog.htm" target="_blank">course catalog</a>.  I don't see ASP.NET in particular, but there is some other .NET stuff there.  The distance learning course may or may not assume that one already has the tools to 'do the job'.  I intend to join after I finish my current books.
<br/>
<br/>
As for books, you may be able to find some that contain CDs with versions of the tools needed to learn the material in the book.  Head down to the book store and take a look.  You should be able to learn a skill for the price of the book if it contains such a CD.

Not if you are applying to be an "assistant language teacher".  Clearly, knowing some Japanese and something about the culture is recommended.  You will have to be able to make an interview.

<br/>
In practice, do programs on the Java platform run fast enough to make software mode 7 video with low latency audio?</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not entirely sure what kind of speed one needs for those features, but I suspect that the answer is dependant on the device running the VM.  When making JAVA games, one may actually want to write some games that have lower specs for people running lower end devices.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, seeing as JAVA runs on a VM, and the VM may (will?) be run on multiple devices with potentially different clock speeds, I'm not sure that managing a program at the cycle level is worth worrying about.  The notion of a VM is a little odd, and I suspect that writing a program for a VM is fairly different from writing a program for a real embedded device, such as the NES or the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
The JAVA VM is a stack based machine.  It's not register based.  Information on the byte codes (JAVA machine language), byte code manipulation, and the JAVA VM in general is out there on the net.  Due to the nature of byte neutral VMs, programs written for things like the JAVA VM and the .NET platform are trivial to reverse engineer.

That strikes me as a strange and arbitrary request.  Why has your employment counselor asked you not to do that?  Once you have a job, you can always keep looking and get another one.  The best time to look for a job is when you already have one.   People quit and find new jobs all the time.

I'd consider looking into it as a generic money making experience.  I was working full time at $7 an hour.  Every week I'm unemployed at this point is a little over $200 I don't have.  Phone work tends to pay better than things like retail.
<br/>
<br/>
First, get a job that pays "near-minimum-wage".  If you want more free time, try to find a higher paying part time job while you work the first one.  If you want more money, try to find a (higher paying) full time job.  Repeat until you are either happy with the money you are making, or happy with the job you are doing.  At that point keep looking for a job.  Now you are in a position to be picky about the positions you accept.

That is certainly practical.  If working on something without being able to test it on hardware strikes you as too risky, wait until you can test it on hardware.  Learning the basics is not risky and is something that can be done with the emulators.  You may already know the basics, in which case you really want to be able to test on hardware.
