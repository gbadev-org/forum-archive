<br/>
<br/>
I think I've been writing and rewriting the same file over and over onto the same SD card, the whole thing has just thought 'Sod it', and now it does Very Strange things when I add files to it:
<br/>
- Files just written disappear, and reappear
<br/>
- Files appear with 0k size and refuse to be deleted/come back when they are deleted
<br/>
<br/>
Stuff like that...
<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know of an app that can test SD cards for consistency, and bad blocks or what-have-you?<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Aye, I've tried that, but I was wondering if there was something more akin to <span style="font-style: italic">memtest</span>, where it can pepper the card with blocks and check for consistency between writes and reads, etc.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum.
