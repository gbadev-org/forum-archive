    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">About all the news stories about people injuring themselves and funature by flinging wiimotes at them and blaming the wrist strap... DO NOT LET GO OF THE CONTROLLER WHEN FLAILING YOUR ARMS ABOUT!!! its just common sense, now apparently Nintendo are recalling some wii controllers because the straps are not good enough, YOU HOLD ONTO THE CONTROLLER, DO NOT SWING IT ABOUT BY THE STRAP!
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps there sould be a warning on the box, 'Using this controller in completely the wrong way and thowing it at your t.v is not advised and could end up in you looking stupid'
<br/>
<br/>
Thats all I have to say.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, it only makes sense.. as most of the population is stupid..  Some of them are going to buy a wii (I mean.. look at the PS3 sales :) )..
<br/>
<br/>
I'm supprised there isn't more "hoopla" about it, as kids sometimes just don't care and I can see them jumping offa couches and stuff while playing games.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">methinks the number of actual incidents is probably very small. some of the stories &amp; pictures i have seen are clearly untrue and/or faked. 
<br/>
<br/>
on the BBC site someone claims to have let go of the Wiimote which hit his gf on the teeth, knocking two out, so she stumbled and crashed through the TV screen. which was connected to a sound system that was pulled into his CD and DVD collection.
<br/>
<br/>
yeah, right... try to pull the other one<br/>_________________<br/>- no sig -</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nintendo will be spending ?5M ($8M), but that is far less than what they have saved in advertising. This stunt has them on many newspapers ^_^ I'm sure it was on purpose.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just find it interesting that several of the pictures of people proudly holding their wiimotes up on wiihaveaproblem show the people not wearing their wriststraps. If they don\'t read the health and safety warnings (which, knowing nintendo, are probably everywhere. Do you have to read them on the wii bootscreen like you do on the DS?) then all nintendo can do is say \"we tried to warn you\".
