Have you decided on a rotation/lockdown system? Do you want to implement something as customizable as the newer <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/lj/" target="_blank">Lockjaw Engine</a>, or do you want to stick with the fixed function of the Carbon Engine that powers TOD?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Well I could (if I wanted) merge this with my java 3d software rendering engine; recode/code texture mapper. I will decide how I will achieve this after I have the tetris engine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In falling block game engines that handle only integer positions of game pieces, such as the engines of <span style="font-style: italic">Tetris</span> for NES and Game Boy and <span style="font-style: italic">TOD</span> for PC and GBA, dropping 1/3 block per frame means dropping 1 block every 3 frames, where a countdown variable stores the number of blocks left before the next downward motion.
<br/>
<br/>
In falling block game engines that use fixed-point coordinates for the game piece, such as those of <span style="font-style: italic">Klax</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Super Puzzle Fighter II</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic">The New Tetris</span>, 1/3 means 1/3 of a cell every frame.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, I did have the right timing; it just didn't feel like it - I haven't played tetris for a very long time! And well the tetris side of things are all handled and ready for the gameboy timing. EDIT: well I did play tetris last year when I made a c# version of it, it started off as a testing session and ended up being me playing it for an hour or two.
<br/>
<br/>
So there are only two main tasks: creating the 'drug effects' and [later] rewriting some of the interfaces to allow for colours and other attributes; it is very cut down and geared to recreate the gameplay and provide enough information for me to be able to have a fully working game that outputs its graphics.
<br/>
<br/>
Ahh, just found the scoring system. And I think I will be implementing the 'bag' concept.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
