I don't see PirateHell as a neutral ground at all - the domain is host to release lists and many other activities relating to piracy. While the main focus may be emulators there is a lot of activity which cannot be seen as anything other than copyright infringing. Their Wiki is especially bad.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh..  Some funny reading going on here.. You can easily identify the pirates and the non-pirates.  I think it's safe to say everyone knows my point on the subject (hell, I had a whole topic about why I shouldn't <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7104" target="_blank">hate bastard pirates</a>)  :)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I totally don't agree with just locking posts.  I mean, that lets the person that is breaking the rules get away with what they want.  So you can't comment.  big deal.  Their link to warez is still there.. I wouldn't want to help provide that kind if information, or direct people to that kind of information.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I think the real question here is..  Is this a homebrew only dev site or not?  It is becoming questionable.  If it's intenionally questionable, then change the main site to be like this:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pirate Forums, click here (redirect to pocketheaven)
<br/>
Homebrew Forums, click here (go to these forums)..
<br/>
<br/>
Wow.. that was easy enough.  Now the true homebrewers can still have a clean forum and the pirates that are playing homebrewers can have their forum without having to post questions pirate related here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think locking and erasing any links and information is fine.

Why not put the notice in the registration process in big red font? That way regular members won't be bothered.

Evidentally you didn't catch all the posts before replying.

It has been said already that the locked posts would be editted. Most other forums I go to, also will edit out the offending stuff. This leaves the thread up for use with authority figures, and for future posts to reference.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I agree, the poll is biased, and I suggest we protest by choosing the "I am a pirate I want to be banned" option as a form of ridiculing the poll<br/>_________________<br/>[ <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dakedesu.info" target="_blank">Main Site</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://krfp.dakedesu.info/" target="_blank"> Kid Radd Fan Project</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.dakedesu.info/" target="_blank">Forums</a> ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So where exactly is the line drawn? Is it where you find it moraly acceptable or is it where the law says you can not do it? The truth is that you will find more links to copyrighted material on forum.gbadev.org then on boards.pocketheaven.com

On pocketheaven, a person asking for roms/warez or posting such link gets a warning if he's lucky or he gets banned directly.

<br/>
Sometimes the law is an ass.
<br/>
<br/>
Morality and legality are two different concepts. What is legal may still be immoral. What is moral may be illegal. 
<br/>
<br/>
What I have a problem with here is not that piracy related questions are being asked here but that those questions are being answered or directed towards resources which will enable copyright infringement. It's setting a bad example.
<br/>
<br/>
I draw the line where the ability to earn a living is being hampered or money is being made from illegally distributing the works of others.
<br/>
<br/>
The internet should have been an ideal medium to allow artists ( I include programmers and musicians here as well as the more common interpretation) to earn a living without having to forfeit large portions of the potential profit to parasites who add little or no value to the product. What seems to be happening instead is that more ways are being provided to avoid paying anything at all.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Nintendo or Sony would respond that if homebrewers want to develop for a handheld, they should do so for an open platform such as Palm or GP2X[2] and then use their Palm or GP2X based program as a "demo reel" when applying to 50 different licensed developers in Greater Seattle (or foreign counterparts).

It could be argued that we obtained a license to a copy of the DS firmware when we bought our DS. Since FlashMe destroys the original copy, we still have only 1 copy in use at any particular time. The FlashMe.nds file stored on your PC is simply a backup.

It could be argued that FlashMe constitutes fair use. It's similar to removing the region protection from a DVD player. In any case value has been added by providing features people want - the removal of the health screen and the ability to run unsigned code, necessary for homebrew. Users have already purchased the original - FlashMe is useless without a DS.

Being honest I'm not a huge fan of DRM but it's an interesting idea.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS has a lot of potential for internet delivered content and your FAT library makes it possible for it to be delivered and stored on the DS. It's a great shame that Nintendo would probably issue a C&amp;D fairly quickly.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Is unrestricted distribution of FlashMe more of a fair use than making "backups" of your games, using them to test an emulator, and not distributing them?

Unfortunately, that's likely not enough. The backup copy exemption of 17 USC 117 is not a catch-all second copy exemption; the user has to make the backup himself or herself. I read <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UMG_v._MP3.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: italic">UMG v. MP3.com</span></a> to imply that if you're modifying the original, you have to distribute the changes <span style="font-style: italic">only as a patch</span>, such as an IPS or XOR that turns each of v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, and v6 firmware into FlashMe firmware. Another issue is that FlashMe could in theory be used as the firmware for a DS emulator.

<br/>
Yes, but a MAC address is used for more than just DRM. It can cause problems trying to use the same MAC address on a local network. 
<br/>
<br/>
If users do start pirating the MAC key, it is a simple matter of black listing that MAC for future keys. Changing the MAC requires the user to short SL1, and flash the first page of the firmware. So if a user tries to use 2 different pirated softwares, with 2 different MAC based keys (since the first is black listed), they will need to repeatedly risk bricking their DS. Then there is the less ethical option of sending out trojans to "clense" DSs and game media (CF cards, etc.) if they are found to contain pirated copies. However, I don't believe that authors should stoop to this level.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I'm going to argue that the ultimate line is not getting the site shut down.  The only way to know where that line is is by stepping over it, so admins tend to err on the side of caution.  (If your server is in some remote location, being shut down could be very difficult.)  Individuals may have other lines.  Unless those individuals happen to be mods or admins their personal lines tend to have relative little impact.
