    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just curious as to why no one has implemented this? Are there technical limitations that can't be overcome (which I would find strange given SNESAdvance seems to be coming along quite well) or is there just not enough interest?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not enough interest, primarily. I suspect that once the existing GB mono emulators are more mature, somebody will try emulating those GBC games that don't use double-speed mode.

<br/>
The best GBC emulator for GBA is a GBC flash cart, but good luck finding one of those.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Emulating ?? the GBA is completly compatible to the gbc (it even has the sound channels from old gb). There is no need of an emulation. You can play commercial gbc games on it. the problem is just putting an gbc rom on a flash card made 4 gba which is illegal anyway. thats what gbc flash card may be 4 but i don't know it.

Without a GBC flash cart, how does one run GBC homebrew programs on a GBA? Or does GBC homebrew development somehow necessarily infringe somebody's rights?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
