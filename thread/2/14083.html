Thanks!  It's been in the works for awhile :)
<br/>
<br/>
I've done all the game code (except the sound library and a few minor snippets here and there that I pulled from example code) and game/level design.  All the graphics were done by <a class="postlink" href="http://spriteattack.cator.de/index.html" target="_blank">Daydream</a>.  The music is written by other people (the music I'm currently using is by Jesse Tracer, but that might change).

Though this is not a romhacking board and I have no intention to threadjack, any help in deep research of the original game is appreciated. There are a few things that we need to know. For example, how the game can play impromptu samples like that. I know the Sappy engine well and the cries are not complete like the sound effects are. They're just samples. And since Sappy is the only part of OP that's not legal...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#139952 - RegalSin - Wed Sep 12, 2007 12:48 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am contemplating and sapose to be collecting refernce material and consatrating on some sorta RPG based game or Comic book reference to that sed game.
<br/>
<br/>
I need to focus on reading commands for Assembler on the SNES since that is what I want to make the game for and finding out how to use whatever complier or to make a complier so I can see my data I write.
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment most of my ideas is in drawing form and I am practicing my drawing skills attaining a drawing style. I need t get it out and realease what I see in my sight.
<br/>
<br/>
I also need to install and remove the nessary items from my PC in order to 
<br/>
have a clean programing/editing area as the sign above my standard computer monitor says "THIS IS ONLY A TOOL" and right now I am in the middle of college.
<br/>
<br/>
I was also thinking about writing a book and then getting it Published to gain favor towards my idea and maybe a little cash in my pockets.
<br/>
<br/>
It would so much faster if I had real cash in my hands.
<br/>
<br/>
I am in college still going for my Associates in Graphics desinging. I am also still trying to pay off some bills and find something to do as a method of funding.
<br/>
<br/>
I have or I had ideas for websites for Tee-shirts, filesharing, forums, nudism, porno, food, and even Videogame pages but again I am underfunded.
<br/>
<br/>
I have thought about becoming a cop since this work study I am in pays pennies. I mean $1000 until December is like the amount most balnced people spend in a week and I am just Too Two years aged. Imagine a man  while who could pass for a sixteen year old who is eating mother milk and has no money and everybody he knew is gone 
<br/>
( no not Fry form futurama ) and generally I keep saying the best time of my life was when I was Softmore year in High School.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't date anybody not like this. I mean all these women excuse my word s ever care about is looks and money. The best I could do is some tall drink of water fresh out of Jr. High and who thinks I am a student or some girl who needs rescuing.
<br/>
<br/>
I am like American Physco only without the Three Apartments, balanced weight, big head of hair, or anything to call my own. I am an undefuned psychopath.
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing keeping me sane is drinking coconut water or the thought of drinking coconut water or being reunited with somebody who give a darg about me.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to make a webpage depicting what I could offer to the table in terms of game art but again no funding. I would take some time to design the website which I do on and off using the composer in Seamonkey / webpage I built from scraps of other webpages.
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly I want to create games and make animated art and many things like that but darn it all it feels like hell frozen over here and I am in the middle of it or war that passed and I am one of those Major Dans you see on the train who says "There is no god" .
<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to go back to snorting up cold from picking up yuck dog plates and seeing all the self proclaimed bad arses in life surse me out or fondle the weightresses. I don't want to have to sell more of my possesions.
<br/>
I don't want to join some Military with a bunch of Hoodlums and kill some guy and make an orphan out there childen or widow or get parts of my body removed jsut because somebody wants oil, or to help Israelies who get miles and miles of cash in there pocket and goes to school for free with Amerikan money.
<br/>
<br/>
All I want to do is draw stuff whichever way I want and be told. That is good work or that's just what I needed. So that is what I am upto in the world and I am being honest as possible okay.
<br/>
<br/>
Right now I gotta foucus on my college and learn how to drive and pay my bills and lose wieght more importantly. Again more importantly get out get hitched or nail a couple of Jr's and ride shamo or some giant Turtle or even Flying Nimbus if I could ever do that.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.
