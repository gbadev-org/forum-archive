    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It seems that more and more frequently, GBA and DS owners more interested in piracy than in homebrew choose to skip boards.pocketheaven.com and come straight to forum.gbadev.org with technical support questions for their infringement tools. I created this poll as an alternative to <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9437" target="_blank">wintermute's much more biased poll</a>.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You're illustrating exactly the behaviour I have a problem with. Many of your replies on posts which have a copyright infringing component direct the poster to a place where they can either find or be given the information they're seeking. Inserting a url as text rather than a link might require a little more effort to follow but is <span style="font-weight: bold">still</span> promoting a site which condones piracy.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think this is sending the wrong signals and gives the impression that you condone copyright infringement.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Wintermute: My job as a moderator is not necessarily to advocate or deprecate piracy but to keep the forum clean of overt discussion of topics that the admins have declared offtopic. <ul><li>If I <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> send people to Pocket Heaven, they are <span style="font-weight: bold">more</span> likely to stop bugging forum.gbadev.org with their offtopic issues. </li><li>If I <span style="font-weight: bold">do not</span> send people to Pocket Heaven, they are <span style="font-weight: bold">less</span> likely to stop bugging forum.gbadev.org with their offtopic noise. </li></ul> Pirates will discuss piracy whether we like it or not. Taking this into account, I discovered that a simple, polite "go away" works better than "shut up".

Should I go censor the board of all references to FlashMe, which is a potentially infringing copy of Nintendo's original firmware, in favor of FWNITRO?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I think that is fairly obvious :rolleyes:
<br/>

I think it is good what the mods are doing. Whether they were harsher than they are now, or they kept it the same, we would have the same amount of posts providing information about piracy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">About directing them away: Wintermute is more idealist and wants to discourage piracy period. I on the other hand am more pragmatist, aiming to "keep our city clean" by removing offtopic discussion. Besides, sometimes I don't always know whether something is piracy related (and worthy of a "Get thee to Pocket Heaven" lock/delete) until I ask for more information.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
