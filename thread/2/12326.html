"Yarr" is gbadev.org slang for alleged use of an infringing copy of a computer program. It comes from the term "software piracy", the implication being that "how do I get romz to work" is as much talking like a pirate as "yarr". Besides the issues with the IDE, Windows XP Service Packs are known to refuse to install if Microsoft can determine that your copy of Windows is infringing.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

What's annoying me is that I always pay for my OSes and I seem to get less than what the pirates get: One old version of XP mentioned that it would only install 3 times and then stops working afterwards and another computer I bought in March 2006 announced a few months later that I am suspected of using a pirated OS, even though this was the XP version that came with the computer. I was almost foaming from the mouth when I sent an e-mail to MS about this. Their answer: This is a support problem, please call our support hotline at so-and-so-many cents per minute.
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah right, Microsoft screws up and I am expected to pay an additional telephone hotline fee for it. I am seriously considering to buy a Mac next time, especially since vista is bugging me as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You have a choice to make: Mac, L*n?x, or FreeBSD. Each has its advantages and drawbacks.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why the censorship on the word L*n?x? As for getting less than the pirates; from the day XP came out we bought an 'upgrade'. Little did we know it was the worst 'upgrade' in history. Unlike the 'typical' license upgrade where you have a 'real' installation we were treated with a buggy 'upgrade' that loaded itself on top of windows 98. It almost has the effect of installing windows XP on top of windows XP without removing your windows and program files directory, completely unstable and hardly any applications work.
<br/>
<br/>
And now the CD is just sitting there collecting dust because we can't even install windows 98 on any of these systems properly ; so that's a whole license down the drain.
<br/>
<br/>
As for a split, I think it could quite possibly turn into several topics!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That page you linked to is incorrect when it uses YHWH as an example of not writing out a full name to show reverence.
<br/>
<br/>
YHWH is written like that because no vowel markings are present in the Torah when it is written, since you will apparently die instantly if you correctly pronounce the name (which is only possible if you know what vowels should be inserted).
<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine said he was going to try pronouncing every possible variation in vowels and see what happened, but for some reason, I never heard back from him on what happened :p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Close.  Most Hebrew at the time didn't really have vowel markings either.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, to get "half way" back on topic, the only thing "processes" like IDE and DRM do is make it more complicated for legit users.  None of these things stop vikings, err.. pirates..  And they never will.  The worst part is many of the latest encryptions aren't even being cracked for piracy!  They are being cracked because someone who legally purchased everything involved but because of these "processes" they are unable to.  So.. they crack it just to be able to use the dang thing.  Rediculous.
<br/>
<br/>
Even if SP2 or any updates required you to have a legal version of XP, you would just have to get a cracked version of the SP2 or any other updates.  The whole thing seems pointless to me.
<br/>
<br/>
As for harderware XP vs retail XP the price difference is something like $95.  XP Liscense with hardware = $5, retail price = $100.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
