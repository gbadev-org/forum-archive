Wireless, button-lacking, sleek, and tactile- everything you've come to expect from Nintendo, including a possible lack of long-term beauty.

Because of it's uniqueness, the Revolution's ability to handle 3rd party multi-console games would be abruptly blocked because it isn't a conventional controller, but if that is the case, couldn't they just use the GC controllers for those games?

don't worry!

Iwata has confirmed in his speech that the rev controller can be customized to become a regular controller.
<br/>
And if you don't want that....just use the Gamecube conrtroller.
<br/>
Also think of all the downloadable 2D classics which I(and many others) will play with the gamecube hori-controlpad(a SNES-pad rebuild for GC).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hot damn! I've always wanted to be able to use a single-handed controller! Excellent! :)  The whole "Remote" design makes perfect sense for the accesibility they were aiming for.  The A-Stick attached via a cord doesn't inhibit using of the motion-sensing, like it would if it were built-in. And you can turn it sideways to get an NES controller for the classic games it's supposed to be getting. As usual, I'm very impressed by the thought that Nintendo has put into this product.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't believe I didn't guess this thing, though.  I had already been thinking about the idea of a literally-"pointing" interface to a game. Darnit! :)

<br/>
Of course, let's just hope it can pull off the "precise movement" idea better than Die by the Sword did ;)

The Revolution can use the regular GameCube controllers just fine. So, any games that don't easily map to the new controller will just use the classic GameCube controller.

<br/>
The PS2 rarely uses the D-Pad in conjunction with the left A-Stick. Most of the time they are usable simultaneously, they just perform the same function.  Although, if you're talking about playing something like Street Fighter 2 where you want to use both the face buttons and the D-Pad, and intentionally avoid anolog control, I'd have to agree. Best options in that case might be to use two Revo-controllers or just stick with the GC controller.
<br/>
<br/>
Any word on Mario (or any other games) yet? Wasn't he going to present that at the TGS with the controller, or are they still holding off on that for another time?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.

Sold separately. People "switching" from a ps2/xbox background to Revolution won't have a GameCube controller, and the Wavebird wireless controller's receiver likely won't fit given the difference in the systems' form factors.

This is the same problem some developers have with the XBox 360 Core System.  They will have to assume that people don't have the hard drive when they are creating a game.  If these extensions (Classic Shell and "Nin-chakus") are not packaged in with the system, developers will have to assume that the Revolution controller itself is all the user has.  From what I've seen, Nintendo consoles have traditionally launched at $199.99, but if it came packaged with the two extensions, $249.99 would not bother me.  I seriously hope they package both extensions in with the system.  I want third party support on this system to be better than the GameCube's.
<br/>
<br/>
All skepticism aside, I am really excited by the Revolution's controller.  At first I was shocked by the look of it, but once I read the features, my mind filled with the possibilities.  Microsoft and Sony showed us what more horsepower can do to games, which in my opinion, is not a big surprise, but I feel Nintendo truly showed us the future of gaming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you watch the video of Iwata's keynote, he's already confirmed that the "nunchaku" A-Stick attachment will ship with the system.
<br/>
<br/>
Not sure about the classic shell, but I'd be surprised if it isn't in there too. But even if it's not included, it would only be about $25 max, so it's not exactly the same scenerio as MS's $100 hard drive.
<br/>
<br/>
On a different note, my favorite quote from Iwata's presentation is definitely "'I want to touch it!'" :D<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.
