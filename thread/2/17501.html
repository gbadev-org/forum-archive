    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Slot-1 cards like the SCDS2 work on the 3DS (I haven't tried any other card), and with that, I went and checked a few of the homebrew to see if they work. So far, everything I tested works just fine.
<br/>
<br/>
I was skeptical before, as Nintendo might have done something along the lines of having some universal binary within the 3DS that took the place of the ARM7 binary, but that doesn't seem to be the case.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Be careful when the update from Nintendo comes (like when the browser and DSiWare-move updates arrive), as it will possibly brick your 3DS if it has figured out the games/homebrew you have run through an illegal card are in the game's log of the system. This is speculation of course, as no one knows at the moment. 
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a 3DS, so I might ask some questions now?
<br/>
How is the loading times?
<br/>
Is the system hardware lagging the games?
<br/>
Is the DS/DSi resolution screens always blurry, even when booted up aspect?
<br/>
Is the bottom screen's 2D closer to OpenGL projected 2D, or the same awesome pixel perfect tiles/sprites that I have come to love since the SNES?
<br/>
<br/>
The lagging question requires you to run a game, or homebrew that scrolls a wrapping tile background continuously at the same speed, so that you can see if it jumps or not from time to time. If you answer yet to this one, then I would probably survive with a 3DS emulator with Windows lagging in the background, rather than buying the hardware. This is my opinion. I am so sick of new consoles lagging like PCs (Xbox 360)!
<br/>
I have already seen a huge lag in the splash screen of the 3DS (while a game loading, the red animated frames do freeze for a moment, which is so sad!).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: More questions, lol...
<br/>
<br/>
Do you think the 3DS is emulating DS graphics through OpenGL? To some of you, that would just make 3DS a handheld Wii, but to me that would end the SNES 2D era, just when I was so close to getting a 320x240 resolution DS screen (my dream since the DS came out)!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">Exceptions are fun</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

IMO, I doubt Nintendo would brick a 3DS in this scenario for a couple of reasons. One, they have no right to brick it. Two, even if they could, should they resort to such measures, it could potentially lead to the same thing that happened to the Wii with one of it's past updates, which bricked many legit Wiis.
<br/>
<br/>
About the 3DS running DS games (this would probably be best as a separate thread):
<br/>
<br/>
Load times - DS games load just slightly slower, but nothing to be up in arms about. 
<br/>
<br/>
Lag? - I have yet to see any. In fact, at least one person commented on another forum about some DS games actually running smoother (like more FPS). May sound odd, but in my mind, I figure it could be because of the hardware, while mimicking the DS environment in DS-mode, may not have some of the RAM access glitches and cycle-intensive CPU instructions that an actual DS would have.
<br/>
<br/>
Blurred resolution - Yes, it is somewhat blurry if you don't force a DS game to not stretch. You hold either Select or Start when you boot up a DS game to keep it at it's natural resolution. I really don't mind it being stretched though.
<br/>
<br/>
Bottom screen sprites - Obviously if it is stretched, they extended a bit, but in the natural resolution, it looks just fine like on any other DS unit.
<br/>
<br/>
DS emulated? - I couldn't really tell you, but imo, I don't think anything is emulated, mainly from the basis that if it were, then it would suffer from the same short battery life per charge as 3DS games do. I do want to check if it suffers from pixel fillrate issues that some DS games have shown when polygons are centralized in one area, to see if the hardware mimicks that, or if the 3DS hardware clears that problem.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I want to know that too!

<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Checked the fill-rate issue with my Metroid Prime: Hunters game at the very end, 2 doors away from the portal leading to the last boss. If you're really close to the door as it is opening on a DS, you'll notice how some of the scanlines right around the middle seem to have missing graphics (but not completely). On a 3DS, it is the same exact case.
<br/>
<br/>
Homebrew audio apps on the 3DS work just as they would on a DS. The maxmod library works just fine.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have recently stumbled across a problem that deals with DS homebrew on the 3DS. As most are aware, the 3DS can play DS games in either native resolution mode or stretched mode. The problem is with the touch-screen if you alternate between these two modes and recalibrate. If you run homebrew under native mode, and recalibrate afterwards, the touch screen input stays under native mode, even if the display mode is in stretched mode (meaning the 20% of the sides and lower region of the screen all report the minimum/maximum X/Y position. If you were to be running stretched mode just prior to recalibrating, and ran homebrew under native mode, the entire screen would represent the 256x192 area rather than just the portion the screen draws to.
<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea on what happens if you recalibrate before touching any DS homebrew on the 3DS. And just for those who ask, commercial games are not affected by this problem in any way.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
