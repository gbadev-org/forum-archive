    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the posts are being generated by a pattern matching/weighted word association bot.  It looks more advanced than a simple weighted next word algorithm.  The vocabulary it uses is very well selected.  Looking at it again, it might actually use weighted phrases.
<br/>
<br/>
The commerical reference is what gives this bot away.  To paraphrase Vampire Hunter D, "I've heard about bots that troll forums and occasionally insert commercial references.  It appears now I've met one."  I'll bet that if you take all of the posts and tally the words used, you will get a small high tally vocabulary.
<br/>
<br/>
I was burned by a search replace script troll years ago on comp.lang.c.  It made a few changes to my post and threw my own post back at me in question form and I fell for it.
<br/>
<br/>
My vote- delete the account and send the guy an email.  If he actually is legit, I think he's been acting like enough of an idiot to get his account suspended.

A bot made by a guy who is somewhat clever.  It probably scans and stores clauses/sentences/paragraphs, and then applies word replace to them.  There is a guy who creates bogus web pages by using nothing but search replace on legit articles.  If you replace a few core words, the post will appear to be based on some sort of logic (the original article/post) while actually being fabricated nonsense.  I'm more convinced that this is fabricated nonsense every time I look at the posts.

I saw better years ago, when a script/bot threw my own grammar back at me.  All you need is a template.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">The posts topics link fairly well, if strangely.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
The linked topics can be explained by a carefully constructed vocabulary list.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">If this is a bot, congrats as it is a good one.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
I do see a certain level of human discretion.  I think it's a coached bot.
<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that an advanced trolling tool (spam; money involved) is being used- templates, seach/replace, project vocabulary dictionary, sentence fragment dictionary.  With a tool like that, a coach could mass post semi nonsense with very little effort.  All they have to do is find a template and add the proper vocabulary.  I'll bet that after a month of doing something like that, you would be really really good at it.
<br/>
<br/>
If this really is a person, why are they not offended by my accusations?  Post a direct, coherent reply to me, and I might believe that you are a person.  It would depend on the reply, but I would certainly beleive that there is a person following the forum at that point.
