    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as I'm concerned WnterMute, sgtair and BiRedPimp are destroying the DS IRC community by habouring this black stain as an op in #dsdev. I'm no longer going to beg for his removal, instead I hail the people for support. The ops of #dsdev should take responsibility for the concerns of a large part of the online DS community. They refuse to listen to my repeated requests online to remove StoneCypher, so it's the duty of everyone now to make it known it's not acceptable. Because WntrMute and sgstair are both respected contributers to the scene it makes it difficult to point the finger at them for making this mistake. But they have made a mistake and it's time for the community to step in and change it. I advice that #dsdev be boycotted until stonecypher is removed. Until he is removed people should make protest. Just because they are big contributers it dosn't give them the right to destroy the community at the same time. Without standing up and voicing your opinion you can not help this situation. So let yourself be heard, and help make a change.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Please don't turn this into a flamewar thread so WntrMute has an excuse to close it.

On the other hand StoneCypher has helped quite a few people start homebrew.

And Liranuna, the author of Tales of Dagur, left the scene for personal reasons.

Sound advice, I feel. You're all blaming StoneCyper, for what? Telling you that you are wrong? Making you feel inadequate? Well sorry to remove the layers of bubble wrap your parents applied by hugging you too much, but welcome to the real world. You will make mistakes, you will go wrong. But learn from that and move on.
<br/>
<br/>
I admit, StoneCypher <span style="font-style: italic">can</span> be an ass, as I said in one of the numerous other threads the 'anti-Stone' group have made. But if argue like an adult with him, presenting evidence, talking politely and most of all being correct, he will listen. 
<br/>
<br/>
Hell, I've had several clashes with StoneCypher, but you know what? I GOT OVER IT (damn, I'm going to put that on a fucking T-shirt and sell it).
<br/>
<br/>
People joining the #mellowdsdev are just further weakening the scene.
<br/>
At one point StoneCypher actually tried to make amends with the #mellowdsdev people, but they wouldn't accept.
<br/>
<br/>
I urge people to join #dsdev on blitzed.org, to show solidarity for the scene. Come over, speak with StoneCypher. Get the other side of the story, without relying on the words spoken by the Anti-Stone group.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

Last time I spoke to SC he didn't even have DevKitPro installed, so he cant be too much help. I always see him arguing online, I never see him give good advice.

It's not about being in bubble wrap, it's as clear as day to me. I don't mind op's moderating like they should, but SC has a personal agenda that gets involved.

Splitting the community is bad, I'm sure we can agree, so why move to another channel? People going to #mellow (and I mean leaving other places to go there) would only split everything further. How is that helping? Better to be in one place and sort it out, than to boycott one, and move to another. Communities are always going to have problems, splitting, running away from those problems, will only weaken the community as a whole.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I do not think that a mod should shy away and be super polite, but if there is no need to be rude, then don't be - any responsible person knows that if you are rude to another person they are more likely to reply with rudeness.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I've never had any problems with anyone on IRC when I have been on, although I have witnessed power abuse. It is bad to the community on any level if it does exist, and if anyone abuses their power then they are not fit to be a mod anywhere.
<br/>
<br/>
The mods here are good and just, although sometimes I disagree with some locks/deletions decisions, they are perfectly justified and are based on forsight of bigger problems and making the scene look like a bunch of arguing teens.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've had disagreements with people in many walks of IRC, and many have said to me that I know nothing and should give up. And I'm in perfect agreement with that: no one person can hope to know everything, and as such it's pointless to argue over semantics. Sitting back and whining about it, however, is but the opt-out of a child.
<br/>
<br/>
Further to your statement that SC doesn't have DKP installed and doesn't release homebrew applications, there's good reason for that: he's a commercial developer, using Nintendo's SDK, and that allows insight into the differences between SDK and libnds, as discussed on IRC just yesterday.
<br/>
<br/>
As a final aside, if you wish not to look like an ass yourself, you may want to investigate a spell checker. The use of "tirant" in a context such as this does not endear your argument.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's not a matter of "GET OVER IT" for the people who are jaded by him. It's a matter of this guy is obviously over the wall out of his nuts, the logical approach of dealing with it is to tell admin, but in this can he is supported by admin. It's a big joke to them that he gets this response from people. It's not a joke to the majority of us.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the SDK, if he's a developer and bound by NDA, as far as I'm concerned it conflicts with is role as an op on the channel. It probably prevents any good advice coming from his mouth because of NDA. But I don't believe much of what he says including that he works for a games company.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

His behavious hasn't changed much over the last three years. It's curbed but not enough to make a difference. This isn't a grudge although Stone and admin will probably say it is. I am with same feelings with too many other people for it to be brushed under the rug like it normally is.

SC/WM/SG/BRP will say that I am a trouble maker, and I admit I have had my moments in the room. The last time I got banned was because I said I was shocked that SC was an op and didn't have DevkitARM installed. But I have been getting banned by him for a long time, and he's always had a personal issue with me because I stand by convictions and he dosn't like opinions that oppose his.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Get over it is fine if "getting over it" doesn't involve being banned from the community. I remember you from IRC and I remember getting quick immediate help from people who are there and not here. You should know the benefits of IRC access, so it's not a matter of just getting over it, if it needs to be settled it needs to be settled. It's almost like saying, "you have no access to dev kit arm, get over it", or more accurately, "you have no access to the IRC dev community, get over it". Put yourself in their shoes, and picture getting over it.

<br/>
And I am concerned that fragmenting the community is going to cause problems, especially if some people are exclusive to one channel.
<br/>
<br/>
This is why I question the decision for the anti-stone group to try and promote another channel, which they've been doing for some time.
<br/>
<br/>
I've held my tounge for many months now, not wanting to get involved, but now dragging this to the forums, which have little to do with IRC. That's pretty low. What you've run out of people on IRC who believe you, so now you come here too?
<br/>
<br/>
The group that will gain the support will be that that is reactive, not actively promoting fragmenting the community over something which is petty. 
<br/>
<br/>
Someone from this anti-stone group need to come forward with a list of grieviences they have and why. Then maybe we can get closer to resolving this.

The fact you make a joke about arguing StoneCypher and surving, tells me your more privvy to the problem that you let on. You may have got away with it but other people are being screwed. Just because you survived arguing with him dosn't make you cool. And the problem is there is a following behind StoneCypher that thinks his behaviour is cool. The fact he can confuse, belittle, abuse others in a channel doesn't make him cool or worthy as a leader.

It's not our job to tell you what he's done to the community. If you don't know what were talking about then thats fine, it shoudn't concern you. What should concern you is if you think you may ever use IRC to get support or chat with other developers. It may effect you then, but like most people things don't matter until they effect them.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You dont understand Zyr, but I appreciate your fresh perspective. Other avenues you expect the right way to go about a problem like this have been exhaused. This is the last alternative to gather the support of the community. The time for debate is over because the ops have made it clear there is no compomise.
<br/>
<br/>
What SC has done can only be understood by talking to people about it. It's also a conversation that has been done to death on IRC, so not everyone wants to talk about it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you feel you have such a strong case to oust StoneCypher then why not present it?
<br/>
I too have visited #mellowdsdev a long time ago and asked what it was all about. No one could tell me; and for some reason you still won't.
<br/>
<br/>
I propose we set up an IRC channel on Efnet, Blitzed or a completly network to try and resolve this matter. We have a panel of people, from both sides of the community as Ops, with the parties involved having voice.
<br/>
<br/>
To make it public as possible everyone is allowed to join but will not be voiced. Make the channel moderated and let parties argue it out, with a mixed group of mediators having ops. 
<br/>
<br/>
This should ensure a fair resolution, as both sides are represented and it will be public.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

Is that advice to the banned, or to the mods, or both? I think it is something that we should all look at. And it is important to the community, we wouldn't want people scared of the community because they are online when someone is immediately banned.

Instead of approaching the other ops with their grievances and attempting to resolve the matter in any reasonable way these people make threats, flood the channel and generally behave in a manner which indicates that they accept no responsibility for their own actions.
<br/>
<br/>
One of the most common excuses is "I was drunk I don't remember doing that" which might be grounds for some leeway if the incidents weren't a regular occurence and often a huge overreaction to some minor perceived sleight which would have been better left ignored.

I also dislike these threads being posted on these forums where you see things rapidly descending into personal attacks and opposing opinions being dismissed as supporters of the individual being attacked even when the viewpoint being expressed is both reasonable and moderate.

On first sight the poll seen here might be considered an attempt to raise an issue that some people think is relevant but if you talk to some of the parties involved you'll rapidly come to the conclusion that it's the work of a minority of badly behaved individuals using the boards as a personal soap box to avoid addressing their own unreasonable behaviour.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

He uses it to abuse others and as a way to power trip.
<br/>
<br/>
Being drunk, and the behavour of others has nothing to do with this. We have no problem with Mute, Stephen or BRP as ops. When the ops do seem to lack reason it's always related to a decision by StoneCyph. He corrupts the whole admin and you guys need to wake up and smell the coffee. The bottom line is he is destroying the online community and your letting it happen. I don't think you should place StoneCyph above more important contributers to the scene - those that actually contribute. There is no reason to have him as an op, he serves no purpose other than as the room's personal bully. Something that is not necessary in this sort of environment - a level headed person can decide who should be banned without resorting to mind games and the usual subsiquent stream of lies and nonsense that follows when you try to reason with him or appeal the decision.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That he's not suitable to be an op on #dsdev. That he can't wield power without abusing it for his own personal pleasure. That he hurts the community by splitting it and causing people to leave IRC. Because the price of having StoneCyph as an op is too high. He has been a problem for a long time and most people who have been on IRC enough know about him. Most people bow down to him to avoid conflict. This is why you get people with sigs like "I had a fight with StoneCyph and survived". It's like a big joke to some people that he's a real talent at arguing. When people get banned more often than not it's from arguing with Stone. Stone causes more bans because of personal conflict, not from policing the room or when someone breaks an actual rule.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When I said to face the facts about Stone, I mean lets not spin this whole thing on it's head and start calling it the fault of the users that this op's behaviour online is inappropriate. The facts are always going to be opinion when it comes to a personality or method someone uses. But there is a public opinion that matters when enough people say the same thing. I don't think StoneCyph is evil, nor do I think he's the boogyman of #dsdev. I just don't think people should have to put up with him when they go online to get support or socialise with other developers. These are facts because this is really happening to people in a real way so it's not my opinion that these things occured. I didn't start this thread to spout off my opinion. People are getting effected in a very real way. I believe the other ops know he dosn't make a good op, but he's been around since the founding of #gbadev. And he's the same style of op since all that time ago, nothing has changed.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Dynastab: look it up.  Nepotism has nothing to do with friends.  That's called "croneyism."  Nepotism is specifically about family.  Don't use words you don't understand.
<br/>
<br/>
It's also relatively amusing that the only "evidence" you mooks have come up with so far is an anonymous poll that you've just been flooding with generated accounts.  Every single time you guys have cried out for support, nobody supports you.  You keep intimating all this bad history, people keep asking you what it is, and you keep making excuses.
<br/>
<br/>
It's because it isn't there.  I honestly wonder how long it'll be before you realize how much of your own time you're wasting.<br/>_________________<br/>Quidquid Latine dictum sit, altum Sonatur

That's not the only place they ask for help.
<br/>
Every time someones asks for help in #dsdev, you come running first and shouting "NO NO THATS NOT TRUE!11! DONT DO IT LIKE THAT, LOOK AT THE <span style="font-weight: bold">FACTS</span>" while the person is actually asking is totally correct and even tested.
<br/>
<br/>
There are several cases like that, where you just point people to google and then when they despertly not finding anything (cause DS is not that documented yet, I, myself had to do quite a research about most of the features) you just call them 'n00bs', leave the channel and say 'WntrMute!11! YOU TAKE CARE OF TI, I CANT ANYMOER!"
<br/>
<br/>
Don't lie, I got logs - and if you want to know, I'm spying in #dsdev - both of them.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I think you should all take the bickering elsewhere. This forum is about gba/ds development and not IRC (yes, I know this is the offtopic section). Only a few of our 7500 members actually visit these irc channels and Id hate for them to (again) "have to" read about people who cant get along. Tbh I couldnt care less if people bitch on IRC but on this forum lets all try to stay civil and courteous to eachother.
