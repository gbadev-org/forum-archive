    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was just wondering what some of you guys recomend for a small lightweight laptop that I can just put in my messanger bag and take with no problem. I have a larger laptop, but now want about the smallest that I can get for a good price. I want it so that I won't have any problems lugging it to school to work on CS projects. It doesn't have to be the most powerful machine just needs to be able to run development tools like c/c++ compilers and the jdk. Please include what you like or don't like about certain products, brands, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Battery power life and lifespan are one of the most important as they can cost quite a bit to replace. 256MB is enough ram to be able to handle most development needs such as .NET and Eclipse.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, that's very true I need to consider battery life. 256 sounds good. I might even be able to find an inexpensive one with 512 who knows.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I doubt you'll find a small inexpensive laptop with good ram and good batterry lifetime. Looking at laptops I got the impression that specs diminish with size, while the price just goes through the roof.
<br/>
<br/>
Quite consequently, all the (2) laptops I ever bought are clunky beasts of around 2 or 3 kg - but they are still more portable than a full desktop + monitor.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are some tiny laptops here in Japan.  (Japan is especially proficient at making things small.)  The prices are not bad, depending on your budjet.  Say 1500~2000 USD.  I have no clue what the specs are.

Not that any of this really helps. =)

If you don't need it right away, I suggest you watch auctions for a couple of weeks while making low bids.  This way you can get a feel for the market.  Right now won't matter as much.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, have you checked <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pricewatch.com/" target="_blank">pricewatch</a>?  Prices are cheap, non-auction and therefore predictable.

That means that if you really want one, you need to buy it in that hour.  Consider with care. =)

<br/>
You probably will if you wait long enough.  Search closed auctions and look at the lapse between auctions.  This should give you an indication of how often they show up (and how much they go for).  You may have seen a low spike.  If so, you can play the auction game if you have time, or just not worry about it if not.
<br/>
<br/>
I recommend that you look at other laptops as well.  Even if you have your heart set something now, you might see something else that would be foolish to pass up.
