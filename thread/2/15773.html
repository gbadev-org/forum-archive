    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Beware! Random rant:
<br/>
<br/>
Not running Vista... "What I relief," I thought... until I found out, that Toshiba didn't supply XP drivers for my Satellite laptop (besides the Atheros wireless [no wired support under XP, until I installed some driver for the chipset, that works] and [a year old beta?] ATI display driver)... I had to search some compatible ones on the web... at a friend's... after haveing formated and having installing XP already... without any network drivers. X^C
<br/>
<br/>
Now I can't even change the brightness of my display (and my eyes are *very* sensitive to that) and I have to go with scarcely updated, buggy vendor specific display drivers that even crash the system occasionally... I never had so many bluescreens with any system. /:^o
<br/>
<br/>
So, after Vista got it's SP1, I might try it out again (although that means change and I am being forced to, which I very much can't handle very well), but I fear that it might screw up again (I mean really screw up even basic UI stuff that works perfectly in XP!) and it would all be a waste of time. 8^|
<br/>
<br/>
If I could, I would hate Microsoft and Toshiba for that. Microsoft for premature software release (I mean, Vista felt like an alpha version after working with it for a few weeks) and Toshiba for *specifically* not supporting XP, when everybody cried out in pain over Vista. X^(
<br/>
<br/>
... And why the heck don't they *let* (via custom firmware, I guess) the HD2600 be supported by the standard driver set? It's an all AMD system, just like my last one (which *was* supported by the standard driver set)... it has an ATI SB... all there, and yet it has to have those damn Toshiba drivers (at least for the GC.)
<br/>
And Folding@Home won't recognize the GC, too. I could have finished at least five times the work units with it by now! :^C
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I could go on. |^\
<br/>
<br/>
I mean, it's a very good system, but the enforcement policy they run to make sure you run the latest crap, it's really pulling it down. And for me, there were no other options, as I needed a mobile, yet very powerful system and I had only a very limited budget.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I guess the next laptop will be the new EeePC and then for more computational power, I'll get some decent desktop PC (hooked to a Full HD TV.) ;^)
<br/>
I am not good at using multiple systems, though. (That's been another reason for a powerful laptop.)

Tepples:  regarding brand recommendations -- There's not a certain brand of laptop I'd recommend more than others, but I have had trouble getting parts Ubuntu working correctly on both a toshiba lifebook, and a Compaq that used a Broadcom wireless adapter.  If you just do some googling, I'm sure you can find some good recomendations.

You couldn't get it to boot from the cd, or you installed, and it wouldn't boot from there?  Unfortunately, the default Ubuntu install cd doesn't work for all setups, so you sometimes need to use the "alternate install cd".[/quote]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you'll be able to open and close the laptop with just one hand (moving the monitor - not supporting the base with the other), it's fine, anything else might break the monitor casing sooner or later: I had it all - from first cracks after 3 months uo to breaking exactly the day after the warranty was over. And all were handled very carefully, explicitly to *not* make the moitor casing break, rarely closed and even less transported. :^C
<br/>
<br/>
The Toshiba Satellite seemed a nice solution, though. After all, I got it because I was fead up with breaking hardware... and you already know what I got into instead.

My point is that Chishm uses Windows less than weekly, per his comment about updates and my knowledge about Microsoft's update frequency. At that point, Wine becomes more and more viable. If not, I have a spare Windows XP machine for that, which I'm using to enter this post. But it's a desktop, and it's over seven years old.

As far as I know, one can only "try the hinge" in a brick-and-mortar store. Where I live (Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA), brick-and-mortar stores sell only laptops running Mac OS X or Windows Vista, not laptops running Ubuntu. What am I missing?

Dell has an Ubuntu page. Is a Dell Inspiron a good idea or a bad idea? And if so, is Intel graphics enough to run some of the free OpenGL games out there (especially StepMania)?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Does anyone really likes their computers hooked up to a HD TV?
<br/>
I do have a HD TV 32" 720p Sony BRAVIA. A few times I connected my PC to it to watch some things on a big TV that otherwise I can watch only on a computer. And that's about it, it's a TV not a monitor, the resolution is too low.
<br/>
<br/>
About Vista... My laptop is running vista for more then a year now. I can't say I like it more then XP but it does the work done. (No, I'm not working for Microsoft)
<br/>
<br/>
The things I hate most are quite simple:
<br/>
 - When I try to delete a folder Vista is telling me that something is using it...
<br/>
 - When I copy and paste file the new file looses focus and I can't directly rename it.
<br/>
<br/>
In matter of fact I hate all the OSes. It fills like every time I make an upgrade on my computer there is some OS that still works quite slow on it.
<br/>
I don't want the next cool visual theme. I just want my OS to boot up and shut down for under 10 sec. And to be able to operate with files without making me confirm everything 10 times and still fails after it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#159944 - silent_code - Tue Jul 08, 2008 7:35 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's the point: OSes try to be too smart these days and they fail miserably!
<br/>
<br/>
What drove me nuts in Vista (to the point I just fromatet the HDD and installed XP) were equally silly, small things, but those are the things you use the most!
<br/>
<br/>
Like, I like my folder content be sorted by file type and displaying a miniature (thumbnail preview), just like in XP. Only in Vista I wanted it to be set on "Big" for the icon size... and don't want any list or anything! I also like all folders look and behave the same...
<br/>
<br/>
Now what did Vista start to do? Reset my damn folder settings after each folder change! I got a list view every time and it also tried to be so damn smart and displayed multimedia controls and list headers for c:, when there were no media (no "real" media) on c:, but all my images, music and videos were on d: ... it drove me crazy, that I couldn't even set that damn behaviour! So, Vista basically assumed I'm a dumb computer noob (where: noob != dumb, but: dumb noob &lt; noob) and I don't know what I want...
<br/>
But I know XP in and out and I sure am *not* a dumb computer noob! X^C I WANT MY DAMN SETTING BACK! Vista doesn't allow for certain settings to be made, that were available in XP, like asking what to do when the power button is pressed... THAT'S DUMB! That's a step backwards.
<br/>
<br/>
Although they've made some really nice and useful additions and those were the things I missed in XP.

It makes StepMania a lot easier when both players can actually see the screen from five feet back. In fact, before HDTVs got cheap, I used to use an SDTV for this.

Speaking of StepMania, I want a laptop whose 3D card is supported well enough to run the Linux version of StepMania with SDTV output so that I can whip out the Ignition pads when I visit someone's house.

I do use Wine for some things. You have to remember that Wine Is Not an Emulator. It's an implementation of the Windows APIs and a binary compatibility layer for *nix systems. With VMware I'd have to run an entire OS inside a virtual machine but with Wine the applications run within Ubuntu itself.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

Windows XB is an underground nickname for the operating system of the Xbox video game console. Like Windows XP, Windows XB runs on roughly PC-style hardware, is based on the Windows 2000 kernel, uses DirectX graphics, and was released in late 2001. Unlike Windows XP, Windows XB requires all executables to be digitally signed by Microsoft.
<br/>
<br/>
The second major version of Windows XB, released in 2005, is designed for a 3-core PowerPC CPU and the rest of the Xbox 360 hardware.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
