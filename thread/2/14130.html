You mean <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/pass/#save" target="_blank">SaveMe</a>. I've hex viewed a Wii Sports save, and it looks like that's RSA'd too, so as to keep people from "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=illuminati+exploit" target="_blank">illuminating</a>" the Wii. But unless there's some sort of Trusted Computing going on, we may be able to observe Wii Sports being executed and find the key that it uses to sign saves, just as the people who created MechInstaller found MechAssault's key.
<br/>
<br/>
But is there a vulnerability in the GIF, JPEG, or PNG decoder of Photo Channel or Internet Channel? That's how various 2.x PSP firmwares got cracked, through vulnerabilities in the TIFF decoder.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Homebrew isn't looking good for the Wii.  It used to be that you could run GameCube homebrew on the Wii, but with the 3.0 patch, it blocked Action Replays and SD Loaders, so the only option (and I'm unsure if it works or not because I don't use it) is modchips.  I know someone wrote a DVD player but it only worked with a modchip.
<br/>
<br/>
Some ideas I'm thinking of:
<br/>
<br/>
*Exploit Photo Channel to crash and load data off of an SD card (Unlikely)
<br/>
*Crash the Browser using a bad Flash application (Possible, but they've fixed numerous potential entry points already)
<br/>
*Hack the Shop Channel to redirect to a PC server (kinda PSO-exploit-ish), but you'd have to crack the encryption first
<br/>
*Find another way to load GC homebrew, then somehow break out of GC mode back to Wii mode (near impossible, but who knows?)
<br/>
*There's a possibility of an unbricking mode (along the lines of the PSP battery hack, and my PDA (Dell Axim X50v) has a special mode to reflash firmware through SD card by holding a special button combination) where you would either press a button combo, short a motherboard terminal or jumper, attach something to USB port, or trigger an event over Bluetooth to reload an image (unlikely)
<br/>
*Use a modchip, dump the firmware, hack the firmware to allow unsigned code to run (along the lines of the DS FlashMe), then reflash it and remove the modchip, possibly do the same w/o modchip if Datel releases some sort of Homebrew disc along the lines of the SDML
<br/>
*Use the disc-swap trick (I tried, couldn't get it to work) where you take out an official GC game and insert a homebrew one before it boots, but this seems to have been fixed, as removing a disc during boot causes the system to reboot.
<br/>
*Exploit a game (possible, but there aren't too many Internet games out for the Wii yet)
<br/>
*Exploit a game save file (copy a save to the SD card, mess with it on the PC, send it back to the Wii, crash the game, and then load code from the SD)
<br/>
*Make an SD Load like code when the Wii Action Replay comes out, use it to run a homebrew firmware dumper (if you don't flash the firmware, Nintendo will kill compatibility with the next release, so a hacked firmware is a must)
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm out of ideas...but I really want some nice homebrew running on that shiny little console...it would make such a great $250 media center, I mean, the Wiimote is an awesome controller for a media center...
<br/>
<br/>
BTW...You CAN use the Wiimote (the Wii Remote controller) on your PC using a Bluetooth device, you can play emulators, games, even control the mouse and keyboard with it.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm pretty sure that it's hardware locked that once you enter GC mode, you're in it until reset or power off, but it has been brought up that maybe Nintendo broke loaders on the Wii because they may be used to get in GC mode, break out, then run homebrew on the Wii...still, it's unlikely.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd say hacking a save or a WiFi transmission would be more feasible, but hacking the disc encryption would be perfection, because you could use a pressed CD made by probably Datel to get homebrew, though pressed CDs are expensive and Nintendo will break compatibility, so make sure there's a firmware mod or workaround when possible.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

It already will.  MythTV developers are working on using a flash frontend so that you won't even need to hack anything, just browse to your MythBackend server.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: The problem with all the Datel (or any other manufacturer, for that matter) idaes is their products come out AFTER the homebrew scene has figured out how to do them.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does using GlovePIE count as Wii homebrew? I wouldn't think so, but then again, it could just be Wiimote homebrew, if that. Anyway, there have been a range of scripts written for use for the Wiimote, but only a few of them are any use. In calcprogrammer1's list, I'm personally thinking that it will be another Action Replay code to get homebrew first.

About getting a Wii that has never ever been updating and continuing development on that Wii. 
<br/>
<br/>
I was just thinking about all these PS3, PSP, and now Wii Region code change with game updates.
<br/>
<br/>
To be honest that is making owning an original PS3, PSP, Wii 1.0 or whatever priceless to owning any upgrades.
<br/>
<br/>
Hs anybody here attempted to backup there PS3, PSP, Wii 1.0 original non upgraded state before upgrading and then downgrading again.
<br/>
<br/>
About the Freeloader trick that allows you to play GCN games of any sort on your Wii. I forget if it works with Wii games also.
<br/>
<br/>
Can you load Freeloader and then load correctly written GCN game file on simular media and then load your program game file.
<br/>
<br/>
Also what about just deving for GCN that use Wii technology. I am sure the GCN and the Wii is not so far off in programming.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered an SD Media Launcher for GameCube.  If I can't get a Media Center on the Wii, I wish that the GC had one, it's still plenty powerful to handle the decoding, but no one's written anything like it.  There's GC-Linux, and it has media, but it only works from a PC server and I don't have a broadband adapter.
<br/>
<br/>
It'd be nice if the homebrew scene for GC were not so small...the only thing that seems to be out there is emulator ports.  Maybe if more people got the SDML...<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

exploit photo channels like tepples said

swap a game CD with a DVD(if they make a dvd player for it) sadly the firmware would most likely be 3.0

Or, make it switch to homebrew mode when certain buttons are held down, or something like that.

The Wii already uses DVD technology, just as the GameCube used Mini-DVD.  It's blocked by the firmware though, that's what modchips do currently, tell the firmware that backups/homebrew are real CD's instead of burned ones.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

The second point is what I'm afraid of, I could see Nintendo taking a Microsoft approach and checking systems via the internet. Wii homebrew is exciting though, I'd love to see what homebrew developers could come up with using the controller.

You can write your own firmware program, that it will fake the official one and switch memory using chip, so that it cannot be blocked or detected.
