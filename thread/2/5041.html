WTF does "sth" mean?
<br/>
Any ways, I assume that you are inquiring about if someone is/has "hacking"/"hacked" the PSP(PlayStation Portable).
<br/>
I don't believe so; because, mainly it has not been released here in the USA yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am sorry if I offended anyone with my comment, but the reason for it is that because mostly, if not all, hacks are made in the US.

Don't take every word that flies by your screen seriously, because "most" people generalize even if they, me, don't say it directly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's cool, I just thought it sounded funny, especially with the probably exaggerated view of americans as ignorant to the rest of the world fresh in mind. (World series in baseball, thank you very much :)
<br/>
<br/>
In conclusion, I wasn't offended nor do I mean to offend anyone with this post, and ofcourse I realize that a generalization is just that, and not something that applies to the whole .. something. And I'm not trying to get any kind of discussion started neither. :)<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Right..
<br/>
I'am sorry, but I cannot agree with you there.
<br/>
I claim that many hacks are scandinavian. But much of europe and asia are also comming strong nowdays.

How about we try to collect some "hack statistics" ? :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Once again I am on the defence.
<br/>
By "hacks" I was and still am reffering to the PSP and others like it.
<br/>
Ex:
<br/>
Nintendo DS,
<br/>
GBA/GBA SP,
<br/>
GameBoy,
<br/>
GameBoy Color,
<br/>
etc...
