Started working on Anguna for the iphone, but got bored, my developer account expired, and I don't plan on renewing it because apple's policies annoy me.  I'll either give up on it, or release it as an app for jailbroken phones.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been dabbling in the world of Android. And what a painful world it is! I didn't know how good we had it on the GBA and DS - where it's "write once, run anywhere" (on any DS at least).
<br/>
<br/>
On Android it seems it's "write once, run only on the one device you happen to have tested", on all the other devices you'll get crashes and weird bugs. And that's not even talking about API versions, I just use lowest-common-denominator Open GL ES 1.1 and Android 1.6.

My "favourite" review so far:

<br/>
<br/>
... Desire there refers to the phone model, an HTC Desire. I've seen the game in question running perfectly on a guy at work's HTC Desire, yet here it causes the phone to lock up. It's madness. At least it's a more or less open and hackable platform, I suppose.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Gratz.

I'm finally out of school for the summer. Other than work, I've gotten back into a little bit of drawing that I haven't done for almost a decade. Haven't focused a whole lot on programming, mainly because I had a major game assignment in my game architecture class (not just making games, but building up a game engine for it to run on). Java-based with JOGL, but I learned nonetheless.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
