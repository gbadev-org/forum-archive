    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a way to use homebrew cheat software to make Pokemon Pearl so that all HMs have zero power points? I also want to make it all pokemons can learn any HM. I have the SuperCard CF device and I want to know if it will work, and if so, how to do that.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe.  There is a homebrew cheat app that only works with original carts.  I forget what it is called, but you should be able to find it easily if you look around.  You will need to supply your own codes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is called <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=12622&amp;highlight=nitrohax" target="_blank">Nitro Hax</a>. You can use Action Replay DS codes except those that modify the modify the cheat engine. I've used it once and it worked quite well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The any pokemon learns any TM/HM code works, but the one for setting all PP to zero doesn't work.
