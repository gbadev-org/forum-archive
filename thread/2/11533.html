Companies have been known to do this kind of promotion before to attract customers... a few years back I got three free years with 1and1.com, just by signing up at the right time. That was awesome, but eventually you want to find a company and a package that suits your needs and is at a price you don't mind paying, as once you actually set up a website it can be a pain to take it all down again, transfer any databases, scripts, etc., as well as your DNS and e-mail to a new provider.

I want a shopping cart.  I could probably just use paypal though.

Is one gig in traffic a month enough?  (For my personal homepage, sure.  At first, sure- nobody will be looking at it.)  I get 32 megs a day in a 32 day month.  What happens if/when I go over that limit?

Most of the ones I see will stop any more traffic, but you may be able to pay to increase your bandwidth for the month.

Unless you've got huge images or streaming content, it should be plenty. You will have time to see if your traffic ever ramps up to that amount, and if it does you should have plenty of time deal with it.

You can create a robots.txt file that will keep most spiders from crawling into areas you don't want them to. Of course, those aren't usually the poorly written ones, but I suppose there's not much you can do about those... I don't think I've ever run into a problem with them, though.

Thanks.  I don't expect much traffic at first.  Naturally, I'm hoping for lots of traffic eventually. =P

The forum part uses about 5GB/month, with 3 million requests. Keep in mind though that most of the 'traffic' on your website will most likely be images and not the pages. This forum is quite low on fancy gfx. Imagine what would happend if everyone had a nice avatar next to their name =)

This forum (and gbadev.org for that matter) doesnt allow linking to external images, so they would have to be stored locally. Sure, most browsers would cache the avatars but even so, there would be a lot of different avatars to load. It would easily double the traffic and requests.

Without checking more than the search words....that seems to be an addon for the phpbb forum and not a general website script to keep evil bots away. Or did you mean that one could check and copy what predefined rules it uses to find evil bots and then incorporate it in your own website's anti-bad-bot script, and thus not needing to rely on raw weblogs to the same extent?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by SimonB on Sun Oct 29, 2006 12:52 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Actually, sometimes when a visitor is not logged in, googleads will show banners for "selected non-profit organizations". While I dont really like external images loading, I have looked away in this perticular case.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
