    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
i know that you can get the SDK for the Supercard ds Two on the forum at supercard.sc. 
<br/>
<br/>
So you know the Supercard DS Two has a lot of Power. So isnt it possible to port some of the Homebrew Software which is runnin very slow on the normal flashcards to the ds two. 4 example dsvideo or some emus that are runnin pretty slow. Also i have a DS lite with the good old slot two, and a SuperCard SD for it, are there any Homebrews which are using the extra memory of the SC SD? I only know DS Linux. When i think about it... 
<br/>
with the power of the SCDS2 and the extra Memory of the SCSD there must be a way to get a descent avi player etc. (no offense Moonshell is great but i?m sick of converting) also aren?t the new possibilities with the extra power and Memory?! 
<br/>
<br/>
thank you for any answers.. 
<br/>
(AND i know that the SDK for the SCDSTWO is not released yet, but see the forum) =)

I don't agree at all, it will not replace my acekard cause as you mantion it prolly draw more current and I will not use it for things another flashcard can do, but this device allow things no other flashcard can. like GBA emulation and video playing without reencode (ok i think they have not published binaries for that yet...) think also of the upcoming DS2x86...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

as far as I know, No. it is not possible to load gba rom unless you have a slot2 ram caridge. assuming you have one you can load the rom on the cart ram, and then reboot the nds in gba mode... so if you don't have a slot2 card featuring some ram (a ram extension or some slot2 flashcard like the M3 perfect) you're out of luck if you want to play gba, the same goes for a DSi since it got no slot2.
<br/>
<br/>
by the way the iPlayer is quite the same kind of hardware (with a processor and everything) and in fact it also offer a gba emulator.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's probably also worth noting that rumour says the iPlayer survived a court case in the netherlands, the supercard ds2 is already illegal by the same judgement and the recent UK judgement. <a href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2010/1932.html" target="_blank">http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2010/1932.html</a>

I already knew the iPlayer was the same kind of hardware - the supercard2 is a clone of that.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

hard to know, there are also rumor that iPlayer was made by supercard too...
<br/>
<br/>
anyway both card are great (or will be...) for thing not possible with other card. for more common stuff  they will consume more power or it is simply not possible, meaning I'll buy one but i'll keep my acekard at same time...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
