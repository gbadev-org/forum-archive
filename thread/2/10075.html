    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not really the right forum I know but I can't find a decent psp one so I thought it would be ok to post this in off-topic. Don't shoot me. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I want to do a 3d game so I'm thinking of using the psp or nds, but the sony fanboy in me is yelling out psp, so far I've found a toolchain installer, but I don't currently have a psp.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is, I suspect anyway, if I buy one now, won't it be loaded with 2+ firmware, which if I'm right is imcompatible with psp homebrew?
<br/>
<br/>
Are there any downgraders compatible with newer versions? If so, what tools(Physical, like link cable/memstick etc) will I need to do it? (I'm only buying the psp for dev so doesn't matter if I can't play the latest games...well I'll have to play Metal Gear Acid before I downgrade.) 
<br/>
<br/>
Also these memsticks that store the homebrew apps on, how do they interface with the pc? Usb? (Just hoping it's new a memory card slot only found on new pcs, mines pretty old )
<br/>
<br/>
Any help on part of that would be appreciated, it's a lot money to waste on something that won't work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Any good reason, other than you're familiar with other products from the same company? It's like buying an Xbox because you like Windows. You can <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.pocketheaven.com/DS_Shopping_List" target="_blank">buy a fully homebrew-enabled DS</a> cheaper than a PSP.

PSP firmware 2.01 through 2.60 is incompatible with homebrew if a vulnerable version of <span style="font-style: italic">Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories</span> is not available. This could happen for any of three reasons: <ul><li>The user is a minor. </li><li>The user lives in a country where <span style="font-style: italic">GTA</span> is banned from sale or import. </li><li>The disc is a newer version, pressed after Rockstar found and fixed the buffer overflow. </li></ul>

Memory Stick PRO Duo. My CF writer has such a Memory Stick slot.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
