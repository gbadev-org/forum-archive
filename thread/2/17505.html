No, that will not work. Once eShop is released in May, dsiware would be transferred by transferring the ticket, and downloading the title on 3DS strait from NUS. There's some dsiware transfer tool on DSi Shop(not available until May update of course) that would need downloaded on DSi to transfer to 3DS, I'm assuming that does the savedata transfer at least.
<br/>
Since 3DS would download the latest title from NUS, it would grab the <a class="postlink" href="http://hackmii.com/2011/01/sudokuhax-release/" target="_blank">patched</a> Sudoku.(sudokuhax is dead for that version)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
