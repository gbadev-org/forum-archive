    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello! I have a game that 've been working on for a while, and I would like to post it here for generall feedback and debugging purposes. It is the first game I have ever coded myself, so I'm actually very proud of the fact that it even works. How do I go about doing this? Do I just upload it to the demos section? If so, how would I go about updating it?<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

You still haven't exactly answered my question. The game is far from complete. I just have it to a working point. I want to be able to change it after a while. Is this possible?<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
