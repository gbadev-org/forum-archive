    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Out of curiosity, I decided to open up one of my broken N64 controllers and see what's inside. (It's broken because the main wire was cut somewhere or another.) I've been playing around with the idea of turning it into a standard USB input device (Or, god forbid, wiring it into my DS!) for a while... But I have no idea how.
<br/>
<br/>
What would be easiest for me to do, "hijack" the signals from the buttons and things before they get to the central CMOS chip, or take the Adaptoid route?

Ummm... Here's a pic. <a href="http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/n64-joystick-inside.jpg" target="_blank">http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/n64-joystick-inside.jpg</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why not check the inside of the n64 to see how the controller connects to the main console? It's possible that it uses a standard USB or serial connection and converts that to the controller plugin (like the Xbox does.). If so, you can pop that off, stick it into your compoter, and search the net for a driver for it. If not, I dunno. Sounds awesome though.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback. I'll look into the Joybus connection (any documentation on the N64's registers and such?)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I would've looked at how the controller connects to the main console, except that I knew for a fact that it wasn't similar anything I've seen before. Why? Because it only has three pins/slots. One for data, one for grounding, and one for power.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I should ask around and see if somebody could open up their Adaptoid...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
