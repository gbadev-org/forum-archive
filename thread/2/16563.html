<br/>
<br/>
I am here to ask your help in my master thesis: it is about online communities, worlds, contacts as a modern form of socialization. If you have some spare time, can you fill the form which is mentioned at the end of this post? 
<br/>
<br/>
I am very thankful for your help!

Free hosting doesn't have to work like that...there are plenty of places that are fairly good free hosts, without nasty bits like that, if you shop around.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nothing is really free.  "Free" hosting, "free" healthcare, etc all need to be paid for by somehow by somebody.  Ad based revenue struck me as normal.

Was it really that bad?  I thought "oh, an ad" and closed it.  I didn't even notice what it was for.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Overall, you're right, I was somewhat blowing it out of proportion...it started with a slight lack of trust due to tgyet's lack of previous posts, and I unfortunately blew it up from there.
<br/>
<br/>
That being said, fullscreen popunder ads ARE nasty -- I don't mind a banner somewhere, or other similar ads, but that one crossed my threshold of acceptability.  
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm doing the survey as we speak.  I apologize for making such a stink.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Don't worry about it.  I think moral of the story is, test out your free hosting before presenting it to other people.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
