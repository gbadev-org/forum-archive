    <h4>#257 - Burre - Sun Jan 05, 2003 5:33 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know, this is REALLY OT, but i figured since some ppl involved in gameprogramming for one console might be working on another platform as well, so I'll give it a try.
<br/>
<br/>
I stumbled over this cable called "PS2 upload USB cable" wich, as I understand can be used to transfer data from the PC to the console. Now over to the questions:
<br/>
<br/>
1. I figure the code sent will be 'unsigned'. Does it execute on the host machine? Will I have to chip the console in order to make that possible?
<br/>
<br/>
2. How does the transfer work? Is it possible to use in the same way as an MBV2 cable used in GBA dev? Since PS2 doesn't come equipped with a HD does it have a maxsize on the executables (like GBAs WRAM) or is it possible to use the PC HD as an 'virtual disc'?
<br/>
<br/>
3. Are there any inofficial C/C++ (or ASM) compilers available for the plattform (like metrowerks dev kit but freeware or GNU/GPL)?
<br/>
<br/>
4. Anyone with developing experience using the cable (or other method not including an official dev kit) that can varify if it is a viable solution for "semi-hobbyist" coding on the platform?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't own a PS2, much less coded one, so don't take any HW spec knowledge for granted. But I do know a bit computerscience and have programming experience, and since I love coding in closed environments (such as consoles), I figured a cable and a chip (if required) would make a VERY cheap dev kit.
<br/>
<br/>
Any and all information (tutorials, webpages and so fourth...) highly appreciated!<br/>_________________<br/>"The best optimizer is between your ears..."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
This might be of use, probably all on that site mentioned by SamX.
<br/>
<br/>
1 &amp; 2) The code seems to execute on the host machine, it's not like multiboot on the GB though, you need to somehow run a program Napkit or something, from a CD in the PS2, for this you can use the chipped option or you can use a plastic knife to fool it. The code is then loaded into memory on the PS2 (32mb only) and then executed.
<br/>
<br/>
3) There's GCC (surprise surprise!)
<br/>
<br/>
4) I'm not actually coding for the PS2 at the moment, only got one last week so I'll wait a while, but it's something I'd make a go of, I'd have to buy a few books on 3d though.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, Sony have released a hobbyist devkit for the PS2, it's Linux and it runs on the PS2, but you have your GCC etc. and you get 6/7 official Sony dev. manuals. It comes with a Keyboard, Mouse, Network Adapter and a 40gb Hard-disk. All for $200. There are obvious drawbacks though, it's Linux dev, not the way that it's done if you have an official devkit, but it's supposedly very close. You CAN'T play your own games on any PS2 that doesn't have the kit. Check it out at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.playstation2-linux.com" target="_blank">http://www.playstation2-linux.com</a>.

Hope it helps.

Doesn't sound like it's too far from MBV2. 32mb is quite little.

Does it run in Linux environment or native? Do you know when it will be available in Europe? Is the console playable allthough the kit is installed? Can't the code be transfered to PC and burned on CD?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
Well, first of all, you're right, it is similar to the MBV2, but it's not hardwired into the PS2 like the GB. 32mb is tiny, which makes me wonder why the official $10,000 devkits from Sony have more ram. There may be some kind of ram extrender in the works like there was for the N64.
<br/>
<br/>
IDEs or Libs, as far as I know, there's nothing more than the standard, which means notepad and a gcc makefile sadly.
<br/>
<br/>
It runs Linux, a twice altered version of Red Hat 6.1 for MIPS architecture processors (not 100% sure though). The Kit is currently available in Europe at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.LinuxPlay.com/" target="_blank">http://www.LinuxPlay.com/</a> prices are ?292,58 / ?191.23 Including VAT. Seems they deliver within 7 days.
<br/>
Console is still playable after install, just needs a reboot, also you can just unplug the kit anyway.
<br/>
As for burning your own game CDs, I'm not to sure of the finer points, but technically, you could move the code to the PC, recompile it under the mips gcc, then somehow burn it to a cd which has the PS2 initialisation codes in the boot sector, or whatever you do to that effect, but um... not a clue as to how that can be done. Sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm definitely getting one, just can't decide when.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looks good. ?293 is quite a price for the kit, almost 30% more than the console itself. Anyway I'll take it under concideration.

<br/>
The dev units have more ram because elf files with debug information are often significantly larger.  When loading lots of files with debug information you can potentially run out of ram quite quickly - how can you then debug and simulate a retail environment?  Answer: lots more ram :)
<br/>
<br/>
For anyone else that's interested, a group called Napalm at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.napalm-x.com" target="_blank">www.napalm-x.com</a> actually created a tool called Naplink (a client for win/linux, and a ps2 side server) that lets you send over your creations to the ps2.  These are the only guys to have done this for the homebrew scene, and that has opened up the scene for demos and emulators.  As far as hardware goes, you need a ps2 that has been chipped (by one of the various modchips out there) so that it can boot Naplink from CD.  You need also a Prolific PL-2301 or PL-2302 USB to USB cable (doublecheck the numbers tho - Naplink is particular from what I understand - I didnt buy the cable yet but plan to).  There are 2 public libraries being developed if (I remember right) to help making coding on the ps2 that much easier, and one of them can be found at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mouthshut.net" target="_blank">www.mouthshut.net</a>...
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to any who pursue coding on the ps2!

Cool. Yeah, that would explain the extra ram. You're obviously thinking of giving it a go. Let me know how you get on. Yeah, Naplink, yes, I referred to it as Napkit... oh well.<br/>_________________<br/>Dave</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
