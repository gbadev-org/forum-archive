    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got a 4GB Compact flash card I use for DS homebrew.
<br/>
It works fine in the DS still, as far as I can tell everything runs.
<br/>
<br/>
However, windows cant recognise it. Cant read it, cant write, and explore crashs if I go "right click&gt;&gt;propertys".
<br/>
No attempts to format with windows built-in abilitys work.
<br/>
(Command.com cant get to its drive letter either).
<br/>
<br/>
So I wondered if anyone knew any tools for reforming flash cards?
<br/>
<br/>
I used a program called "PC Inspector File Recovery", and that actualy managed to get my files off ok. So I know its possible to access with the hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
But I cant reformat it to remove the error :-/
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas? Recomended tools?
<br/>
Unfortuntely I dont have a linux installation to try it at the moment, gota wait till I get more hard drive space, so it will need to be windows tools.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --
