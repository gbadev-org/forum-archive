    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought a DS while I was on a trip to the US. I can't return it or anything like that. I have one broken pixel on the top screen (hardly noticable when display is bright). I have no broken pixel in the bottom display (touch screen).

<br/>
I don't know what to do really. Should I kill myself because of this broken pixel? I need to know if it is common of having broken pixels. Therefore I made this poll.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you could code a simple homebrew and run it (if you have a passme and gba card of course)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The pixel is not dead, but is stuck in colors. Sometimes you can't see it at all when it is a white background, when it is green background it is black, and with red background it is green.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it really possible to fix the broken pixels with this method?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In the US NOA is pretty good I hear about replacement, and stores usually handle it. Dead pixels are a normal "defect" for anything with an LCD. Laptops typically have a replacement policy for 8 or more dead pixels, sometimes more, sometimes less. They are generally considered normal, but manufacturers are still kind enough to try to replace them.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What if they made it run only when the lid is closed, and stop flashing if it detects the lid is opened? I think that might be OK. (Can't do this with a gba rom obviously, but in DS mode theres a bit somewhere that indicates wheather the lid is open or close</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am on vacation in the US, and I am going to replace my DS today. It's just so hard to spot the dead pixels so I'm a little bit worried. I want a perfect DS, and I have ordered a PassMe. I'm going to develop so much more for the DS then for the GBA because of the better graphics and sound, but most of all because it has the same IO REG functions as the GBA and I like that technology.
<br/>
<br/>
My dead pixel is pretty far away from the edge but is not in the middle. It looks white when the screen is black. I guess it is locked in the white color and that's why I didn't discover it when I first turned on the white themed DS operating system.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Doesn't the DS turn the screens off when it is closed.  Is that a hardware switch, or a software switch?  If it's software, you could do that.  But, it's just as easy to add a warning screen before it starts to cover lawsuits.[/quote]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

software switch. Theres a bit in one of the keys registers you can check if the lid is open or closed, then you call a sleep swi i think. Most homebrew doesn't do this, so they wont turn off when you close it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
