    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It depends on whether it was supposed to be more or less the same game.
<br/>
<br/>
They made Tony Hawk 3 for the GBA, and it was a isometric game, vaguely similar to the real THPS3 in terms of gameplay, but a completely different game when the 3d is removed.  But they still called it THPS3.
<br/>
<br/>
So, depending on who made this crazy claim, I would tend to think they were doing something like that....making a game LIKE Halo 2, but with a comletely different feel.  Top down or something.  And then somehow claiming it was a "port" of the actual game.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I'd even really doubt that.  I'd probably just guess that somebody is talking out their cheese-crack.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I partly agree. I thought it was certainly a good game, but not even remotely as "mindblowingly incredible" as everyone made it out to be (I have very little intrest in the sequel). I don't think it was marketing though, I think it was just thousands of console gamers that had never played a <span style="font-weight: bold">proper</span> FPS before.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as Halo on GBA, my main reaction (aside from, "What is tepples up to, now?" ;) ) would be an instant "red flag", followed by the following suspicions:
<br/>
1. Is some lamer kid tossing around BS again?
<br/>
2. Does someone not know the difference between "port" and "GBA remake"? (As in the THPS3 mentioned above)
<br/>
3. What framerate constitutes "working"? ;) If it was one frame per hour, I could totally believe it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You'd be suprised how much can be packed into a tiny space if you don't care about making the CPU do a trillion times as much work.  If you have infinite time, you don't usually need infinite space, and vice versa.
<br/>
<br/>
There's the possibility of using really low-quality textures and audio heavily compressed with a lossy algorithm. That wouldn't prevent it from being technically considered a port. Of course, strong compression of low-quality data alone probably wouldn't shrink it down to a normal cart size, but it could be combined with other tricks. Such as below:
<br/>
<br/>
If the claim is simply "Halo ported to GBA", nothing about that says the author couldn't have been an EE expert who made a super-high-capacity cart using bank switching, or maybe even a cart with an IDE interface to a hard drive. It would be extremely slow to be swapping so much data in and out of the GBA's tiny RAM (especially over IDE), but if framerate is *completely* ignored...it could work.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I highly doubt anyone would bother to go through all of this trouble to port Halo to GBA if it meant insanely unplayable framerates (which it probably would). But, I still think it's technically feasable.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I didn't really mean "one frame per hour" as an exact figure, but just as an example of "insanlely slow". ie. "one frame per hour", "one frame per day", "one frame per month", or whatever.
<br/>
<br/>
Ooohh!! Also, another idea: If someone were to say they "ported Halo to the GBA", maybe they didn't mean "GameBoy Advance", but some sort of supercomputer named something like "GreenBriar-Althena". :) Or maybe it means they completely removed all of the red components from all of the artwork, so it's no longer RGBA (Red Green Blue Alpha), but just GBA (Green Blue Alpha). ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
