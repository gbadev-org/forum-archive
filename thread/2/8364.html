    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I know some people in here are really into math. I am taking a college algebra course online and we don't have a textbook for the class(the teacher just gives up examples online). This isn't a very good way for me to learn so I was wandering if someone had experience with some books on this topic. What in your opinion is the best easy to understand book on the subject?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It kinda depends on the type of Algebra Course you're doing. For group theory and stuff in first year, I found Durbin's "Modern Algebra" to be really really useful - after that I just used lecture notes - a classmate of mine wrote these up for a linear algebra course, and I thought they were really helpful : <a href="http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/coursework/211/211.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/coursework/211/211.pdf</a>

If all else fails, in general, the undergraduate Springer Series books are wonderful for theory, and the  Schaum's Outline books are great for example problems.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.distractionware.com" target="_blank">http://www.distractionware.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's a tonne of free maths resources out there if you know where to look - have a look at these:

[edit] The first site was down when I went to get the link - so I got the google cache instead. It actually seems to be back up again, though.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.distractionware.com" target="_blank">http://www.distractionware.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, that looks great. Yeah, purple math is a good site to. For some reason I learn better from books than I do from online resources so I print a lot(I don't understand it).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
