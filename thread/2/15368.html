The machine itself does look entertaining enough, but the 'easiness' of development and better spec, as well as the non-existant user base put me off.

If I want to program something with lots of CPU power, I use my PC.

If I want to program something with that has detailed specs and documentation, I go to work.

If I want to program something that provides the bare minimum (yet is still very capable) I program my DS!

Not really too sure where this Pandora thing would fit into the mix... Plus what's with the name?! Pandora?

True story: When I asked in a Target store about the new Pandora handheld game system, I got told the release date for the next Dora the Explorer game. I guess it'll be yet another mail-order-only system, which doesn't represent a sizable market for commercial game products because a lot of parents are hesitant to mail-order a child's Christmas present.

That's what I first thought when I saw that Pandora thing: a sort of really small Linux based laptop. When my Palm m130 broke down, I wanted to find a good PDA replacement, which led me to the DS. Now that there's this Pandora, I might buy it too, if its available here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is a good idea. Now you can play word games as well, such as Word Warp (a game I play a lot on X-BIT), and you can do calculation quickly by pushing the numbers instead of have to move cursor every time to a different number to push, and other stuff as well. Will it have a touch-screen, or a serial port? I think it should have a touch screen, and a serial port, and also have a firmware upgrade file and BIOS, that if you hold down some combination on boot it will load from SD card directly without the operating system first. Is it compatible with GP2X at all?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I saw reference to this a while ago in your sig, tepples. It looks like an interesting device. If I were in the market for a neat little MID or UMPC, I might consider it more. Unfortunately, I don't know if I could buy a $330 device solely for homebrew applications. It is very impressive spec-wise, comparable to the PSP in terms of 3D performance (if not exceeding), but who knows how long it will take for that potential to be used without commercial software support? The thing I love about the DS is that it is a great system even if it didn't have homebrew support. Without a strong library for it or support, I don't think I'd get one. It does seem cool, though. I would like to see it become a reality and do well.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL
