    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't remember the "arm STD" ever being on the main site here, but if it ever was, I would assume it has been removed due to legal reasons. That particular page on his website is pretty old, so at that time the tools must have been on the site, but have thus been taken off.
<br/>
Why not just use DevKitARM or DevKitAdv that uses GCC which is free?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it because some old libraries are available only as object files for ARM SDT? Or is it because GCC's code generator emits slower code?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
