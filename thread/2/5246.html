Well of course ... but then ... who'd wanna work in a professional studio !?
<br/>
<br/>
:P

(only jokin' Mike)

<br/>
I'm more interested in people who are making a living as a GBA professional freelancer / contracter ...
<br/>
<br/>
Are people doing that ?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm certainly trying and am getting some contracts ... I'd love to hear from other GBA developers doing the same.<br/>_________________<br/>Qwak - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk</a> | Forum - <a href="http://www.qwak.co.uk/forum/" target="_blank">www.qwak.co.uk/forum/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think there are definitely a variety of other businesses out there who are fascinated with the idea of the GB being used for other marketing and/or education uses. I'm currently getting paid on a contract basis for some custom GBA stuff, but it's not through a licensed studio. 
<br/>
<br/>
Selling games is Nintendo's realm, but I don't see anything wrong with developing specific apps that get burned onto a few carts for targeted projects.
