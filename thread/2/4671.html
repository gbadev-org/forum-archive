Heres why it would suck:
<br/>
1. CPU
<br/>
The CPU is way to slow to run at any decent speed
<br/>
2. Memory
<br/>
Not enought physical memory, do you would need to swap it somewhere, probably with some kind of WLAN hack on a computer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not too sure, but it *might* work. Not very well though :(
<br/>
<br/>
There should be enough buttons for everything (Including a GS Cheat (<a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/images/smiles/icon_evil.gif">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>)button thingy) but the C-pad (Well, sorta like a pad) which could be put on the touch screen along with the analogue stick.
<br/>
<br/>
Ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
Possible Controls (If I can remember the DS controls correctly)
<br/>
<br/>
D-pad = (You guessed it) D-pad
<br/>
X(?) = Z
<br/>
Y(?) = Cheat menu
<br/>
Start = (Yes, you guessed it too) Start
<br/>
Select = Emulator pause (Touch screen goes into 'change settings/game' mode)
<br/>
A = A
<br/>
B = B
<br/>
L = L
<br/>
R = R
<br/>
Touch Screen = (In main control mode) Analogue Stick/C-Pad
<br/>
<br/>
Anything else? Do I have confirmation that the DS has X and Y buttons?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: You beat me by a few seconds I think :(. You forgot SCREEN: Tiny amount of screen real estate, hard to see most games designed for a TV.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But why would anyone need an N64 emu, all N64 games are going to get ported on DS anyways, that's how big N can sell a lot of old games that they just need to port, later on they might release new games (with new concepts?)

Which is why there is an off topic forum for these, so hopefully this becomes the newest addition to it.

<br/>
Well, I can tell you've put a lot of thought into your control scheme, especially considering that it would <span style="font-weight: bold">require three hands in order to play a game</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>netroid9 wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Possible Controls (If I can remember the DS controls correctly)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
The problem with your control scheme, other than also requiring three hands to effectively play (look at the control schemes for either Mario 64 or Metroid and ask yourself why you don't use the ABXY, Dpad, and touchscreen simultaneously),  is that often times the L and R buttons on the N64 are useless, and your A &amp; B are horizontal instead of vertical.  Look at a N64 controller to see what I'm talking about.  And in order to successfully mimic the N64 controls, the Z button would have to be placed on either shoulder button.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll tell you guys the same thing I told the GBA-SNES hopefuls: <span style="font-weight: bold">make the controls configurable</span>.  Each game has different requirements making a universal control scheme, when there aren't enough buttons to go around, useless.  For example, with Smash Bros. I remember two of the C buttons functioned as jump, while you could get the same result simply by pressing up.  But on other games they're necessary.  So let people define their own controls.  End of story.
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, control schemes are getting far too ahead of yourselves considering that N64 emulation is impossible (and by this I mean successful emulation, not emulation running at 10 fps with no sound and graphic glitches).  If we had the source to the N64 games in order to port them it would be no problem.  But because they have to be emulated instead then it's pretty much out of the question.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if anybody else would feel the same, but I can think of a few reasons to have even such a limited functioning emulator.  For one, I don't like SNES emulation on the PC.  When I'm at my computer I want to play PC games, or at least N64 or Playstation at the least.  But when I feel like playing the DS, I enjoy the scaled down RPGs and platformers of the 8bit and 16bit eras.  And there's just something about playing it on a handheld that makes it so much cooler.
<br/>
<br/>
Usually when I play my DS or GBA it's while sitting and watching television moreso than playing it outdoors on public transportation and such.  I would love to be able to load up a SNES emulator just to be able to sit on the couch and play it on my handheld instead of sitting at my desk or stretching my controller across and looking toward the monitor.  Also, I use my computer for a lot of television and video purposes, so running an emulator on the same screen that I'm also watching The Simpsons is not the greatest.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, a fully functioning emulator that isn't flashed with the multiboot would be far superior, but as I said this could be at least a start to get the ball rolling, so to speak.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I took a good look at the GP32 and did the research, and found that it was incredibly overrated.  The flash cards only hold a max of 128mb (incredibly lame), and the emulation is grossly overstated.  They don't successfully emulate, meaning full speed with sound and no graphical glitches.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The SNES emulator for example, says that to get Mario World running you need a frame skip of 4 or 5.  That is not successful emulation.
<br/>
<br/>
I also read a bit into something about being required to register the product, and by that point I decided that not only is it not for me but I truly hate the GP32.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ops, do you really hate GP32 ?? ... really ??
<br/>
<br/>
I?ve made two games for GP32 and of course I have tested every single emulator, and well of course SNES is not yet finished for GP32 and emulation with NO SOUND is almost GOOD, but with sound on the games need some frameskip :p
<br/>
<br/>
But of course GP32 doesn?t live only for SNES, also we have a PERFECT  emulation or near pefect for : NES, GB, GBC, GG, Master System, Genesis, PC-Engine (you can?t use save option for games...but emulation is perfect), ZX Expectrum,  Amstrad CPC, Commodore, MSX... and only this "little" list of emulators, run almost perfect.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, there?re emulators like ATARI 2600 or others that aren?t good at all (I never use them), but GP32 scene is powerfull and could do incredible things and at this point I can say without doubt, that GP32 scene is really more powerfull than GBA.

<br/>
The homebrew GBA scene is one of the largest homebrew console communities (I've never seen something like this), this is also because there is as much information about the GBA as about the GP32 (wich is an open source system...).
<br/>
<br/>
The problem with the GP32 is actually that there are no really good games for the console itself and that there are not many commercial games for that console. The device itself is quite powerfull and it would be possible to do more with it though...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

<br/>
Ok, commercial games are good, but if you want that, just buy an GBA, or something like that, GP32 is a little personal computer, because you have, emulators, Linux, e-books readers, media players, and things like that...
<br/>
<br/>
Most people (at least in Spain) who have GP32 is because they like playing "old school games", not commercial :p

<br/>
Only one little comment, it sounds not so nice when you say GP32 is dead...I can tell you that on 25th of december of 2004  rlyeh released the most pulished ZX Spectrum emulator for GP32, you must try it, and stop saying bad things to other consoles :P

I call bullshit.  It's claims like that which made me ever take an interest in the GP32, and when I realized they were indeed bullshit that I came to despise it so much.  Having a maximum of 128mb <span style="font-weight: bold">does not constitute anything close to a personal computer</span>.  I have a 256mb flash cart for my GBA, and while it's served me well I'm looking toward the gigabit products right now.  I came to realize that storage counts, especially when you're going to tout things like ebooks, video, music, etc.  In this respect, the GP32 when compared to the GBA is such a weenie system that it's pathetic.
<br/>
<br/>
All those emulators you listed are already available for the GBA.  Plus it runs native GBA, GBC and GB carts.  And flash carts which support far more than a meager 128mb.  So what reason would there ever be to spend money on a GP32 when you could get a GBA for far cheaper in addition to it being superior?
<br/>
<br/>
Who knows if the GP32 is dead yet, but more poignantly <span style="font-style: italic">who cares?</span>  It might as well be dead/it should be dead/it should have been dead a long time ago.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
