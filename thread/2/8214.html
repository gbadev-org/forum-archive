Thats the same as asking "how do I find a job?"  What do with the money you earn is up to you.
<br/>
<br/>
First, sign up with every temp agengy you can find.  Then apply to a whole bunch of places you don't want to work for.  The goal is botch interviews with companies you are not especailly in working for.
<br/>
<br/>
Take the first job you can get.  It doesn't matter what it is.  A job at the supermarket is cool.  You can always fail to list a job on your resume.  (I only list 20% to 40% of the jobs I've had.)
<br/>
<br/>
Drop your resume off everywhere, fill out every application you can get your hands on.  (Finding a job is more work than holding one.)  After you get a job with a company you don't want to work for, keep applying.  Go to every interview you are invited to.  The goal now is to get better at interviewing.  You can always decline a job offer (or take the job if it seems better than your current one).
<br/>
<br/>
After you find a job with a company that will look good on your resume, stay there for at least four or five years.  (Longer if you like them.)
<br/>
<br/>
Show your resume to every friend and relative who has been hired.  Do mock interviews with friends and relatives.  Write personalized cover letters when you hand out your resume.  Have multiple people proof read your cover letters.  (Your friends and relatives are certainly busy.  The goal is to get as much help as you can.)
<br/>
<br/>
You'll also want to do informational interviews with basically every company you can find that grants them.  Find out what the company does, who they hire, who they don't hire... find out if the person you are talking to like his or job, etc.  These are questions that are only appropriate in an informational interview.  Even if the company is in an idustry you are interested in, there are a fair amount of things that apply to finding a job in general.

No, it was an attempt to stay at least nominally on-topic.

I've found a position with a company that will look good on my resume. Trouble is that it pays $0.00 an hour for 15 hours a week because it's a volunteer position, and it offers zero opportunity to use a computer on the job because of company policy toward volunteers.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Periods of time that are unaccounted for look bad.  I don't list old jobs.  There are times where I have worked two or three jobs at once.  I only list the one that is most applicable.  I tend not to list old jobs.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone asks about a blank period of time, "I held a temporary job" is a fantastic response.  They might ask what you did.  If you held a retail position, then "retail" is a fine answer.
<br/>

A volunteer position isn't a job.  It's a volunteer position.

<br/>
A volunteer position isn't a job.  It's a volunteer position.  Keep looking and find a job.  A good volunteer position + McDonalds is a fantastic start.  That can be turned into a good volunteer position + something pseudo applicable.  That can be turned into an applicable job.

Yes, property is a sure way to make money. But buying to let may bring you much more money in the long run as you are essentially having people pay for your house. Simulate it in your heads; you'll be worth about a million within 10 years (in the UK at least).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't see why they automatically should get suspicious and what they should be suspicious of? Are you afraid they're gonna think you're a drug dealer or a hitman in between jobs? And if so, are you?
<br/>
<br/>
I have a few empty spaces between jobs in my CV because I like to take a month or two off to relax, something you don't get to do when you're in a job. Obviously these gaps between jobs are accounted for as holiday and if you say to a HR dude/dudette that you took the chance for some holiday between jobs I believe you're more likely to get a sympathetic nod rather than a suspicious look.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can fill that time in with study, or working as a full time babysitter. Self employment can also work - although lying is not good.
<br/>
<br/>
It is so much better if you can tell the truth in the most imaginative way. Sitting on your behind all day can be your housekeeping job. Your weekend chores become gardening jobs. Either you are a self run development team or your game programming was full time study / training. Your last website update was a project. The computers you fixed for your friends is part of your self run computer repair business - just create invoices and get them to sign.
<br/>
<br/>
Unless of course you actually were sitting around doing absolutely nothing all day it shouldn't be too hard to add a career perspective to most of the activities I guess a person such as yourself would have taken part in.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes that is one way of benefiting from the property market. However when you buy to let your profit is all of what was paid since you only put in the ?5-20k deposit. One guy I know is currently on 30 houses using this method alone. With the average london house price being ?300k ($480k), you can estimated his property value at around ?9M ($14.4M). This is because  ?7k is made from each house every year - and that is going easy on their rent ($800 per month will actually give you a 1 bedroom appartment). Two years gives you enough collatoral to purchase another house - although you can give it much more time to play safe.
<br/>
<br/>
More money 'can' be made by buying to sell at a profit but it is a different ball game, and there is much less risk in buying to let.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Fun topic - my side business actually :)
<br/>
<br/>
Just so you know, I am a believer in buy low and hold.  That's how I've made a good chunk of my retirement.  But by the numbers, a quick flip will earn you money faster.  Example:
<br/>
<br/>
Investor A and B has 150K to work with
<br/>
<br/>
Investor A buys a ARV 200K house for 130K, spends 10K to fix it, and sells it for 190K.  I can get this done in 4-6 weeks.  Total profit of 40-45K and all his equity is free for the next deal - but he has to find his next deal and be ready to work on it immediately.  Annualized return of about 200%.  If this investor can continually do this for a year (10 houses), it will have earned 400-450K in profits or more if they had re-invested the dividends from the previous sales.  This of course is a VERY full-time job.
<br/>
<br/>
B leverages the money to buy 5 of the above homes.  We'll say the rent covers all expenses for a break even amount.  While he now has 300K in equity in those homes, he must be a Land Lord as well.  This investor though will do well by paying down the mortgages and collectiong Yera to Year appreciation.  He no longer has to actively persue other houses and will literally be able to become a full-time LL on the income they produce in 20 years or less.
<br/>
<br/>
Investor A is a very active way to make a high return and have cash to expand.  Investor B has a low maintaince investment that will pay pretty much forever.  A mix of both is the way to go :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
