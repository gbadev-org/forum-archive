    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can anyone help me track this game down? It's a GBA port of the famous bullet-dodging game, which used to be downloadable from here (at this link: <a href="http://gbadev.org/index.php?ID=133" target="_blank">http://gbadev.org/index.php?ID=133</a>) but isn't any more, and I can't find it anywhere on the entire internet. Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you trying to get the exact program for the sake of completeness, or do you just want to play bullet-hell dodging? If the latter, then you might want to try Vulkanon, which is still on the front page of gbadev.org.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wanted the exact program, but have now found it elsewhere under its amended GBA title of "TrainX". Whether it was on GBADEV or not is a bit of a moot point anyway, as every single download on GBADEV gives me this message:

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Unfortunately there was a problem. If you can read this, you have most likely tried to download a file from our website. The server have not permitted you to do this however.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are some possible causes and solutions:
<br/>
<br/>
Cause: Your browser did not send a http referrer with your download request.
<br/>
Solution 1: Enable http referrer in your browser.
<br/>
Solution 2: Make sure your firewall does not remove the http referrer from http requests.
<br/>
<br/>
Cause: Illegal http referrer (another website is linking to our files).
<br/>
Solution: Use the search function and locate the file on our website.
<br/>
<br/>
Cause: The file does not exist.
<br/>
Solution: Contact us, and let us know that we have a bad link on our website.
<br/>

Hopefully these simple things will fix the problem. We apologize for the inconvenience!</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
