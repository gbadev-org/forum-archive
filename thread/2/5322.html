    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Some of you may remember that my parents wouldn't let me get a flash cart because they thought it was illegal and so on. However, after around a year, I have managed to convince them to allow me to get one. Yesterday, I gave my money to my dad, and got him to order it. As a result, I should have my cartridge within a few days, as it is a UK based company. I may even get it tomorrow. As you can tell, I'm excited.. Is there anything I'll need to check out in my games before I can run them on the GBA? Like headers, as I know you need the nintendo logo to get through the check. Will the cartridge just do that anyway?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Cool, nice going. I love convincing my parents to order stuff for me. So fun.

Anyway, what cartridge did you get, because most of the newer ones you won't need to worry about Nintendo logo's and so on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh, Tepples. Yea, the headers are fine now. I seriously doubt that hey'll do any of the more 'extreme' things you suggested though! Visa Buxx looks like a great idea, but it'll never happn, probably. Remember, it took a year to get the flash cart!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It never hurts to asks.  Even if you know your parents will say no, ask anyway to find out how they decline.
