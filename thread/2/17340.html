    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well what are you up to? I haven't posted here because I've not been doing anything DS related. Left my full time job almost a year ago, did some official DS development in a contract (which was fun) and I've been doing film editing and have invested in a Mac/iPhoneDev/CS4 Production Premium.
<br/>
<br/>
I still would like to do something DS related and have back logs of small things, like tile quantisation that I would some day like to spend some dedicated time investigating (though it might be too late). Unfortunately I've never committed to DS development other than studying the docs and using that throughout my contract.
<br/>
<br/>
Also not posting here often unless I'm doing something DS related, kinda lame being one of the top posters with nothing released specifically for the DS (unless you count my incremental garbage collection as something useful).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yes and no, but you're mostly right.
<br/>
<br/>
You can write code, and run it in the simulator, but you can't run it on the device unless either:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  You pay $99 per year
<br/>
2.  The device is jailbroken.

While it is a nice platform, Apple's ridiculous policies sure are a deterrent. (That and the lack of a real controller on the things - onscreen touch controls are terrible for most action games).

<br/>
I ended up getting into Pinball, I'm currently writing custom software in C for WPC tables using the FreeWPC OS and toolkit:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.oddchange.com/freewpc/" target="_blank">http://www.oddchange.com/freewpc/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It's a really cool project, I don't need to do any hardware mods to my table to run it, just burn the software to a 4mbit eprom, although I am using a Dataman S4 at the moment as a chip emulator to speed up testing.
<br/>
<br/>
I've got 2 tables now, "Twilight Zone" and "Lethal Weapon 3", the TZ was *not* cheap but I managed to find the LW3 in a shed, dirty and unloved, so I got it cheap and the chance to bring it back to life.
<br/>
<br/>
Coding for pinball really has put the fun back into it for me and the hardware is even more limited than the DS!  I get a 2MHz 6809 CPU and 8KB (yes, 8) RAM.  Certainly keeps the code cruft down, I can tell you.
<br/>

Outside Safari, the iPhone can only run Objective-C++ (of which standard C, standard C++, and Objective-C are subsets). This rules out sharing code between the iPhone and Windows Phone 7 versions of an app, or between the iPhone and Xbox 360 versions of a game if you aren't an established company, because standard C++ doesn't meet the "verifiably type-safe" requirement of Silverlight and XNA.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The iPhone simulator is very accurate. Not so much performance wise (should always test on hardware too) but it's a much better emulator than anything we have for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Also our game is being coded in C++ with only a very small amount of Objective-C. Not sure what the XBox has to do with anything where you have to code in C# anyway. C++ is more portable than C# is.

sonny_jim: I posted about your pinball software on Aussie Arcade and quite a few people found it very interesting (a few guys on there have made custom pinball machines from scratch). You should make a post on arcadecontrols.com; I'm sure there will be quite a bit of interest there too.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I dunno, I'm porting Anguna to the iPhone using the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.airplaysdk.com/" target="_blank">AirplaySDK</a>, a cross-platform SDK which lets you write your iPhone code in Windows in C++, and, if you're willing to pay $100 for the license, it will let you deploy to Android, BREW, older Windows Mobile (they're working on trying to add Windows Phone 7 support), and others.
