    <h4>#93721 - DynamicStability - Thu Jul 20, 2006 9:58 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was banned from DSDev by BigRedPmp like 3 months ago.  I had broken the spamming rule because I was 1. drunk. 2. trying to help someone that wasn't listening.
<br/>
<br/>
After being banned for a month or two, and being completely ignored by said BRP, trying to appologize and get back in, WntrMute unbanned me.  That lasted a whole 10 minutes till StoneCyph banned me saying I was "tricking other ops into lifting brp's ban."  
<br/>
<br/>
StoneCypher then gave me the idea to use gaim or some program that just gets a list of people in the channel...I wanted to figure out if some people were online but I didn't know their current nicks.  Well, for some reason gaim let me connect into the room, and stone banned me for 'ban dodging'.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Point Is....  I formally appologize for being drunk and disorderly in the channel and for disrespecting you BRP.  I hope you haev not passed on, and that life is okay for you.  To the other 4 bots and 2 ops left in DSDev, can you have some pity on my soul.  Seriously, I cant get a permban for this shit.  I can't talk to anyone like this.
<br/>
<br/>
Or, how do i talk to someone that has me on ignore?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by DynamicStability on Fri Jul 21, 2006 6:55 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

It is possible that BigRedPmp is a Muslim*, and lack of access to DS homebrew resources is your punishment for drinking alcohol. Workaround: Develop for the GP2X instead.

Actually, I doubt it, as with most (if not all) homebrew scenes, it attract a lot of "kids".  So, as it is mainly "kids" that have time to learn and develope homebrew, "teh scene" will always be imature.

Interesting theory.  But I wouldn't say the kids are the problem....nor the 'kids that have time to learn and develop homebrew'.  I've seen quite a bit of trouble in the scene caused by 'adults' that don't even 'develop homebrew'.

Although I am not privy to the actual incident and I have, on occasion,  been witness to dyna's offensiveness towards the ops, I will vouch for the fact that he is one of few developers who actually write and release DS related code on a regular basis.
<br/>
<br/>
He is hosted on my domain (I am too lazy to lookup the actual subdomain) if you realy care to see his many demos.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't understand why people get perma-banned for issues such as this when /ignore usually does the trick nor why one op cant give someone a second chance when the op that did the banning is not available for comment (it takes about 3 seconds to ban him again when the op comes back if it is that big of a deal),  but...irc being what it is... pissing off an op in an irc channel generally results in this sort of thing and taking it this seriously probably isn't helping the cause.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Probably won't work as most DHCP servers retain your lease with that MAC address.. You'd either have to change your MAC address or wait till the lease expires before you would receive a new IP from the DHCP server.  You can usually check the length of your lease either on the router or if you are direct connected, ipconfig /all for windows.  Most routers allow you to change your MAC, so it'd be easier just to change it for a few days (pick whatever you like :) ) and then change it back if you really care what your MAC is.

As for banning on IRC, it's usually just an OP on an ego trip.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
