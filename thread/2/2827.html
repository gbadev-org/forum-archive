    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all, i'm new here and have something for who would like to create his own game and run a little production. Me and my friends are planning to make cartridge cases for GBA so that anyone of you who is going or thinking to make games for GBA and needs some cases, can ask to us.
<br/>
Right now it's only an idea but if anyone is interested we can discuss about that. We have a great experience in creating all sort of objects with resins, fybers and particular materials. If you got informed about having cartridge cases produced you surely know that you can spend 5/10 thousand dollars just to have a factory create the mold. We would be able to create cartridge cases which looks like the original one for few euros each and also for little quantity. Should anyone be interested just let me know!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">a few euro's each? just for the plastic casing?
<br/>
some 'people' will give you a complete pcb with 64mbit rom, casing, manual and box for 3.5$ each if you order 1000.

crossraleigh, i've already contacted them, thanks, i'm waiting to know if they are interested, but maybe not, i didn't thought a cartridge was as cheap as 3.5$ :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it would be really nice if a website would be able to step up and take on something like this.  I think that <a class="postlink" href="http://www.atariage.com/" target="_blank">http://www.atariage.com/</a> does something similar for the Atari homebrew scene.  But, 2600 carts are usually a bit simpler than a GBA cart :)
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if gbadev (or some other GBA oriented site) would be willing to do something like this?  Maybe even offer homebrew carts on demand for a price, or just stockpile copies of various titles (of course, all with the developer's approval) and sell as orders come in.
<br/>
<br/>
I know there are a few homebrew titles that I wouldn't mind paying to have in a more permanent format -- plus, it would allow smaller developers to get a little more than recognition (but, not much more -- no one's gonna get rich off this :D)<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lik Sang may be interested in selling it, they have been selling Dreamcast homebrew stuff before.
<br/>
How about checking if people are interested to contribute to a compilation cart containing multiboot games and demos, maybe even a competition again =)<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The problem is that the minimum order is 1000 carts. And I think the minimum for the boxes and manuals were 2000.
<br/>
If one managed to get the carts to a reseller (probably internet stores) at ~7$usd per cart, said reseller would prolly want 5ish $usd to sell each cart.
<br/>
Would it be easy to sell 1000-2000 copies of a multi-game compilation for 12$? Would also be nice if the people making the games would get
<br/>
a small profit on the carts too, so it would probably be more like 15$+shipping for anyone interested in the game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Depending on the games in the compilation, I'd be willing to pay $15 for a cart.  Do these carts have SRAM?  If so, how reliable is it.  My brother picked up some pirate gameboy games on ebay a while back (without knowing that the carts were fake) and the SRAM stopped working almost right away.

Would it be cheaper to use Atmel flash than SRAM?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
