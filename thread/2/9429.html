    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">These are just some random off-topic concerns I have.
<br/>
<br/>
(1) Why are we not allowed to post pictures in topics? I normally wouldn't object, but I have some math related issues that would be much better illustrated with graphs.
<br/>
<br/>
(2) As a general rule, what things must (Ok, "should") be included in any official readme for a game? 
<br/>
<br/>
(3) If I just want to randomly post a binary without actually making an update to a game (say, to give an example of an issue or concept) is there a way I can host it somewhere for like a week or something? This would help a bunch.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">(1) You can post picture, but it won't display it until you click on it.
<br/>
<br/>
(2) The readme file should probably include title of game, web-site for game, version number, author, description of the game, and the controls to use. Probably it would include things that might be in a printed manual.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Replacement of images with links are a an old mod done to the forum. I am personally very happy with it, as it will not allow signatures with images. The lack of these sigs actually makes this forum feel a bit more concentrated about what it's really about - GBA dev, and not some ePenis graphics contest.
<br/>
<br/>
Readme's should include: Authors, contact addresses, compo name, sponsor websites, and a description of how to play the game.
<br/>
<br/>
As for binaries, there are loads of ways to get space today. The best would be to set up your own dedicated server, or to get access to a small amount of room on a friends server. Then there are all sorts of free (but advertised and hotlink-killing) newbie webhosts (geocities, etc), and last and worst: Temporary file storage services.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because they take time to download and can be abused.  There are plenty of other forums where you can post pictures.

Anything you:

B) Anything else you want people to know

I describe all files and their usage.

Isn't that about the amount of time it takes the geocities people to remove content?  Others have mentioned better solutions.
