Bear in mind this (as I understand it) is not running on actual hardware, and we can probably expect improvements to the game as time goes on.
<br/>
Typically 1st generation titles do not draw on the full potential of a game system.  Personally, I am impressed with things so far.  Looking forward to what Nintendo's DS has to offer as well.

PS: The footage is crappy quality crap cam footage crap. Crap again. But the game is still impressive.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I saw the PSP emulator running at the GDC a few days ago in San Jose. It looks alright, but not as impressive as they try to make it sound. I'm sure it will take some time before we really see what this thing will be able to do. I sat in on the PSP developer session and heard about all the specs and programming API. It does sound good and everyone was excited. I hope they make a way for small developers to make games for it too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
