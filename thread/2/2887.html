    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone ordered anything from Linkerworld? I placed an order back in December and still haven't recieved my order. My status on their webpage is still Pending and all of my requests for a refund have been ignored. I've sent lots of emails over the last several weeks and I've gotten no response.
<br/>

Does anyone have a phone number maybe? I want my money back.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I read your post and started to get worried cause I placed an order with em about 3 weeks ago. I did a bit of searching and found a few people saying not to use them. I sent of a query using thier online form as mine was still stating pending. Within a few hours, my status had been updated to "Delivered" and I got an email with tracking details for honkkongpost.

To be honest, they sound like dodgy f*ckers, but I'll keep you posted on what happens. If you have any troubles, you can always go to <a href="http://www.paysystems.com" target="_blank">www.paysystems.com</a> and get them to refund your money (was gonna do that tomorrow if I hadn't got a reply). I've also heard that EZFA's are in a bit of a shortage at the moment (if that is what you ordered) so maybe they are justified in that (but the customer service about it is still sh*t).

<br/>
Hope all goes well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, thanks alot for the suggestion. I hadn't thought of it. I went to myPaySystems and put in for a refund. It says if they don't respond within 48 hours they'll automatically refund me. Considering how prompt Linkerworld has been in reponding to me, I figure the chances are good that my money will be on its way back in the next couple of days. I was getting worried that I'd never see my money again. Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well all went 'well' here. My cart arrived today and works without any issue. Hopefully it won't have any problems cause i really don't want to try and deal with them again.

Hows the credit card stuff going?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It looks like my money is on its way back. I still haven't heard from Linkerworld but I don't plan to. If they don't want to respond to any of my questions then I don't think I need to tell them I pulled my money out from under them. My order still says it's pending but mPaySystems says my refund was apporoved so I'm not worried any more. Caveot Emptor re: Linkerworld.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
