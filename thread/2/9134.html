    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to know the standard deal structures for licenses. For example, let's say I would want to have a deal with Kawasaki for my motocross game.

<br/>
I don't even know if it is the company owner of the license that pays since the game is a great publicity or if it is to the developper (or publisher) to pay to use the name.
<br/>
<br/>
It's obvious that in some case like Tony Hawk's games, the $$$ goes to Tony, but is there situations where it's the opposite ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am guessing if you don't have the name recognition, then you will probably have to pay.  Yeah, it's marketting for Kawasaki, but you are essentially using their design/brand to attract people to your game.  Look at Gran Turismo, at the beginning, they had to do lots of work to get cars into their games, but when GT became hot properties, lots of car companies came to them.  The car companies also put restrictions on what they can do with the car models (no damages).  The company may even want to approve the final game because they worry your game might give people bad impressions about their product.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
