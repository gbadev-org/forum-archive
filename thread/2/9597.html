LOL, can anyone say stupid?

I got banned for talking about making multiple save-files for my pixel-project, or the pixel-proj itself, the admin was never clear on it.  Screw that crap.  Maybe I should just give up on the Internet entirely -  I'm sick of the crap.  I'll just stay offline for a month and see what happens.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can talk about homebrew in moderation, but when it becomes something that could possibly be bordering on the edge of the law in some peoples' minds (eg flash cartridges), the topic will get locked. The forum rules state this, so if you do it more than a few times, a banning seems wholly acceptable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
