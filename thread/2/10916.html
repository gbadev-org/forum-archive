<br/>
Perhaps try some headphones that has anti-sound and little coolers in it :)

Explain to her that the cooling effects of a fan work by removing hot air from around your body. If no body (double meaning intended) is around to have their heat removed, the fan is doing more harm than good. The motor adds to the heat in the room and the fan is wasting electricity (and therefore money).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I don't know the person, but I honestly can't see this explanation
<br/>
working with anyone who runs a fan in every room.  (I might be wrong.)
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any air circulation?  You might consider pointing one fan out
<br/>
the window, and another in front of another window pointing into the
<br/>
room.  (Not that this helps if you don't want fans in the first place.)
<br/>
<br/>
If somebody else pays the bills, then you are essentially a guest.
<br/>
It is within their power to tell you to leave so upsetting them is
<br/>
generally not a good idea.  (It all depends on what kind of a
<br/>
relationship you have with the other person.  Some parents would
<br/>
never kick their children out of the house, etc.)
<br/>
<br/>
The heat is the only thing I can give advice on (ice pack, hachimaki).
<br/>
Are the fans and radio run at night?  Is typing or staying up late
<br/>
at night taboo?
