    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Phantasy Star 0 will have no public lobbies(boo), since this would circumvent the friend-code-as-doorman policy that Nintendo has regarding its WiFi service. Someone (on another forum) mentioned that the Pay &amp; Play service wouldn't have this requirement.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this accurate (just the Nintendo policies--I'm not looking for confirmation on the PS0 stuff.) Does anyone have a link to something official, or at least especially credible? I haven't found anything myself.
<br/>
<br/>
I really didn't mind the friend code thing until now. Mostly because most games I'd play online would be equally fun with random people. (IMO Mario Kart is way more fun ad hoc, but I'd be interested in playing PS0 online quite a bit.)<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
