Personally we can find everyting here from every other time zone. We got Confederates in the Southern States, Naszi here and there, Even a Slave or two, Berlesk houses, and so on.
<br/>
<br/>
Store houses full of heat beams, micro machines, dragon DNA, The lost maps of yesterday.
<br/>
<br/>
We have Giant Squids, Giant Dragon lizards with Bateria breath, Giant turtles, Giant rodents big enough to train as dogs, Giant Spiders that makes "Jeepers Creepers" Snatcher look like nothing, and Giant cats.
<br/>
<br/>
We have dolphins that are human like along with sharks who are beast like.
<br/>
<br/>
We can have and harnest technology to do about anything even the so called 4d Time Travel, We even put people on the moon.
<br/>
<br/>
Right now we have Water cars and cars that can go on water literially. We have Flying cars just like in the movies. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Germans had plans for flying saucers which we have been mimicing  for years. Russia has a coupe of saucers and so does the US. We have them as toys now for less then $45 to $200 dollars.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

They all tend to just give more dramatic things to everyday technology.

We have a lot of the things in the movies, it just doesn't look and sound as cool. Though, the movie versions tend to be more advanced - our cell phones don't project 3D holograms, our cars don't fly, our Internet isn't accessible from literally anywhere in the world wirelessly, etc... <span style="font-style: italic">yet.</span> ;-)

That's some form of disproof for the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox" target="_blank">grandfather paradox</a>. In laymen's terms it means that no object can change something in its past.
<br/>
<br/>
This should also disprove the possibility of travelling into the future and changing that future, since that perceived future affected the state of your eyes, anything that follows is now dependant on that future so now that future cannot be changed since it is no longer the future but the past!!!

One thing it mentioned was taking two ends of a worm hole and sending one out in space and bringing it back, due to Einstein's relativity, walking through the wormhole would put you into the future. I think if people in the future have discovered time travel they don't make themselves known because we as a race aren't ready enough, we haven't learned all that is necessary. And the only way society learns is through experience.

What do you base your theory on?
<br/>
The way I understand it:
<br/>
1st dimention: Two directions of movement
<br/>
2nd dimention: Four directions of movement (2D movement + instantaneous movement in 1D (fold a piece of string flat on a table))
<br/>
3rd dimention: Six directions of movement (3D movement + instantaneous movement in 2D (fold a piece of paper))
<br/>
4th Dimention: Eight directions of movement (Instantaneous movement in 3D(wormhole?))
<br/>
5th dimention: Ten directions of movement (4D + time travel)
<br/>
<br/>
So what makes you say if you time travel you would lose your ability to move through space?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's interesting to try to think how a 2D person would perceive a 2D world. Then imagine you put them in a 3D world. They'd still see only in 2 dimensions, but then they'd take a step to the left or right... it'd be as if they just moved into an alternate, but likely very similar world. It might look very different to them, because they might have e.g. just stepped in front of something, but chances are it looks similar. That gives you some idea of what it would be like for us to move in the 4th dimension. More food for thought: maybe the 2D perspective is correct, and being 3D just means we can see and process several of these worlds at once?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, interesting perspective trick I noticed the other day. If you draw a cube on paper, the corners will come out something like this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">Y Z

There's a pattern; a line rotated 45? from the previous one. So continue it:

<br/>
We can not be visited by time travelers for this reason. (not human ones anyway :p)
<br/>
<br/>
Any deliberate change would set up a feedback loop that would instantiously resolve itself to be a stable timeline. (that is, one where your own actions in the past dont change your trip to the past in any way).
<br/>
<br/>
It annoys me when paradox's and other dimensions and such are brought up in time travel, because its a solved problem.
<br/>
<br/>
You can not cause a change in the past without first causing a change to your own journey into the past, which will, in turn, set up another change. 
<br/>
Even the very air and heat brought with you in the time machine will displace atoms and subtly change the future, and thus your trip back.
<br/>
Theres no paradox to this, its just a feedback loop that will continue untill the timeline is stable.
<br/>
Its hard too visualise or comprehend the "human scale" effect of that, but it would be the minimum change needed for the timeline to stop looping.
<br/>
Could be your time machine stopping working, could be you were never born, could be something as minor as a change in your brain chemestry just enough too stop you wanting to kill your grandfather ;)

<br/>
<br/>
Heat, Sound and Explosions are merely propertys of other particals.
<br/>
They are 3d discription of a 4D shape, in effect.
<br/>
So its not that they are restricted, its that the 4d "shape" we view as those 3D movements we call heat, sound, ect.
<br/>
In order for there to be a 4D explosion, there would have to be at least 5D, because it will take 1 dimension to messure the change in the other 4...do you see?
<br/>
<br/>
However, gravity *does* work in higher dimensions, its completely nutral too direction or dimension.
<br/>
The effects of gravity on our speed though time are well known, studyied and even messured.
<br/>
<br/>
Put simply, in theory, passing over a point were a dense object used too be, will slow you down in time slightly relative to that around you.
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, one of the current lines of study involves looking at small scale gravity to work out how many dimensions there are. (in a hope of limiting down some of the string theorys, that are currently so diverse as to be useless).

Its a very nice site, and upto 5-6 dimensions it makes sense.
<br/>
Beyond that it lose's its way.
<br/>
The connection to string theory isn't like that anyway.
<br/>
Dimensions are kinda a place to store the information of mater as far as string theory goes.
<br/>
They haven't got them numbered or listed as meaning stuff what the site implies.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, Id argue you could say you need infinite dimensions to cover all possibilities.
<br/>
Because, however many dimensions you got, to store/mesure *change* in those dimensions, would take...another dimension :p
<br/>
So you could go on again.

Still, its a nice site, and its very good visual explanation.

Exactly, but this does raise the possibility that time travel would be possible if we were hit (gained an impulse) from another object already "time traveling" relative to us.

Also, I agree there is no reason to belief its possible.

Paradoxs are just an illusion caused by people seeing events as discrete instantanious things. ("kill grandfather") rather then the continious flow of events that make them up.

Splitting the time stream is a fantasy fix.

The only paradox of time travel is changing the past. It is not a paradox because we are not capable of understanding it but because the scenario contradicts itself. That's why I wrote a 'proof' for it, well the proof is merely state transition itself, but the splitting time streams and branching are the <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> other possible explanations.

However multiple time lines is completely made up.

How about, you can't go back in time and change things because you didn't. The flow of time stopped you from doing it.?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

<br/>
Thats actualy a very good way of putting it.
<br/>
<br/>
The very moment you go back in time and do anything you have changed the timeline.
<br/>
The very heat, the very atoms that come out of your craft has changed things. By a tiny slight amount, yes, but its still changed.
<br/>
<br/>
The changes propagate instantly, meaning that you have also changed.
<br/>
Which means the past changes again, which means you change again and so on.
<br/>
This is NOT a paradox at this stage, this is merely an iterative process.
<br/>
The irritations will continue untill the timeline is "stable".
<br/>
<br/>
eg. That actions in the past do not result in changes to the future that would effect the past.
<br/>
<br/>
From the perspective of the human time traveler this would happened instantly. They wouldnt even know it happened, as their bodys and brains are part of what changed.
<br/>
<br/>
Its much easier to understand with heat, balls, atoms..to think of it on the human scale is confusing.
<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, paradox's are merely an illusion. Even if Time travel was possible, paradox's would not happen.

Well, HGWell's The Time Machine was one of the few things to have proper time *travel* rather then time teleportation.

One interesting fiction example is an eppisode of Earie Indiana, where people are the only things really moving in time. By not setting his clock back the hero ends up an hour "behind" everyone else, and the streets are all abandoned.

This is quite true.
<br/>
We cant even picture 4D objects in heads, we can only infer their shape.
<br/>
<br/>
The timeline or "history" of any set of human effects is so complex its very hard for us to comprehend what would happen if we changed it a bit.
<br/>
<br/>
I try to imagine myself as wigglying line crossing an itteracting with lots of other wigglingly lines.
<br/>
If I time traveled back, the line would loop back, and any effects I do to my past self would also instantly be effecting my current self too.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

Donnie Darko has a good representation of 4D. 4D is nothing more than an extra plane which can easily simply represented with the object at multiple points in time quite like motion blur or how it was shown in Donnie Darko. Obviously you wouldn't expect to draw an objects entire existence in 4D in the same way you wouldn't expect to draw an entire scene 3D semi transparent - you just couldn't see anything.

A paradox is a statement that says "I am true, I am false". Paradoxes have nothing to do with lack of understanding, and yes, if time travel was possible then paradoxes could not happen. The main paradox involved in time travel is changing the past since changing the 'past' negates the existence of the 'past', which the one changing the past is a dependant of.
<br/>
<br/>
And then what future do you go to? Because essentially there will now be two of you! How so, because the past didn't exist and now you don't go back! And if that instance of you goes back then what happens? Are they following your path, it's all very .. well .. dependant on the idea that it 'just works', all part of the fantasy thought of "if only I could go back and change this and that"; and also idea that if time travel exists then so does the ability to change the past too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
