<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Tepples</span>, your mistake is that <span style="font-weight: bold">qwwq</span> doesn't want <span style="font-style: italic">Animal Crossing</span>, he wants <span style="font-style: italic">Doubutsu no Mori</span>, and you may say it is the same game, but that is not true. 
<br/>
<br/>
The N64 and GC versions of DNM/AC and <span style="font-weight: bold">especially</span> the DS versions are FAR from identical, and each version has something different and special to offer. Any person who has <span style="font-style: italic">played</span> the game will know this easily.
<br/>
<br/>
That's essentially like taking Sonic R and Sonic Riders and saying "well they both have Sonic and they are both racing games so if you want Sonic R then buy Sonic Riders."
<br/>
<br/>
Same series, far from same game.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Qwwq</span>, you mistake is that, if you are an AC fan in the first place, you should've simply read a single article about the game.
<br/>
<br/>
It was NOT translated to English and sure as hell was never released in the US.
<br/>
<br/>
So you can either learn Japanese, hack the ROM and translate it yourself, or you can live with the GC and DS games, which, as <span style="font-weight: bold">tepples</span> pointed out, are available literally at any specialty gaming store like EBgames or Gamestop for rediculously low prices.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's not the same, and I was wrong even trying to defend you. <span style="font-weight: bold">Tepples</span> made a simple mistake. You just totally lack sensibility, sorry, I have to say it.
<br/>
<br/>
My main point before was that, in fact, <span style="font-style: italic">DnM</span> was completely different from it's GC and DS counterparts and that was really the only way you could get it-unless you KNEW Japanese.
<br/>
<br/>
Going back to my Sonic example, let's take "Sonic Battle" for the GBA and 'Sonic Adventure 2: Battle' for the Gamecube.
<br/>
<br/>
If you had a Japanese-only version of Sonic Battle and you wanted to translate the text, and you used the game "Sonic Adventure 2 : Battle", it would make <span style="font-style: italic">no</span> sense whatsoever.
<br/>
<br/>
Again, <span style="font-weight: bold">qwwq</span>, do some research, because right now, I'm not believing your signature too well. 
<br/>
<br/>
And <span style="font-weight: bold">tepples</span> is right, if you want to do ROM hacking, please go post somewhere else. If you have Game Boy Advance or Nintendo DS development questions, like making an Animal Crossing fangame for the GBA, please continue posting. This is <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> a ROM hacking forum, this is a development forum.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
With a lot of money or great difficultly.
<br/>
<br/>
If you need to ask, you are probably not capable of an unofficial translation.  My advice is:
<br/>
A) Learn Japanese and import the cart, or
<br/>
B) Give up and work on something productive
<br/>
<br/>
Gamefaqs might have a walkthrough for English speakers, so you might not even need to learn (much) Japanese.  You can probably find hiragana and katakana tutorials/tables on the net.  You might be able to ...find your way around the Japanese version without being able to read it.  (In my experience one tends to get stuck somewhere using this strategy.)
