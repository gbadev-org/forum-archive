    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, my GBA SP has two pixels that are blue on most colored backgrounds and red mostly on white backgrounds.
<br/>
<br/>
I assume they can be made unstuck somehow, but what I would like to know is what game and situation is the best to try and get rid of them?
<br/>
<br/>
I heard making the screen change between white/black quickly helps unstick them. If anyone knows something to help, I'd be greatful.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, DJ.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
