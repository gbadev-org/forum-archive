    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unless we could submit the same game, I think it would be better to wait after this one. But if the pdroms compo isn't about making a complete game, then maybe some people that didn't want to enter because of the rules could enter the pdroms compo instead.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">even though most games that has been submitted has been GBA games, then you must remember that this isn't a GBA only compo. Have you checked if there are any GP32 compos around?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
