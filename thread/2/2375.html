    <h4>#12725 - ampz - Mon Nov 24, 2003 6:04 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The rumor cannot be ignored, and it does make alot of sense considering the PSP threat. Nintendo will most likely release a new handheld within a year or two. The name "Gameboy X" can be read on a few places on the net, and there's lot's of speculations on the possible hardware specifications of this new handheld.
<br/>
<br/>
Let's just hope the name is a codename. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
My opinion is that Nintendo should do like they did when they built the GBC. The GBA platform is a winner, so let's keep it as it is, but add support for higher CPU clock speed, and add more graphics hardware (for example: 3D hardware, better screen, some more video memory, ..). I'd also add a small cache memory to speed up code execution from ROM considerably, and add support for higher speed ROM access as well as trying to find a way to increase ROM adress space with one or two bits without using pages. 32MB is enough even for many 3D games, but it will be on the low side in a few years.
<br/>
<br/>
I would not follow Sonys example and use optical discs for storage, it requires more power, and much more RAM since code and graphics must be loaded from the disc to RAM before execution. RAM is either expensive (SRAM) or powerhungry (DRAM).
<br/>
Optical discs would also make backwards compatibility a big problem.
<br/>
<br/>
According to the rumor, beta devkits will be made available to game developers before christmas this year, so I guess we will learn if there's any truth behind this rumor soon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because if it isn't, then the emulation community, which has used "GBX" to stand for Game Boy and Game Boy Color, will run into a namespace collision. I'm still confused over Sony's "PSX": does the name refer to the PS1 in the original form factor (as seen <a class="postlink" href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=static.howstuffworks.com/gif/playstation-sonyps3.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.howstuffworks.com/playstation.htm&amp;h=199&amp;w=350&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dplaystation%26svnum%3D10%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26ie%3DUTF-8%26c2coff%3D1%26safe%3Doff" target="_blank">here</a>) or a PS2 and DVR joined at the hip?

<br/>
As of the Game Boy Advance SP, Nintendo is already on rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, so "power-hungry" would just mean the system has to go back to the charger a bit more often. This wouldn't impact habits nearly as much as the terrible <span style="font-style: italic">alkaline</span> battery life of the Game Gear, Lynx, and Nomad.

<br/>
Not really. Game systems with optical disc media typically have a cartridge slot in the front for saving game state. All Nintendo would need to do is give this cartridge slot the same form factor as the GBA's, and it would still be possible to read GBA and GBC carts.
<br/>
<br/>
The real reason why I'm opposed to optical discs on a Nintendo handheld is that Nintendo implied plans to use GameCube discs on a handheld. The GameCube uses bare optical discs (essentially 8cm DVDs) rather than encased discs (as seen in MO drives, MiniDisc, early DVD-RAM drives, and the PSP), and bare optical discs would scratch too easily under typical handheld handling.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Power consumption is very important. I'd say it's one of the most important things. I want nothing of this PSP 3-6 hours battery time crap.
<br/>
<br/>
Memory pages was neccesary on older 8 and 16bit consoles because of the 16bit address space. The 16bit address limitation does not exist on 32bit platforms like the GBA. It is highly inconvenient for developers, and since it is fairly easy to avoid...
<br/>
<br/>
If they in fact do a updated version of the GBA, do you think they will name it "Gameboy Advance 3D"? Like they updated the name to "Gameboy color" when they added color to the original gameboy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can guarantee that Nintedo would never use the letter 'X' in the name of any of their systems. (To the extent someone not working at or with Nintendo can guarantee something like this. :)

The PSX is the new and improved PS2 system. I belive early SDK's for the PS1 was cluttered with the abbreviation "PSX" but in the PS1 game guidlines Sony prohibited developers to use the phrase "PSX" in games.
<br/>
<br/>
It feels like only yesterday the GBA was released but come to think of it the gba was released some 2-3 years ago, right? It feels a wee bit to early for a new system from Nintendo and their philosophy has always been to "do their thing" and not bother about the competition so speculations about a response to the PSP doesn't fit the Nintendo style.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And better speakers with 16 bit sound hardware! The sound quality is the only thing I don't like about GBA. Some hardware mixing would be nice, but writing software mixers is fun anyway. 
<br/>
But I think the most important thing is to keep the price reasonable. All those new handhelds coming out are neat and all, but they cost way to much for most people, especially kids.
<br/>
I agree that discs just don't suit a handheld. It's much more prone to getting dropped and abused, and disc readers are just too delicate.
<br/>
And more VRAM would definately be nice for page flipping in mode3, since the 3D hardware would most likely be 16-bit.
<br/>
And a backlit screen is a must, even if it does soak more battery power. Just give it a brightness control so you can turn it down if you don't need it up full blast.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.

One thing they really have to include in a new GBA system is a cache to speed up code execution from ROM.. Just a small 2kB cache would do wounders to performance and/or power consumption.
<br/>
I think the GBA is just about the only ARM7 based system I know of that completely lacks a cache. Most ARM7 systems have the cache as a optional feature. You can choose to use part, or all of the internal RAM as either cache or generic RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
And yeah, 16bit sound would be a good thing.. However, good stereo speakers is a bit of a size tradeoff. How much size should be traded for better sound? It is of course also a cost issue. Two speakers cost twice as much as one. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The things that should happen:
<br/>
<br/>
1)Increase CPU speed: I am thinking... 40mHz-120mHz, depending on if Nintendo's gonna push some kind of 3D graphics or effects on the system.
<br/>
<br/>
2)More memory!!: double or triple memory. I like mode 3 but its too slow.
<br/>
<br/>
3)Better sound!!!!!!!!!: Well, the GBA did finally give us SOME decent sound, in fact the tunes to Golden Sun are really cool, but most games don't have that. 16-bit at LEAST, maybe 24-bit but let's not push it.
<br/>
<br/>
4)Backlit screen since launch day, not an improved version later on. How many people who bought a GBA traded it in and paid $60!!! for the SP? Not me. It should have some kind of dimmer control, so we don't such up too much battery power.
<br/>
<br/>
5) Nintendo personally giving ME the first autographed copy of the system as well as all the games available on launch day (EVERYBODY, PUSH FOR THIS)
<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't matter how many things you add to a system... If the games aren't fun, no one will play it. How many of us bought the original Game Boy? How many bought the Game Gear?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Here's my little all-in-wonder GBA2:
<br/>
<br/>
- Same registers as the GBA + some more registers for more silly effects ;)
<br/>
- Support for 256 sprites (or even 512)
<br/>
- Inbuilt MP3 support in BIOS (not really needed, but it's nice to have though).
<br/>
- At least 133 mhz (I played SNES on a p166 just fine).
<br/>
- 4-16 meg of RAM (I won't need much for my operations).
<br/>
- 320*256 backlit screen (it'll be HUGE).
<br/>
- A mono/stereo switch for headphones.

Haha... this rings true with me. I spent a year learning QuickDraw 3D and was just starting to make my game when Apple sent it to the chopping block. That was an important lesson that I could not afford to stay on the cutting edge of technology with hobby programming.

That's why I love the GBA: it's literally decade's old technology in a modern, portable wrapper.

I would like a 32-bit port to the ROM versus the 16-bit that's currently on the GBA. This would make it practical to run ARM instructions from ROM instead just from IWRAM (which we only have 32K of). Maybe give it an instruction cache as well, or something, so that load/stores don't impact the reading of instructions so much.
<br/>
<br/>
Conditional execution in ARM mode could make for some very zippy code. Processor speed is only half the battle...

But the real showstopper is that fast ROMs are expensive to replicate.

I'd be willing to settle for an expansion of IWRAM to 256 KB, which would give the same benefit of larger ARM inner loops without stressing ROM too much.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I wonder when Ninty will dump the Z80 alltogether in favor of software emulation,..

Anyway, it DOES seem more logical that the next GameBoy will have a StrongARM or ARM9, but If Nintendo ever wants a handheld that plays GameCube games (maybe in another 15 years..) or Microsoft gets into the handheld industry, they're probably going to want to find someone to develop a low-power equivalent of the MPC730.<br/>_________________<br/>There were worms, lots of worms, worms that made me crazy,..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I love ROM, but you run out of 16Megs so quickly when doing really detailed stuff (even with compression.)  I'm all for going the Sony route and having a minidisk system - as long as there's enough RAM to do some decent buffering - though I know Nintendo is loathe to do this.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, the next GBA needs to run a bit faster, have way more RAM (I'd love to see 2-4 Megs of RAM of Slow and 256K of fast at least so we can use more advanced compression schemes and store more data), a math coprocessor chip (not necessarily for floats - I'm thinking more like the GTE chip on the PS1 for matrix math, and trig), and give me a hardware divide already that doesn't suck.  I believe the sound stuff is pretty good as is (I know I'm in the minority here).  Also, give me the extra 2 buttons from the SNES and perhaps the 2 extra shoulders from the PS1 as well.   Make sure the screen is still lit and leave X resolution on a number that's easy to compute w/o multiplies.  Then make sure all the documentation for it is in English from day 1 so I don't have to learn Japenese for the 3rd time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How ironic.
<br/>
<br/>
(I am, of course, thinking of Super Mario Advance 4, which has to be the ultimate example of Nintendo not following this philosophy. After they had already converted just about every other Mario game they could, they still chose to go back and re-release a MUCH older game than those featured for SMA2 or 3, rather than come up with something new.)

Look at Metroid Fusion. It has all the same functions as Super Metroid, but there is no dash button, so you have to hold down the L shoulder button to dash. The same with Megaman Zero. But wouldn't it be alot easier if the thing had X and Y buttons in the first place? The L button does two different things (dash/aim diag.), but it could be confusing to people who are used to the Super Nintendo where each button does one thing.<br/>_________________<br/>There were worms, lots of worms, worms that made me crazy,..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Personally, I don't see why people would complain about only four buttons - it's more than enough for almost any 2D game (I could see an issue if camera control came into play)...Even fighting games (see the King of Fighters series).
<br/>
NES games got by with only two buttons, and that system bred some of the most innovative and accessible games ever - certainly, clever game designers can more than accomplish this.
<br/>
<br/>
When I first played True Crime: Streets of LA on the XBox, I was literally overwhelmed by the number of controls. There were seperate button combinations for arresting, firing a warning shot, frisking civilians, flashing your badge, etc. What ever happened to pure, simple, <span style="font-style: italic">simplicity</span>?

  i'm personally inclined towards fewer buttons, one of the qualities of GBA gameplay, is the ability to play frequently in short-periods, thus the controls need to be as intuitive or seamless as possible, simplicity is directly proportional to intuitiveness.
<br/>
  but on the other hand, take notice that the next generation of handhelds will surely focus on 3d games and the added complexity of 3d 'might' call for additional buttons
<br/>
 also more buttons would mean more functions, and 'form follows functionality'

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll toss in my opinions as well (for free! Can you believe it? ;) )... 
<br/>
<br/>
I think that the next GB will be an incremental upgrade... the GBA has a lot of life left in it, and since the GB Color was successful, I can see Nintendo reusing that idea, and extending the GBA in similar ways.
<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, I would like to see the following:
<br/>
<br/>
 - 16-bit sound
<br/>
 - more graphics modes (maybe a 4 layer rot-scale mode, with independent pallettes)
<br/>
 - more sprites
<br/>
 - faster CPU -- at least 100mhz would be ideal, but of course, more is better, with the option for the programmer to slow down the CPU as needed (or, I guess if VBlankIntrWait() is used, it wouldn't really matter...)
<br/>
 - more IWRAM/EWRAM -- in fact, I would like to see IWRAM and EWRAM both become equivalent, i.e, 32-bit bus, same wait states, etc.  1 meg of RAM would be nice, but I dunno if that will happen.
<br/>
 - more VRAM to go with the better graphics modes
<br/>
 - two more face buttons (X and Y)
<br/>
 - improved battery life (why not? just about every GB model has improved on the battery life of the previous one)
<br/>
 - local wireless link support (bluetooth?) -- let's get rid of that damn link cable for once and all :)  Ideally, for existing GBA games, this should look exactly like the cable, but then again, I can see where that may cause some problems.  They could also release an adapter for older systems as well....
<br/>
<br/>
As far as software emulation of the GB/GBC, I don't see it happening... since the GB/GBC used 5v and the GBA uses 3.3v, it would probably just be cheaper to include the GBC chip in the next system.
<br/>
<br/>
Some other points -- hardware mixing would be nice, but in all honesty, writing a mixer isn't rocket science and (as DekuTree pointed out) it's quite fun to write.  I'd rather have the ability to put out CD quality audio through the headphone jack, and decent audio through the internal speaker.
<br/>
<br/>
3D support?  naaa... with a faster CPU, we can finally have some really decent software 3d engines anyway, and besides, I'd rather have Nintendo give us something like hardware divide and floating point instead of 3d anyway...
<br/>
<br/>
Optical media -- well, only if it was done in a way that made sense -- i.e, having GCN media doesn't make much sense.  I would never give that to my kid for his GB.  I do agree that memory cards would be best implemented using the existing cart port -- in fact, I'm disappointed that Nintendo didn't simply use the GBA port for the GCN's memory carts.  But, I guess they could always do that for the next home system, huh?
<br/>
<br/>
BIOS modifications -- I don't really like the idea of modifying the BIOS.  In fact, I was really surprised that the GBA had routines in the BIOS.  In all honesty, having 16k of BIOS doesn't really save much from the overall cart size.  Just make the minimal changes necessary to support the new hardware, and leave the rest the same.  Bugs and all.
<br/>
<br/>
I believe that all of my ideas could be implemented without breaking compatibility with the existing GBA... there's plenty of register space available, and even if the CPU timing isn't perfect, I don't think there are many games (if any) that would break because of the CPU timing.  Most games are synced to the V-blank and H-blank anyway, so having a few more cycles to burn isn't gonna make much of a difference :)

If you don't include 3D you will get burned by everyone who does. Besides, part of what makes the GBA so great is all of its high-level features (sprites, bgs, etc.) that make it easy to code for.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't need floating point, but hardware divide would be very nice. Don't know if you can have one without the other on ARM, though.
<br/>
<br/>
When all is said and done, I think I pretty much want a Nintendo-brand <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tapwave.com" target="_blank">zodiac</a>. Man, that thing is cool.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and software mixers aren't necessarily the worst thing to write in the world, but I don't think I ever heard anyone complain about the SNES's on-board sound. Meanwhile, mixers on the GBA are a pain overall, steal processor time, and worse quality than the SPC-whatever that the SNES had.

16-bit sound will help, though, for things like MP3 playback -- quite unlikely to be used if the next GBA uses carts, but more than likely if it uses optical media.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as hardware mixing goes -- how many channels would make it worthwhile?  I would that you would want at least 16 channels -- 8 seems way too limiting, while 32 is probably too much for most games.  Hardware panning would be nice while were at it -- full left and/or full right is annoying :D

Yeah -- it is better.  So is Mini-Discs.  Both are Sony properties, and I think that can rule out any chance in hell that Nintendo would use them (Sadly).  I just don't see that Nintendo really has a good track record in making portable durable optical media, and therefore, they would have to license from some other company.  What other companies are making small durable optical media besides Sony?

Point taken -- but, wouldn't you rather have had more IWRAM than the BIOS?  Of course, though, they had to have some sort of BIOS -- just to show the logo and validate the cart -- and, once you have the space to use, might as well use it :D

BTW -- how would the 3D hardware work?  Would it be used in conjunction with the existing 2D modes?  Could you intermix sprites and 3-D objects?  What about the API?  Would it be in the BIOS?  Libraries that have to be included in the ROM/Disc?  Adding 3D is more complicated than simply dropping in a chip... especially if the system is going to be backwards compatible.  I still think that having a faster CPU, hardware divide and floating point, and more RAM will make up for a lack of dedicated 3D hardware.

I'm not saying this with any scientific certainty, but I think most modern systems use the 3D hardware to supplant their 2D processing. Therefore traditional "sprites" just become a "square" geometry (two triangles edge-to-edge) which are always projected to be facing the camera, with the desired image as the texture shader. From this principle, you can then extrapolate things like backgrounds. It should be possible to emulate all of the functionality of the GBA by replacing the rendering hardware it uses with an intermediate layer that translates its needs to the 3D system.
<br/>
<br/>
When I was programming with QuickDraw 3D (ages ago, before Apple sent it the chopping block), that's how I did it.

Therefore traditional "sprites" just become a "square" geometry (two triangles edge-to-edge) which are always projected to be facing the camera, with the desired image as the texture shader. From this principle, you can then extrapolate things like backgrounds. It should be possible to emulate all of the functionality of the GBA by replacing the rendering hardware it uses with an intermediate layer that translates its needs to the 3D system.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Well, my concern is that to keep compatibility, you would need to have the same hardware registers as you have on the current GBA -- so, if Nintendo did use the 3D hardware as the backend for the 2D functionality, it would have to expose the same registers as we have now.
<br/>
<br/>
Much simpler, IMO, would be to just give the ability to put 3D graphics in a layer, that would work hand in hand with the existing graphics modes.  So, you could have a traditional 256 color tile layer above the 3D layer, with another 256 color tile layer below.  Of course, you would also have the option of just ignoring the 2D modes/layers as needed.
<br/>
<br/>
There is still the issue of the API for the 3D layer as well -- would there be an OpenGL library in the BIOS?  Would Nintendo give the developers libraries?  Would they have low-level access to the 3D hardware, similar to the access we now have with the 2D hardware?
<br/>
<br/>
And, I'm still not convinced that 3D hardware is actually needed yet -- if the screen was bigger, it might be necessary... but, in all honesty, we have a 240x160 screen.  With a faster CPU, and some hardware support for divide and floating point, I'm sure that it wouldn't be too hard to toss a ton of textured and lit polygons to the screen.  And, as a bonus, the faster CPU and hardware divide/floating point benefits non-3D games as well -- unlike  dedicated 3D hardware would.
<br/>
<br/>
Hey -- if Nintendo can give us the best of both worlds without compromising compatibility, size, and battery life, I say go for it.  But, I certainly don't want to see a system destined for crappy 3D only games that eats batteries faster than my kid's Tickle Me Elmo doll....<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it would work best to just have the 3D hardware render to wherever you want, An EWRAM buffer, VRAM for mode4, just add regs for the 3D render target address, and resolution. Then add a mode6 that uses the newly expanded VRAM to do a double-buffered 15-bit bitmap. The problem with that though, is that the sprite hardware always uses 0x6010000 as its base address, which would then be filled up with the second buffer, so if it was to allow sprites, they would have to make some modifications to the existing sprite hardware, although I don't know if that would be a problem or not if they were making all those changes to the rest of the gfx hardware anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
All that said, I don't really want 3D hardware either. If they do add it, I want full low-level access, if they don't, I'll write my own just because it's fun. Either way I probably won't ever make a 3D game. Also, what's most important to me is the battery life, and the price of the system itself, so I'd rather not have 3D if it's going to hike up the price very much. 
<br/>
<br/>
And I'm sure nowadays they can get the system itself small enough to leave more room for a speaker. Headphones make the regular GBA sound plenty good enough for my taste, so I think the speaker is more of a problem than the 8-bit-ness. 16-bit DSound channels would help though, especially with a faster processor to do linear interpolation in mixers. 
<br/>
My current mixer does as many channels as I want with full panning (although running 16 chns takes about 25% of the frame, but that wouldn't be much with a faster CPU), so I don't really care wether it has hardware mixing or not. Although if it does still use cartridges, hardware decompression+mixing of compressed samples (ala SNES) would be a big plus. But then with more RAM you could cache decompressed samples youself.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

Sounds like it will not replace the GBA, but rather complement it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">LOst?: Is your conjecture a worst case scenario, or do you have an inside line to something that the press release didn't cover?
<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, the press release claims that both displays are 3 inches in size; this would imply a 150 dpi "high res" screen. Do there exist such color LCDs? (Most TFT LCDs, used in laptops and GBAs, run about 100 dpi.) And where's the second processor? And how would the 3D BIOS reliably determine whether such a "license" exists?
<br/>
<br/>
No, it wouldn't be called "Super Game Boy Advance" because 1. given the public's association of the name "Super Game Boy" with TV adapters, that name would be confused with the Game Boy Player, and 2. it'll be marketed separately from the whole GCN/GBA setup.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Just a worst case scenario! I really think that having an adapter for the headphones in GBA SP is bad, so if Nintendo keeps doing those idiotic things, it may be the next handheld :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The non-standard headphone connector is there simply because a standard headphone connector is too deep. It would have made the entire GBA SP larger.
<br/>
Look at your SP.. The cart and the battery take upp almost the entire SP. There are only a few millimeters left for the connectors.
<br/>
<br/>
Are'nt there headphones with SP connector so that a adapter is not neccessary?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's one thing to talk about progress on software months, even a year, before the actual release date, but with hardware, it's another thing.
<br/>
My opinion on why Nintendo is being so secret on the DS is because of competition. If another company knows of the final (of semi-final) specs of another company's hardware, then they can change their specs on their hardware to make it more appealing and powerful.
<br/>
<br/>
If Nintendo has something really special under their sleeve, why spill the beans so that other companies can counter it? Same goes for the next Gameboy. This is just my opinion.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to see it play GBA games just so that I wouldn't have to get an SP.

More information will be released at E3.
<br/>
And secondly, according to Nintendo, this is NOT the next gameboy.
<br/>
Third, why would it be huge just because it has two screens? Imagine a SP with a extra screen where the buttons are.
<br/>
According to the leaked specificationsheet, the device will have CPU, memory and 3D performance similar to N64. It will also have a touchscreen and 802.11. (This is according to a leaked spec. sheet, the specifications might be outdated)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
