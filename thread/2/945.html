Initially, this may seem like a better deal to them but they will probably need your talents (through vigorous game-testing &amp; market-testing) to ensure that you provide a product that is commercially viable.
<br/>
<br/>
They may try to sign you as a job as a senior/lead programmer, game designer, etc (but this may get complicated if you are part of a team)or it may involve  a 'deal' with royalties (per copies sold) and other benefits (it may be similar to a book or music publishing deal) but each product is treated completely different (depending on market-value, release date, genre, format, company size, etc) so it'd be hard to hazard a guess.<br/>_________________<br/>---------------------------------------------------
