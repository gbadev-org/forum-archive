Heh...I was amazed when I showed up on the board today and there were tons of unread threads.  Then I noticed that they were all last posted by the same guy.  I thought to myself, "Ah, must have a new guy around here"....it's always the new guys gravedigging ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, welcome.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I was ignoring off topic until now and then I come in here and find I've got my own thread. Oy. Yeah, I guess I'm the new guy. (Not actually that new though, check the join date.) Nice to meet you all.
<br/>
<br/>
When I made all those posts in Game Design, I wasn't really looking at the dates. I figured if they where on the front page, they couldn't be that old. (I guess the other forums I frequent are active enough that that heuristic works.) Then I realized.
<br/>
<br/>
I was actually a bit worried once I noticed. Some boards frown on reviving old threads and I'd just necro'd a buch, many of which where a year (or two) old. I guess it's not too big a deal, but I've started checking dates.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's ok, you had intelligent things to say.  There's no shame in reviving an old thread if you have something worthwhile to contribute.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
