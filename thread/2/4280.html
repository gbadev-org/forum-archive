    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm sure I saw a guy who had made games that ran SCUMM (and Simon the Sorcerer, very important :-) run on the agb but now I can't find it anywhere. I thought I had seen it on <a href="http://www.gbadev.org" target="_blank">www.gbadev.org</a> but I don't see it anywhere in their archives, I've searched this forum, I've used google but I've always came out empty-handed.
<br/>
<br/>
Could someone please save my day here and tell me where I can find Simon the Sorcerer and the SCUMM games for the agb.
<br/>
