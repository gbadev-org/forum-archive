    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The touch screen on my DS is quite bright and hard to see. I have to tilt it down to be able to view it as normal. I'm not sure what happen to it, since I never used it for about two months now. It works great like when I first bought it, but now the LCD somehow just gotten too bright. So my question to you guys is can there a way I can adjust the brightness or is the LCD dead?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When you say brightness, are you referring to the colours displayed on the screen being too bright, or the backlight being too bright?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
