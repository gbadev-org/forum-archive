    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think this is the appropriate board to post this(I think &gt;&gt;;;). GFAQS wasn't much help. I always get error 94030, I'm using a D-Link DI-624+. I always get disconnected on the fourth race. Is there any way to fix this? I don't really want to buy a new router or that USB device thingy(it's expensive here in my country).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Does it happen in friend matches or just stranger matches?

PROTIP: If you want tech support for official games, you can also post on nintendo.com or your local equivalent.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ive looked in a few forums, and this problem is pretty common. that used to happen to me, but now it works fine but the range has seriously decreased(i have to be within 10 feet of the router for it to work)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I looked at the Nintendo forum and it said that the problem is that my router is sending too much data than the DS can handle. Also, it ALWAYS happen on the START of the FOURTH race in EVERY wifi match. I tried lowering the rate of transmission thingy, but it didn't help. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
