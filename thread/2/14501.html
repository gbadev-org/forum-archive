phpBB's concurrency isn't without defects. If you go middle-click-happy and open multiple topics in tabs too quickly, not all of the topics will be marked as read.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

That wasn't the issue (I wasn't rushing at all), but Lick's suggestion of clearing all cookies and caches seems to somehow work. I can't really see how it should, since the visited-tagging appears AFAIK on the server-side. But, well, whatever.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#145166 - tepples - Mon Nov 12, 2007 2:26 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have never read the phpBB source code, but based on the behavior I've seen on this and at least six other phpBB forums that I either read or used to read, it appears that phpBB has a concept of a "visit" that has a duration. When you log in to the forum, phpBB starts a new visit. When this visit expires after several minutes, every comment from before the start of the session gets marked as read. When you have the forum set to "Log me on automatically each visit" and then pull a page, but you don't have a valid session open, phpBB starts a new visit.
<br/>
<br/>
Why doesn't phpBB store the entire list of comments that each user has read? As I understand it, that would take a lot of database space, which clearing out this list at the end of a visit frees up. Only those posts that can be seen in "View posts since last visit" can be unread.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Java gaming, and the NBC boards store which topics you've been on - so you can [truly] read all unread topics, or unread replies to your posts!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wow, that is awful design for such a good feature (Fitt's law and all, having the most likely desirable function the most difficult to access with such a small clicking space). Well at least I know where it is in the future ... thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
