    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, 
<br/>
<br/>
I made some games on calculator and I wish to convert them to make them run on Gameboy advance. I saw that there is an object called supercard, but I prefer to have one cartridge for each game that I make and then draw myself the picture for Illustrate each of them. I saw a lot of sites who sells supercard, but no one who sells empty cartridges. Is it possible to buy in detail or must I command a minimum quantity of Cartridges? Does it exist GBA stickers where I can draw my illustrations which I paste on the cartridges? What stuff should I buy for make the thansfer from my computer to the empty cartridge?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>

The only thing i didn't implement was fog of war, scrolling and move range depending of the ground type. Because of the restrictions of the calculator. The adaptation work I had to do can be find here: <a href="http://grabag.free.fr/bordel/textes/Design%20Metalwar/Document%20MWv1.00.pdf" target="_blank">http://grabag.free.fr/bordel/textes/Design%20Metalwar/Document%20MWv1.00.pdf</a>
