    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It was an interview question, and though he thought it was a bit of a challenging question I found it to be a very clever and revealing question. Surely everybody wants to finish stuff, but people tend to get the most satisfaction from starting a project or on its completion.
<br/>
<br/>
And that's not to say that you just get excited that you've come up with a name; I'm talking about researching and developing the technology for a project, discovering various technologies and really learning about it.
<br/>
<br/>
Finishers are generally not starters, they're more interested in just having it done, and get their buzz from the fact of completion and not a moment before.
<br/>
<br/>
So what type of person are you?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well the "R&amp;D guy" in my interview said you need a bit of the two. What good is a finisher without a starter, and vice versa.
<br/>
<br/>
You might notice that I don't have a web site, however I do have a secret domain name. I have publicly exposed it to a few who weren't very interested to show my Java source code to something. Some may know that I had a website that is still on-line but I don't talk about.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a starter (IMO), I get my joys out of learning, researching and creating new ideas. It's a bit of a "problem" when my project motivation is "personal satisfaction" since my task of attaining satisfaction is completed when I've figured it out and prototyped the proof of concept. "Finishing" to me includes:
<br/>
 - completed documentation and details for reuse
<br/>
 - a professional finish, such as title screens and menu systems
<br/>
 - a help booklet and help section in the game, complete with tutorials
<br/>
 - game / program options and configuration
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe "starters" may be better placed in engine development or the completion of research tasks and project modules. Finishers can work alongside the project manager (or in fact fill that role) and ensure that all code is "finished". This may involve instructing the "starter" coder when to stop, or to declare a good point for a deadline.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Although as some already stated, doing something for work may go more on the finisher side, while as free-time activities are more for fun. Sometimes it goes as far as not even starting a project before moving forwards to something else. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well then I (on behalf of the people) command you to un-retire ^_^ p.s., very good excuse for not finishing, clever
<br/>
<br/>
But now the big question, if you're a starter then how do you finish? And for those who start more projects than they finish, why is this and what do you think could get you (and the rest of us) to finish?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Because when I do projects for fun, I'm just doing it for fun.  If it stops being fun, why continue?  
<br/>
<br/>
The real question, in response to your questions, is who cares?  If I'm just doing a project for my own enjoyment, then who cares if I finish it?

Hmm, maybe the 'problem' with starters is that they always want to do something new, prove a concept or try something out. I tend to write out possible projects without starting them just so that I don't have to much on my load, although I think some really should be taken further but I've always been told by my mum not to start something you're not going to finish - which I guess is contrary to my inquisitive nature.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
