    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it was EIDOS or Valve who were creating a system that could automatically reduce the complexity of a 3d world based on its given hardware but don't think it was every completed. Although many (if not all) 3d modelling applications can do this, the system they were developing would do it automatically based on your graphics card and processor. This would allow you to be able to create a game with great detail that could still run on older machines, meaning that the minimum spec does not constantly grow with each new game.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone remember who it was who was researching this because I haven't seen it used yet; or is it still in development? Really curious because I remember it being in one magazine, then I never heard about it again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

By that Aidyn Chronicals: The First Mage comes to mind. They tried to use high detailed features or features that would be normal in todays games but the game ended up being extremly English( crappy ). 
<br/>
<br/>
I am guessing somebody at H2O Interactive figured they could do the same thing Imagineer did with there battle system they used in Quest but on a higher level.  The game itself suffered from the effects Secret Of Evermore left afterwards.
<br/>
<br/>
Also the game gave you the option of High End graphics which was great but it also played slightly diffrent music which to be honest sounds worst compared to the original.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

Have you read the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dperry.com/archives/articles/dp_speeches/messiah_what_yo/" target="_blank">shiny article</a>? What I am talking about are the forever rising minimum requirements of games that now cannot run without graphics accelerators at all despite the games engine being capable of doing so. Sure you can configure your game; but nothing comes close to what Shiny developed.

Precisely; there is no denying that no [typical] game made today will run on a PII without a graphics accelerator (maybe even with one). In fact I got monopoly and can't play it on my PIII laptop or my 1Ghz Athlon, which is pathetic, because it's only monopoly.

If you consider motherboard + ram + processor + graphics card to be an upgrade and not a new computer. I do believe I let a lot up to imagination, such as what is old.
<br/>
<br/>
A PII with an ATI (Rage II) All In Wonder card is an old machine. Half life (and many games of that time) run pretty well on a Cyrix MII 333Mhz processor without a graphics accelerator, which is saying something! In fact I were able to play many games on that at good framerates including Rollcage (which is still visually stunning in my opinion) and Delta force (which still looks great)!!!

I would be, but that's not what I was every suggesting.
<br/>
<br/>
How much processing goes on in Doom and Medal of Honour that is more than Half Life and Delta Force? I do not ask that in a mischievous way, but you seem to be confident that it is not down to graphics! But like I said, Shiny seemed to think so!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Games can make use of the current processing power of PC's for many different things, but in how many games does this actually happen. Bearing in mind that pretty much every PC game will run fine on much slower processors, the bottleneck tends to be the graphics card anyway!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It doesn't seem to me that the idea was to have modern games able to run on ancient computers. It sounded more like they wanted a system that would run on the average computer of the time, but still take advantage of all the extra processing power that newer hardware would provide. They mentioned 500,000-polygon models, when obviously the idea of a single model having that many polygons on the computers of their time is ridiculous. The idea is that 10 years later, this same game that ran on such old hardware, still manages to cripple our modern systems and looks hundreds of times better than it did before. It's never going to run on your old 8086, but it'll push the Pentium it was designed on to the max with some decent graphics, and it'll push your Athlon64 to the max with amazing graphics. (I know the CPU isn't as much a factor as the GPU, but anyway...)
<br/>
<br/>
It's an interesting idea. If nothing else, it lets you push your current hardware to the max at all times without fear that a more intense scene will be too difficult to render because your main character is already a zillion polygons. It can simply render half a zillion while that explosion is on the screen, with almost no noticeable loss in overall graphic quality.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Since they have gotten so good at pushing polys, most games tend to scale other things, like Anti-Aliasing, or add extra technologies, such as HDR rendering.

The complexity of games has increased, but most of the jump was from 2d-3d (with occasional mechanics that are CPU hungry). The Sims for example is CPU/data hungry, although you can run it on a 333Mhz Cyrix quite fine! Prince of Persia 3d is not CPU intensive without the graphics, it is doing nothing more than Tomb Raider. And yes we don't know everything going on, but there is nothing about that game that requires it to (in case it was argued)
<br/>
<br/>
So here's a simple question: Prince of Persia; are you saying that its requirements are not about the graphics, and if the graphics were scaled down to those of Tomb Raider that it still would not run on the same PC's that run Tomb Raider?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Physics, for one.

Keldon: I couldn't because it's a completely different case
<br/>
possible reply: not really, it's just the same, just another type of bottlekneck
<br/>
Keldon: good point; AI routines were improved and so on so we have more complicated mechanics. But one thing missed is that the processor still is not usually the bottlekneck but the graphics card (nowadays). I could probably use a processor just like the one in my laptop but it is just the graphics that stops it from running<span style="font-weight: bold">(#1)</span>!!!
<br/>
<br/>
So node count does matter to the processor (I am not and never was disputing that); but there is always much room for the processor and less room for the graphics card and much strain placed on it. With Shiny's method are you saying that you could not lower the graphical strain<span style="font-weight: bold">(#2)</span>?

In a sense, PCs are in a realm of existence separate from game consoles and handhelds for two reasons: <ol type="1"><li>PCs have a user space free of anti-homebrew measures. </li><li>More importantly, PC backward compatibility is more thorough than that on consoles. For instance, Windows XP can run games made for Windows 3.1 and even some made for MS-DOS.

    <h4>#127725 - Al - Fri May 04, 2007 9:47 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, but the point is that <span style="font-weight: bold">graphical strain</span> is a moving target - why bother making a part of your engine scale when there's no guarantee that's the bit that will need to scale tomorrow?  Back in the Messiah days, keeping the polygon count in check was a massive win as the cost of transforming, lighting and rasterising them was huge (and the 3D cards of the day only helped out with the last stage).
<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays the battleground has changed beyond recognition.  Reducing poly count will only help a little - the real differences between low-end and high-end PC hardware (beyond memory capacity) is in the complexity of shaders you can use.  And while there perhaps scalable ways of approaching this, it's not as simple* as what Shiny was doing with tessellating the geometry.
<br/>
<br/>
To get any scaling on modern hardware basically means writing several versions of the same thing - for example the last PC game I worked on had to two or three different shaders for rendering water in order to cover a reasonable number of 3D card specs.  Those shaders also had to have special case compatibility tweaks applied for specific cards and drivers as many have their own bugs and peculiarities.  When you multiply this across all the shaders in the game, you very quickly see why developers tend to support as narrow a band of hardware as they can get away with - and why engine coders on PC games are often bitter, burnt-out people ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the day though, the main problem is that scaling to this degree often just doesn't work well in practice.  Messiah was dead clever, but I remember playing the demo (on a reasonably spec'd PC for the time) - I went up to a door, opened it, and watched as my poor character had all the polygon detail sucked out of him so they could be used to render the world beyond.  Immensely cool tech, but the distraction it caused made the game rather laughable in my eyes.
<br/>
<br/>

    <h4>#127728 - keldon - Fri May 04, 2007 10:09 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually that does sound pretty funny with it changing mid game! When it comes to shading you can simply turn it off (which is what anyone will do if there is an option and that is limiting their play). The tessellation will only change the model which means there is no way to do anything with shading; but shading isn't an issue if you turn it off anyway. Also the alternative to your Messiah situation is that your main character always looked that 'poor', or the enemies looked poorer. Having said that consistency is better than change in that case.
<br/>
<br/>
Shiny may have only thought as far as the complexity of the model; but does it <span style="font-style: italic">only</span> go as far as that? I think it is too easy to switch the thread into an argument between A and B; I never think like that, I think it is much more intelligent to discuss the possibility of A and the issues around it. *<span style="font-weight: bold">Shading is an issue, not a disproof</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
Having said that the problem is not just scaling down the strain but in still keeping a reasonable graphical appeal. If you just remove effects then you end up with an ugly picture since the scene was designed to have lighting effects light up the room, had it been designed to not use lighting effects it would have pre-drawn the shading effect in the textures, but basically would have designed it to look good in the absence of the technology.
<br/>
<br/>
If you remove shading how ugly does it look? I guess fairly ugly since the models are designed to have that graphical characteristic drawn via the effect. But nonetheless would it not be great if one could create a system where the processing speed is the main issue and not the graphics card power? Even if just for an experiment, or research? <span style="font-weight: bold">That is what I am getting at</span>.

<div class="post">
    <h4>#127756 - Al - Fri May 04, 2007 4:21 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The problem is that the overall look of a game is a holistic thing - in order to make the end result look as good as possible each element is designed to complement the others.  A good example is the game I'm working on at the moment: it currently looks very bad in places because our normal mapping isn't working properly - the effect of this is amplified because our diffuse texture maps are lacking in bumpy detail because they were designed from the start to work with the normal map.  You can design these kind of effects to be additive (the base texture map looks good, then each additional pass makes it look better - PC games often take this approach) but you get far better results if you make all the effects work together.  We have that luxury - we're Xbox 360 exclusive so we don't need to worry about supporting different specs (and things will look awesome once those damn normal maps are fixed).
<br/>
<br/>
In short, making a game that looks good and runs well on both low-end and high-end hardware is a LOT of work and will almost always have a detrimental effect on how good the game looks in the usual and best cases.  It's very rarely worth the bother - far better to aim somewhere inbetween, put in some adjustments to include as many systems as you can, then spend the rest of development fixing compatibility bugs with all those PC specifications included in that band ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, Shiny's approach of modelling stuff very high-poly and reducing it down is alive and well in a slightly different form - many games (high-tech shooters like Doom 3 and Gears of War in particular) use an offline process to generate lower poly models with normal mapping from a ultra high-poly source mesh.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

At build time - the game ships with the lower-poly, normal mapped versions of the meshes.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess you could ship the high-poly source meshes and do it at install, but that adds to install time (it's an intensive process - I seem to remember the tool that builds these meshes for Unreal Engine 3 even supports distributed processing over a network!) as well as giving you a test and support nightmare (it's bad enough having to test and support the graphics options games already have - but this could give you a setup unique to each PC!).
<br/>
<br/>
I wasn't saying that this technique was used for scalability - it's actually more to help artists generate assets that can make use of normal mapping.  Normal maps are hard to do well by hand so techniques like this or tools like Zbrush are popular.  This method could be used to automate generation of multiple level-of-detail versions of the same mesh though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was exaggerating a bit, but it was definitely noticable and distracting (it was particularly noticable on the characters' heels for some reason).  This is where you have to be careful with dynamic level-of-detail systems - unstable graphics like this tend to undermine the solidity of the game and destroy the players' suspension of disbelief.
