    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am planning on getting a new 500GB external HDD to replace my old 150GB external HDD. I was just curious if anybody can estimate about how long it will take to transfer the files from my old HDD using USB 2.0 to my new HDD using firewire. I have about 140GB to transfer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would guess at least 40 minutes, based on the speed of the USB 2.0 in "best" scenarios, even though it really doesn't achieve the supposed 480 Mbps because of it's "Master-Slave" architecture. I'm not putting out FireWire numbers even though the data rate transfer with that is faster, because it is at the mercy of the USB 2.0 device.
<br/>
<br/>
So, at least 40 minutes, but I wouldn't be surprised if it took over an hour.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, there will be other factors that will result in a longer data transfer, such as having lots of small files, data fragmentation, etc. Don't forget that the speed of the external HD unit itself is a factor.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
