    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They were bought from a place that evidently has no more carts available.  I believe that they were flashed and boxed one by one.  Tedious, but given such a short run I'm pretty sure that that is how things were done.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure you could have boxes printed with relative ease if you really want them. =)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what I remember these carts were flashed by Simon and maybe some others. They had the boxes printed off at some printing company and had stickers made up for the carts.

The didn't get boxed. Your order got shipped with a flattend (not assembled) box, an instruction manual, and the cartridge, in a padded envelope.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Really..  I thought the original plan was to manually flash, but then they went with an outside source, that being the reason SimonB had some empty carts available to flash for cheap (long since been sold out)..
<br/>
<br/>
This question has been asked a few dozen times..   Can't SOMEONE find a place to
<br/>
A) Flash individual GBA carts or low quantities
<br/>
or
<br/>
B) Sell the flashing equipment and carts
<br/>
