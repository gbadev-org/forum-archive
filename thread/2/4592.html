    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At the risk of having moderators mad at me, I'm going to ask for a little help in my search.
<br/>
<br/>
Ever since I've joined this forum, I've been on the lookout for a particular program, a program that will capture games or utilities sent by the GameCube to the GBA over the link cable.  For example, the Tingle Tuner in Zelda Wind Waker, the controll / in-dungeon map for Four Swords, or the plethora of games and stuff in Animal Crossing (NES games, Animal Island, the pattern designer).
<br/>
<br/>
I have, to some degree, verified the existence of this program, and to my understanding it works as a GBA rom that captures the program from the GC, and spits it out over an MBV2 cable to the PC as a ROM.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling information like this is NOT good publicity to smear on these forums, as it borders on piracy (that depends on how you use it, really), and I can understand if the moderators remove this post entirely (not just lock it).
<br/>
<br/>
So if anyone has information that could lead me to finding this program which I've searched hard and long for with little to no success, I would greatly appreciate it.  And like I said, it's best not to post that information!  Contact me and we can meet elsewhere.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot everyone</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Heheh, just have to meet in a dark downtown alleyway at midnight, on a stormy night, and both people must be wearing long black trenchcoats.  And make sure to practice your "shifty eyes" beforehand, it may come in handy ;)

Sorry, I can't help ya though.  I haven't come across such a thing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I guess the mods booted my bumps... but that's okay (I guess bumps aren't allowed?  *checks rules*... *doesn't find rules he agreed to upon signing up*  Er, I'll just assume that bumps, either in general or for this particular post, are frowned upon).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I've found what I'm looking for!  (Actually, someone else gave it to me on another forum)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most phpBB boards that I've read don't like bumps with minimal to no content, e.g. "++postcount", or multiple bumps in the span of a day or two. But if you have new information, then you're welcome to post it or edit your last post.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
