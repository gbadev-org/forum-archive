    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Included in the software for the flashcart I purchaced was this tab for GB and GBC games. Knowing full well that the flashcart I purchaced was a GBA cart, this intrigued me. The emulator for the GB games is very nice, seeing as how I can now play GB and GBC games on my DS, but it has one particular feature missing.
<br/>
<br/>
The emulator I found out (by obviousness) to be the Goomba emulator. Does  anyone know if a similar emulator exists that supports the GBC functions? It would make a lot of games (Pokemon Crystal, for example) playable.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks if you know. It\'s still pretty cool though!

<br/>
<br/>
.iso is usually a CD image.  .bin is a binary and could be literally anything.  The PC Engine ran Hu-Cards.  .bin is probably a Hu-Card image.  Google "pc engine" or "pce emulator".
<br/>
<br/>
Nevermind... it looks like there is a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gameboy-advance.net/emulated/pce_roms_on_gba.htm" target="_blank">PC Engine emulator for the GBA</a>.  Think of that.  I'm going to sleep before I'm tempted to figure out how it deals with ISO images.

*EDIT* I found the goomba color site, and the emulator is very nice. A few glitches here and there (rendering zelda, for example, unplayable by me because they mess up link, although playable by someone who doesnt mind) but overall very nicely done. One minor issue: saves dont work. At all. It says they do, but then I reset the rom (hardware and visualboy advance both) and the native saves go away.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Piracy really is not discussed here at GBAdev.  If you can find the official support forum for Goomba/Goomba Color, you might have more luck receiving assistance for your saving issue.  Goomba Color is really the only working GBC emulator for either the GBA or DS as far as I know, aside from an ancient DS one made for a Neoflash competition that never went anywhere.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as good GBC homebrew, I personally am partial to the collection of PDA-like software apps made by TeamKNOX.  It's got a calculator, address book, clock, a paint program, some games, etc.  It really is pretty good, and the calculator is very functional for having been programmed for the GBC.

A DS emulator of any kind would be quite usefull for debugging purposes...

How about the bugs that switching to a software renderer will fix? I can envision running the GBC CPU and audio on the ARM7 (where it is now) and dedicating the ARM9 to emulating the GBC PPU.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I wasn\'t aware that audio would be an issue. Aren\'t the 4 GBC channels still there, even in the DS? Wouldn\'t you just map the emulated registers to those, or (gasp) let the emulator write to them directly with the code? The sound in goomba is perfect, save for slowdowns, so I can only imagine this is what they did. Even the \"wav\" sounds in pokemon yellow and pinball work fine.

The GBC tone generators are not there with the same semantics that they had on the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance, but there is a set of tone generators that the emulator can use if it doesn't want to do a full software APU. It'd be like the translation from NES tone generators to GBA tone generators that PocketNES performs.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Goomba is about as fast as it gets.  It is just fast enough to emulate the GBZ80 at gameboy speed.  If it was ported to the DS, speed problems would disappear, since the DS's ARM7 speed is twice as fast.  So doubling the speed of the ARM7 would result in double the speed of emulating the GBZ80, so GBC speed is attained right there.  Nothing would have to be redone to improve the speed.  The DS's ARM9 is 4 times as fast as the GBA's ARM7, so that could make things even faster if necessary, but that's overkill.
<br/>
DS sound is significantly different than GBA sound.  Goomba emulates sound by simply passing the sound register writes to their GBA counterparts.  The sound would likely need to be emulated in software.  Even ineffecient code made for PC emulators may work well, since the DS is quite speedy.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So the DS can\'t use the sound registers, but the DS in GBA mode can? Something\'s fishy here... oh well. Making an emulated tone generator can\'t possibly be as hard as it seems. Not to mention that a DS emulator has the whole dual-core thing (sort of) so one could use the ARM7 in doublespeed mode to emulate the z80 and use the other processor to handle things like translating the GBC memory locations into their proper registers to be displayed on the DS or similar things. Not to mention that taking this load off of the first processor would make it fast enough to speed up the emulation even in double speed mode. (idealy, using the goomba techniques.)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am ordering my passcard3 today, so I will be able to actually start coding this thing very soonly. Of course, I\'ll be doing a lot more on my PC version, since I need to get that done first. (Its going slow, but it is going...) This will be the first emulator of this kind on the DS yes?

Do you mean there is no documentation on the wi-fi hardware, or is there some weird encryption or something to that effect?

The GBA mode tone generators have hardware envelopes, and the bits of each register mean the exact same things they meant on the GBC. The DS mode tone generators have software envelopes, and everything written to the registers is in a different, cleaner format. An emulator could still virtualize GBC audio on top of DS audio in the same way that it virtualizes GBC video on top of DS video.
<br/>
<br/>
As for multiplayer, the latency of 802.11b is much greater than the latency that GBC games expect. An emulator supporting two players would have to use the TGB Dual method: emulate both GBCs on both DS systems and then just exchange keypresses to keep the systems in sync. This is where the 4x clocked ARM9 CPU of the DS, as well as its much faster RAM, would come in handy.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
