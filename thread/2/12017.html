I thought this was funny; especially after my experience after a cancelled flight this Thursday. I scored 9 out of 10 with this, so when my plane was cancelled the only other guy who did not live in Blackpool and needed a hotel was this guy who looked like either one or the other. I asked him what sort of work was in, and he said he is a security administrator (or something of that nature); had he said he was a builder I'd be right out of the door ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe you had too much crunchtime and too many bugreports from co-workers' code :P
