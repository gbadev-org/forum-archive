    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if I use the prepatched r4 file with my m3simply it works (maybe your dldi driver is old ?)
<br/>
<br/>
BTW: 2 Questions:
<br/>
<br/>
Can this baby's data play on a normal windwos pc too ?  I ask because my PC sees the Data as Moviefile although it may miss some codecs ?
<br/>
<br/>
2. What about a GUI Converter or atleast a data that supports simple drag and drop and reads the settings from the ini ? I really suck at DOS so it would be great.
<br/>
<br/>
Good to see that so much Vidplayer come out for the DS lateley.
<br/>
<br/>
Great work to all of you !<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.petitiononline.com/blizzds/petition.html" target="_blank">Starcraft DS ?</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are issues with some DLDI patches, as often it is assumed that the ARM9 will be running filesystem access code, where as ours uses the ARM7.  
<br/>
<br/>
During development, we tested on R4 and Supercard Lite cards, but we'll need to look at others specifically if they don't work with the regular DLDI patches. I'm not sure about the M3 slot-2, so please let us know. If there is source released for the DLDI patch, we should be able to modify it to work.  For the R4, we just had to use libnds7 instead of libnds9, and the same may work for other drivers.
<br/>
<br/>
The difference between the wavelet codec and MPEG-1 (DPG) movies is difficult to explain. Artifacts in DPG videos will look like square blocks, where as wavelet ones will look 'fuzzy'.  It's best if you can try and encode something yourself, obviously.
<br/>
<br/>
A GUI converter is something we'd like to do, but we mostly use Mac and Linux, so it would be great if someone could help with a Windows GUI.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, it's possible to compile this for playback on something other than the NDS, but we're not planning it at the moment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would it be possible to release this as a development library?  I see the source code is available, so I may look at it myself, but it would be really ideal to simply be able to include some trimmed down version of the player and then call it with a single function (or a choice of functions depending on whether you wanted to have controls).
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to include a couple videos in the game I'm currently working on, but I'm not sure how to go about it.  Moonshell is also open source, so I thought of maybe going through and trimming out everything that wasn't related to DPG playback, but it seems like a large task for one of my skill.
<br/>
<br/>
Your app is at least smaller and simpler, so it may be a better option for this purpose.
<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that if an easy to use video playback lib that supported a decent format was available, lots of people could definitely put it to good use.

Yes, I thought that would be a really good idea too while I was developing the dsvideo player, but I wanted to polish it up as a player app first and actually release it.  I have a few things in progress that will be more suitable as a library than the system as it currently stands, and I'll be working towards that as time permits.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was able to encode an episode of stargate atlantis to compare against a dpg encode, and at the current level of development, there's not a lot going on in favour of DSVideo

<br/>
I guess what you could do is try and do some kind of analysis during the encode process, and mark points in the timeline when you should trigger the rumble pack.
