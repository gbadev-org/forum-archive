Pretty Colors is a simplistic digital painting application, inspired by a method to paint using Wacom boards in Photoshop or Painter. It is a an early version, but it has all the basic features in there.
<br/>
<br/>
Stylus: Painting
<br/>
D-pad up: 100% pressure
<br/>
D-pad right: 50% pressure
<br/>
D-pad down: 25% pressure
<br/>
D-pad left: Pick color
<br/>
L: Palette and Brush-size screen
<br/>
R: Save painting to disc as .png
<br/>
B: Playback painting
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to keep working on this one for a while, but feel free to drop me some feedback.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The .drw is the playback data, that has recorded every brushstroke so it can be played back. The plan is to be able to send both pictures and the playback-data between consoles, so your friends can view the making of the picture as well. Also I would like to be able to easily create videos of it, but I probably need supply a PC app for that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also, I wanted to update this thread a bit with some issues that currently is bugging me.
<br/>
<br/>
Stylus jumping - I learned a lot from <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10925" target="_blank">this thread</a> about this problem and in the end I modified libdns using PadrinatoR's code. It solves 99% of the problems, and it would be really nice to get this into libdns. Anything I can do to help?
<br/>
<br/>
Current directory support - As far as I've understood from this forum, there is no way of knowing where an application was launched from and therefore you can't really have directories relative to the .nds file. Or am I missing something?
<br/>
<br/>
Wifi support - I can be something special with my DS, since the only homebrew Wifi app I've ever gotten to work is a lib-test where I don't even know what wifi-lib it was compiled for (and that one only works 50%). I talked about it in <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=13344" target="_blank">this thread</a> and since I'm very stuck I can only hope something will happen with new version of the wifi-lib or something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Coming soon. This feature will require some support from the card manufacturers. Ideally I'd like to see someone create the definitive homebrew launcher application though. The component parts are in various stages of completion but I've yet to see one application that does it all well.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

I finally got a chance to try it and apparently I wasn't using the most recent one. The new one works like a charm. There are still a few jumps, but I'm not sure it can get much better since official titles has that as well.
