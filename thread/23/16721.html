    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've released my first 'serious' DS homebrew project, a remake of the old Spectrum/Amiga/ST puzzle game Deflektor. You can find more details and a download in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.sigmaris.info/blog/?p=19" target="_blank">this post</a> on my site.
<br/>
<br/>
You need to DLDI patch before running and place the data folder in the root of your flash card, see the accompanying readme for details. Any comments/suggestions/useful bug reports are welcome. Also I'd like to know if it works on a DSi, since I only have an original DS to test on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cool remake. :) Two things:
<br/>
<br/>
1. The touch screen is far too fiddly to turn the mirrors - the light beam is uncontrollable. :) How about a system where you can tap on a mirror - that then becomes the active mirror which you can thern move by pressing the left / right shoulder buttons or left and right on the d-pad. If you tap elsewhere, it stops being the active mirror again.
<br/>
<br/>
2. There is graphical corruption present underneath the green energy bar on the bottom screen. The red overload bar is drawn without any problems.
<br/>
<br/>
Running it on a DS Lite with an R4 card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
