    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's been a long while since I last posted a DS game.
<br/>
I keep meaning to do stuff, but AGameAWeek's been taking up a whole bucketload of my time.
<br/>
Still, this one's a quicky, and since I already had all the assets ready to go, I was able to clump it together in next to no time.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Gameplay</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Cardagain is a simple puzzler, but one that gets inexplicably harder as you go.
<br/>
<br/>
Four cards appear on the table, each with one of two symbols.
<br/>
You have to remember where each one is, and then they're all flipped over.
<br/>
Two cards are flipped back, one of each pair, and you then have to flip over the other two in the same order.
<br/>
<br/>
As the game progresses, the cards are shuffled around, and more cards are added, leading to a tougher game, as you try to memorise mountains of info all together.
<br/>
<br/>
The <a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZQib2WgQ-w" target="_blank">Youtube video</a> can explain it better.  (..yes, it's also on iPhings)
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://jayenkai.socoder.net/GameList.php?ShowJust=210" target="_blank">You can download Cardagain for DS here!</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The reasonings for it's "Slapped together" appearance</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if folk'll play it, since nobody seems to be playing it in any other format , so I haven't spent a lot of time on it.
<br/>
But I love the game, so I figured I'd let you try it.
<br/>
<br/>
This edition is the absolute basics that are needed to play the game.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone does find themselves playing it, let me know, and I'll start putting together a bigger/better edition.
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, there's just a big-ass logo/rulesheet on the top screen, and the whole game takes place on the bottom one.
<br/>
<br/>
If I ever do bother to update, I'll switch that out for a highscore table, add in saved scores, and then throw in some of the other card decks and things.
<br/>
As it stands, it'll do, because all signs point to the fact that nobody'll play it!
<br/>
<br/>
Prove me wrong!!

Let me know if you think I should build it up a bit.
