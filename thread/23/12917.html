Judging from the fact that the example file loaded is in a PAlib folder, could I assume that any events are actually PAlib code? And if so, would the user be able to see the code, and therefore learn from it?<br/>_________________<br/>My favourite DS apps:

I think that he uses PA_lib as backbone for his Program. Example ?
<br/>
<br/>
You use his program for making a little Textexample, place the Text somewhere on the upper screen and then add a background to it.
<br/>
<br/>
So.
<br/>
<br/>
Next, if you click compile the program will get all info you gave him and convert it into code for PA_lib.
<br/>
<br/>
After this PA_lib will do the rest.
<br/>
<br/>
Mainly you will program with PA_lib, BUT you don't need to know a single code. THIS IS AWESOME, EXACTLY  WHAT I EVER WANTET.
<br/>
<br/>
PC does work, you have fun ^^.
<br/>
<br/>
Now PSP's Lua can go home, people will overhelm it with high quality DS Homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
I just hope we can use wifi to and make our own homebrew apps aswell which should support Fat/DLDI then too.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, PALib is the backbone for this program. I have no idea of making NDS Files myself :)
<br/>
<br/>
It uses a PALib example folder right now for compile because it was easier than creating new project folder.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and WiFi wise this is very possible if PAlib can do it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If PALib can do it, so can XtenDS - XtenDS is really just a PALib code generator and compiler :)

Uhh..  I don't know if you have noticed, but tools that make it easier to write games (like PAlib) don't have the reputation of producing "high quality DS homebrew" because it allows anyone to create a game.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I use PAlib, so I'm not knocking PAlib. (though, my homebrew is far from "high quality").  it's just that when a tool is this easy to use..  that is what you get.  So, it's not that PAlib isn't capable of producing high quality homebrew, just that most of the developers that use these tools aren't.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Indeed!
<br/>
<br/>
But C Integration is perfectly possible and required for an If statement for example.
<br/>
<br/>
Quite a few people I imagine feel that changing to total WYSIWYG is hard, so enabling C and PALib code integration is the best solution.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">www.dsgamemaker.com</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I know you're all eager to see XtenDS so to hurry up Beta Distribution I will allow the experienced PALib users to add-in missing features to XtenDS!

So the Beta will not have all the functions in. But They can be subsituted with PALib code.

I want the Beta here by the end of the holidays! (if you're not at school then that's about a week).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">www.dsgamemaker.com</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br/>
Just to clear this up this DS Gamemaker is for Windows and generates NDS files which can be run in emulator/put on flashcart!</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to thank you all on finding this!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The first point is that all progress will now be updated under my main website, which is <a href="http://invisionsoft.co.uk." target="_blank">http://invisionsoft.co.uk.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions, please use the chatbox on the right. I will be monitoring it from now on.
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, the other site, <a href="http://invisionsoft.co.uk/xtends" target="_blank">http://invisionsoft.co.uk/xtends</a> WILL be the future website for XtenDS, but not yet. So that is not being updated now.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thirdly (and possibly finally) XtenDS Alpha 01 is available for download. The first step is to head over to <a href="http://invisionsoft.co.uk" target="_blank">http://invisionsoft.co.uk</a> and read the first news post, which tells you how to download it. It also contains information about XtenDS and what you should expect. Oh, and one request: Please register on my site. Not only will it push the rankings up it will let you post in the chatbox, use comment system etc.
<br/>

The compile button does actually compile the NDS file invisibly, next version will tell you.

I beg to differ, but that's not the place to start an argument.

Dragon BASIC I believe.  The last post or two in the Beginners forum pertain to that program, and I've actually recently looked at it myself simply due to the fact that I have very little programming knowledge whatsoever, and this appears to give me a relatively easy way to create simple programs for the GBA.  Unfortunately I cannot get any sound output to work on real hardware (works in VBA) but that's a minor issue.  Obviously it's not the best solution for making a huge GBA project, but for minor ideas it works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What he said!
<br/>
I don't want to have to worry about learning syntax while programming the DS, on PC I can make the changes right away and compile in an instant.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">XtenDS Alpha 05 has been released featuring a number of fixes in the interface and programming. I have also decided that XtenDS should NOT be a Gamemaker but a tool designed to aid DS Developers, because that is realistically its true purpose.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Some features I added (and can remember, lol)</span>
<br/>
Set Text Colour
<br/>
Set Text Location
<br/>
C Code editor
<br/>
Scripts mechanism
<br/>
DS Like Interface and universal control layout
<br/>
Auto Update/Disable XtenDS from my PC
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the support. I wouldn't be here without all the great comments.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">www.dsgamemaker.com</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, I use that aswell. It's really useful. I'm not sure if I know how to program that, but It'd be great to learn how for future projects. I'll do some research and try to make an example thing. It'd be good to have highlighting like Green Comments, Red stings etc. These are definetly features to be considered.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i can't seem to load sprites, backgrounds, sounds and scripts
<br/>
<br/>
is this a bug??
<br/>
<br/>
and when i try to compile somthing, it says: error in rom output. the rom out location must exist and have enough room for your game.
<br/>
<br/>
how can i solve this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yup, I'm nearly there with sprites backgrounds sounds and scripts... but the build you'll be using, Alpha 05b, the most up-to-date version won't support them. But I can almost guarantee the next one will. And it will be called XtenDS 6, because the Alpha word is annoying. And as for your ROM output location, well the compile was successful, it will then try to copy the .nds file to your card, please set the location of your card by going to File &gt; Options &gt; Set ROM Output location (or something like that), or just copy the file from the HelloWorld folder in PALib examples to your card manually using Explorer. So yeah, I have the codes for sprites and backgrounds complete, I just need to put it in and add more functions. I'm not going to go into detail because I dont really have time, but this will be a pretty major update. You should be able to look forward to being able to share your games online from the application, use your own fontsprites (lots may be provided) etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope I've helped.
