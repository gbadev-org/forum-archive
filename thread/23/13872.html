I'm amazed that it actually got this far.  After the whole Gnirfleo ordeal I had my doubts, so I'm glad to see that this project actually exists.

Shame images couldn't be included, and sometimes you can't tell the difference between normal text and links, but it's looking very professional.  Good job.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Pretty cool.  I've been playing around with it and all the pages loaded and rendered pretty fast for me.  Unfortunately, there were a bunch of sites that just didn't work at all and some that just barely worked (I coulden't read my slashdot news :( ).
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, this is pretty cool.  It still has a long ways to go, but cool none the less.  It'd be great if it comes to the point where the majority of pages render fine with pictures...I have yet to buy opera (it really isn't at the top of my list of things to buy either though...).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#137123 - Mr. Picklesworth - Wed Aug 08, 2007 3:01 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You have done great work with this. Even if not quite the most featureful (so far), Okiwi seems clearly the best designed homebrew web browser for the DS because of its forward-thinking use of CSS stuff and its smooth, non-obtrusive user interface. (And, because it manages colour, it is the most visually appealing, too).
<br/>
Having followed your web log for a while, I can see that you have worked really hard to make this browser properly, following web browser standards and conventions quite solidly.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with the future!
<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have noticed trouble with is accessing the following URL:
<br/>
<a href="http://litstudytool.googlepages.com/" target="_blank">http://litstudytool.googlepages.com/</a>
<br/>
It goes between "Connecting" and "Waiting For Response" for a long while, then stops. (Could it be because of redirects associated with GooglePages, some other weird thing Google Pages does, or maybe Google Analytics?).
<br/>
<br/>
More stuff:
<br/>
<br/>
-Port numbers in the URL do not work. (For example, 192.168.1.120:81 will not be resolved).
<br/>
<br/>
-That site I tried to navigate to renders pretty well. (Good sign!). However, crazy stuff is happening with linking between pages.
<br/>
The URL format is something like this:
<br/>
<a href="http://192.168.1.120/index.php?page=/aboutus&amp;sect=/aboutus" target="_blank">http://192.168.1.120/index.php?page=/aboutus&amp;sect=/aboutus</a>
<br/>
Here is an example of a link:
<br/>
&lt;a href="index.php?page=/aboutus&amp;amp;sect=/aboutus"&gt;
<br/>
Normally, "&amp;amp;" should turn into an ampersand when the link is activated. However, in Okiwi, I do not believe that is happening; the URL that it has navigated to still has "&amp;amp;". It appears to be tacking that onto the end of the current URL, as well. Here is what happens if I click a link in Okiwi:
<br/>
The URL becomes 192.168.1.120/index.php?page=/aboutus&amp;amp;sect=/aboutus.
<br/>
After navigating for a while, the URL becomes really weird, though.
<br/>
192.168.1.120/index.php?page=aboutus/something&amp;amp;sect=/index.php?page=/aboutus&amp;amp;sect=/aboutus
<br/>
I believe my script is not picking up the section passed (in the sect variable) via the url, so it ends up using "/". (Actually, that shouldn't happen, so I could be wrong). Maybe Okiwi is tacking "index.php?..." onto the end of the url because it ends with a slash?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

yeah, i'm also getting an infinite spiral. i waited about 1 minute before powering off.
<br/>
<br/>
using ez4.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: My bad, i tried again and it booted. however i gives a message "unable to resolve host"
<br/>
<br/>
Also no sleep mode.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT2: actually i think i mucked up my wireless settings, so i'll confirm soon.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT3: fixed my settings and its working fine
<br/>
<br/>
thanks alot for your work.
<br/>
The keyboard design is excellent btw (don't know if you are the one who designed it)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#137256 - Mr. Picklesworth - Thu Aug 09, 2007 4:34 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, that keyboard is very clever. I was a little uncertain about having so many keys, but it makes fine sense to do it that way since we have a lot of vertical space, and it would be completely wasted with a more "conventional" layout.
<br/>
I also like that I can tap to place the cursor at different points in the text I am typing. Very nice!
<br/>
<br/>
I do have a problem with the keyboard, though, and that is the lack of key repeat. If I want to erase a lot of text, I have to press Backspace a lot of times. It would be good if I could just press Backspace and hold it for a while.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!
