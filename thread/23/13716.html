NDStation v1.2.1     |
<br/>
----------------------
<br/>
Neoflash Edition     |
<br/>
----------------------
<br/>
August 20, 2007      |
<br/>
----------------------
<br/>
<br/>
NDStation is a flasher for the EZFlash 3-in-1 Expansion Pack
<br/>
which allows you to package a ROM within a .NDS file and therefore
<br/>
run it from your Slot 1 flash card's main menu. Its purpose
<br/>
is to make things feel more integrated and unified on your flash card.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------------------
<br/>
Notes:               |
<br/>
----------------------
<br/>
<br/>
UPDATE: Version 1.2.1 fixes "NOR detection" on uncompressed ROMs.
<br/>
Source code is also cleaned up a lot.
<br/>
<br/>
Version 1.2 has arrived in time for the Neoflash Summer Compo!
<br/>
<br/>
Let's take a look at the new features:
<br/>
   ~ Compression for both GBA ROMs and borders
<br/>
   ~ Border bug fixed
<br/>
   ~ Automatic NOR detection
<br/>
<br/>
The compression used is LZSS for borders and GZip for ROMs.
<br/>
<br/>
The border bug being fixed means there are no longer white lines
<br/>
in the center, off to the side of the screen!
<br/>
<br/>
Automatic NOR detection means the program automatically knows if a
<br/>
ROM has already been flashed to the NOR and will skip the flashing
<br/>
process unless the A button is held. This makes using NOR ROMs a lot
<br/>
faster than before. Remember, always start your NOR ROMs from the
<br/>
.nds file and not by just booting Slot 2!
<br/>
<br/>
----------------------
<br/>
Usage:               |
<br/>
----------------------
<br/>
<br/>
To use NDStation, run the NDStation.exe included in this package.
<br/>
Some of the functions are self-explanatory, such as choosing the
<br/>
GBA ROM image you wish to use and where you want it to be copied.
<br/>
<br/>
"Game title" defines the embedded title in the ROM. The first line is
<br/>
automatically set to the basename of the ROM chosen, although it can
<br/>
easily be changed. "Use PSRAM" allows for faster loading for ROMs
<br/>
smaller than 16MB. "Use Compression" compresses your ROMs with gzip
<br/>
before packing them.
<br/>
<br/>
Clicking "Customize the NDS" will open a menu where you can change
<br/>
the icon for the NDS file and choose a custom border. "Preview NDS"
<br/>
gives you a rough idea of how the NDS will appear on R4DS's menu.
<br/>
<br/>
"Go..." builds your .NDS file, and is finished when a message box pops
<br/>
up and says "Complete!" Don't forget to DLDI patch the NDS for your card.
<br/>
<br/>

I am currently writing a multiplatform (I hope :P) GUI. However, it does use an app called Zenity that is included in GNOME in Linux, but it is not included in Mac OS X.

If you would like, you can go ahead and install Zenity using that tutorial so that you will be able to use my GUI which should be included in the next official release.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Zenity is something somewhat similar to Visual Basic for Windows but much more basic. It lets me write a shell script and then easily add GUI dialog box and such to make it look much nicer. In order to install in on a Mac, you are going to first have to install Darwinports from here: <a href="http://zenity.darwinports.com/install/" target="_blank">http://zenity.darwinports.com/install/</a>
<br/>
Darwinports is just a project to make it easier to port Linux applications to Mac OS. If you've never used a console before, that site can seem a bit confusing, however it's not nearly as difficult as it seems and the tutorials are quite detailed and guide you through all of the steps. For the most part, you just type what they tell you to. I'm not really sure how easy it is to uninstall honestly. I have never tried this out because I don't own a Mac. Unfortunately, I can't guarantee that my script will work on a Mac. However, Idon't see any reason why it wouldn't. Sorry it's not a little easier to install, but I made this with Linux in mind and I just figured that it should theoretically work in Mac OS as well. The only way I can know for sure if it'll work in Mac OS X is if someone trys it out for me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
OK, I'm almost convinced to try it.
<br/>
<br/>
I've used Fink to do this sort of install of ported Linux stuff, but am annoyed with the state of my filesystem because of it. So I don't do it any more and am stuck with these folders and files I don't really know what to do with.
<br/>
<br/>
What I'm really interested in is you saying that the core of this thing is simple a shell script.
<br/>
<br/>
If so, there's a native app for Mac OS X called <a class="postlink" href="http://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus" target="_blank">Platypus</a> that I have used before. It can wrap shell scripts written in lots of different languages, providing a simple GUI (showing output, input using drag and drop or command line). A more detailed GUI (allowing other inputs) can be added using an optional library <a class="postlink" href="http://cocoadialog.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">CocoaDialog</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I'm offering here is to do a native Mac OS X version of this. :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, great job, this is impressive stuff. A few questions though.
<br/>
<br/>
1. The Linux version does not write a 'mode.txt' when in NOR mode. Is that normal? should there be a 'N' in there? Because when I use NOR on the Windows version, it works, and it doesn't on Linux and I'm trying to figure out why.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Is there a way to verify that the ROM currently loaded in NOR is possibly the same as the one we are trying to load, and just boot to slot-2 immediately? That would allow for a lot of transparency, without requiring people to remember what is in their cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Saves do not have to be copied off the NOR, right? Or do they? How does the loader figure out what to do with an old save image when it's about to erase the NOR?
<br/>
<br/>
4. Is there any chance of having the progress bar from gbaldr? That would feel a lot nicer than just staring at 'Erasing NOR' for a minute or so.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes, that is normal. chuckstudios just got kind of lazy when adding the PSRAM loading and I took advantage of it. Basically, the loader checks mode.txt, and if it has a P in it, it switches to PSRAM mode, if there isn't a mode.txt then it'll just load the game using NOR. Actually, I just realized something while typing this. Does it still use NOR correctly when you patch the ROM using my script?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm sorry, I'm going to sound the total newbie -- especially bumping this old and forgotten thread like this -- but I wanted to ask, is there any hope that we might see an updated version of NDStation that works with the newer 3-in-1 flash carts?  I really love the idea of this tool.  Not only does it save one a lot of time and troubles, but it provides compression as well.  Always a nice thing considering how quickly even a SDHC card can fill up sometimes...  Personally, I'm probably most sick of dealing with this save file handling interface on every single run of a GBA game especially...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
