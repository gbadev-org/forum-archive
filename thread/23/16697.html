    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to announce my first two DS projects.
<br/>
<br/>
The first is a port of a game called <span style="font-style: italic">Gnome Quod</span>. It is similar to <span style="font-style: italic">Connect Four</span> only that you are trying to draw the corners of a square instead of a row. The goal of the port was to add a DS-friendly interface while keeping the (quite addicting) game mechanics. You'll find the binary, source and screenshots at <a class="postlink" href="http://quod.23inch.de" target="_blank">quod.23inch.de</a>. I tested it with no$gba and DeSmuME.
<br/>
<br/>
The second game is a variation of <span style="font-style: italic">KJumpingCube</span>. I wanted to play around with tiles so I figured, I'd try to use triangles instead of squares. The result is a completely different game that is still fun to play. You'll find the binary, source and a screenshot at <a class="postlink" href="http://jump.23inch.de" target="_blank">jump.23inch.de</a>. It works with no$gba but not in DeSmuME, which seems to have a problem with the module I used for background music.
<br/>
<br/>
Both games are most fun when played with more than one person though they have built-in AI, too.
<br/>
<br/>
So let me know, what you think. I just started playing around with the DS and am always happy to get some feedback.
<br/>
<br/>
So long,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you all. Great to hear that someone likes those games. I'm already working on my next project but it will be slightly more complex so it might take a while.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
