It's a racing game controled by the Stylus.
<br/>
What do you think about it?

<br/>
Do you have plans for local multiplayer support? This would be a great game to play with 2-4 players!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
At present, the game is for 1 player versus 3 rivals(CPU).
<br/>
But in future versions I would like to implement multiplayer support.
<br/>
I think that the only way to do this nowadays is via Wifi router.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DS-to-DS communication seems to be working, actually.  The user Pete_Lockwood has a slight modification to ndslib that makes it possible and a demo program that shows it works.

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Mod: please don't link to this stuff, it doesn't conform to wifi standards and will cause issues for other wifi networks</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would not touch that code with a 40 foot barge poll.  I'd sugest waiting until sgstar gets the correct ad-hoc code working as using that code you pointed to Kayvon you could cause damage to a normaly working WiFi network.
<br/>
<br/>
I have read the arguments for and against using it, but the main one I want to put forward here is from the point of view of trying to get Nintendo to help homebrew developers on to the DS in a legal way.  If we start producing libraries and apps that can cause a normal DS to turn into a WiFi killer from some incorrectly setup wifi code then I'm sure Nintendo will attempt to make the use of homebrew carts even more illegal than they are now.  Heck they might actually start attempting to do what team twizzlers, and other hacking groups are doing - and reverse engineer a homebrew launcher on the DSi to attempt to fix the loop holes before we can exploit them to get stuff running.  If they start doing this, then there will be fewer loop holes for us to use to run homebrew on the DSi / DS, and I'd like to actually code something decent on the DS and release it before that happens...
<br/>
<br/>
Jovin, just use the current wifi libs, wait until sgstar has a working wifilib with correct 802.11 frames, then add in ad-hoc mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Any idea how long until that's available? I wasn't aware any work was being done on DS-to-DS communications.
<br/>
<br/>
If it's something that will yield results in the next month or two, that's great. Otherwise, I'm proceeding with what's in the links. The occasional packet output from the DS is unlikely to cause a significant disturbance in other nearby wifi apps.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
