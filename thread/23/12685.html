<br/>
<br/>
So far, It's the best SNES emulator I have used for the DS.. and he just released a new version today (0.4 final).  If you haven't heard of this yet, you should check it out here:

That's because the game puts the Super NES in a special screen mode where each tile can be scrolled up and down by 1-pixel increments. The stage "Touch Fuzzy Get Dizzy" in Yoshi's Island uses the same mode. The GBA/DS graphics hardware doesn't have this mode, which is why GBA Puzzle League uses a playfield of 72 sprites (instead of background tiles) and GBA Yoshi's Island uses much coarser scrolling for that level. The only way I can see to solve this is to use high-level emulation of that screen mode, which is more work than just buying a copy of GBA Puzzle League especially now that there are a commercial DS spiritual sequel Meteos, a DS homebrew clone "tetattds", and purported screenshots of an official DS version.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Super NES had only three layers in plain "text" mode. Your suggestion would have wasted two of those layers on the playfield.
<br/>
<br/>
No, line-by-line scrolling does not fix games that use tile-by-tile scrolling such as PdP/TA.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Update: <span style="font-weight: bold">SNEmul v0.5 beta</span>
<br/>
<br/>
This version aims to improve in sound and graphics. As the emulation becomes more and more complex, it is more and more difficult to add new features without breaking the emulation overall, so some new feature will not be enabled by default for all games. The configuration file select which features are enabled or not, and becomes very important (so don?t forget to put it in the root directory!).
<br/>
<br/>
I tried very hard to improve sound, and i succeeded to get much better musics in some games, but there may still some ?pops? or ?cracks? sometimes, and the sound can slowdown or goes mad in some rare circumtances (the ARM7 seems not powerful enough).
<br/>
<br/>
A new menu has been added : the GFX config menu, this menu offer a simple way to change the GFX behaviour in real time. The emulation is not stopped like in the options menu, you can enable/disable several features and see which ones are better for the game. (See README for more informations)
<br/>
Here is the list of changes
<br/>
<br/>
    * Changed the Sound timers, now the timers should be a bit more accurate and removed the timers hacks
<br/>
    * Moved back the Sound RAM in the fast ARM7 RAM, removed unused code from ARM7 codes
<br/>
    * Now support sprite address change during frame (limited to two addresses by frame), this makes Ogre Battle much more playable
<br/>
    * Left handed people can now enjoy the SNES mouse option (right buttons can be used like left joypad).
<br/>
    * Options can now be saved in configuration file
<br/>
    * New SNES config menu
<br/>
    * Fixed some bugs
<br/>
<br/>
Optionnal feature (enabled by configuration file):
<br/>
<br/>
    * Added sound synchronisation fixes, this is a set of flags that make ARM9 slowdown or make ARM9 wait for the ARM7. Those options make Square games (and other games) sound much better, but also break sound in other games. So this option is available through the configuration file. I only changed for the configuraiton file for Chrono Trigger, SOM1 and FFVI. You will have to modify the configuration and test the options for other games.
<br/>
    * Added priority per tile for BG3, by detecting if there are more low or high priority per tile at each line (see README)
<br/>
    * Added priority per tile for BG1 and BG2, by using the fourth DS layer. Low priority tiles go to fourth layer, and high priority per tiles (this idea was taken from SNESAdvance).
<br/>
    * Sprites priorities can now be changed. See configuraiton file for more informations. The default is 1123 but 1223 makes some games look better (like Castlevania IV first level for instance)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh wow! The sound is excellent! I noticed though that in zelda I can't fix the layers so that link walks underneath bridges and trees etc. It seemed like I was able to do this fine in v0.4 ...

Also I noticed a weird bug in Demons Crest (U) [!]
<br/>
The fight with the second boss is impossible to beat (can't be damaged), and after I die and start at the last checkpoint I can't harm any of the enemies that I could before... I could provide a save state if you like.
<br/>
The SNES mouse emulation is pretty awesome! Although in mario paint it doesn't work so well, I have to recalibrate with the up button frequently. I would like an option to be able to use the mouse kinda like a laptop touch pad, the game would stay on the top screen, but movement of the mouse is relative to the change in the X and Y coordinates, not absolute. Also the mouse buttons would work just like a mouse button (you don't have to tap to click)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

<br/>
Did you put the last snemul.cfg in root directory ? Because you should not need to recalibrate with mario paint . The emulator modifies the internal variables of the game to move the mouse cursor accurately. This feature is available in Populous II, Eye of the beholder, Mario Paint and Civilization.

SCSD_moon.dldi isn't the <span style="font-style: italic">correct</span> one, it's just something to try if the other doesn't work, I know some people's SD cards only work with the moon version.

One quick question however, do you know what is ailing Super Punchout? Your distro is the only one I've had luck with that will run it, and I've got to tell you the emulation is just GREAT! But one small problem :( All the sprites have a transparency to them. Normally, just "Little Mac" would be transparent so you can see the boxer behind him, but in this case, everyone is transparent.

<br/>
Anyone have any luck with settings to get the opponent to display correctly?
