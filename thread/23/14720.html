12 is okey but just for cartoons.

could be possible to use xvid and PCM waveform ? audio will incrase filesize but DS will need much less process to  decode audio, and we can use that "power" to incrase video quality,

<br/>
ARM7 errors are normal when seeking. In your case, the 2 indicates it was an error decoding, the 9 indicates it was a corrupted Huffman table and the 1B00 is the offset within the AVI buffer that the data was read from. This is caused by the interrupted MP3 stream that happened when the seek jumped around in the file.
<br/>
<br/>
pas:
<br/>
Yes, this is as optimised as I am willing to do. There's still the possibility of coding everything in hand optimised ARM ASM, but there won't be a big enough performance increase for the time spent. 
<br/>
<br/>
Cid2Mizard:
<br/>
You must DLDI patch it. There are no built-in drivers in the version of libfat I'm using.
<br/>
<br/>
spalnndstest:
<br/>
I'm aware that 12fps isn't enough for live action. The name originally derived from "cartoon videos for DS". I mainly watch animated shows on my DS anyway, so I'm not too worried. Avatar is awesome on the DS. The MP3 decoding is done completely on the ARM7. The ARM9 takes care of decoding the video and buffering the AVI file from disc. There's nothing more than can be offloaded to the ARM7 without creating synchronisation issues and data transfer delays.

For all those people that haven't figured it out from the link or the URL in the demo vid, there is a <a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/tuna-vids/index.html" target="_blank">webpage for tuna-viDS</a>. Source code is available there but it is quite ugly. Tuna-viDS defaults to "fat0:/tuna-vids.avi" but it will use the filename in arg[2] if it is there. That way, the launcher can specify a file to open.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I took a look at the file you uploaded. It has extra data that I wasn't ignoring correctly. A fix for that will be in the next version. It has another problem, however. It is storing incomplete MP3 frames in each AVI chunk. Although some muxers produce AVIs like that, it is in breach of the AVI spec and basically requires that I use a separate audio input stream buffer. I won't be doing this, as it'll slow down tuna-viDS and, if the muxer was written to spec, then it shouldn't be necessary anyway. 
<br/>
<br/>
You can clean up the AVI using ffmpeg with the following command:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just a quick observation that's probably in the "captain obvious" category:  if you decrease the framerate, you can afford to use a higher bitrate without lagging.  I used a framerate of 10 and a bitrate of 256 kbps on a marching band video and it came out very good.  A bit choppy, but it still has a clear picture and, unlike every attempt at converting this particular video to DPG, it's in-sync the whole time through.  A marching band video needs to be in-sync to be effective, so I'm grateful that I can finally watch it on my DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Chishm, and good job.  The only addition I can think of would be a file chooser so I don't have to rename my video files with DSO each time I wish to change videos.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  384 kbps seems to work alright as well, though it paused for a split second a couple times during playback.  I haven't tested to see what the upper limit is, but I'd imagine 384 kbps at 256x192 and 10 fps is pushing it.  That's more than enough for me to work with anyway.  Any more than that isn't noticeable at such a low resolution and only increases filesize.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can run the video at a maximum of 12fps, less if there is a lot of motion. Look at the frame counter on the bottom of the screen to get an idea of what FPS you should be encoding it as. If the video can't keep up with the audio, the MP3 decoder will run out of data and stop, and the video will stop too.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

it offer you can use any standar video transcoder. just that...
<br/>
<br/>
in my opinion xvid use too much compression to be used in NDS, as you can see; u can get just 10 to 12 fps, and even in 10 FPS the picture is not crystal clear like with dsmPlayer.
<br/>
<br/>
i think like you, as we're having to re-encode the video anyway let's better choice a standar codec we can find in any video converter but more light than dsm and with better quality than dpg,

Guys.... stop this useless: "if we could get the official codec blabla" just focus and stay on topic so the mods don't have to delete your offtopic posts, ok ?
<br/>
<br/>
To stay ontopic: I did a bit testing, and using 1 channel (mono) sound, xvid codec and mp3 decoding I get pretty damn nice result if you think that it is AVI that plays on your very own DS !
<br/>
<br/>
the only thing I hope that gets fixed is the point that the video's lose sync after some minutes (20~30).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Too many macroblocks per second. Most MPEG-1 videos are encoded at 320x240 at 30 fps (QVGA for computer), 352x240 at 30 fps (NTSC VCD), or 352x288 at 25 fps (PAL VCD), with 44100 Hz (possibly stereo) layer 2 audio. DPG, on the other hand, typically has 256x192 pixels at 12 to 15 fps and 32000 Hz mono layer 2 audio.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It uses MPEG-4 part 2, which is also implemented in Xvid. Mobile phones have much faster CPUs compared to the DS, which really is underpowered.
<br/>
<br/>
AVI is also just a container format. It is the specific combination of AVI, Xvid and MP3 that is important here. MoonLight could've used AVI to store MPEG-1 video instead of DPG. I'm not sure why he didn't. AVI has a low overhead and requires only one buffer and file reader for both audio and video streams.

I figured it was because of the chunk header overhead when interleaving the streams.

DPG has a master seek table (which AVI also provides) that adds a few % to overall file size anyway. The only reason I can think of for not using AVI is that the audio can be read independently of the video, and no de-interleaving needs to be performed.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I looked at the previous one and thought it was strange that you chose such a high bitrate.  You could probably increase it from 96kbps to something higher, but you've got the right idea.  One question though:  shouldn't the "Output video codec" at the top be XviD and not DivX?

Agreed.  Luckily, Chishm did say that the filename could be passed as an argument, so I don't imagine it would be terribly hard for someone else to add a simple file browser, even if Chishm himself doesn't have time to do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, I guess you're right ^^. I guess I have to try it with DivX aswell to see if I get even better results. (I guess using Youtube vids for this is just wrong cause they have such a high pixelation... )
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I took 96kbps cause Chishm posted it on his webpage like this, though I may try other bitrates to see if they work better
<br/>
BTW: I think this is quite useable for any kind of video, maybe it's just my kind of low expectations but I find any video very watchable using this.
<br/>
<br/>
The benefiz this has over Moonshell's dpg format is clear:
<br/>
    a) the conversion times are MUCH shorter
<br/>
    b) the file is watchable on the PC without having to use a special         encoder (although it is kinda pixelated when streched to full-screen, but this was to expecting when you watch a 256x192 vid on the DS :) )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you want to submit a skin, get the <a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/tuna-vids/controls.xcf" target="_blank">tuna-viDS skin template</a>.

Blue and white areas are part of the background and can be modified as much as you like. Yellow areas will not be seen - they'll be covered with text or the seek bar. Green and red areas are controls. The vertical stripes in the top green, red and yellow area is the seek bar, where the seek bar is built from tiles so that red indicates video already played and green indicates stuff that hasn't been played yet. The black area is the character set and the play control. Keep the characters 8 pixels wide by 16 pixels high. The sun icon is used to control the bottom screen backlight. Only one of the play or pause icons will be shown, depending on whether the video is paused or playing.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

Basically, he takes each frame and compresses it independently with a simple lossless compression format. He then compresses the audio with a lossless codec, and slams the two streams together.

How high do you think could we get the framerate if we use 256x192 as the resolution and 32 as the bit rate  ?

And, about that filebrowser passing thingy, do you mean we have a tuna-vids.nds in the root, that is the filebrowser and tun-vids opens that ? wouldn't that change the nds in the RAM therefore hindering it from running avis ? Further explanation might be needed</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It uses Xvid, mp3 mono, a bitrate of 192 kbps for both sound and video and it works WONDERFULL, I can even read the text, and encoded the video using batchdpg too and the avi one looks as good as the dpg one and encodes faster, the only drawback is that it is 8 fps lower, but I guess thats ok.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by pas on Mon Dec 31, 2007 6:42 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

It sounds like the M3 CF DLDI is broken. This error never showed up before because libfat had, until recently, a built-in driver for the M3 CF. I'll look into rewriting it when I get my PC set up again (reinstalling Windows after removing 2 years of accumulated cruft).

I did put a source zip on my site, but it turns out I zipped up the wrong folder or something, so it contains nothing but crap.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know if this has been mentioned before (probably has) but xvidcore is a very bad choice as a decoder. It doesn't handle all streams (mainly stuff its own encoder produced, which, arguably, is &gt;75% of all user-created ISO-MPEG4 content out there), and isn't very optimised. libavcodec is the fastest MPEG1/2/4 decoder on the planet, on most platforms, and it eats pretty much anything (it includes specific workarounds for known bugs in certain versions of encoders). As far as I know it's also pretty portable. Any specific reasons to using xvidcore as opposed to libavcodec, other than "it seemed like a good idea at the time" ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/tuna-vids/tuna-vids-1.0.zip" target="_blank">Tuna-viDS version 1.0</a> is out now. Source is available on the <a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/tuna-vids/index.html" target="_blank">web page</a>. It includes a skin by Ferrie, a file chooser and fixes a few bugs.
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;-- This is the 1337-est release evah!
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
R4DS / M3 Simply users should check out the <a class="postlink" href="http://dldi.drunkencoders.com/index.php?title=R4TF" target="_blank">R4DS page on DLDI wiki</a>, in particular the 2nd version of the driver. Any other SLOT-1 card users should report your card somewhere (here I suppose). It's likely that the driver was compiled using the ARM9 version of libnds due to a mistake in the DLDI template supplied with devkitARM. This will cause it to crash when used by the loader, which runs it on the ARM7. One work-around is to patch tuna-viDS.nds directly and not use the loader, sticking to just fat0:/tuna-vids.avi as the video file.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

<br/>
BTW: I heard this is the first evar Homebrew to use arguments, is this true ?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:... the gui looks great but 2 things:
<br/>
<br/>
1. I can't get past the load blablabla.avi with /:fat0 tuna-vids.nds it remains there until I shut the DS down.
<br/>
( I patched it correct so no worrys here, and I use a M3 Simply)
<br/>
<br/>
2. Like already mentioned, the stoping of anything after finishing movie playback is really awkward, I think it would be much nicer if you could always retun to the filelist after finishing a movie (or play the next movie in that directory optionally)[if this is not possible due to the argument nds system loading why not release a normal fat versions for those of us who don't care about skins ?]

<br/>
Aside from this: GREAT WORK I love this videoplayer the most.

Regardless, I eventually got it to work using a Supercard miniSD and the SCSD_moon.dldi file.

<br/>
<br/>
For the next (possible) version of tuna-vids I got some minor requests:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Jump back to the loader after the video has finished playing (may be possible, but I think the only one who could answer this would be you chishm)
<br/>
<br/>
2. Include a software volume control like moonshell has to get low sound videos louder without the need to reconvert every video.
<br/>
<br/>
3. save the last played video file path in a ini file so it will open as soon as tuna-vids is started (after pressing B it should get back to the Folder where the Video was from, for references check moonshell)

Than again, tuna-viDS avi's can't be compared with DPG files. DPG has 20 plus fps, tuna has 12 fps max, DPG has stereo sound, tuna has mono.

ok i got the location problem fixed all i had to do was put %1 lol easy but am now looking into batch converting.
<br/>
<br/>
ok a new version is up and running just drag your video onto the exe and it will convert it and place the new file on the desktop with TV at the end you can create a shortcut and drag onto this works the same also i have made it so that you can configure the settings edit the config.ini file.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://johnconn.wordpress.com/pocket-physics/" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue">My Pocket Physics Stuff</span></a>

What is the maximum for Quality ? What about a parameter in the ini file that allows us to self choose the output directory ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your work, and hannah is a sweet name.

The only thing left now is that tunavids sometimes doesn't play videos full. I ripped a video from ign for testing purpuroses and guess what ? It played some time and then suddenly had finished.
<br/>
<br/>
Chishm... any ideas ? (shall I send you the vid ?)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.petitiononline.com/blizzds/petition.html" target="_blank">Starcraft DS ?</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Only things left are batch converting and output path editing via config file ^^.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm amazed at how fast and good this works... why is SUPER ? is so damn slow and outputs such a crappy quality when it is based on ffmpeg ?
<br/>
<br/>
Well anyway, I love this thing.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.petitiononline.com/blizzds/petition.html" target="_blank">Starcraft DS ?</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hey, chishm, I had a few ideas:
<br/>
1) Because the encoder already decodes mp3's for the avi files, could you allow this program to play mp3 files?
<br/>
2) Skinning, of course
<br/>
3) Maybe a bmp/png/jpg file with the same name as a video file (ex: sheep.avi &amp; sheep.png) could be displayed on the top screen when you highlight a video, like a preview image of sorts.
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, I like the way this is going.  The videos I encoded still looked great and they had a small filesize, giving my DS and upper hand over my PSP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
