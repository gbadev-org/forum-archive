    <h4>#155231 - TheMagnitude - Sat Apr 26, 2008 11:00 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Note: This used to be know as: "Mandelbrot Fractal App v2.0" but is now know as: "Fractal Junkie 1.0"
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">So why the name change? And Im sure I downloaded v2.0 before, so how can v1.0 be a new version?</span>
<br/>
I wanted to change the name to a more generic name instead of limiting the name to the Mandelbrot set only, so now the new name Fractal Junkie implies several fractals, which it does have serveral fractals. And it's now v1.0 simply because of the name change.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Whats new in this version then?</span>
<br/>
-Julia sets
<br/>
-More colour palletes
<br/>
-More efficient "only render when need be" system
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">How to use:</span>
<br/>
D-PAD: Move 32px
<br/>
TOUCH: Draw a new view
<br/>
R/L: +/- Iterations
<br/>
A: Colour Styles
<br/>
B: Colour Pallets
<br/>
X: Toggle precise rendering
<br/>
Y: Toggle Julia set mode
<br/>
START: Start over
<br/>
SELECT: Goto previous image
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Current Features</span>
<br/>
-64bit accuracy
<br/>
-Mandelbrot set
<br/>

I already posted on dcemu, but I wanted to make sure you saw this:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Nice color options (are you going to add more?)
<br/>
2. I can't help but ask, are you going to implement a drag-to-zoom feature like Davr's mandelbrot program?
<br/>
3. I have yet to see a save feature work for me to save those awesome Mandelbrot pics. I don't know about you, but that would be the ultimate.
<br/>
<br/>
Great app. I'm looking forward to the next release!  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When you say save them mandelbrot pics, do you mean save the image as a png, or save the coordinates so you can load them up next time, or both :)?
<br/>
<br/>
Im not quite sure what you mean by drag-to-zoom but ill check out Davr's Mandelbrot implementation.
<br/>
<br/>
As with colour the next version you will be able to alternate between colour palletes and colour styles without having to load the entire image again :)
<br/>
<br/>
And also in the next version there will be an option to draw it out precisesly instead of using a quick method.
<br/>
<br/>
Expect a new "clean up" version within the next few days.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh sweet, I didn't think of saving the coordinates, that's pretty cool. :)  I was referring to saving the picture (like png) cause if I find a really cool looking image I could put it on my computer.
<br/>
<br/>
In Davr's it's pretty cool. It's like "dragging a box" from the top left corner to the bottom right corner, and the "box" that you "drag" is the level of zoom. Really nifty stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah I personally like a red-on-black color theme. Yeah, I just went there.   :)
<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait for the next release, the new features sound nice.  So do you use DevKitARM? I'm trying to get into DS Programming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Draw onto your image with the colour you want but don't do "image[pixel] = my colour", do "image[pixel] = image[pixel] ^ my colour". Then when you don't want to see the box any more, redraw your box again (with the xor) and the original pixel will come back!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
suggestions:
<br/>
1. let me zoom/scroll while it's still drawing.
<br/>
2. always show the controls on the top screen
<br/>
3. have a display of how much you've zoomed in
<br/>
<br/>
Also, here's <a class="postlink" href="http://blog.davr.org/category/nintendo-ds/mandelbrot/" target="_blank">my NDS mandelbrot app</a>. I should go back and update it one of these days, but check out the nice screenshots anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ah, so you're Davr. I know this is probably a lot harder said than done, but it would be sweet if you could get your Mandelbrot program working with DLDI. And BTW, I was a huge fan of your Draw program when you were developing it. I've really enjoyed your creations.
<br/>

Hopefully I can get into DS programming over the summer and make some of my own contributions to the homebrew community.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have done the drag box
<br/>
<br/>
@ simonjhall
<br/>
I've never used the XOR operator before so I just cached the image and inversed each pixel in the bounds, which doesn't seem to slow it down and it looks kinda cool so Ill stick to that for now.
<br/>
<br/>
@ josath
<br/>
I may have a look at the competition, but i have got alot of revision to do.
<br/>
I have tried to interrupt drawing for user input but my attemps have not worked so far.
<br/>
When I get a proper GUI together your suggestions will be noted. At the moment for the top screen Im just using printf();
<br/>
<br/>
@ everyone
<br/>
I have finished the next version which is a bit more than a "clean up" version which I said it would be a few days ago, it's much better now.
<br/>
<br/>
I have added support for custom <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set" target="_blank">Julia Sets</a>!!
<br/>
And I have added the option to precisely render the image or render it quickly, and I have added the drag to zoom feature where you select an area of the image to zoom into. And Ive added a few more colour schemes.
<br/>
<br/>
And i guess I have cleaned it up quite a bit aswell.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway you cant have it now I gotta do some testing tonight, expect the release tommorow if I don't have truck loads of revision to do.
