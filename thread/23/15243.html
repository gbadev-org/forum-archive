<br/>
<br/>
This build includes some optimizations of the software renderer and the CPU Core, and fixed a problem with the multiplayer pad reading of SGB games.
<br/>

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b><a class="postlink" href="http://lameboy.nutki.com" target="_blank">lameboy.nutki.com</a> wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">This release has very short change log and does not address many of the problems pointed out in last post comments. I have managed to fix annoying SGB multi player games input problem though. Apart from this the only difference to 0.10 is emulation speed. Both video render and CPU interpreter were heavily optimized. Sadly some games still wonâ€™t do its 60fps.
<br/>
<br/>
Since majority of the code base was touched in process of optimization there can be some regression in compatibility. Please report games that stopped working (or degraded in some way) with this version in comments.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Save states are in early phase now, but somehow working. As a feature when save state is used game is not saved to regular .sav at the same time. Super Gameboy emulation on the other hand is pretty much done (of course no SNES sounds, as in other emulators).
<br/>
<br/>
Note for 3in1 expansion rumble: To use 3in1 Expansion Pack in Lameboy you need other software that enable it and slot1 device with soft reset capability. It was tested with 3in1_ExpPack_tool.
<br/>
<br/>
Note for M3 SD/CF and other slot2 devices users: I have removed all card drivers from libfat except for DLDI, so you have to dldi patch it.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"><br/>_________________<br/>Equipment:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice update, cool new features. Found a bug though, after saving, when I went to load another game, the directory listing was massively corrupted. It was showing parts of files as filenames and other junk. The filesystem on the card itself was fine though and I was still able to find my games in the list and load them.
<br/>
<br/>
Also nice that X/Y can be remapped, but A/B can't, so we still can't do Y=B, B=A like it should be. :(<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
