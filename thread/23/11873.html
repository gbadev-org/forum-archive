<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: darkblue"><span style="font-weight: bold">Release notes:</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Version 1.51</span> (stable) 2006/12/16
<br/>
<span style="color: darkblue">- Corresponded to GBAMP/SD.
<br/>
- Voice/image quality of DPG has been greatly improved. Please re-encode try again. Thank you for Firon.
<br/>
- [Chinese traditional] by nhlay was added to the language file of dpgenc.
<br/>
- Skin supported for The file cursor with alpha channel.
<br/>
- The bug that failed in reading of the genre of IDv3 because of the MP3 plug-in was corrected.
<br/>
- The bug with the loop noise when MP3 reproduced was corrected.
<br/>
- I was misunderstanding the default setting of the resume. It corrected.
<br/>
- About the setting that turns off the power supply of NDS when you shut the cap. The bug that this doesn't work was corrected.</span>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Version 1.50</span> (stable) 2006/12/03
<br/>
<span style="color: darkblue">- Corresponded to EZ4/DSLink. I wish to express my deep gratitude to Rudolph.
<br/>
- 'The cartridge of enhancing the memory of DS browser' can be used for the cache memory.
<br/>
- The resume item was added. (sound volume, reproduction mode, and NDSLite backlight brightness)
<br/>
- ResumeUsingWhileMusicPlaying item was added to [System] section of global.ini. The resume is preserved while performing the tune.
<br/>
- The DPG format was renewed. As for the DPG file made with a new encoder, seek is fast and the image doesn't fall into disorder either. Especially, it is remarkable in a long video.

Correct.
<br/>
<br/>
Xtreme: it's no surprise because the keyint is set to 60, instead of the default of 30. 1 extra FPS would drop quality a little more probably.
<br/>
<br/>
Like I've said bother, don't bother with DPG Tools, and just use BatchDPG.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking, if the Resume function for music is writing to your SD card every 5 seconds, then you'll end up with an astronomical amount of writes to your card after a few hours. It's a very easy way to kill your SD card. What was Infantile thinking? He needs to make it write to SRAM instead, though this would require him either creating the save file for each device, or requiring users to run it through the GM/patcher for the card.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Firon on Thu Dec 07, 2006 4:15 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

1.5 beta 3. Only pre-compiled .NDS and dpgenc/dpgshow are provided, so install 1.5 and then replace the nds with one from here. Or just put it in the same folder with a different name. Make sure you pick the correct one for your flashcart.
<br/>
<br/>
24fps DPG playback (no skips!). And older videos should play back better too.
<br/>
High quality profile added (use dpgenc_plan, profile selection is in the Options) Uses B-frames without any decoding speed penalty. Identical to the VeryHigh/Ultra profile from BatchDPG.
<br/>
B-frames no longer cause a crash (beta 1/2 did).
<br/>
&gt;160kbps audio can no longer raise volume beyond 100% because of a lack of CPU power (skips).
<br/>
TwoLame is now used for audio encoding, so the audio quality is much much better. Same as BatchDPG since it uses Joint Stereo.

Low-quality profile 24fps (sample)

<br/>
1.50 worked great for me on a Supercard CF, so I can't wait to try this beta!
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I could use a difference checker thing to quickly get the changes into my very specific global.ini to avoid that bother that happens with every release.
<br/>
Good thing the actual appearance isn't changing much anymore so I can just keep my old skin files! (That bit there can be a real pain... although it is usually worth it).
<br/>
<br/>
Do the DPG Playback changes involve more changes to the encoder?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow... good, good.
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if Moonlight is planning to check out Internet audio streaming like with DSOrganize. It can be made fairly transparent, and his plugin system would work beautifully with that sort of stuff!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
Okay, just watched an episode of Star Trek: TOS on it. (Ah... having a bunch of idle computers at my disposal to rip / convert this stuff is great :p)
<br/>
<br/>
...Wow!!
<br/>
A quick before and after comparison (which is easy since all that's changed with this beta is the still tiny nds file) really shows how impressive this is. Congratulations, Moonlight, if you are reading this!<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

It think it was full resolution (256x192) ( I simply started dpdenc the first time,
<br/>
and encoded the video). But I will check when I'm back at home.
<br/>
<br/>
The good message is, that even with full resolution and the freezes,
<br/>
video and audio were always in sync :-)
<br/>
<br/>
My SD card is kind of noname brand, so this can always be a source of
<br/>
problems.
<br/>
<br/>
But one concern is still there: seeking seems only to work backwards,
<br/>
forward seeking seems to jump a very little forward, but not really usable.
<br/>
When I keep pressing the right direction pad, it also freezes, only
<br/>
single taps seems to forward a little bit.
<br/>
But since I never used Moonshell before and the GBAMPSD integration is
<br/>
very fresh, perhaps I am doing something wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
I read about better seeking support in 1.5.1 with the dpg2 format, and
<br/>
this seems the format my video was encoded.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I want to use C++ with DLL(MoonShellPlugin or DLDI).

<br/>
'glue' is the section of code that is used for interworking between THUMB and ARM code. It doesn't use the GOT in -fPIC mode because the linker inserts it, not the compiler. Likewise, C++ constructors and destructors use code that isn't compiled using -fPIC mode. Unfortunately it is put in the same section as the rest of the code so I can't work on a specific region of memory. To fix this, I set the base memory address of DLDI compiled code (ddmem in dldi.ld) to 0xBF800000. This constant is unlikely to ever show up in code, as it is a reserved instruction in THUMB mode and an invalid SWI in ARM mode. In this way, I can modify any value starting with 0xBF8????? to point to the correct location in memory.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have DRP r17 installed, so I can't test DLDI with that. To get -fPIC code to compile using DKP r19, I had to modify the GOT section of the link script by adding *(.rel.got), giving:

It regrets that there is no possibility of the C++ support. I sad. (Wry smile
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I have strong hope concerning DLDI.
<br/>
I want you to build information on the version into the header.
<br/>
For example.
<br/>
'.asciz ""__DATE__" "__TIME__" GMT+09:00"' (this is MSP info type) is put in the after of the shutdown function pointer.
<br/>
Or,
<br/>
'Version high' (==Version number) and 'Version low' are put.
<br/>
Or,
<br/>
verXX(verHighLow) and The date is added to the DLDI file name without fail. (mpcf_ver10_20061229.dldi?)
<br/>
<br/>
I dislike confusion by being not able to judge an old driver. please.

I am sorry for saying only a selfish thing.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm having trouble with my M3 Lite. I have a Kingston 1 gig card.

<br/>
Moonshell won't run any nds, saying it is not compatible.

Hope this helps. If needed ask more questions:)
