    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">REminiscence is a rewrite of the engine used in the game Flashback from Delphine Software. This program is designed as a cross-platform replacement for the original executable and uses the SDL library. Original version by Gregory Montoir, <a href="mailto:cyx@users.sourceforge.net">cyx@users.sourceforge.net</a> - <a href="http://membres.lycos.fr/cyxdown/reminiscence/" target="_blank">http://membres.lycos.fr/cyxdown/reminiscence/</a>

<br/>
<br/>
Copy the original dos data files into the romdisk/Data directory and run the createromdisk.bat which will create the romdiskfs and append it to the end of the nds and ds.gba binaries.
<br/>
<br/>
Still needs support for sound in my SDL library, so no sound in this release.
<br/>
<br/>
Has been tested on the superdisk and m3 and should work with any flashcard that supports appended filesystems, its not compatible with the gbamp though, I still need one for testing if anyone has one to send me or wants to buy me one :)
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,

<br/>
Also I have received some updates for 16bit mode but havent had a chance to merge them in yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Iv attempted to add sound but no luck yet, its not streaming support, just a call to soundplay whenever SDL wills it :( but its not initializing correctly for some reason.

Yeah I did a quick port of my dreamcast version and its running in ds emulators(runs on hardware but controls are not working yet), but still needs some work for this port. Plus I need to contact Eric Chahi and see if its cool if I release it, if I ever finish porting it :)

<br/>
run it from a dos command prompt and make sure all the files from the release are in the same directory and you have extracted the dos version of flashback into the romdisk\Data folder 
<br/>
<br/>
If you are not on windows , you will need to download the sourcecode for genromfs or find a precompiled binary for your os and the bat file will need to be rewritten as a shell script etc. as well as the padbin binary.

It also said I needed Msys-1.0.dll in the directory too, however I have since downloaded that file (had to install/uninstall another package to get it) and after a direct comparison of 2 made files &amp; can say you don't need Msys-1.0.dll it works without it - even though it complaines.

Works fine on the M3-SD :)

Yeah I unfortunetly cant test FAT code-unless someone buys me a gbamp and cf card , Im broke :)

Some kind of thread scheduler could be set up on vblank or something like that, there have been discussions in other posts about it. Just need someway of saving the current thread context to a stack somewhere and then switch to a new thread and visa-versa, too bad I dont know how to code something like that :)

I added in Chishm's FAT library and got it to read the files from M3CF /flashback/data.  It saves to /flashback/.  You can also speed the game up slightly by pushing R (shoulder).
<br/>
<br/>
Should work on GBAMP/SCCF/MK2/MK3 but untested.  Always backup anything important on your CF/SD but it's unlikely to corrupt anything.

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
No compatible FAT device!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Flashback isn't free but it should be.  Delphine software no longer exists.  I've thought about including the flashback files on my site but I would prefer to get permission from at least the main coder or artists.  I have no idea who actually owns the rights to the game now.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure about libfat's compatibility with SC miniSD.  I know it works with SC Lite microSD.  I can compile with a version of GBA_NDS_FAT.  I'll try the one with picodrive since that is reported to work on MMD and many devices.
<br/>
<br/>
I will also write some instructions for attaching the files to the .nds file.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Tue Dec 05, 2006 7:21 pm; edited 4 times in total</span></div>

Could you tell me where to get SDL with sound support? Because as stated on GPF`s site ver. 1.2.9 doesn`t have it. So it`s kinda strange.

2006-12-09 v0.23
<br/>
- Added a version with GBA_NDS_FAT from picodriveDS 0.1.6.  Use this on MMD, EZ4 and SC miniSD.  Untested.
<br/>
- Support for Italian language files
<br/>
- Updated libcartreset to 0.72 (fixes return to menu on SC Lite).  Return to menu only works on libfat version.
<br/>
- Level select.  You can now scroll through level codes on the password screen.  Up/down for skill, left/right for level.
<br/>
<br/>
As always, backup files before running.  It could corrupt your file system.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I have a question concerning the playback of the original amiga modules.
<br/>
<br/>
they do play, but very fast. so when the cutscene is only at the beginning, the module is already done. is that normal?
<br/>
<br/>
i know sound isn't working great yet, but i thought it would be just a little bit better. not sure if the problem is on my side?
<br/>
<br/>
got the modules from unexotica, so thats not the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
any info would be appreciated!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The music plays around normal speed (as long as you aren't in fast mode) but the cut scenes are too slow, so they will go longer than the music.  I need to replace the SDL functions for faster speed and better quality audio.  xFlasH's version had native video code but he didn't release source and I don't know how to contact him.  His version didn't have sound but the cutscenes had almost no glitches and they played much faster.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Mon Feb 12, 2007 3:07 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>
