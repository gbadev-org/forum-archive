<br/>
<br/>
a moonshell clock might be nice, but then you can't add in the extra functions such as alarm.
<br/>
<br/>
A clock or even an alarm clock isn't that useful on its own, considering i don't really want to waste battery leaving my DS on.
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it could be useful if i wanted to remind myself of something coming up shortly, so i'd only leave it on a short time.
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, that gives me an idea.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could make an option to play the alarm or a noise after each certain period of time. ie. every 5 mins. It could be useful in keeping track of time when occupied with something.
<br/>
<br/>
I do remember another clock homebrew released a while ago, i think it was called Binary clock (don't quote me on that).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Looks great.
<br/>
I agree about the sound.
<br/>
<br/>
Any chance of a DSOrganiser exe version?
<br/>
Not sure how easy it would port, but DSO does give you easy sound/reset functions.
<br/>
<br/>
You could even make any button press exit it back to DSOrganisers browser, so it acts like a screensaver.

On standby mode the DS use's very little power.

Your battery's dud then, mine lasts <span style="font-style: italic">far</span> longer then that on standby.
<br/>
Ive had my DS original since release and changed the battary once about 4 months back.
<br/>
Same capacity as before, but naturely a newer battery keeps a larger percentage of charge.
<br/>
<br/>
New battarys are quite cheap however, before Sony shut down Lik-Sang, they sold them for $7 or so.

Lol :D 
<br/>
Your right about it sometimes intergrateing into your dream.
<br/>
Still, I find it enough to wake me eventualy, as long as I leave it out of arms reach so I have to get up to turn it off :p<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

If you could recognize this sound during your dreams, it could be a method of inducing lucid dreams...<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
