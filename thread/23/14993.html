    <h4>#150674 - simonjhall - Sun Feb 10, 2008 2:43 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I said I'd never actually work on this game, but here I am releasing it!
<br/>
So here it is, Quake II for Nintendo DS: <a href="http://quake.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://quake.drunkencoders.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
To play the game you require a homebrew-enabled DS, and some kind of way of playing homebrew on your DS.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">You also require a slot-2 card that has a minimum of 16 megabytes of RAM on it</span>. When playing, you do not however need to place the data files and the program on your slot-2 card - if you also have a slot-1 card then you will have better load times if you play the game with both cards in use. You will still need to the slot-2 card inserted to make use of the RAM, though.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">To install:</span>
<br/>
- make a directory named baseq2 in the root of your card
<br/>
- copy the pak files from the baseq2 directory of your CD or Q2 install into this baseq2 directory
<br/>
- download the config file from the web site and place it in the directory
<br/>
- from the game archive file take the quake2.nds file, dldi patch it and place it in the root of your flash card
<br/>
- plug in your slot-2 RAM card into your DS
<br/>
- turn on your DS.
<br/>
<br/>
To reiterate - you'll get better performance if the game and it's data files are on something like and R4 in slot-1 than if you put your data files on your slot-2 RAM card. Unless your slot-1 card is a GnM...
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Overclocking memory:</span>
<br/>
The performance of the game heavily depends on the speed of your RAM. Slot-2 RAM is very slow, but you can overclock it to make it up to 40% faster if you have the right type of flash card. When the game starts, try changing the speed option from slowest to slower or slow and see if the game starts ok. If it does then you're in luck :-)
<br/>
Don't forget to try memtestARM to see more reliably if you card can be overclocked.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">About the game:</span>
<br/>
- every level is playable in single-player mode
<br/>
- there is no multiplayer
<br/>
- nearly all graphical effects are done by the DS hardware
<br/>
- there's auto and manual saving
<br/>
- there's no mod or TC support (not my fault, I'm afraid)
<br/>
- there's an on-screen keyboard as well as eight touch buttons (so you can bind functions to them)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The bad stuff:</span>
<br/>
- again, no multiplayer
<br/>
- some levels are poorly coded and the performance will hit the floor (in particular security.bsp)
<br/>
- GUI Z sorting is broken
<br/>
- no sprite rendering
<br/>
- some textures are misaligned
<br/>
- cinematic rendering is disabled
<br/>
- bits of the world will often pop in/out cos the DS GPU is SO overworked by this game! Some boss models have more polys than the DS can render in a frame...
<br/>
<br/>
Reasons I'm releasing this early is cos a) I'm too busy to work on this properly b) my computers all have faulty PSUs! c) most of my flash card readers have disintegrated!
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, if you enjoy the game and want the bugs sorted please drop some pennies on <a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">THIS LINK</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Quite a surprise, since yeah as you said, thought you weren't even working on it. Plus having loaded a few MD2 files myself in random projects, I figured the poly count of a typical scene in-game would be too much. Glad it isn't such a big problem as I once thought!
<br/>
<br/>
Excellent work, I just had a load of fun quickly playing through the first level. Shame my Supercard miniSD doesn't seem to support the RAM overclocking :(. (Wouldn't start on anything but the "slowest" option regardless of auto-detect or not).
<br/>
<br/>
One question / problem though... seems I can't get the "Video" options menu to pop up. When I select it, I just get the twirling 'X' on the bottom screen that seems to sit there forever. I can cancel it and continue on with the game if I want, but I was kinda hoping to turn the brightness up a bit, heh.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

nothing you can do but i kinda enjoy the fact that you plugged away at the game even though boss models have more polys than the ds can render in a single frame ... i find that humerous in more ways than one..

<br/>
I also forgot to say thanks here to the people who helped me get this out the door either through testing, donations or just tech support. Big thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
@elwing, thanks again to you mate. I think you found more bugs than most people!
<br/>
<br/>
@pas, the 3-in-1 is IMO the best card that you can play this game on. It's actually faster than the M3, and cheaper too! Also (in case anyone's wondering), there is no advantage to having a 32 meg card over a 16 meg card. If I had taken the time I could probably get the game working in 8 meg, to allow the Opera expansion to work with it...
<br/>
<br/>
@hogmeister, very much appreciated. Thanks very much!
<br/>
<br/>
@fling, the polygon count is a serious problem in this game! You may have notice that I fade the models out (and don't draw them) beyond a certain distance? That really helps the polygon count (I'm gonna have a better solution in v2) but it's still not enough. It'd be really really nice if Q2 had a model LOD'ing system...
<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, there's nothing on the video menu. Again, not enough time...
<br/>
<br/>
Things coming in version 2:
<br/>
- speed
<br/>
- multiplayer
<br/>
- video menu :-)
<br/>
- maybe music
<br/>
- bug fixes
<br/>
- video playback
<br/>
- better polygon limit solution
<br/>
- HDR effects?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It's been a long time since I messed with the Quake games, but seeing as people like to do "high res" replacement packs for old games, wouldn't it be feasible to do the opposite, and make a "low res" version for DSQ2?  I think with the poly counts we're talking about you'd get a better result than any dynamic LOD that you could do.  Of course it's a lot of work either way, but if the community is up for it..
<br/>
<br/>
It's funny, I just reinstalled Q2 on my son's PC, and I'm afraid to say I forgot how to get into the base properly, haha</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah thats what I meant actually... I originally figured by doing something like that, you'd end up having to cut out too much resulting in something unplayable... turns out there was a pretty good balance I guess. :p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello mate. If you've made it past the memory detection stage then the game should run on your card!
<br/>
On some cards (esp supercard variants) the dldi driver corrupts the data stream as it's pulled from disk (seriously) and stuff goes askew...
<br/>
The solution to this is either run with a slot-1 card as well (with the data on there instead) or extract your pak files into the baseq2 directory (maintaining the directory structure of the paks) then remove the pak files from your flash card. Try that!
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know how you get on.

<br/>
What does happen with my SC though is that when the pak file contents file is loaded (done with a single fread, no funny business) there's an extra byte inserted / a single byte missing from the middle of that table. That means that the file names can no longer be matched (when the pak is searched with strcmp) and the file offsets are mangled cos they're all up/down by a byte!

M3 ram is easily overclockable, but for an unknown reason with both quake1 and 2 when the fat is also on the slot2 the M3 can't be overcloaked as much... to be able to use the M3 with ram at full speed you need to have the pak file on a slot 1 device.... not great for myelf who only own a passcard3... I'm still able to overclock it to the middle setting without any problem trough...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The M3 was by far the hardest card to get the game running on, esp since I don't own one! I have no idea why it works better when fat is on slot-1: you'll have to ask team m3. There are a lot of gotchas when using the RAM on this card and I think I really should put some notes up somewhere from all my findings.
<br/>
But it does raise an interesting point: maybe I should drop the latencies right down when I'm doing fat access? Are there potential data corruption issues when doing fread/fwrite with low latency timings? Anyone want to put me in contact with a tech guy at M3? ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Btw: wtf is an ewin? Is it a supercard knock off?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">odd, i finally got around to finding my quake4 collectors edition DVD (comes with quake2 :) ) and installed quake2.. copied over the pak files, first load it worked great.
<br/>
<br/>
using an m3 Real Perfect bundle here... put the game on the slot 1 SDHC card, while using the GBA expansion slot for RAM. first boot it worked great, and i've played quakeDS on it a number of times. So i wanted to see if i could set it to "slower" or "slow" and see if it runs any better, i promptly powered the DS down and back up, and when i try to play any setting now (even slowest, which worked the first time.. with autodetect for the card type) i get "not enough memory" error with it saying possibly misdetected.
<br/>
<br/>
*shrug* i'll get around to testing it more :)
<br/>
<br/>
edit: upon further testing, it looks as though it works every time as G6 Flash set to Slower.
<br/>
 for those with E-Win gba carts they're the same thing that the m3 real ships with (m3 just repackages it, if you open the case up tho it says E-Win right on the board) so these settings should work for you as well. i can't guarantee anything though but like i said g6 flash and slower (try slowest if nothing else, that works too).

Just curious... how much of what you've applied to Q2 can be applied to Q1? That runs great so far, so I figure with all you've learned from Q2 it could be improved to be more-or-less flawless (I'm not suggesting you should do it, though, you've given us more than plenty).

I was wondering if you think that it could be possible to implement the use of the rumbnle pack in Quake II DS as the 3in1 have this feature and is the most reliable memory pack for Quake.

Yeah, it should be technically possible in homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
Rumble sounds great! If you add it, it should be possible to turn it off too though.

<br/>
I also have a 3in1 Lite for my DS Phat, but Rumble works great in it! I just remove the screw and the top, and it works great! Maybe it was just bad luck...

You could also use a lower setting, so the Rumble isn't too hard.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Happy to hear that you already plan to add rumble in Quake II DS. Whith that we'll get one of the best port ever (on an handled console, of course).

I'd like to know if the lack os lightmap is due to the Ds horsepower or "just" that you plan to add it later (I supposed it's the first answer...) ?

It's already good enough in my opinion, but if you really think it is too laggy try with the demo pak files, they are MUCH smaller and there's a huge performance increase when running those... by the way did you raise the cluster size to 64k? that also help for pak access</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Ad-hoc; if I'm gonna use this then I want someone else to manage the whole ad-hoc library thing. Wintermute's said a couple of times that it's incompatible with r22. I don't want to maintain it or work on it, but I will definately use an ad-hoc library once someone writes one that works and everyone is happy with!
<br/>
<br/>
Infrastructure mode; I could do that right now with dswifi but I'll hold off until sgstair's v2 of the library. I had a lot of problems with networking in Q1 and I don't want to go through that again! Again, I'll do it as soon as the library is there and working.
<br/>
<br/>
Brightness controls - easy!
<br/>
<br/>
Item list - I think I've bound the button to show the list to one of the touch buttons? If not, then bind the function that does this (can't remember off the top of my head) to a button then jab that button.
<br/>
<br/>
Obscure crashes - yeah, the game wasn't nearly as thoroughly tested as Q1 but still big thanks to my testers as they played the game far more than me! With Q1 I played it through many times at various stages of development to find problems, but with Q2 I never had the time. Hopefully we can resolve these problems in the next version.
<br/>
Btw when you get a new version, none of your save files will work - sorry! Blame Johnny C for that one ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Draw distance - 'fraid not, sorry. The 'bad guys can shoot you when you can't see them' thing is intentional. Originally I had the draw distance the same as the AI distance and that gave pretty weird results!
<br/>
<br/>
Rumble - if I can find some solder to fix the rumble on my EZ flash I'll add it in!
<br/>
<br/>
Frame rate - my number one problem with the game! The rendering's really fast, it's just the game itself that lets it down. Not sure what I can do about this!

<br/>
Those system specs are waaay inflated by a) the OS requirements and b) the "portability over efficiency" approach the devs have taken.  Nobody said it wouldn't be a challenge, but come on, just *look* at the game.  It's not quake, not by any stretch of the imagination.  It could *so* run on the DS.  Here are the 3DO specs, the machine this code originally ran on:
<br/>
12.5MHz ARM + some specialized graphics hardware
<br/>
2MB main RAM
<br/>
1MB VRAM
<br/>
<br/>
As for threading, the devs say the threading has been gradually reduced over time and now is mainly being used for inconsequential effects.  They say they would welcome de-threading patches.  Also, there are a couple of threading libraries for the DS that might be usable if one didn't want to de-thread the game.
<br/>
<br/>
It's true that UQM couldn't run on the DS in its current state, but it's totally feasible to port it.  It's probably not a weekend project, but it's doable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">simon: taking your advice i picked up a 3-in-1 and have spent the past couple of days playing though quakeII. i am really blown away by your level of coding and what you did to make this game run on the nds. i have found no real problems, no huge issues, nothing that kills the game play in any way for me. i just wanted to say thanks for your efforts and i hope you can keep it up!
<br/>
<br/>
my only complaint is that the nds doesn't have enough buttons for all of the options. so during game play i find that i have to stop and reassign buttons to get a task done (like using the inventory). this isn't a huge issue, but i was curious would it be possible to link keyboard buttons to the virtual counsel keyboard? perhaps an option to toggle this on/off so people could still use it just for talking in game?
<br/>
<br/>
for everyone else if you are having issues here is my setup:
<br/>
r4 running a 1gb kingston japanese msd formatted at fat 64k with the quake files on it.
<br/>
slot2 ram is an ez 3-in-1
<br/>
<br/>
i can run the game at the fastest ram speed and i have found no problems at all. no slow down, no sound hickups, no graphic issues, 
<br/>
nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
i do have a question about ingame music? i'm running the pak files off of the 3.20 gold edition. i find no ingame music at all or perhaps i'm missing out on something. i never played quakeII back in the day so i have no idea if the game has music at all or if the port just doesn't support it. can anyone shed some light on this and perhaps help me out?
<br/>
<br/>
let me add the version i'm using contains the following
<br/>
pak0.pak 175mb crc 6888136E
<br/>
pak1.pak 12.3mb crc B232F881

In case you missed it (or I got the wrong end of the stick) I think you're looking for the touch buttons so you can bind your commonly-used functions to buttons on the screen. Have a read of the page I wrote for the on-screen keyboard and touch buttons for Q1: <a href="http://quake.drunkencoders.com/osk_touch.html" target="_blank">http://quake.drunkencoders.com/osk_touch.html</a>

And I'm afraid there's no music in the game. I was going to add in MP3 support (so you can rip the CD audio off the disk, and play it like that) but I ran out of time as I was very busy when I released the game. Plus adding music support to the game is very fiddly...

<br/>
<br/>
I really want to finish off the two games properly and do have a list of things that I need to do (a BIG list for Q2) however it is a lot of work and I've not done any of it! I'm enjoying not coding at home and when I do write code it's original code, not augmenting or bug fixing someone's ten-year old code.
<br/>
<br/>
One significant problem is that I'm lacking the profiling tools I need to sort out the framerate in Quake 2, and writing the tool to get per-instruction timings is taking me quite some time. So not only do I have to optimise the code, but I've got to roll my own tools! The per-function instrumentation tool I wrote for Q1 was good for that, but I need better stuff for Q2.
<br/>
Another problem is that I want to add ad-hoc multiplay and to rework infrastructure mode MP in Q1 but I can't do this until someone writes (or re-writes, in the case of dswifi) proper wifi libraries that everyone is happy with! I'll be damned if I'm gonna RE some hardware ;-)
<br/>
Finally, I think the DS community is bored of these Quake releases. Yeah it was fun at first (as it had only ever been seen in John Gillote's YT videos) but now people obviously want new games to play, not Q1/Q2...so maybe it's time to work on something different! (not Q3!)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what to do...
<br/>
(sorry this wasn't the answer that you were expecting!)
<br/>
<br/>
l h:
<br/>
I use an EZ 3-in-1 (which is a slot1/2 combo) so the RAM always works when it's plugged in, regardless of what flash card is in slot-1. However for the slot-2-only EZflash cards I'd imagine that the RAM "just works" regardless of there being a flash card plugged in. For example with both the Supercard and M3 the RAM is accessible when there's no flash card plugged in.
<br/>
<br/>
a w:
<br/>
yeah I'm not a mega fan of the music but I was going to do it just for completeness. I did invest *a lot* of time in MP3 playback for Q1 but I found that when it was used in the game the extra bus traffic caused by the game running on the ARM9 would quickly desynch the music playback done by the ARM7. God I hate the sound hardware!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
as for porting more 3d stuff? i would love to see a 2d port of some type. there are so many games i grew up on that would be a treat to play on the nds. i don't know if anything i can recall would be good for the features of the nds per say, but just to have a lot of that stuff on the go really makes that portion of my day (where i game on the go) that much better.

Just today I went through an acre of code that I wrote at work in Nov last year during a very busy period and I'm like "I wrote this? It's so complicated!". Not good.

I used to make it so that the AI would shut off at the same distance as the draw distance but it was very obvious that something was wrong - when you got close enough to bad guys again they'd be still in the exact same position and pose etc.

I actually shut the AI off a touch after they have faded out so that they can still move around a bit at distance and this looks much better. The only disadvantage is that they can shoot you but you can't see them!

luckily simon did an AMAZING job with the sound, and it might still work. especially with headphones on.

on that note, I've hooked up my DS to my car's auxiliary port, and played quake1/2 at blow-your-mind volumes. :O

it's suggestible. :)
<br/>
<br/>
there IS, however, a console command which eludes me at the moment, that causes enemies not to attack, or move positions (as if they don't even notice you) until you make an attack. with this activated, you can literally walk up to enemies, and do a little ditty in front of them without them attacking. mayhap this option could be modified somehow to work with the drawing distance in some way..?<br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At first I didn't quite get what you meant (esp as the 'notarget' command basically turns off AI) but I think that's actually not a bad idea. Where I effectively "turn off" AI beyond a distance, setting it to notarget mode in the gap between the graphics fade-out and the AI-turn off would prevent you getting shot when you can't see them, yet still allow them to move.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw the AI-turn off is the Source of Power in this port. If I don't do it the frame rate is on the floor! I originally turned it off for ALL AI beyond a minimum distance but that meant that doors wouldn't open properly. If I run the non-actor stuff once per second, things like doors would lurch instead! Although things like doors don't use a lot of CPU time, the moving laser effects do which is why the security.bsp level is SO SLOW!
<br/>
<br/>
This does rule out a DS-hosted co-op game though, as I wouldn't be able to turn off the AI.

Personally, I think there's quite some differences between forms of programming... some are very pleasent, some are not. I think it's the external factors as well as motivation (which could be counted as an external factor - don't ask ;^) ) that make these differences...

I think that if you don't complete a software, it is normal you won't receive glory and fame. take for example opentyrian, judging from the first alpha release it wasn't so much... but after release and releases it becomes amazing.
<br/>
I hoped in something similar for quake 2, the game is amazing itself, the port surprised me, but it has bugs that should be fixed, and when they will be fixed you won't call anymore "quake 2 alpha-unstable" but "great quake 2 for ds". it's so bad to stop developing a software when you have done 80% and 20% is left: let's finish it!
<br/>
<br/>
regarding ad-hoc... I still think that multiplayer trough internet, with pcs... it is better
<br/>
<br/>
regarding other ports i may suggest... well, quake/quake2 were the best games of which their engine was released under gpl, so i don't know what you could do now... warzone 2100? it is completely GPL but I'm not sure you'll reach to shrink it in 16MB of ram :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
i personally have spent hours (and hours) replaying q1. i find it so much fun to play it on a hand held reliving old memories of playing it for the first time on a pc. q2 is actually a first go around for me, and the ds port is brilliant even with the current minor bugs.
<br/>
<br/>
i studied in my undergrad years as a programmer. i'm currently running an ebay business with a local comic book shop to pay my bills. i love to code but i hate the coding environments of the computer world. i also hate how on every job interview they ask me about coding, what i can code, what projects i've done. i still love comptuers very much but i'm so sick of coding!! i've been spending my free time recently writing irc scripts, which honestly are as much "coding" as i want to do right now.
<br/>
<br/>
although the nds dev does intrigue me. based on a bit of research i also see the limitations of the ds hardware for certain projects (like q1/q2) and can understand your comments.
<br/>

consider coming back to your projects and fixing what should be fixed but take your time and do it when you feel like doing it. the people who really appreciate your skills and efforts will be looking forward to updates.

i'm not the expert here but i have renamed it to .nds and it runs fine for me. although i have only tested on my slot2 using my slot1 as a passme. saves function perfectly, but probably because my slot2 has sram.
<br/>
<br/>
worth a try for you, no?

I only have a ezflash v and a 3in1 cart. I don't think there is a way I can get it to work unless I somehow am able to load it with the 3in1 cart (I doubt it.)
<br/>
EDIT: Nevermind got it working with GBA loader sweet!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Next thing I'll release will probably be a bit of tech, cos that's what I like writing and do for a living :-)

For the few minutes I played, it's work smoother than I could hope. Great job ! I hope we could have some update for this piece of gold one day.
