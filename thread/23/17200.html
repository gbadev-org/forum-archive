    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
I finally made NitroTracker an open source project today! The code is available from:
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://code.google.com/p/nitrotracker/" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/nitrotracker/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
This doesn't only mean people can have the source, but also that I'm opening up development to the community. Or, to put it a little differently: NitroTracker needs coders!
<br/>
<br/>
I think there's a lot of benefits working on NitroTracker. I'll give you some examples of what I like about it:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>The thing that I love most about programming NitroTracker (this holds for most of my projects actually) is that it enables people to be creative. You make something and then people make something (in this case music) with that thing you made. It's inexplicably cool, like being meta-creative!
<br/>
<br/>
</li><li> Working on NitroTracker has taught me many things. One thing was programming for the DS, but also how to design productive and easy to pick up user interfaces, how to write GUI toolkits, and how to write code that produces music.
<br/>
<br/>
</li><li> NitroTracker has a big community of users (over 100 beta testers!) that give a lot of very useful input in the shape of bug reports, feature requests and music (which can serve both as a motivation and as test cases for the XM player). It's a lot of fun listening to your users and, learning design lessons from their experiences, and improving your software through feedback.</li></ul>What I'm looking for are motivated people with good DS programming knowledge. Musical skills are a plus, but not required. Just <a class="postlink" href="http://code.google.com/p/nitrotracker/source/checkout" target="_blank">check out the source</a> (setup instructions <a class="postlink" href="http://code.google.com/p/nitrotracker/wiki/NitroTrackerDevelopmentSetup" target="_blank">here</a>) and contact me if you're interested. There's really no commitment. You're just part of the project and work on it whenever you feel like it.
<br/>
<br/>
Who's in? :-)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">are you asking for coders so that you can continue to release updates or are you putting nitro tracker out there as opensource so you personally will not be releasing updates?
<br/>
<br/>
its confusing how you asked for coders to help but you released it as opensource =P.
<br/>
<br/>
what is the planned future of nitrotracker? it has been a long time without an update. do you plan to get other coders to help you release a new version?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey! Yes, the plan is to speed up development by getting more developers into the boat. I will continue to work on it, but I need help. This does not mean that I'm giving up the "leadership" of the project if that's what's confusing to you. I've made it open source so the development is opened up to the public, and also for people to study the code and use it for their own (GPLed) projects.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
