    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">I have noticed a problem with the file writing on hardware (R4 and GBAMP) which can lead to films becoming corrupted and failing to load. I am working on the problem and in the mean time version 0.1 has been retired and is no longer available.</span>

<br/>
FlickBook is a cell animation toy. You can get it from <a class="postlink" href="http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/FlickBook/flickbook.php" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
See the <a class="postlink" href="http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/FlickBook/flickbook.php" target="_blank">FlickBook webpage</a> for more information.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The rest of this post is left for historic reasons, with the links changed to the webpage.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/FlickBook/flickbook.php" target="_blank">Here is a jpg</a> giving a indication of what the buttons do.
<br/>
<br/>
Other controls:
<br/>
You can move the drawing area and tool windows by holding 'down' on the D-pad or 'B' and then dragging the area around with the stylus.
<br/>
You can zoom in and out of the drawing area by holding 'up' on the D-pad or 'X' and then dragging up and down with the stylus.
<br/>
You can scroll through the animation frames by holding one of the shoulder buttons and dragging left and right with the stylus.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Java AVI export application now available</span>. You can get it from <a class="postlink" href="http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/FlickBook/flickbook.php" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
Run from the command line as:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">java -jar FlickbookAnimMaker_0_1.jar</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Or maybe by double clicking/right clicking the jar file.
<br/>
To use:
<br/>
From the FlickBook directory on your DLDI device, copy the <span style="font-style: italic">film_?</span> directory of choice onto your PC.
<br/>
Select "File-&gt;Load film" and open the <span style="font-style: italic">flickbook.xml</span> from the <span style="font-style: italic">film_?</span> directory you just copied.
<br/>
You will be presented with a <span style="font-style: italic">Set frame bmp directory</span> dialog. Select the directory that contains the frame .bmp files (this will be the <span style="font-style: italic">layer_0</span> directory if you have not changed anything).
<br/>
<br/>
You can now preview the film at full speed (12 frames/s) and half speed.
<br/>
<br/>
To export the film as an AVI file select "Export-&gt;Export AVI". NOTE: if the half speed checkbox is selected the generated AVI file will run at 6 frames per second otherwise it will run at 12 frames per second.
<br/>
<br/>
The generated AVI files are fairly large (about 1.1MiB per second), this is because they are uncompressed 24bits colour. So you may want to convert them to a compressed format for distribution.
<br/>

<br/>
The animations are saved on your DLDI card.
<br/>
A 'Flickbook' directory is created which contains a directory for each film you create ('film_a', 'film_b', etc.). Each of these directories contain a 'flickbook.xml' file and a 'layer_0' directory.
<br/>
<br/>
The 'layer_0' directory contains the .bmp files that make up the individual frames.
<br/>
The 'flickbook.xml' describes the order of the .bmp files to make up the film.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">NOTE:</span> it is important to save and close the film (button in the bottom right) before powering off your DS to ensure that the film is safely saved to your DLDI card. There is a warning message stating this on the top screen.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you are talking about saving the animations to play elsewhere then, as OOPMan said, I am producing a Java application that takes the 'flickbook.xml' file and .bmp files and exports an uncompressed avi file which should play most places.

According to <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_book" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> 'flick book' is more used in British English and 'flip book' in other forms. You say tomato, I say tomato (works well when typed).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm... good to see you're working on a animation tool, here are some Ideas/Suggestions:
<br/>
<br/>
- Please, make it more userfriendly... it should be easier to push/press those buttons, it really is a pain in the ... to push these tiny buttons, (I need to push them twice with my stylus to get them working most of the time)
<br/>
<br/>
- Maybe try to make it easier to copy the last animation into the current window.
<br/>
<br/>
- Implement a filler tool ?
<br/>
<br/>
- Implement an Eraser ? (I know, using the colour white and the full brush size I can erase,  but I just prefer to be able to have an Eraser in my range ^^)
<br/>
<br/>
- I also hope that you could implement more colours and a way to export/import the drawings as a animated gif (my favorite drawing app)
<br/>
<br/>
Ah ! and, did you ever draw a Pictomaticon using the DS's internal Pictochat ? Having icons letters and numbers to drag into the drawing is very useful and easy !
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm happy to see someone working on something, we all (kinda ^^) waited for, I hope you will update this app, and, don't think about my Request's too hard, I just want to post them here so I don't have to remember them and so you can see them.

Yeah, between that and Colors, it got me thinking about the good old days of making cartoons with mario paint and a VCR, and an old DOS program called animagician that my siblings and I did some pretty cool stuff with.

Yeah, I actually think it's really cool having a bunch of them going on at once. It will be interesting to compare interface designs, and see how each one could be made better.
<br/>

Yours is looking pretty cool, masscat. Playing back an animation with onion skinning turned on is fun<br/>_________________<br/>___________

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Java AVI export application is now available (see the first post of thread). The app runs fine for me under Linux and Windows (cannot test Mac).
<br/>
<br/>
The generated avi files play fine under Window Media Player 9 and MPlayer. Xine sometimes does not play the last few frames - not sure if the generated AVI is malformed or Xine is doing something strange.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
pas:
<br/>
Some of the lack of button responsiveness is due, I believe, to stylus jumping (also causes the occasional stray line whilst drawing) leading to the button press being ignored. You may get better results if you make a definite press when selecting a button. I will try I filter these jump in software and see if that helps.
<br/>
The GUI is a balance between screen space and number of function needed to be represented. I may try increasing the tool button size but add the ability to hide some or all of the tool windows.
<br/>
<br/>
The can copy the entire frame using the "copy all" button. If you want to copy something, say a background, to all frames then this is a bit cumbersome. I am thinking to allowing a layer's contents to span a number of frames when I implement layers.
<br/>
<br/>
I have not decided how I am going to implement adding colour to the animations (and the tools associated with that). Maybe separating the colour work from the line work - a colour layer behind a black layer or similar. The only reason for the red and blue colours is that there is no support for 2 colour textures on the NDS otherwise it would have black and white only.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do they load correctly in VirtualDub? I like to run MPEG or AVI files through VirtualDub to "sanitize" and recompress them before making them public. If not, at least you'll have error or warning messages to track down the export misbehavior.

HyperCard for Mac did something similar. Every card had its own foreground image, controls, and script, plus a reference to a background containing additional image, controls, and script.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
I found errors on both the Compact Flash of my GBAMP and the MicroSD of my R4.
<br/>
After reformatting the Compact Flash, FlickBook happily creates films again. It  made a 66 frame film with something drawn on each frame for example.
<br/>
<br/>
If anybody else has had trouble please run 'chkdsk' or similar on your memory card and report if there are errors or not.

<br/>
Here is a link to version 0.1 again - FlickBook_0_1_test_only.nds (<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT:</span> link to 0.1 removed as it should not be used even for testing)
<br/>
Please do not link to this file as it is just for testing and will be removed at some point.
<br/>
<br/>
If anybody is willing to test the above then the help is much appreciated. Do so only with the understanding that it may corrupt your memory card (ie backup everything). Please chkdsk your media before testing.
<br/>
<br/>
If FlickBook has been working well for you then please post giving details of your hardware.

Thanks for your suggestions and I am glad that the 0.2 preview is working for you.
<br/>
Version 0.2 will be very similar to version 0.1 as far as functionality goes. The next few versions after 0.2 that will also be mainly tidying up some of the internals, for example better handling of texture memory to remove the flicker when moving between frames and accurate frame timing during playback.
<br/>
<br/>
Once there I will start adding features, one of which will be multiple layers. This will include some method of maintaining contents across frames.
<br/>
<br/>
The contents of the copy buffers are currently maintained between different films. Although they are lost when you power off.
<br/>
<br/>
The controls are now better explained on the <a class="postlink" href="http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/FlickBook/flickbook.php" target="_blank">Flickbook webpage</a>.
