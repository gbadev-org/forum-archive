<br/>
<br/>
This game is a collaboration of Flash (ASM Coding), Headkaze (Coding Support), Lobo (Graphics), Spacefractal (Music), Sverx (libXM7 music system) and Rev.Stu (Concept, Research &amp; Story) and has been the culmination of 3 months tireless work spread over the last 26 years since Willy's first outing.
<br/>
<br/>
The game contains 20 levels taken from versions of the game that you may never have seen, and also 10 new all new levels based on movie themes. Along side these levels are a further 20 levels for the adventurous to discover.
<br/>
<br/>
So. we are proud to present "Manic Miner in the Lost Levels"<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That is fantastic! After such a long time, you'd think the project would eventually die off - good to know that long term stuff can get finished after all. Gives me hope for my own long term stuff that has been collecting dust at about 25% completion (this is a book, not a program, though).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
