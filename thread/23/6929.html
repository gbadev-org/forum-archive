This is my first completed project for the DS (aside from random test demos). I was able to learn a lot for the experience and feel a lot more comfortable now after setting goals for myself and achieving them. This is merely the beginning of a series of exciting unique titles. Note, this is a 1.0 release. It has been tested, and as far as I can tell, bug-free. The only feature that might be added is stereo sound. Currently it uses mono only, but still sounds loud and crisp. Tested on NeoFlash, should work with other flash carts and the M3 (doesn't with emulators).
<br/>
<br/>
Source shows how to manipulate audio/video clips (image slideshow), animation loops, accept complex touch readings, finite state machines, and a basic menu system. Because of the amount of images and animations states, the code is rather bloated, but the principles are pretty simple. Everything is well commented and should be easy to follow if you have any interest.
<br/>

I have to admit, I ripped the audio/video from a popular flash animation (full credits in source). The model is Silvia Valcikova (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.forza.sk/index.php?act=modeling&amp;subact=women&amp;lang=sk&amp;c=pmodel138&amp;forza=b8b674983b7e09fc9329c3cda7dbee3a" target="_blank">photos</a>).  I made sure that all title/intro screens used photos of the actual model in the video. Unforunately she didn't have any nude photos, or I would have added them as a bonus.

Chetic: Thanks man ;) Of course if I told you what I was working on, I'd have to kill you... Really I have a few projects lined up. My next project will be a classic puzzle game (with a modern twist). I am about 50% into a remake of a classic shooter which needs about another months work. I also have plans for a cyberpunk adventure game (down the road). In the meantime I am looking into doing some source ports to the DS (possibly a Doom port or a Genesis emulator). I'll try to keep my site updated, so I will likely be logging the progress there.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I know. I start a lot more projects than I finish. But I'm always working on something. Anyway, I was waiting for the new hardware to come out that will be able to handle the size of video. Right now I can only use 16MB on my flash cart, so the video demos I've done suffice for now.

The adventure game isn't a port, its an original game I have been developing for the past few years off-and-on (still in preproduction). Its an action/adventure/RPG similar to the Shadowrun games for SNES and Genesis. It will introduce some fresh ideas to the action/RPG genre, while also sticking to its adventure roots. I dont really want to give too much away seeing as this game may not be finished for a year or more.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Out of over 2500 images 5 of them repeat. At about 4K each (they are just white screens) that is a total of 20K. For a 14MB game that difference is negligible.

Its not a brute-force hack. I just used the simpliest solution. I am not such an anal coder that I will spend hours trying to get something to work "the right way" when I can have it up and running in one my way. I admit the code could be a little more dynamic, but once its compiled its all the same anyway. Its not like I manually typed all the code for the arrays. I wrote scripts that generate them for me. If you bothered to read any of the code past the first array you would see that the main loop is arranged logically per game state and uses a double buffer to decode jpegs to the screen on the fly. Think of the main array as a lookup table. It is actually more optimized (in terms of speed, not readablity) than any dynamic solution you may suggest.

You do realize that the audio alone takes up 5MB, right? If I was using a real video codec, then yeah, maybe it could fit it all into 4MB. But how long would that take to produce? This was the simpliest solution that took the least amount of time. If it works, it works. If you have a better method do this, feel free to explain, I would be interested to hear...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this was my first DS project and I am still learning how to use the system (never programmed for GBA). Once I learn more about the system I will implement things you suggested in my future projects.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Certainly, it is the best way to do things with what is currently available. I do agree that using a register fade would be better, even if the space saved is negligable, at least you have learned a good technique that you will no doubt find useful in further projects.
<br/>
<br/>
JPEG is obviously not the best or most efficient form of compression for video, an MPEG 1 decoder would provide a much better size outcome, but again that would require someone to write the codec.
<br/>
<br/>
And finally, the audio issue, simplicty over space has won again, which is fine. But ideally using IMA-ADPCM compression would help with space. It is just a matter of setting a bit in the appropriate register because the support is built into the DS. Although sox can convert to IMA-ADPCM I think the DS's version is not quite the same. Although noone has bothered to verify this (including me).
<br/>
<br/>
There are possible improvements, but once you break the 4 MB multiboot limit, you might as well not bother with compression at all. Having said that, learning ways to save space will always come in handy at one stage.
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, very nice for your first DS project :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wasn't just talking about the white jpegs, but about the blending. You have 5 images which are blended to white. For that you need 55 images. 20 different images for the hud (without blending images), but you could do it with 5 I quess. I think, you could be much more flexible without everything on the screen being a jpeg (a function for blending could be reused etc.)
<br/>
<br/>
The girl doesn't move anything but her hand in the first 130 images, there is a great potential for saving space! If you want to make a bigger game, you will have to think about these things.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">juhees: Believe me, I realized this when I was making the game. The blended jpegs are actually exported from flash, which was done using a blend function I wrote in actionscript. If I knew the correct syntax to do this on DS I would have done it that way. But even though it isn't the most efficient method, it works fine. My quota was 16MB because that is the max for my flash card. It didn't really matter to me if it was 10MB or 14MB or whatever. Just as long as it fit on a 128Mb cart. I noticed now that a lot of people using the wifime method cannot play games over 4MB. But I dont think they can play anything with GBFS anyway (using hardcoded memory address for the cart). So even if I managed to do some miracle compression, it really wouldn't change too much. I mean, it was hard enough for me to compress it down to 14MB in the first place, I was happy that it even worked.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On the GBA, you use the blend registers to fade between the backdrop color (element 0 of palette RAM) and the image in background 2. It's probably the same on the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've not been reading through this all the way, only the 1st page. Anyhow I just wanted to say that if you added your efforts to the DOOM project, I'd be eternally greatful since I'm trying to create a stand alone Star Wars WAD that will replace DOOM2.WAD. I've got a lot accomplished, but am having a few issues here and there that can only be resolved by hacking away at the source code, so the more hands on that project the better I feel! DOOM is a worthy game to be ported, and once people begin to realize the flexability of PrBOOM's BOOM and MBF features, they will flip there lid! While not near as amazing as GzDOOM, the DOOMsDay Engine or what not, it still has some pretty amazing feats of it's own!

So that would require a little re-coding to address &amp; get it running from modern slot 1 cards? If that's the case it's a little beyond me. I know sod all about coding.

I've been trying a lot of homebrew stuff a lot of which doesn't seem to work with my slot 1 EDGE card. I guess it would be true of most older homebrew .nds files that they require a slot 2 flash card. I wonder if there is any easy way to update the files to operate with slot 1 cards? It would be useful to have an app that could automatically update whatever code is required to enable the program to run from a slot 1 card.

Buy an EZFlash V 3-in-1 expansion pak for $20. This is a SLOT-2 card that can be flashed using a program running from SLOT-1. I know of no easy way without money.

So you'd have a game that effectively pause's ocasionaly to load, but while not loading anything it acts the same.

Of course the magic "conversion" app would run in advance, making changes, and not staying resident in memory.

It's like the difference between <a class="postlink" href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/mmap" target="_blank">mmap()</a> and fopen()/fread()/fclose(). When the program starts, SLOT-2 is mmap'd into memory, and the entire 32 MB can be randomly accessed. So if a program's access patterns are <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_set" target="_blank">sufficiently random</a>, the "pause's ocasionaly to load" would happen <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank">all the time</a>, and the history of PocketNES on the GBA Movie Player bears this out.

Because the DS does not have an MMU, a static recompiler like the one you describe would have to 1. find a piece of RAM that none of the rest of the program uses in order to make a buffer for data copied from the ds.gba file, 2. find all parts of the existing program that ever read SLOT-2, and 3. add code to copy data from the ds.gba file to that buffer in main RAM before copying it elsewhere. Steps 1 and 2 are <a class="postlink" href="http://www.everything2.net/e2node/halting-complete" target="_blank">halting-complete</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The trick in cloning an app like this is knowing how it picks the next .jpg to display, and one needs either the source code or a <span style="font-style: italic">lot</span> of play testing for that.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

On top of that (in this example), it's a clone of a flash "game".  In which case, I'm sure it was just decompiled to get all the .jpg images.  Now, I didn't see this myself, but I would assume some of the logic is displayed when the flash is decompiled, no?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
