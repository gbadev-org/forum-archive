    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">dsmcu implements the most important parts of the MCU mix protocol. it talks to audio workstation software (mainly tested with Reaper PC + allegedly Mac, may possibly work with other apps) over WIFI via DSMI.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">i.e. mix + record arm from your couch. </span> or the hallway. kinda.

more info on the linked pages. main thing that needs to change is the channel selection/solo/mute etc, and some graphics refactoring (it's really clumsy at the moment). i've been meaning to do a lot more work on this before doing a proper announcement, but i've been really busy (and it's working okay anyway), so treat this as a technology preview/concept app. 
<br/>
<br/>
big thanks to tobw for the DSMI library!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">WhiteTie, who helped out with the Reaper design, helped me out with the UI elements on that a LOT. 
<br/>
<br/>
It's going to change a lot in the future, though - it looks great but there are a few things that aren't really ergonomic. 
<br/>
<br/>
I just bought myself a new DS today (PINK! hahahaha!) so hopefully having a DS that's operating correctly will spur me into action and get it working a bit nicer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
