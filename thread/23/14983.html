    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh, you have to do some investigating, can't make it too easy.  You could find his site by looking at his previous posts but I just remembered Dopefish from his ROTT port.  It's on his site: <a href="http://vespenegas.com/dsbill.html" target="_blank">http://vespenegas.com/dsbill.html</a>

I thought it was running at a low framerate but then I tried the Windows version and it's not much smoother.  I also learnt that the error message is a feature.  This is one of those games that would be more fun to port than to play.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, that pretty much sums it up.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that the original version is designed to play with a mouse.  Playing with a touchscreen makes it quite a bit easier (and it starts off slow anyway).  You'll want to start around level 20 (at least) to get much enjoyment out of it.<br/>_________________<br/>#include &lt;sig.h&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
