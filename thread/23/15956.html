Its been a long project and we are very pleased to have it release in time for the Neoflash compo here and the GBATemp homebrew bounty.
<br/>

Please check our game and all the other games release for these fine competitions! Smiley   From the screenies and descriptions it looks like the competition is going to be tough!
<br/>
<br/>
We've also launch a game site:

The music sounds very good (libmikmod for DS in Software Mixer Mode I think).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Excellent release, been playing around with it all weekend.  Lots of fun.
<br/>
<br/>
Some suggestions:
<br/>
- a couple of the songs have awkward lengths (either they'll end abruptly as soon as you hit the last note, or they have a 10 second empty stretch at the end with nothing for you to do)
<br/>
- clean up the song titles, and maybe add a bit more information about each
<br/>
- more songs / ability to add custom songs (obviously)<br/>_________________<br/>#include &lt;sig.h&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The custom song option is definitely in the making - the tool at the moment is not user friendly enough to make it easy and fool proof - Sumiguchi is working on it [an update is not likely in the next 4 weeks though as he will be traveling during his well deserved break]
<br/>
<br/>
For now - Here is update 1!
<br/>
A new version [including 10 new songs] and some bugfixes is now available on <a href="http://www.videogameshero.com." target="_blank">www.videogameshero.com.</a>
<br/>
There is also a 1.5MB patch for those who already enjoy the game. 
<br/>
Have fun!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is probably the best homebrew software I've seen, definitely the best homebrew game I've played, imo.  It's really fun and it just looks really professional.  Thanks for releasing!  Congrats and good luck at neoflash.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Shame this didn't win the homebrew bounty.  As good as Still Alive is, it's not something released specifically for the purpose, and ..  I like to moan about that sort of thing ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Good work.  I hope to see more from you in the future.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://AGameAWeek.com" target="_blank">A Game A Week.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
