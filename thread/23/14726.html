I saw the "Using the PSG to create music" thread in the other forum so I thought "Hey, why don't I make a PSG mod player" :P
<br/>
So I spent the last couple days whipping up this little mod player to support PSG/noise channels, then I got carried away and added everything else a mod player needs..... 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it includes a special template.mod that has samples of the PSG and white noise (mapped to samples 23-&gt;31) so composers out there can easily make some psg tunes for ds :P (easy except for crappy .mod format).
<br/>
<br/>
More information is in the readme. Tell me if you find any broken .mods :)
