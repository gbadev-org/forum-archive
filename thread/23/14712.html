    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Pocket Physics is a physical construction set for the DS. Like in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/games/crayon/" target="_blank">Crayon Physics</a>, you draw objects which then become physical and interact with each other. It uses <a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob/2007/12/23/box2d-for-the-ds/" target="_blank">my DS port</a> of the <a class="postlink" href="http://box2d.org/" target="_blank">Box2D</a> library by Erin Catto.

<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit: Pocket Physics will be open sourced! If you want to take a look at the source now already, just ask.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a list of features I'm still planning to implement. Features that people suggested and that I think would be interesting are listed under "other". I will not implement them but I hope someone else wants to!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">To do:</span>
<br/>
- changing physical shape attributes
<br/>
- <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=150267#150267" target="_blank">layers</a>
<br/>
- changing the gravity with the stylus
<br/>
- skins
<br/>
- xml documentation
<br/>
- duplicating shapes (select objects in rectangle, then copy them)
<br/>
- moving groups of shapes (in the same way described above)
<br/>
- uploading to the web
<br/>
- toggle motion card control on/off during playback
<br/>
- motors
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Maybe:</span>
<br/>
- rotating shapes
<br/>
- grid that allows easier drawing
<br/>
- ropes
<br/>
- wrapping
<br/>
- checkpoint button (makes the current positions and rotations of shapes the initial ones)
<br/>
- sound
<br/>
- camera pin
<br/>
- zooming
<br/>
- child mode (no controls, only move tool)
<br/>
- folders
<br/>
- objects leave traces (optional)
<br/>
- slow motion/stepwise simulation
<br/>
- colors
<br/>
- configurable paper size
<br/>
- elements (like pistons) controllable via buttons for making e.g. pinball games
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Other:</span>
<br/>
- portals 
<br/>
- level system (like the star in Crayon Physics)
<br/>
- straight line tool
<br/>
- filled objects
<br/>
- undo/redo
<br/>
- snapping objects when moving them
<br/>
- springs/balloons/anti-gravity fields/cats/ragdolls/bombs (a while object libraray like in "The incredible machine" would be cool!)
<br/>
- fans that blow when you blow into the mic
<br/>
- cannons that shoots objects in a certain direction
<br/>
- breakable objects
<br/>
- export to image sequence (for making videos)
<br/>
- <a class="postlink" href="http://iphysics.r4m0n.net/index.php?title=IPhysics_Levelpack_Format" target="_blank">iPhysics compatibility</a>
<br/>
- collaboration using liblobby
<br/>
- grouping/ungrouping of objects
<br/>
- <a class="postlink" href="http://xs125.xs.to/xs125/08141/pprials219.jpg" target="_blank">Rails</a>
<br/>
- <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=153776#153776" target="_blank">Motion damping/enhacing areas</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Known Bugs:</span>
<br/>
- simulation speed varies
<br/>
- joints freak out if under heavy stress
<br/>
- on some cards, the drawing sound keeps playing after the pen is lifted
<br/>
- on supercard lite, saving is unreliable (due to the screenshot) use the nothumb version
<br/>
- <a class="postlink" href="http://xs125.xs.to/xs125/08110/ppbug391.jpg" target="_blank">weird pin behavior when pinning things in pause mode</a>
<br/>
- pin centering does not exactly center the pins</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by 0xtob on Sun Jan 10, 2010 4:45 pm; edited 31 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, this is fantastic. I love these sort of games (e.g. where the player 'makes' the game).
<br/>
<br/>
Bugs:
<br/>
1) When I'm designing a scene, I can only draw so many shapes before the program stops after releasing the stylus from drawing a shape. It carries on playing the drawing sound.
<br/>
<br/>
2) The rectangles seem to bounce around on their own. Not a major thing, I know, but one of mine fell over (on straight ground) and knocked over the other dominoes.<br/>_________________<br/>My favourite DS apps:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great work !
<br/>
<br/>
As a old Incredible Machine fan I need to say: THANK YOU !
<br/>
<br/>
Some suggestions:
<br/>
<br/>
- include a free hand tool (the drawing thing you included is just a line drawer it seems)
<br/>
<br/>
- include level saving / loading support 
<br/>
<br/>
- perhaps include more types of objects, like bouncing lines and stuff like this so we can do really complicated stuff ?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bugs I came over:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">-</span> sometimes if you have much fun drawing stuff you will come over problems like this: you draw VERY much circles and stuff, and then you press play and the thing locks up
<br/>
<br/>
I guess this may be a DS limitation, right ?
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">-</span> if you draw than it can happen that the thing locks up without a warning (drawing sound continues to play, though)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for this wonderful Christmas Present ! I really like your work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#147592 - Markzilla - Mon Dec 24, 2007 2:10 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">More bugs: If you draw a solid half-pipe (A double layered "U") and a dynamic Pac-man shape, the Pac-man falls straight through the platform. Also, the game freezes up even if the world is consistently deleted.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, could you use the song used in Crayon Physics? It is released under the creative commons license.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, Sleep Mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, scrolling would make this even better! Keep up the good work!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, thanks a bunch for all the feedback :)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad that many people enjoying this. I apologize for the bugs, but hey it's a first release.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a list of issues known so far:
<br/>
<br/>
- Shapes with self-intersection are not simulated (no clipping, no movement)
<br/>
- They also cannot be deleted with the delete tool
<br/>
- The delete tool sometimes deletes the wrong object (problem with overlapping bounding boxes)
<br/>
- Random freezes

<br/>
You have to think of the objects as solid (although only the outlines are drawn), so this is normal and intended.

Adding mp3 music would either blow up the file size immensely or require the use of DLDI, which would mean extra hassle for the user. But if someone wants to compose some TIM-style XM music, that would be very much welcome :)
<br/>
<br/>
Features I'd like to add are:
<br/>
<br/>
- Scrolling
<br/>
- "Pins" for fixing objects to the background (useful for making seesaws)
<br/>
<br/>
However, this is just a small toy and I want to keep it that way. (You know I still have this tracker, which is crying for an update :)
<br/>
If someone wants to pick this up to make it bigger and better, or even make a full game out of it, just drop me a message!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

by the way, you are the guy who made nitro tracker ?
<br/>
<br/>
buttons and window style is 100% the same one.

<br/>
as you know it freeze too  much, dosn't matter in a first relase =)
<br/>
<br/>
tiny circles don't look very well
<br/>
<br/>
can you add an option to do free lines in the static red objects? if i do a big semi circle, the first and the end point become joined by a stright line themself,

(If I knew a way on how to get it into xm format/style then I would do that, but sadly I'm unable to do that, even with the fabulous Nitrotracker...)

I REALLY hope that you will implement pins (for seesaws like you said), a scrolling system, and a level saving/loading feature to make this baby complete.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I love the idea of being able to set a fulcrum to make pendulums or see-saws out of the moving objects.  I also think a rubber band tool would be really cool; just a straight line with two anchored points at each side that would stretch when something fell onto it and then snap back sending the object flying out.
<br/>
<br/>
With some more tools like that and larger playfields and the ability to save a created environment to show others or share on the Internet, this would definitely be one of the coolest homebrews ever.  I haven't even tried out the Motion Card support yet, but that sounds really cool, too.

What a great game.

<br/>
As you probably noticed, <a class="postlink" href="http://tobw.net/index.php?cat_id=3&amp;project=Pocket+Physics" target="_blank">version 0.2 is out!</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The main addition are pins that you can use to pin objects to the background or to each other (see the screenshots on the homepage for example uses). Also I tried to eliminate crashes, which are mostly related to integer overflows in my ported physics library. I think the amount of crashes has reduced, but it might just be me.

I actually thought about this! But then again, people would be disappointed to find out I was lying about the cake.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who had ideas for new features and thanks to pas for collecting them! As I said earlier I don't want to work on this project very long (I hope someone is interested in picking it up later). But since the resonance is quite positive (even girls enjoy it!) I might extend my TODO list a little. So I'll just take your list and pick the ideas I like:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">TODO:</span>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">- </span> bigger paper (scroll support, 4x the size of the touchscreen would totally reach) 
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">- </span> loading/saving of levels
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">-</span> non-closed shapes
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">-</span> moving shapes with the stylus
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">-</span> Rubber shapes
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">-</span> Maybe: Duplicating shapes
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">-</span> Maybe: on/off switchable grid that allows easier drawing
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">-</span> Maybe: Export to image sequence (for making videos)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">-</span> Maybe, but probably not: Portals
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your ideas! Feel free to suggest more, but be aware that I'm picky :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by 0xtob on Wed Jan 09, 2008 2:09 am; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

as u have decided to do scroll support, this might be a bit awkward to use on its own depending on how it is done; if only scrolling is allowed, viewing everything at the same time might be difficult/impossible. so a (maybe) easy solution would be enabling the top screen to display a zoomed out view of the "paper"?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could also use the top screen as part of the whole paper, say a quarter. Then you can move around the paper so you are able to draw on that portion.
<br/>
<br/>
Then when you hit play you could have a option to follow a specific object or move around the paper to watch the action.
<br/>
<br/>
This would make is so you will have a bigger field of view of the paper.

hmm.. expoding moving things ? that explode when they touch something and force everything away ? sounds good, but I guess it 'd be the best to first let him finish what he wrote down up there and THEN ask for other stuff.

Here's an idea:

No... actually ram is the least of his problems, the main thing here when dealing with the complex calculations required for physics simulation, is processing power, which the DS is severely lacking, so using external RAM will be pretty much worthless.

While I love pocket physics I'm kinda wonder how the box2d lib would stand up in a high speed game, even if used sparingly.  Does it have support for simpler grid aligned based map collisions?

<br/>
<br/>
these are some stuff i think would make it even better
<br/>
<br/>
1. Saving and loading
<br/>
2. Grid - for lining up stacks of objects makes it alot easier
<br/>
3. Undo and redo function as i have deleted some stuff i dint want to
<br/>
4. The area that you can work with make it a little bigger doesnt need to be huge but a little bigger would be nice.
<br/>
5. An option to toggle the pin sprite as this does rune the videos :(
<br/>
6. A snap tool for snaping object together but when you play back the objects explode this would be great as making breakable objects is a pain

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know there's a lot of messages on this thread, but I really want to say thank you to you 0xtob and every homebrew developer for putting time and effort into fun and entertaining pieces of software. This app is already some of the best I've ever seen on the DS, and while I know this is intended to be a toy, with a few upgrades it could be even more incredible.
<br/>
<br/>
I also know that there's tons of messages on here that talk about feature requests and bugs, but I welcome the idea of panning/scrolling and save support. A slight speed upgrade when playing with lots of shapes would help considerably, too. Thanks again for developing this!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How about a hand tool?  Something that lets you grab an object and move it around whether its in play or pause mode.  I'm thinking something like putting a pin on an object, and having the object move with the pin, That would allow you to twist and turn it or hit against another object like a wrecking ball.  Or if you grab the background, then just pan over the paper.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I still can't get a useful amount of work from just gravity. Even pendulums seem to loose some energy.  Friction? Loss of precision? Funky collision?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Your first release had me hooked but this is insane.

  Thank you so much for this as it has been eating up all of my idle time. I'll  even sit there when I can't play and formulate plans to try the next time I can.

While we wait for the next version, i've discovered a good way to introduce kinetic elasticity is to double pin the piece you want to act as a spring.

<br/>
All of the requests are excellent suggestions, Brush thickness control would be a nice feature.  However, I suppose with an expanded canvas/zoom feature that would be a negligible addition. 
<br/>
<br/>
If it's at all possible, an expanded ram via slot 2 feature would be ultimate. I suppose you might need it for some of the other features anyway huh?

If it was just instantaneously transporting(more like a teleporter) it would be fairly trivial, just translating the coordinates and setting some flags about its status.  However if mimicked like the game portal, where an object could peak through...well that raises a bunch of complications.  I doubt that this could handle such complex collisions when theres already trouble with objects overlapping.  I don't even want to know what would happen if an object would collide with itself. :)

<br/>
<br/>
I know there are a lot of suggestions, and many of them are probably better than mine, but I can't keep quiet. My thoughts:
<br/>
<br/>
It seems like objects are alive even when they've fallen off the screen. If I create a lot of balls that all fall off the screen, the simulation eventually slows down. They can't influence anything and I can't see them, might as well delete them. If I'm right that is, maybe you're already doing this and the slowdown is from something else :)
<br/>
<br/>
Add impulse force. When no tool is selected, a click with the stylus on an object could add an impulse force to the closest edge, parallell to the normal of that edge. The force could be proportional to pressure, but that might require a calibration mode aswell like in Colors!.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm sorry I don't quite understand what you mean by "simpler grid aligned based map collisions". Could you explain that?

<br/>
<br/>
-Rope tool
<br/>
-Spring Tool
<br/>
-that portal idea is great but it would be very, very hard to create imo (i am programing in GM)
<br/>
-Breakable objects!!!!!! for example you'll do a "Window (s :))" and catapult a ball into it. And the window will be smashed to small moving things (to blue objects) 
<br/>
-Hand tool - you could "kick" objects with it, you can pick up object with it</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> As I said, I won't be adding any more objects. Breakable objects are not supported by Box2D and I think it would be rather hard to implement them. But I'm planning to implement moving of objects with the stylus, which would also work during simulation.
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>svenhenrik wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">It seems like objects are alive even when they've fallen off the screen. If I create a lot of balls that all fall off the screen, the simulation eventually slows down. They can't influence anything and I can't see them, might as well delete them. If I'm right that is, maybe you're already doing this and the slowdown is from something else :)
<br/>
<br/>
Add impulse force. When no tool is selected, a click with the stylus on an object could add an impulse force to the closest edge, parallell to the normal of that edge. The force could be proportional to pressure, but that might require a calibration mode aswell like in Colors!.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">Normally, Box2D checks if an object moves out of the world's bounds and freezes it. I'm not sure why frozen objects still sometimes slow down the simulation. About the force idea, I think it would be more intuitive to "throw" objects with the stylus, what do you think?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your great ideas, bug reports, videos and support! As I said earlier, I cannot implement everything that was suggested, even though there were some pretty great ideas; but I just want to finish what I started and then release the source code so the other cool stuff will hopefully be added by someone else. If someone can't wait until that, I'll give you the source on request.
<br/>
<br/>
The to do list that was maintained and updated by pas (thanks for that!) is now in the first posting in this thread. I split it into "to do", "maybe" and "other", where "other" means things that would be cool but that I will leave to someone else to implement.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

-toggle motion card control on/off during playback

-delete pins without deleting the object they're pinned through

I certainly hope someone picks up the source after 0xtob gives it up.  If developed further, Pocket Physics could be reason enough to own a DS just on its own, let alone owning a flash cart if you already have a DS.

I did happen to find an intermittent bug, though. It seems to happen when you close the lid. Sometimes it'll work fine. Other times it will freeze when it tries to resume. It does this whether it is playing the animation or not. At first I thought it was just when it was animating the action, but it seems to be more random now.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

Little update: 0.3 is close to finished. Scrolling is there and working really nicely! I'm still undecided about the size of the world though. 3x3 screen sizes is nice and big, but you kind of feel lost sometimes, so I might as well go for 2x2.

I can imagine zooming in to setup the finer details, but zooming out to watch the whole thing unfold. And if that's the case, it would seem like 2x world size would be like the max you would want because I would think that it would be really difficult to see everything otherwise.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

I have uploaded a version that uses slow (but more stable) software division. Unfortunately this introduces some flickering on the top screen, but that's better than the crashes.

So, if you downloaded v0.3, please download it again.

This happens if you have too many objects on screen, it doesn't draw them, but they still exist (I for example some circles ok... MUCH cirlces and after that I drew a red line, which couldn't be seen, but the cirlces still interacted as if it would be there.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I noticed a weird behavior in 0.3, and I don't know if it's a problem in the base physics calculations, or if it has to do with how the primitives are made now...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Draw a static (red) rectangle/box/line as a base, and then draw some *small* (like, as small as you can get it to draw) physics (blue) circles above it.
<br/>
<br/>
They will fall, hit the base surface, and then gradually build up speed as they roll to the right.  Larger circles will do this also, but it takes longer for them to get rolling.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">CurlyCarlos: Nice videos! :) There is actually a maximum number of objects that you can make. Due to a bug, if that limit was reached, objects were still created, just not drawn. I fixed this problem now. By the way the maximum number of shapes is 50. You can reduce the number of shapes in your tunnel by drawing longer lines.
<br/>
<br/>
JLSoft: That's an interesting one :) I'm not sure why this happens but you can make some nice Line Rider style stuff with it. I suppose this is some numerical problem that came from the fixed point conversion of Box2D.
<br/>
<br/>
I also made scrolling more responsive during simulation; I think it feels much nicer now.
<br/>
<br/>
So, <span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="http://tobw.net/ds/pocketphysics.zip" target="_blank">please re-download</a></span>!
<br/>
<br/>
And be sure to try out pen scrolling by holding L or R and hold down the pen on the touch screen. This is my secret favorite feature in the new version :)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry about all the micro-updates but I don't want to let you guys suffer under problems that I can fix within two minutes.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe the pin could only be placed when you lift the stylus, so you can drag it around (while the stylus is still pressed) precisely.  Along with highlighting the 1 or 2 objects the current pin location will affect, you can be sure of exactly what's getting pinned :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You know, now that I think about it, the proposed method for highlighting objects when you pin them together and only pinning on release could also work quite well for deleting objects as well. That way, if you're trying to delete overlapping objects, you could drag the stylus around until the one you want is highlighted and then pull the stylus away. I would think that would be helpful in allowing better precision when deleting objects. And, should that work, perhaps it would allow enough precision to delete the pins themselves (unless deleting pins has other complications rather than just selecting the pin itself). Would that be feasible?<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

And to clarify since that link will probably get removed, the CycloDS skinning tool creates the screenshots automatically from your skin images and puts the icons for Big Brain Academy, Bomberman and Castlevania there automatically as examples, it has nothing to do with what's on your card.
<br/>

I was thinking that it needs saves mostly because it seems to freeze so often that I can't even ever build up any really cool models.  How did you manage to play for three hours without a freeze?  Is there something I'm doing wrong that's causing the game to freeze?  I haven't noticed any pattern to when it seems to happen, but are there certain things I should never do or something?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is interesting about differences in how often the game freezes on different cards.  The Supercard DS ONE patches homebrew to allow soft-resetting, so that may explain why it freezes more on that card, but to my knowledge the CycloDS Evolution that I'm using doesn't patch homebrew unless there's a DLDI section, so that wouldn't explain why I get freezing so much.  Even previous versions have locked up a lot for me and this isn't something I see other people mentioning very much.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a played a couple of very long sessions of the game, but thinking back, these may have been loaded from my G6 Lite because I was using the motion card.  I'll have to test that out some more and see if it fixes the freezing.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't see why it would be related to what card it's loaded from, though, because everything gets loaded into RAM in one shot and then runs entirely from there, right?  Maybe if there's lots of lookup tables to speed up the math even small corruptions that don't normally cause problems in other games could lead to lockups Pocket Physics though?  So the problem could just be in the microSD or other flash memory itself.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi! I'm new here, but I got a neat idea for Pocket Physics.
<br/>
<br/>
Why not make it possible to use different layers when you draw objects in Pocket Physics? For example:
<br/>
There would be three layers, one background, one middle and one front layer. The background and front layers would not affect each other, and you would therefore be able to draw shapes over the background layer in the front layer. The middle layer however, would affect both the background and the front layers, but I think that you should be able to change which layer affects which. With this technique you would be able to create gearwheels in one layer and then pint it together with, say a lever.
<br/>
Earlier in this thread many has requested that we could use the stylus as a realtime handpower, addapting force to objects for moving them. Imagine that you would use this on my idea, thus creating a machinery similiar to a clock or something similiar which you can control yourself with a lever or something.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, thanks to 0xtob for this wonderful chunk of code! It really has encouraged me to buy a DS Lite and a homebrew cartridge (I've yet only played Pocket Physics in an emulator)! 10/10!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nice to hear about the way that pins are done, and the deleting of pins and objects. will this be in a seperate release from the one with the save system?

It seems that perhaps you should start doing sub-version numbering as well for the micro-updates (think bug fixes). You could use v0.3.1 or v0.3a to specify which is which. Then the major additions and changes can be a new version. I think that the behavioral change with how pins and deletes work would warrant an increase to v0.4. Save implementation would also warrant a new version in my eyes (unless it was implemented at the same time). It just helps to keep things in order better for both us and for you. We can tell easier if we need to download again and you can keep better track of whether fixes implemented in one sub-version broke something else (I know I get that all the time). Just an idea to consider.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

I personally am not too good at picture making, but I tried:

I don't really know. I think that this would be a good way to incorporate the whole grid idea that many have asked for, and would give the game a different look and feel.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Just found one small, little thing. It looks like you use the NitroTracker dialog box for the destroy world button. The purple and yellow colors don't really fit with the rest of the game.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The lock up for me seems to work something like this:
<br/>
<br/>
Draw several red diagonal lines (let's say four) positioned so rolling things would fall off one, down the other, etc
<br/>
<br/>
Now switch to blue and start drawing some little balls.  Yes, I should be using the circle tool but this is testing afterall, and it's actually my first time trying this program.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it seems to lock up after a few moments each time.  I've managed it a few other ways too, like while in play mode just drawing some intersecting red lines and so forth.  Sometimes it locks up just with a single red line and a single blue circle drawn with the line tool.
<br/>
<br/>
Since the scrolling and keys don't lock up, may I suggest a hotkey for soft reset?  L+R+select+start is my personal favorite, you could have it reinitialize everything from scratch so a cold restart wouldn't be necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
On another note, should the swishing sound be looping indefinitely?  After I draw just one line, it doesn't stop playing the sound until I press a button to switch tools or play/stop.
<br/>
<br/>
FYI, ny hardware is a classic NDS and a DS-X v1.1.0.
<br/>
<br/>
By they way, this is excellent work.  This will probably be a lot of fun for the kids too.
<br/>
<br/>
Another suggestion, if you don't mind: I think this program is begging for a hand tool. By switching to it, you could grab objects on screen and drag them, or collide your pointer with objects to bump them around.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good job on this homebrew so far, it is really fun to play with.
<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that patched/unpatched copies will not launch on the M3 Lite. The load screen "Pocket Physics" is displayed, however, clicking once on the touch screen goes to a black screen. It will boot up properly from within moonshell. I'm not sure if this is a M3 Lite specific problem or not. It isn't a big deal at all, just thought I would mention it.
<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what is up with this: The very first time I ran this I put pocketphysics.nds in my "NDS" folder on my M3 Lite. I tried to save and the app created a "pocketphysics" folder in root but would not let me save. I then instead put pocketphysics.nds in root and saved and it worked correctly. After that I copied the .nds rom and the "pocketphysics" folder back to my "NDS" directory. This was of course an attempt to see if the app would save to the folder using a direct path or not. This second attempt I was unable to load anything, which made me assume that the path of the original save is stored in the file. So I drew something new and saved it, and on this second attempt it saved to a newly created "pocketphysics" folder in root. I shut down my NDS and then powered back up and was able to load it. I'm not sure what is up with all that. It could very well be a M3 Lite thing. Perhaps others could comment.
<br/>
<br/>
If I create any stable ("red") shape and then click the PIN icon and then click on the "red" shape, the touch screen controls freeze up. My understanding is that you can only pin dynamic shapes, as they receive a green check mark. So this has to be a bug? I have tried making multiple shapes, adding balls, etc. However, everytime I click the PIN icon and then click on a "red" shape this occurs.
<br/>
<br/>
I am using a DS Lite (unflashed) with an M3 Lite and an R4 as the passme. I have no tested this on the R4, but I could if you need more feedback.
<br/>
<br/>

and two of my saves didn't save the file as a .pp, but just as a file (i think i used the name "GGGGGGGGGGGGG").

basically if you start the simulation, pause the game, and then pin an object, it will work after you resume the simulation, however after you restart it the pin will return to where you placed it when it was paused, causing objects to be pinned to objects a long way away from them</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Here's a list of features I'm still planning to implement. Features that people suggested and that I think would be interesting are listed under "other". I will not implement them but I hope someone else wants to!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">To do:</span>
<br/>
- moving shapes with the stylus
<br/>
- changing physical shape attributes
<br/>
- <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=150267#150267" target="_blank">layers</a>
<br/>
- changing the gravity with the stylus
<br/>
- skins
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Maybe:</span>
<br/>
- duplicating shapes
<br/>
- grid that allows easier drawing
<br/>
- gravity changing with the stylus
<br/>
- ropes
<br/>
- motors
<br/>
- maybe, but probably not: portals 
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Other:</span>
<br/>
- addition of a level system (like the star in Crayon Physics)
<br/>
- the background music used in Crayon Physics [mp3][raw].
<br/>
- a straight line tool
<br/>
- filled objects
<br/>
- undo/redo
<br/>
- snapping objects when moving them
<br/>
- pin auto-centering
<br/>
- springs/balloons/anti-gravity fields/cats/ragdolls/bombs (a while object libraray like in "The incredible machine" would be cool!)
<br/>
- zoomable bottom screen
<br/>
- breakable objects
<br/>
- toggle motion card control on/off during playback
<br/>
- delete pins without deleting the object they're pinned through
<br/>
- export to image sequence (for making videos)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"><br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm very happy you guys like the new features :)
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't seen anyone sharing their work so far, which is probably due to a lack of a place to put the files. So, I think a public pocket physics gallery where everyone could submit their creations would be cool. It could be all Web 2.0 with a comment function etc. Would anyone be interested in setting up such a thing? If so, I can hack together a ppToPng PHP function for displaying thumbnails online.

<br/>
Yes I patched it with the correct DLDI driver. I tried it both with DLDIrc and Dlditool-win32-gui. I double checked awhile back to make sure I had the right DLDI driver. I also had this problem with Cluster's c|irc homebrew. It will only launch fully if I launch it from within moonshell. I have read that some others have also experience this, with some homebrew and the M3 Lite. Again it is not a big deal, throwing moonshell in the mix, just thought I would mention it. =)
<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed after watching some YouTube vids that the sound efx of the "drawing" is not working properly for me on the M3 Lite. If I draw a static ("red") object the sound contines even after I have lifted the stylus off of the nds.

this can sometimes happen by mistake, if there is a very skinny blue object that u want to pin to a red object, you can sometimes miss the blue object and go directly into the red one. (but this shouldnt happen really, as the pin placing has changed)

<br/>
<br/>
Why not make it possible to use different layers when you draw objects in Pocket Physics? For example:
<br/>
There would be three layers, one background, one middle and one front layer. The background and front layers would not affect each other, and you would therefore be able to draw shapes over the background layer in the front layer. The middle layer however, would affect both the background and the front layers, but I think that you should be able to change which layer affects which. With this technique you would be able to create gearwheels in one layer and then pint it together with, say a lever.
<br/>
Earlier in this thread many has requested that we could use the stylus as a realtime handpower, addapting force to objects for moving them. Imagine that you would use this on my idea, thus creating a machinery similiar to a clock or something similiar which you can control yourself with a lever or something.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, thanks to 0xtob for this wonderful chunk of code! It really has encouraged me to buy a DS Lite and a homebrew cartridge (I've yet only played Pocket Physics in an emulator)! 10/10!</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

i have an idea which is something to do with the Colors! app;
<br/>
in colors! you can send your picture to an email address. so what i think you should be able to do is send your pp saves to the website "someone" is going to create. and from there people can brows other people's saves. if however, you could brows the saves ON your ds, that would be perfect.

Another idea, since dldi.scp is just a renamed DLDI file, is to take Barni's modified DLDI file and rename it to DLDI.scp.  This fixes problems I had with the stock dldi.scp screwing up LMP-ng, which makes me think it's a problem with unaligned reads and writes.  However, I've renamed my dldi.scp file to stop it from auto-patching, as I'm too used to manual patching to bother with something that could be buggy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As far as affecting objects in the simulation, I always felt it should be that you have to affect one object with another... it'd be more interesting that way if you could grab a hammer like object and attack another with it, rather than just slide the stylus into the object. You'd get more of a realistic response with it, plus you'd understand why the other object reacts the way it does. i.e. when you just slide the stylus into the object and it moves, and do it again and it flies twice as far with no good idea as to why, vs. sliding a pea object into a much larger one and the larger one barely nudges, but slide a bowling ball into a pea and the pea goes flying at mach speed :).
<br/>
<br/>
And I would like to see the ability to move with say a tagged object, otherwise it might try to move erratically when several objects on the board are moving around.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

Please look at the to do list (first page of the thread) before requesting features, so you don't request something that's already in there.

<br/>
I can't say when the next release will be. I'm currently working on some speed optimizations and trying to find the physics bugs. This is progressing only slowly. The next release will probably be a small one that addresses bugs and improves speed.

And so was I :) I'm surprised the guy didn't give up on it even though it was so unstable for him. "The Greatest Nintendo DS Game Ever" probably means a lot coming from someone who has tested that many commercial titles (And I didn't pay him, I swear!) So, I feel quite flattered.

Yet I hope the uploading mechanism will be more dynamic. I'm also not sure if a blog is the way to go.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, since everyone is writing me wishlists, I might as well write everyone a wishlist of how I would imagine a PP sketch sharing site:
<br/>
<ul><li>Users can upload their sketches and give them a name
<br/>
</li><li>The screenshot of the sketch is automatically extracted from the PP file (<a class="postlink" href="http://tobw.net/ds/pp2png.txt" target="_blank">Here</a>'s the PHP code for that)
<br/>
</li><li>Users can comment on and rate sketches
<br/>
</li><li>Sketches can be browsed by Rating, Creator, Name, etc
<br/>
</li><li>(Optional) The title should say "beta" somewhere and there should be reflections in the logo</li></ul>Then of course, sharing via wifi directly from the DS would be the next step.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how to best realize this. I'd probably start this from scratch since it's not that much work and I'd have control about everything. But maybe extending an existing CMS that already provides commenting, rating and searching functionality might work well too.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

please could you impliment this somehow as it is the one thing that i need for pocket physics to be PERFECT!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It was already requested to have an option to center pins. This is a no-brainer to implement, but I'm trying to keep the user interface as simple as possible. Maybe I could do this via unfolding tool buttons like in photoshop. If you hold the pen over the button for half a second, a menu with alternative tools pops up. That's a nice way of keeping the interface simple to use for beginners and at the same time include powerful functions for advanced users.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Good news, I got the moving tool to work! It's really awesome! I'll release the next version within a few hours.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Note to self:Never use the sentence "I'll release the next version within &lt;some timeframe&gt;" again! It's working pretty great now, but moving is still not 100% stable as it seems.

Nice, but how about also pinning this gravity line to objects ? :p

<br/>
So, effectively, the gravity could be changed in the simulation by things hitting it. A bit like in Mario Galaxy with those switchs.

Of course, there would have to be a delay.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

<br/>
<br/>
Besides the moving tool (which is really fun!) simulation speed was increased by changing the physics timing and putting inactive objects to sleep. A side effect is that when several objects are put to sleep at once, simulation suddenly speeds up, causing a "bullet time" like effect. But I think the speed increase makes up for that.

Actually, I started off playing with physics on the DS in order to make a physical sound toy (like eg. Electroplankton). But then I slapped the crayon theme on it and thought it was so cool that I continued along that track. The early versions even had sound when objects collided. A problem is the selection of a good set of sounds though. For example when doing a ragdoll simulation you'll want to use different sounds than when you're playing with dominoes. I guess I'll play around with that though, since Pocket Physics really is a bit quiet.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">v5 seems to save/load fine when DLDI patched for my M3 Lite. I still have to boot it up using Moonshell, I would love to see that investigated in a future release.
<br/>
<br/>
The "/data/pocketphysics/sketches" is OK i guess if your homebrew uses the "data" folder. Nothing I'm interested in running seems to make use of this as a saving scheme. Would it be possible to just allow me to pick the path and have pocketphysics remember, in a future release?

On the M3 Lite the "sketching" sound never stops playing until I click on a new button. Would it be possible to add a "mute" switch in a future release?

i have been trying to sort this out for a few hours now and i have tried the DSorganize idea, but failed, so i have an idea that it might be the saving the "thumbnail" picture which crashes my ds. i say this because sometimes it will save but only the preview picture will be messed up.

<br/>
Yes, it probably is.
<br/>
And the more I think about it the more it probably wouldnt work.
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking if this "gravity arrow" would basicaly be a rectangle with the long side representing the direction of gravity.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, if it was hit in simulation, gravity would change to keep alligned with its allighment.
<br/>
<br/>
I was initialy thinking this would make interesting simulations that could go down the screen(s), hit the gravity around, then go back up.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I'm pretty sure it would get too much "feedback" effects.
<br/>
Maybe it was imune to gravity but not impacts.
<br/>
But that would just get more complex :p<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

<br/>
create a seesaw about half way down the screen, balance a few big objects on either end, a few small 1s aswell, (just to lag things up a bit) make it balance evenly. now play the simulation and quickly draw (as small as possible) little rectangles in the middle of the seesaw. this should if done correctly, make the little rectangle act really strange, ie. when it touches things it smacks them flying, it randomly jumps, or even flies away lol. me and my friends call this little rectangle the "superman".

Actually, I started off playing with physics on the DS in order to make a physical sound toy (like eg. Electroplankton). But then I slapped the crayon theme on it and thought it was so cool that I continued along that track. The early versions even had sound when objects collided. A problem is the selection of a good set of sounds though. For example when doing a ragdoll simulation you'll want to use different sounds than when you're playing with dominoes.

Well, maybe the best, and the easiest, alternative for this would be to use a simple scale such as a whole tone scale or a pentatonic scale for the musical implementation. Maybe we should be able to choose between them? Anyway, when two objects collide, it would pick a random tone and play it. Therefore, I consider a whole tone scale to be the best alternative, as it would both avoid clashing chromatic intervals, and also always sound logic, something that I wouldn't quite say a pentatonic scale would do (not meaning that it would sound strange, but it will not be optimal).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
two little ideas here:
<br/>
1) I think the tone of the sound should be determined by the area enclosed by the line, OR, if the object is unclosed, by the length of the line. This would allow people to create musical pieces of art :)
<br/>
<br/>
2) what if we were allowed to add our own sound fonts, or sound libraries? i.e. add a .wav sound and be able to change the tone of it based on the size, etc.. or add a .sid, .mod, or .it file (I think all of those have some form of instrument description in them).
<br/>
<br/>
*edit* but I do agree, the tones should fall within the specific scales.. perhaps we could choose which scale to use? a whole scale to just start off with to make it easier to make nice sounding pieces, then go to the pentatonic, etc... allowing for more advanced musical scores :)<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

<br/>
As a suggestion for 0xtob, it would be great if you detect the SCLite DLDI signature, and if it's present, you just disable snapshot saving (Or maybe include it as an option.) But please, keep loading snapshots even if SCLite is present because downloading PP's from internet is awesome, and reading the image works great.
<br/>
<br/>
Why is the binary save broken in SCLite? Everything is saved perfectly, there's even a part of the image that's saved perfectly, but then just garbage is stored. I even had a file that had some strings out of your program (Well, it looked more like part of the physics lib) printed, like it was a buffer overflow or something like that.
<br/>
<br/>
If only I had enough knowledge to fix the DLDI bug by myself :(
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, if you could send me the source I'd be really thankful. My e-mail is <a href="mailto:da_kaodDELETETHIS@yahoo.es">da_kaodDELETETHIS@yahoo.es</a>

<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">I love Pocket Physics! Thanks a lot for all the time you put into it.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
And like everyone else I have lots of ideas what you could do if you ever run out of ideas yourself ;)
<br/>
<br/>
 - Child Mode: No button controls and a "difficult" (R+L+Select) key combo to return to normal mode. No reset on R+L. Tool mode set to "move".
<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this mode would be to create a scene that can be played with by a child without the danger of breaking anything. I speak from experience with my own son who manages to move icons, close windows and rename files if left to his own. I think PP would be great for children if you could protect the scenes from being trashed and save over easily ;)
<br/>
<br/>
 - When saving, spaces in the filename should be replaced and the file extension .pp should be added if not present.
<br/>
<br/>
 - Some basic documentation on the XML file format.
<br/>
<br/>
I quickly got into editing the .pp files on my PC to improve accuracy and  create exact objects to play with. Doing this there were a few points I noticed that might be good to document somewhere for others:
<br/>
<br/>
 - Pins do have and do need IDs, though they are not written.
<br/>
<br/>
 - The Parameters like friction and desity don't seem to have any effect. And I have no idea what restitution is meant to do anyway ;)
<br/>
<br/>
 - I messed around with the XML and noticed that blank lines and skipping IDs is ok.
<br/>
<br/>
 - "Closed" objects will not allow dynamic objects to be inside them. So a frame needs to be done with two open objects.
<br/>
<br/>
 - Changes to "gravity_x" and "gravity_y" will load right, but will be overwritten when saving.
<br/>
<br/>
 - The order of objects does make a difference in "complex" setups like a car (a box and two pinned "wheels"). Changing the order did make a little difference in dragging and jerking of the different parts. Or maybe I'm just imagining it ;)
<br/>
<br/>
 - A "weight" parameter. How is the weight calculated anyway? Does the "density" take effect here?
<br/>
<br/>
I'ld love to see those unused parameters have an effect and I think you should add more "special" features to the XML file that are not accessible via the interface, so you can add more features while sparing you the trouble of building interfaces for them. Like the "sound on collision" feature, which I very much would love to see too. Combined with "object cloning" it would be possible to make scenes with "special objects" that could be arranged via the interface by anyone.
<br/>
<br/>
 - "Marker" objects that don't affect the world. For additional information or just graphical beautification.
<br/>
<br/>
 - Pining "markers" to dynamic objects to label them. These markers should not rotate, just move with their parent.
<br/>
<br/>
 - Folders for the saved files. I have quite some of them myself already and some more downloaded form other people and I'ld like to separate them. Also I'ld like to separate my "work" and "final" scenes.
<br/>
<br/>
 - Different backgrounds. Not sure if you meant that by the "skins" point on your ToDo ...
<br/>
<br/>
 - A global "friction" parameter would be nice.
<br/>
<br/>
 - Information on the format of the &lt;image&gt; so it can be decoded and used as a thumbnail on a website.
<br/>
<br/>
 - A "Trace" and "SlowMotion" mode to find the kinks in difficult setups. "Trace" would leave shadow images of the dynamic objects of previous steps visible. "SlowMotion", obviously, would just do one step per second or so.
<br/>
<br/>
And on a realy nitpicking note:
<br/>
<br/>
 - The Run/Pause and Reset Button are one pixel higher than they are "supposed" to be.
<br/>
<br/>
 - A pixel wide border between the controls and the canvas could improve the look a bit.
<br/>
<br/>
That's it for now ;)
<br/>
<br/>
So, here are some of the scenes I've done. Might give you an insight on how i had those ideas and what their purpose is ...
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/BILLIARD.PP" target="_blank">http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/BILLIARD.PP</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Not realy billiard as there is no global friction, just a setup of balls and a frame to play around with.
<br/>
Obviously without gravitation, so don't save or gravitation will kick back in ;)
<br/>
This is the source of the "global friction", "marker" and "label" ideas.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/CARJUMP1.PP" target="_blank">http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/CARJUMP1.PP</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Basic car jump with a bit of hazard added to it. You can change the outcome by moving the positions of the balls just a little bit.
<br/>
The car is reedited for improved accuracy, but the front wheel still jerks around sometimes.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/LOOPING2.PP" target="_blank">http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/LOOPING2.PP</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Hand made looping with reedited marbles for uniform size and better timing.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/LOOPING3.PP" target="_blank">http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/LOOPING3.PP</a>
<br/>
<br/>
A setup build from calculated looping objects. Though the friction only permits one looping to actually work.
<br/>
The "trace" mode would have helped a lot in the fine tuning. Reduced friction would allow for much more complex setups.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/MARBLES1.PP" target="_blank">http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/MARBLES1.PP</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Orchestrated flow of marbles. This would make even more fun with collision sounds.
<br/>

<br/>
Box2D uses physics on a 2D plane, so therefore I assume that it uses the mechanic maths of laminas where depth is negligible.
<br/>
<br/>
Density is mass x Volume. Volume = area in 2D therefore the density setting would affect its mass.
<br/>
<br/>
Weight = mass x Gravitational force therefore you wouldn't set a weight parameter as then gravity settings would not work, thus you would set a mass parameter but that again is covered by density. (Don't ask me why density is set instead of mass but it will be probably due to how Box2D uses the calculations)
<br/>
<br/>
Restitution is a constant that is used that determines how much speed the object will have after its collided with another. (Equation V1+V2=e(U1+U2) where e = restitution) Usually the restitution is between two objects so I am not sure how setting one for each object reflects the but its likely to be some simple calculation like adding them or multiples them or something. (that wasn't covered in my A level mechanics)
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that makes sense, and 0xtob keep up the good work, its been fun playing with this app and I look forward to future releases.

Basically, you'd need two things.  First, an additional drawing tool similar to the existing non-moveable freehand tool, but moveable objects wouldn't interact with it.  This would just be for filling in the environment with trees or buildings or other background stuff.  And second, you'd need a simple color chooser that allows you to pick any of the colors from the basic Crayola 8-pack.

Because of this, I can't validate the pp. Reading the &lt;image&gt; tag is still possible, but you can't use a xml reader or something. ;)

The root element can be named anything of course.

Another tip:
<br/>
Maybe it's a good idea to add some author data to the savefiles, and a simple editor in the program.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Friends of Sir Newton!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The new version 0.6 of Pocket Physics is out!</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Get it from <a class="postlink" href="http://tobw.net/index.php?cat_id=3&amp;project=Pocket+Physics" target="_blank">here</a>!
<br/>
<br/>
This version was quite a lot of debugging work, but I'm really satistied with the result. There's good and bad news about the changes.
<br/>
I'll tell you the <span style="font-weight: bold">bad news</span> first:
<br/>
<ul><li>There are no new features, except for deleting sketches.
<br/>
</li><li>Many of your existing sketches will no longer load in this version and if they do they will behave differently. This is due to changed in the new version of Box2D and also due to my optimizations. If you want to "rescue" a sketch, open the pp file in a text editor and check that all boxes are at least 6 pixels wide and that there are no extremely small or thin polygon shapes in there.
<br/>
</li><li>The PP file format has changed because I introduced a root node to make the XML compliant. The old files will still load, but those of you who have written parser code for websites will have to update their code.
<br/>
</li><li>Certain changes led to heavy objects being "restless" when lying on a flat surface.</li></ul>
<br/>
And the <span style="font-weight: bold">good news</span> is:
<br/>
<ul><li>Simulation is now incredibly fast! I optimized the hell out of it and it still runs at acceptable speed with 50 circles on the screen. This is probably as fast as it will get.
<br/>
</li><li>Box2D now officially supports fixed point math and the DS target! Erin Catto has added the patches by Kavaler and me to the official SVN! Yay! Thanks a lot to Kavaler for his help with the fixed point port!
<br/>
</li><li>I fixed the "explosion" bug. In case you're interested in what caused it: I'm using the DS's hardware div and sqrt functions both in the physics and in the drawing code. Usually the physics code gets interrupted by the drawing code. Now if the physics code was just waiting for a division result while being interrupted by the graphics, the result will be overwritten by the graphics code. When execution of the physics code in continued it will read back the wrong division result, which can have dramatic consequences. This also caused a lot of randomness and probably crashes. I fixed it by remembering the division/sqrt register values at the beginning of the vblank interrupt handler and writing them back at the end. Also, because of this fix:
<br/>
</li><li>The randomness is gone! Everything is 100% deterministic now.
<br/>
</li><li>There are no more crashes! Really, I can't get it to crash any more. If you can, please show me the pp file!</li></ul>
<br/>
As Steve Jobs would say: This is the best release of Pocket Physics ever! Well, I wouldn't release it if it was worse than 0.5 :)

<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this mode would be to create a scene that can be played with by a child without the danger of breaking anything.

I'ld love to see those unused parameters have an effect and I think you should add more "special" features to the XML file that are not accessible via the interface, so you can add more features while sparing you the trouble of building interfaces for them. Like the "sound on collision" feature, which I very much would love to see too. Combined with "object cloning" it would be possible to make scenes with "special objects" that could be arranged via the interface by anyone.
<br/>
<br/>
 - "Marker" objects that don't affect the world. For additional information or just graphical beautification.
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> This will be possible once I implement the "layer" idea. Then you can just create a layer that does not interact with other layers and draw the markers there.

So, here are some of the scenes I've done. Might give you an insight on how i had those ideas and what their purpose is ...
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/BILLIARD.PP" target="_blank">http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/BILLIARD.PP</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Not realy billiard as there is no global friction, just a setup of balls and a frame to play around with.
<br/>
Obviously without gravitation, so don't save or gravitation will kick back in ;)
<br/>
This is the source of the "global friction", "marker" and "label" ideas.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/CARJUMP1.PP" target="_blank">http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/CARJUMP1.PP</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Basic car jump with a bit of hazard added to it. You can change the outcome by moving the positions of the balls just a little bit.
<br/>
The car is reedited for improved accuracy, but the front wheel still jerks around sometimes.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/LOOPING2.PP" target="_blank">http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/LOOPING2.PP</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Hand made looping with reedited marbles for uniform size and better timing.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/LOOPING3.PP" target="_blank">http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/LOOPING3.PP</a>
<br/>
<br/>
A setup build from calculated looping objects. Though the friction only permits one looping to actually work.
<br/>
The "trace" mode would have helped a lot in the fine tuning. Reduced friction would allow for much more complex setups.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/MARBLES1.PP" target="_blank">http://www.poetic.net/pocketphysics/MARBLES1.PP</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Orchestrated flow of marbles. This would make even more fun with collision sounds.
<br/>
Reedited for uniform marbles and a little logo "artwork".</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Wow, those are awesome! I especially liked the marbles one. Sadly this one is broken in the new PP version.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>samwyse wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">I figure that 0.6 is already being worked on, so here are some ideas for the iteration after that.  All of these are extensions to the .PP file; if a GUI interface is possible, that's great, but I think that a lot of people would be willing to edit the XML to get these features.<ul>Add a &lt;bg&gt; element that's just like &lt;image&gt;, only it specifies a different backdrop.</ul>
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> I'm currently thinking of using a separate skin file that will define the look of all sketches. Or do you think per-sketch skins are better?
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote"><ul>Add a color attribute to the circles and polygons.</ul></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">I'm definitely for making it more colorful, but I don't want to create confusion, since blue and red are established colors for dynamic/static objects. So I'm not sure if throwing this overboard is a good idea. On the other hand, I could use a different texture for static and dynamic objects.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Basically, you'd need two things.  First, an additional drawing tool similar to the existing non-moveable freehand tool, but moveable objects wouldn't interact with it.  This would just be for filling in the environment with trees or buildings or other background stuff.  And second, you'd need a simple color chooser that allows you to pick any of the colors from the basic Crayola 8-pack.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
This will be possible if I implement both the layers and the colors ideas. Technically this might become difficult since drawing is quite expensive (thus the maximum of 50 objects). I either need to find a way to speed up drawing or make a real drawing layer that works like a traditional drawing program.

Because of this, I can't validate the pp. Reading the &lt;image&gt; tag is still possible, but you can't use a xml reader or something. ;)

The root element can be named anything of course.

Maybe it's a good idea to add some author data to the savefiles, and a simple editor in the program.

Great work on the PP sharing site! This is pretty close to what I imagined. A "sort by rating/author" feature would be cool! For rendering the sketches someone made a flash app that's already being used on pp.mnfu.com. I can give it to you if you want.

I'll check again, but when I tried PP out at first I didn't get anything saved, or rather loaded, as the files where missing the extension and truncated at the first space, but later on I also saw the extnesion being added. I'll get back if I find any repeatable error.

<br/>
I'll check that out again. When starting to play with the XML I renumbered the objects with no regard to the pins and it would freeze loading/drawing just at the point where the markers were, maybe it was something else, but I think it worked after I accounted for the pins "hidden" Ids.
<br/>
Same as above, you don't need to care about it now, if I find some "evidence" I'll get back to you ;)

<br/>
Layers would be great. I'ld imagine any layer to not interact with the others, so you could make objects move past/over each other.
<br/>
And in regard to a later statement from you: If you could mark a whole layer as static, you'ld only have to draw it once.
<br/>
Maybe even put it onto a different "screen hardware layer", but I'm not sure about your technical screen setup, so maybe that's not possible anyway.

<br/>
The idea to pin markers to dynamic objects was born with the marbles and billiard sketches, where it would be nice to mark the balls/marbles to track their flow. Another idea involving the marbles was to put letters on them that arrange into a message after their "journey" completes. I hope that convinces you, but it's just a fun feature, so feel free to push it way down ;)

<br/>
I do think that would be most appreciated, as skins are just about style. So when you create a sketch you want it to have a specific style and if skins are not per-sketch they will look all the same on one device.
<br/>
Also there are lots of possibilities with using a special background for just one sketch, it would be like a totaly-free-form drawing layer (that doesn't take any time to draw). Combined with the "colors" and "invisible wall" ideas it would make for a lot of fun ...

<br/>
I'ld love more colors too, but I totaly got why there are just two colors. One solution I thought about was one color for dynamic objects, many for static objects, as colors are mostly interesting for the artwork, but it's not a "nice" solution as it still is very restricted. Different textures would be a "simple" solution that could go a long way. The "perfect" solution would be to have seperate "layout" and "coloring" modes to switch between.
<br/>
<br/>
And I'ld like to second an idea I've seen here before that I don't remember seeing noticed:
<br/>
A "view pin" that sticks to one object and makes sure this object is being followed in the "close up" screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don't feel flooded by all the ideas and opinions ;)
<br/>
You're doing a great job and it's your baby, so do as you see fit.

Another idea I just had while watching some of the brilliant sketches by Sh4wn was to keyframe camera movement. This might be a little overkill, but you could define camera movement by defining camera positions at certain points in time, and then when you play back the sketch in "showcase" mode, the camera path is interpolated between the points using hermite splines. This would however involve a great deal of programming and I'm not sure if I can put that much effort into it at the moment.

With the crayon texture, you mean the 'paper' background? Yeah currently I just made a screenshot of no$gba and used the clone stamp tool of photoshop to remove the black rectangle of the view :P But the original image would be better I think :)

<br/>
A "view pin" that sticks to one object and makes sure this object is being followed in the "close up" screen.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Yeah, I would love that feature as well.  It wouldn't be perfect for all creations, but if it were an option, I would certainly use it a lot.  It could be like a special pin, if you attach it to an object, the closep screen follows that object during playback.  If you don't attach the pin anywhere then everything works just the same as in the current version.  If the player manually changes the location of the closeup during playback then I think it would be best to ignore the "camera pin" from then on until playback stops and restarts.
<br/>
<br/>
The keyframe camera movement idea is good as well, but would be too complicated to be useful during the actual construction of world.  It would be great for final presentations, though.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd also like to bring back the suggestion that I made earlier that may have been forgotten to allow motion card users to toggle between motion card gravity and regular gravity.  If you're going to be allowing user changes to the gravity anyway, this should be easy to implement.
<br/>
<br/>
How many other people here are using a motion card/pak with Pocket Physics?  I find that it totally changes the way I play.  When I'm not using my motion card, I mostly set up scenes and then watch them play out.  With the motion card, though, you can control the movement of objects (though now you have to be careful to not let them move outside the simulation field or else they're gone forever), so I find that it's often more fun to constantly be in playback mode and add new elements and delete old ones as I feel all while keeping the playback running.  It's much more fluid and game-like with a motion card.

<br/>
"Layout mode" is what we have now. When switching to "coloring mode" all the buttons to create or modify the layout are gone and you get one button to select a color,  one to assign that color to a shape and one to pick a color from a shape. All you actually do in this mode is set the colors of the shapes. When you switch back to "layout mode" you still have the systematic coloring, but in "playback mode" you again see the shapes in the colors you assigned. That way you have total control over layout and coloring without it getting too complicated or restricted to do either.
<br/>
Also pins should be hidden in "coloring mode" like in "playback mode" and there could be more or different buttons (assign differen textures? switch shapes between filled or outlined?). Anyway, I hope you get what I was aiming at ...
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you feel like it and have lots of time, it would be cool if you could rework the toolbar interface so you have just one button visible for any group (create/modify/playback/files/type) and a submenu poping up when you touch that button with the different modes you can select from. That way you could minimize the toolbar quite a bit.
<br/>
<br/>
For the object type button you could just make it toggle like the play button if you need some space.
<br/>
<br/>
Also it might be good to disabled/hidden  the save/load buttons in "playback mode".
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I didn't have much time to really check out the new version yet, but just from a little tinkering I am realy amazed about the speed increase and the 100% repeatability is fantastic just as well, though it was fun to have different possible results ;)
<br/>
<br/>
About the filename problem I had: When I tried to save "test 1" I got a file named "test.pp". So the extension was added but the name truncated after the space. Different result than the first time, but I'll fool around some more soon ...
<br/>
<br/>
And my son still manages to freeze the interface. No idea how he does it as I only get to see it when it's done. Scrolling still works then but nothing else.
<br/>
<br/>
I might be repeating myself, but I just feel I need to tell you not to get into to much pressure from all the ideas and wishes flooding in. You're doing a great job and doing the internal upgrades while ditching the feature wishes for this version was the right choice. Do as you see fit, don't feel bad about it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
There's a whole range of numbers for how many polygons the DS can display onscreen, depending on what effects or what mode you'r ein or something, I guess.  I've never seen anything as low as 50, though.  Commercial 3D games certainly do better than that.  And PAlib's 3D sprites function allows you to have up to 1024 individual flat polygons onscreen.  Since 0xtob isn't using PAlib, I would assume he should be able to get even better performance, rather than worse.
<br/>
<br/>
That's only for one screen at a time, though.  For the the other screen, you're still limited by the 128 sprite 2D engine unless you can accept a framerate drop to use 3D on both screens.  There may also be some ways around the sprite limit--at least for simple line graphics like in Pocket Physics--by using the framebuffer mode or something.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All these fancy, tricked-out ideas are interesting, but I really admire the simplicity of Pocket Physics.  I do hope you are sticking to the more bare-bones, seemingly essential features of a physics simulator first before moving on to the glitter and shine.
<br/>
<br/>
Object property implementation and object property customization implementation seems to be something that should be at the top of the list now.  The overlying principle during this implementation should be simplicity first.  As they say, keep it simple.  I strongly feel following this ideal is pivotal to the successful development of Pocket Physics, but of course that's just an opinion.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I propose as the next essential set of additions now that some excellent speed optimization and crash prevention has been implemented.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Object property implementation:</span>
<br/>
functioning density setting
<br/>
functioning friction setting
<br/>
functioning restitution setting
<br/>
functioning rigid/soft body setting (maybe for later)
<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice to be able to change the volume of the object as well, however I feel that is not as necessary yet, as it is just as easy to delete the object and recreate it for the moment.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Object property customization implementation:</span>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Selection tool</span> - click objects once to select and be presented with a set of sliders/gui objects to adjust all properties. 
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Duplication tool</span> - click and drag an object just as you would with the move tool, although instead of moving the object this will create a duplicate of the object and move it along with the drag.  or, you can look at it as moving the object and leaving a copy behind in the original location.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice to have group functions for all the tools (move, delete, select, duplicate).  However, I feel that is not necessary yet.  Priority should first be given to fleshing out the available single object editor.
<br/>
<br/>
Beyond these additions, I feel the next step would be to add adjustment of world settings, implement rigid/soft bodies, and then work on group functions.
<br/>
<br/>
Out of curiosity, would it be possible to help in these implementations?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, on a more trivial note, in your first post it says you are maybe working on having pins auto-center.  Wasn't this addressed in the latest release?  You also mention in the other section that you may allow deleting pins without deleting the object they're pinned through.  Isn't this also already implemented?  If so, great job!  You can remove those from the list now ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you place a "triangle" icon on the screen (background only I guess) or something like a megaphone or a "<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;</span>"

choose it's angle (with the stylus)

when you need tu move something just blow into the mic (harder or softer depending on what you want)

maybe just one megaphone per project would be ok

<br/>
is this possible? (please)
<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be dificult to make it like a conical wind opening
<br/>
but it could be lineal, only moving thing that are in front the megaphone

another similar idea: fan
<br/>
it's the same, but it's not necessary to blow

just choose position, angle and strongness

Obviously everyone has different ideas about where Pocket Physics should go or what should be done first.  I like most of the ideas people have had, but *MY* preference would be for improved aesthetics.  Especially, he ability change the background image (sound like that may be in the next release) and draw in multiple colors.
<br/>
<br/>
So far I think 0xtob is doing an excellent job of balancing everyone's different expectations.  However as the PP gets better and better and the audience grows, that's going to become more and more difficult to do.  Early on, he mentioned the idea that the project would go open source.  Personally, I'm really glad that he decided to keep updating it himself and got it to the level where it is now rather than opening it and abandoning it like he originally planned, since I doubt it would have developed much from the initial stage without his work.  But now maybe open source would be a good idea since the basic engine seems very stable and most people's requests are for more ephemeral stuff at this point.  Opening it up certainly wouldn't mean 0xtob couldn't continue to work on it himself anymore, either.

Since it's quite a lot I was rather brief, so don't take it personal that some questions are answered very shortly. Anyway, here goes:

The speeds are just incredible. One thing I have found is that if you were to do a long, skinny rectangle with the thin ends up, (pretty much a vertical line) and placed a centered pin on it, ideally the rectangle would just wait, perfectly balanced. I've tried this but it seems that all of my rectangles fall to one side or another. Is this an easily fixable bug, or is there something that I should be doing?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">Yes, I'm aware of this, but it's rather hard to fix. The problem is that due to rounding errors in the corrdinate system conversion (box2d uses a different coordinate system than pixels) the pin is not exactly centered. At the moment if you miss the center you have to recreate the box and try again. I added this to the known bugs.

If you're going to be allowing user changes to the gravity anyway, this should be easy to implement.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> Right, I can just periodically check if the motion card was ejected and switch back to normal gravity then.

Could you explain further?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
"Layout mode" is what we have now. When switching to "coloring mode" all the buttons to create or modify the layout are gone and you get one button to select a color,  one to assign that color to a shape and one to pick a color from a shape. All you actually do in this mode is set the colors of the shapes. When you switch back to "layout mode" you still have the systematic coloring, but in "playback mode" you again see the shapes in the colors you assigned. That way you have total control over layout and coloring without it getting too complicated or restricted to do either.
<br/>
Also pins should be hidden in "coloring mode" like in "playback mode" and there could be more or different buttons (assign differen textures? switch shapes between filled or outlined?). Anyway, I hope you get what I was aiming at ...</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">I'm thinking about this. Not sure if it might confuse the user. Also it's not natural to draw a line in one color and then change the color afterwards. OK, then again it's not natural that things you draw come to life on the paper :) Still, I'm searching for a more elegant and natural solution for having more colors.

That way you could minimize the toolbar quite a bit.
<br/>
<br/>
For the object type button you could just make it toggle like the play button if you need some space.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> I could, but I'd have to extend my GUI toolkit to suport this first and I think it's easier to see all the functionality of the program at once.

I tried out how many circles I could draw on the screen before the program crashes. It crashes when drawing takes too long. Haven't exactly looked into what causes the crash. I had a look at my drawing function and everything that's called from it and didn't find any obvious bottlenecks, so I'll examine this more closely with a profiler. What I can also do is counting edges instead of counting objects. I chose circles as a "worst-case" object but it's really the number of lines that is limited. And since most of the objects you typically use are boxes or lines, I think the average case object limit could be raised by about a factor of 2 two 4. Further increase could be possible if I find bottlenecks in profiling, but then the physics also can only handle so many obects before it gets jerky.

oh, absolutely.

This is far far better then many commercial ds games.

Its very suitable for the system, creative, and easy to use.

I think the only mods neccessery for a full commercial game would be a little bit of structure, and some titles.
<br/>
<br/>
By structure, I mean as well as the "sandbox" mode, have a few incredible-machine type challanges.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
It surprised me that some pleople started making little games using pocket physics like skeeball, pinball, mazes, puzzles and so on. There's potential for several different types of games in the concept. By adding a fixed goal, like, say, a star to collect, I'm afraid I might be limiting creativity since then, only crayon physics type levels will be made. So I really want to keep the concept open. If anyone wants to make a real game out of it they're of course free to do so, since the source is available on request (and hopefully some day on the web :)

Object property implementation and object property customization implementation seems to be something that should be at the top of the list now.  The overlying principle during this implementation should be simplicity first.  As they say, keep it simple.  I strongly feel following this ideal is pivotal to the successful development of Pocket Physics, but of course that's just an opinion.

Here is what I propose as the next essential set of additions now that some excellent speed optimization and crash prevention has been implemented.

<br/>
functioning density setting
<br/>
functioning friction setting
<br/>
functioning restitution setting
<br/>
functioning rigid/soft body setting (maybe for later)
<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice to be able to change the volume of the object as well, however I feel that is not as necessary yet, as it is just as easy to delete the object and recreate it for the moment.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Object property customization implementation:</span>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Selection tool</span> - click objects once to select and be presented with a set of sliders/gui objects to adjust all properties. 
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Duplication tool</span> - click and drag an object just as you would with the move tool, although instead of moving the object this will create a duplicate of the object and move it along with the drag.  or, you can look at it as moving the object and leaving a copy behind in the original location.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice to have group functions for all the tools (move, delete, select, duplicate).  However, I feel that is not necessary yet.  Priority should first be given to fleshing out the available single object editor.
<br/>
<br/>
Beyond these additions, I feel the next step would be to add adjustment of world settings, implement rigid/soft bodies, and then work on group functions.
<br/>
<br/>
Out of curiosity, would it be possible to help in these implementations?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> That pretty much sums it up :) I'm trying to select the most basic suggested features first and think about a consistent way to add them to the interface, ideally not changing the way things worked previously and logically extending the functionality. That's also why I have this system of three todo lists into which I sort the suggested features depending on how well I think they fit in, how much time they take to code, and also how much fun they are to code :)
<br/>
<br/>
I already thought of a way of changing object properties which will extend the current move tool to be a selection tool as well. It will work like with icons on the Windows desktop: You can select single objects by clicking on them and multiple objects by drawing a box around them. Then by drag and drop you can move objects. There will be a collapsable bar or window with the object properties that is used for changing the parameters of the selected object(s) using slider controls. A separate "clone" tool will work the same way, but create a copy of objects when they are moved.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to help out, drop me an e-Mail so we can discuss this.

you place a "triangle" icon on the screen (background only I guess) or something like a megaphone or a "<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;</span>"

choose it's angle (with the stylus)

when you need tu move something just blow into the mic (harder or softer depending on what you want)

maybe just one megaphone per project would be ok

is this possible? (please)

I think it would be dificult to make it like a conical wind opening
<br/>
but it could be lineal, only moving thing that are in front the megaphone

<br/>
another similar idea: fan
<br/>
it's the same, but it's not necessary to blow
<br/>
just choose position, angle and strongness</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
This is definitely a cool idea, but too advanced for the current state of the project. I'm putting it on the "other" list for now.
<br/>
<br/>
I cleaned and reorganised the todo lists. Most notably, web uploading was added :) And yes it seems like I won't be abandoning Pocket Physics as soon as I initially wanted to because it's really fun to code and to get so much great, valuable and motivating feedback :)
<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless there will be a break in development now since I decided to finish the next version of NitroTracker first, which is overdue for a long time now and I have some great new features I want to share. Also I'm quite busy with university at the moment so development will slow down, but rest assured it will not cease yet and there will be an open source release before I stop development so even if I eventually get tired of PP someone will be able to continue it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, I certainly didnt want to restrict it to that type.

It was just an example.

Its only a vague idea anyway, but I was thinking if there was some "formal" way of making a *.pp file thats set up as a challange to someone else.

I didnt want to restrict what that challange could be.

Of course, by the nature of making an engine its hard not to be restrictive.

I just like the idea, in general, of games that allow you to make your own challanges for others.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

Who doesn't remember the cult game The incredible Machine? Well, we can bring joy to the fans of the series, as a TIM-clone, Crazy Machines, is heading for the Nintendo DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Crazy Machines is a physics-based puzzler, based on The Incredible Machine. The player is given a task which he (or she) has to solve using series of mechanical components. For example, to light a room one might need to cut a rope which is holding a helium-filled ballon, that will then fly upwards to scare a caged-monkey which'll in turn start to run on a threadmill that'll start up a generator used to power the lamp. Sounds easy enough, doesn't it?
<br/>
<br/>
Crazy Machines on Nintendo DS goes further than a simple port of the PC version: this time an Action-mode will be included. During Action-mode, gamers need to construct their machine while the machine is already working. This requires some quick thinking and quite some responsiveness from the player.
<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, Crazy Machines features the option to exchange solutions with other players over Wi-Fi (we're not sure whether this means local-only or not).
<br/>
<br/>
Crazy Machines for Nintendo DS is currently set for a European release this Autumn.

How about regions that dampen or enhance motion? 
<br/>
<br/>
eg, anything going into that region will start to speedup/slow down. (whatever its current vector is, multiplayed by a positive or negative factor every time unit)
<br/>
<br/>
Potentialy I think this would allow "active" regions, which could allow smart designers to make moters in their simulations?

On a basic level, having a "enhanced" motion region would make a ball in it act like a bit of flubber.

  them ut after pressing stop, it would reset.)

Yep, it's still not perfect, but the guy who created this (don't know if he's registered here), is still working on it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was just on a plane, and had time to create a cool Pocket Physics course. It's pretty cool, I must say. I'll try and make a video as quickly as possible, but I need to buff out some small details. (I'll say this: the course is a game of sorts) After making the majority of it, there were only a couple of improvements that I would have liked:
<br/>
<br/>
-A limit of objects more than 50 (seen as how it can handle more and not be too slow)
<br/>
-Duplication of objects (Common request, but it would be great)
<br/>
-This isn't quite as important, but a grid that would allow objects to snap into place
<br/>

Again, these are only little things. You could stop production here, (which you very well could have done) and I'd be alright with it.<br/>_________________<br/>Hmm?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

  wheel after pressing play and then I could get objects to move along
<br/>
  them ut after pressing stop, it would reset.)

Other cool things that I think could come second are Gravity Change, Water, and maybe a rope creation tool.

No idea really. As I said I'm making a break at the moment because I'm working on NitroTracker for a bit. The good thing is that Pocket Physics will benefit from this as well, because I'm cleaning up and polishing TobKit, which is the GUI toolkit I use in NitroTracker and Pocket Physics. The plan is to make it open source, so people have an easier time making apps with GUIs.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I'm glad to announce that Box2D 2.0.1 was released recently which now includes the fixed point NDS version by kavaler and me :)

Oh well, I thought it would actualy be an easy way to do motors :p
<br/>
<br/>
eg.
<br/>
By having a rod on a pivot with two objects stuck to each end.
<br/>
With a negative resistance on one side of it, that should automaticaly make a moter. (as the object entering the negative resistance area will speed up, thus turning it).
<br/>
<br/>
Of course I guess the problems will be keeping stuff sane. Stop things accelerating into a massive crash :p
<br/>
<br/>
I dont think it would be possible for bullet time effects under this though.
<br/>
Any resistance added per frame would slow the objects down as if they entered, say, water.
<br/>
Bullet Time would mean effecting the rate of the global "tick".

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey! I'm happy that the interest in PP hasn't ceased despite the lack of updates. Nevertheless, I want to finish NitroTracker v0.4 first, and this still means a lot of bugfixing. Also I'm quite busy with university at the moment, so don't expect any updates in the coming weeks, or even months.
<br/>
<br/>
This does not mean I've stopped development, I just paused it, and I hope you understand that I want to keep my benevolent dictator status of this project until it's in a state that I'm reasonably content with.
<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, if you badly want to have a feature, get in touch with me so we can discuss the way it's integrated into the program and the user interface. I'll also provide you with source code.
<br/>
<br/>
After Pocket Physics is "finished", I will release the source code and probably stop development, so someone else can pick it up and modify it as they will. I hope that whoever will continue development will carefully think about how to integrate new features, and I'll of course be there for discussion about this.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep on producing cool and creative sketches! I really enjoy the stuff you make and I'm often astonished about what's possible with PP :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unfortunately I haven't had much time lately, so there won't be a new release any time soon. Remember the source is available on request, and if you want to add a feature you would like you're welcome to add it. If I like the change I'll even call it an official new release.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the most awesome change at the moment would be direct upload to / download from the PP sharing site, enabling you to submit sketches from wherever you are, without the hassle.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm still intending to open-source it, but before that there's a lot of maintenance to do since nearly all libraries it depends on have been updated :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Activision sells a ds game called "Tony Hawk's Motion" that includes a slot 2 accelerometer device, and I was wondering if this device would work with pocket physics.
<br/>
here is a picture:

<br/>
Apparently THMds is a horrible game but it is cheaper on ebay than a dsmotion cart (about $15), and the included game would be a good reason to buy it. 
<br/>
<br/>
It looks like it was designed for possible use with other games, so does anyone know if it would work? Many thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm glad that there's still interest in PP, and I'm still intending to fully open source it and maybe even add a bunch of things. I still cannot tell when though.

Yeah, the first time I stumbled upon the effect, I was kinda startled. I expected the robot guy to stand on his own, I thought that would be pretty cool by itself. But when he began walking, I couldn't believe my eyes.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I like to play around with different sorts of legs, and see what walks and what doesn't.
<br/>
<br/>
If you go ahead and add motors now, I will cry. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
