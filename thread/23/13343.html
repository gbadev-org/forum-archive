my-MeloDS v.45
<br/>
by outphase and zoharmodifier
<br/>
<br/>
my-MeloDS (read: my melodies) is a piano-based music application for the purpose of ear training and basic composition. There are 4 modes: Free Mode, Ear Training Mode, Composition and Metronome.
<br/>
<br/>
Free Mode
<br/>
---------
<br/>
This mode allows free play on the piano with no restrictions. Click the instrument name to change instruments.
<br/>
<br/>
Ear Training Mode
<br/>
-----------------
<br/>
Here, you can take several tests to increase your ear training ability. Follow the instructions on the top screen to determine how to complete each test. Tests are scored right or wrong and have clear cut answers.
<br/>
<br/>
Compostion Mode
<br/>
---------------
<br/>
You can create a simple melody using the notes provided. I got lazy and prevented a note overrun (tied notes), so you cannot place a note duration that does not fit a perfect measure in 4/4 time.
<br/>
<br/>
KNOWN BUGS
<br/>
----------
<br/>
Text shows up strangely on slot 2 cards. Strange because we don't use DLDI or any hardware specific calls that we know of.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great app really well done. the only thing i could suggest is incorperationg some kind of education secition that explaines some music theory for those people looking to learn. Musictheory.net is a great place if your looking for ideas</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I really like the idea of this, the ds seems like a very good platform for this kind of thing.
<br/>
<br/>
To make it even better I have to agree with zigmen that some more information for those who hasn't already studied music theory would be a great addition. One thing I can think of is that it would be nice if it could show the intervals of subsequent notes played in freestyle mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you update it!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
