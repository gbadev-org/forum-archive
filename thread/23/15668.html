    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have released my version of a quake port for the nintendo ds. I named it cquake for lack of a better name. The frame rate is not the best but I think it is playable on easy or normal. Hard and Nightmare are not very playable.
<br/>
<br/>
you can check it out at:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://code.google.com/p/cquake/" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/cquake/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
be sure to read the readme_cquake.txt file as it includes some important notes about defragmenting the PAK files.
<br/>
<br/>
I left some debugging code turned on that can be used to trace failure points at startup. If you see a message that says "wait for it..." then you need to press the A button to continue. This only occurs during startup. You can turn off the rest of the debug messages by going to the console and setting developer to 0
<br/>
<br/>
Like this:
<br/>
developer 0
<br/>
<br/>
I have tested this on:
<br/>
Ezflash 5
<br/>
Supercard Lite microsd
<br/>
Max Media Doc CF
<br/>
<br/>
I have not tested this on a FAT32 or SDHC card as I do not have the hardware. So, I would be curious to know the results.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I used per vertex lighting on the world and implemented dynamic lighting. It is not perfect but it looks prety good. It is a little dark but gamma can compensate.
<br/>
<br/>
over all I would have to say that simon's version is better with more polish.
<br/>
<br/>
I did implement a few thing that simon may want to incorporate into his version. In particular I modified how edicts are allocated so that they are not allocated in one big chunk using the maximum amount everytime. They are allocated in small chunks. The solution turned out to very simple and it frees up tons of memory. This keeps the game from loading from disk all the time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Besides the obvious, there's DScent which I thought had very nice touch screen controls w/ customisable on screen hotkeys for weapon switching and such. The Wii version of Quake has a unique wiimote aiming system that also works very well, though I'm not sure how/if it would translate to the touch screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
A few remarks:
<br/>
<br/>
Changeing the brightness will eventually make the textures disappear. That's due to the way you handle it. The NDS has a brightness register, so you might want to use that for better results.
<br/>
<br/>
When shrinking the screen, the stats (HUD) are only displayed while the menu is on. That should be easily fixed, I guess.
<br/>
<br/>
Modelling stylus aiming after Metroid Prime Hunters should work pretty well. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
How about you and simon merging your work?
<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the good work and happy coding! :^D

do you ever see "done." printed? did you try holding the A button down? Are you using a special boot loader? Just throwing out ideas at this point.

You should hit a few wait messages before the file system is touched so the defrag issue should not come into play at this point. any ideas? I think I saw a post where you said you have an ezflashV - does it work on that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
So, if you are willing. Please boot the original version with the waitforit messages and let me know what (if anything) prints on the "mem: " line. There should be two numbers after that on the same line. The first one is the base address and second one is the amount of memory allocated. When quake initializes it tries to grab as much memory as possible. This can leave little to no memory for the rest of the "subsystems" (for lack of a better word). I think cquake may be grabbing too much memory for your card to continue functioning. hopefully I should be able to tell by looking at the "mem: " line output.
<br/>
<br/>

I hope my post didn't sound condescendingly, in which case I would be sorry.

Reality is, that a lot of people don't read instructions and then ask things that have been already anwsered *in* those instructions. One can not know who read them and who didn't, unless people explicitly write what they did.

The current implementation really drags the game if it is visible all the time. It is just a buffered bitmap in VRAM_E. So it is not refreshed when the game is running and it is hidden. I am still working on that part. I was thinking of redoing that part completely instead of just porting the existing implementation. It does not make a lot of sense (to me) to ocscure or shrink the 3d display when there is a whole additional screen that can display that info. I think I still have bank VRAM_H free, so I should be able to do something on the sub screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

-you can adjust the sensitivity at the console using the "sensitivity" command
<br/>
-the option on the menu is really a gamma adjustment and not brightness. r_ambient controls the ambient light level, it defaults to 0 which is complete black. I ranges from 0 to 255 with 255 being fullbright. this can be adjusted from the console. This does not adjust the lcd brightness only the in game lights. the lcd brightness would need to be adjusted prior to starting the game.
<br/>
-yes, ramping the gamma up real high will wash out the textures. I allowed to get so high so that I could test the lightmap coordinates. I do not recommend setting it that high.
<br/>
-if the screen size is set to the maximum it will hide the status bar. the setting no longer scales the viewport - it just adjusts what is visible on the status bar.
<br/>
-there is a command that can be issued from the console to swap the screens. it is "v_swap".

-did you try sensitivity at the console? if so, what did you set it to? I will adjust the range for the slider.

-so what r_ambient did you use?

-the model light levels are all off. I need to take a second look at how the light level is calculated. the world uses vertex lighting but the models use the full resolution lightmaps to find the light level for the spot they are standing on. so the it never looks quite right. plus I think my math may be off for this section. It uses the same math as the dynamic lighting (which looks right to me) so I am not sure.

I should not have put the key configurations in the autoexec.cfg file as this messes with the ability to change the configuration using the menu. so, sorry to do this to you but you will need to remove the all of the "bind *' lines from the autoexec.cfg file and move them to a new file named "config.cfg" in the same directory. the good news is that you will then be able to use the menu (start button-&gt;options-&gt;controls) to set the key configuration. once it is set you can save it on the options screen(it is the last entry on the options menu).
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: since r_ambient is not on a menu you can add it to the autoexec.cfg file like this

The new v_swap and touch screen implementation take this port to another level. I tried the new mod support and I'm happy to report that the following all run.

repearbot 81

I will test more mods later and report back my findings.

The netcode is still within the single player .nds file so by simply adding the listen command to the .ini file you can adjust how many bots can spawn. Sweet.

<br/>
Also both the official addon packs boot even with out a ram pack. 0_0 amazing! I have yet to test them properly but just to seen them running is quite a feat.

I tried the mulitplayer build and it worked fine as a host and a pc client running dark engine connected, worked a treat.

<br/>
<br/>
The brightness can be adjusted via the brightness register. You can check it out in my demo (there's a new version out, too.) It's  really simple:
<br/>
<br/>
Tell the NDS to either increase or decrease brightness and then the amount.
<br/>
It's not too good looking, but it works. It can also be adjusted at any time, so it makes a perfect candidate for the slider. You might want to make an array with ready to use brightness values, not the if / else statement I used in the demo, though. :^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

This morning I realized I never bothered trying some of the things I was looking for in QuakeDS (solely because of their use-in-modding/TC potential) in cquake...it's awesome that setting the FOV works great :)  It also didn't click until this morning that dynamic lighting worked...I guess Quake was looking 'normal', so I didn't notice :D
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be possible to make the console Tab-completion either cycle through the possible values, or else give a full list of matches on a 2nd Tab press?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, is the 'shakiness' of the viewweapon easily fixable?  (I'm guessing right now it's actually hovering in front of the player's view and follows them with a slight delay)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The only other big thing I'd like to see would be the frame-to-frame model animation interpolation that a lot of the Quake ports started getting a while after the source came out (this would be sexy while playing around with host_framerate-based slow motion/etc effects :P), but doing the math might use too much CPU :/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

yeah, I always felt that the tab completetion was a little lacking in the original. but, probably the fact that it had completion at all was amazing at the time. I think I shoould be able to fix something up.
<br/>
<br/>
the shakiness of the view weapon bugs me to no end. I have not been able to trackdown exactly what causes it though - it looks like a precision issue. I guess I will have to put more effort into. that and fixing the entity lighting are on the tops of my todo list... and I also need to adjust my hack for loading progs.dat files so that it will work with mods with the progs.dat in packfiles.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

there is only 512k of texture memory for everything. the world and all of the models. I currently have it set to use one bank (there are 4 128k banks) for 32x32 resolution textures and 3 banks for 128x64 (or 64x128 depending on the aspect) which will fit 48 textures. so texture memory is super tight. someone could probably come up with a better solution but this allows a fair amount of texture streaming with minimal black lines (which are caused by loading out side of hblank and vblank).the 128x64 limit is why the model look so pixelated.I was thinking of using 2 textures for the models - one for the front and one for the back. I am not sure if there is enough memory for it though. at a certain point though the high res textures wont make a difference on the small ds screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure that I want to put sleep mode in though. I thought that it caused some problems with certain cards. the save/load code does work.

Quake can only run one progs.dat at a time, which contains pretty much *all* of the gameplay logic/etc.

You can't just make a .PAK that has the model/sound/etc resource files from different mods.  Whichever progs.dat you use is going to be what the 'mod' is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have not come up with a decent way to enable screenshots. the screen capture hardware requires a free texture bank of memory. since texture memory is in short supply it may be a little tricky. It is one of the things I wanted to try to implement but it is not really tops on my list. I really want to try to increase the frame rate a little.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I hear down in Hell (Remember: "Hell is *infinite*!" &lt;lol&gt; - that was a random quote off a QotSA record), on the bad side of NDS hacking, they can capture directly to main RAM. That's a hellish helltastic feature... but guess what? As evil as the saints at Nintendo are, the Hell, Earth and Heaven versions of the NDS are IDENTICAL!

You can capture directly to RAM by setting the source B bit to 1 (definition not yet included in libnds.) I think I showed hot to do it in VSD 1.6.0's capture setup, but gbatek is the place you want to go to for more information (so you don't have to go to hell and aske them 3v17 haxorz.)
<br/>
<br/>
That way you can capture without the need to free up a VRAM bank for the screenshot. I haven't done it yet, but I think it's worth trying, so I will, eventually. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
PS: It is set like this:
<br/>

<br/>
...</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
(which is 2 ;^) )
<br/>
<br/>
You'll have to figure out the rest for yourself, though. But I guess this works via write and read offsets etc... I could also be totally wrong! ;^)
<br/>

Good luck! :^)

It supports mode 5, which is the same thing (modulo bit 15). My suggestion was that the program captures to main RAM, sets bit 15 (if the capture hardware can't set bit 15 by itself), and writes out the result to VRAM C (or even H, using vcount DMA).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I guess you can not capture *to* main memory, but *from*? It seems Martin himself wasn't sure, so all the terminology in gbatek is a bit weird... I'm still trying to figure it out.

<br/>
@ tepples: Not regarding what I just wrote, yes, that could work. :^)

EDIT: Now I am pretty damn sure this is a one way route into the opposite direction: You can only blend the captured image with an image from main memory, which has to be DMAed *to* the capture unit...

added double tap support for the touch screen - it is a bindable key named "dstap". double tapping the screen when selecting a key in the controls menu can be used for binding it to a command.

For the new sprite code, would you happen to know if it supports the different sprite-drawing modes the Quake engine supports?  (They can either always face the player, a-la the goldish light spheres and bubbles, or they can face a desired direction always (think blood splats/etc))
<br/>

<br/>
Relating to my Tab-completion suggestion...would you also consider adding a short previously-typed console history using d-pad Up and Down, so you can just scroll through the last 5 or whatever things entered? :)
<br/>
<br/>
-
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I don't know if it's just me, but there seems to be a slight Shift weirdness that I can't replicate 100% of the time.
<br/>
<br/>
- If you toggle Shift on, the key you hit afterwards will usually trigger the Shifted-key and then also the normal key...for example, trying to type an underscore results in <span style="font-weight: bold">_-</span> here.
<br/>
<br/>
Not only that, but sometimes after it does that and I close and reopen the console, it will stop recognizing that I'm hitting Shift when trying to type an underscore about 5 times in a row...Shift is on, the _ key is shown (and highlighted when I tap it), but it spits out a minus sign.  I don't know what causes it to start working again, I just keep trying Shift and that key :/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
the keyboard is not the best. I need to put more effort into it. part of the confusion is that the caps key is implemented wrong. it works more like a sticky shift key. I need to make it just do uppercase and change the color so you can tell it is pressed. the double type on shift drives me crazy, almost crazy enough to fix it ;)
<br/>
<br/>
yeah, I should have looked at the console autocomplete code before I brazenly said that I could add multiple tab completion support. the code is quite convoluted. I am not sure it is worh the effort. I could alternatively have a listcommands, er.. command with partial matching support. that would be a lot easier. 
<br/>
<br/>
the up and down arrows on the keyboard will scroll the console buffer so you can see things that scrolled off screen. the up and down on the dpad are supposed to move through the recent commands - doesn't currently work though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

cquake does not support using both slot1 and slot2 devices at the same time - either the slot 1 or the slot 2 can be used but not both at the same time. it only makes use of the one it has been dldi patched for - the other slot is ignored. it currently does not make use of or require a slot 2 memory expansion card.

seriously though, I suspect the issue is that the driver for the MK5 does not support unaligned reads. Are you able to try it on the G6? I think that does support unaligned reads. I know the supercard lite has issues with this and there is a special driver ( supercard rumble ) that support unaligned reads. I do not know if a special driver exists for the MK5.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">this is growing up fast... i confirm again my compliments...
<br/>
few questions to take up the discussion:
<br/>
1) could you please add a message log when you do commits to googlecode? i like to read what has been changed/currently developed and also it is simple to follow your improvements in the pure code (programming).
<br/>
2) which could be a good default value for r_ambient? (comparing to the pc version)
<br/>
3) I am not able to run episodes 2, 3, 4... nothing happenes when I enter the portals, it seems to load but then it crashes.
<br/>
4) Are you considering (after cquake will reach a good state of development) to start working on a quake 2 port with your enhancements over quakeds? quake2 is more usable on the small ds screen, because it is much brighter and has vibrant colors (compared to the dark quake1) and that result in a better gaming experience on a handheld. It is maybe more adapt to those small screens. I'm sure that you can receive donations very quicly to have your own EXRAM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
1)hmmm, that sounds like a lot of work ;) you can browse the source repository through the google code site and look at the diffs for each file. I try to put a list in the readme file each time I create a new distribution. if I can figure out how to do it and it is not too much work I will think about...
<br/>
2)that is a hard question to answer as it depends a lot on the ambient light level where you are playing. in a darker room or at night the default level looks pretty good to me. during the day though it looks a little dark. I tend not to use r_ambient very much myself though. I like to keep the dynamic lighting more visible - r_ambient sets the beginning light level for a surface then lights are added in on top. if you set it much over 60 than it washes all of the lighting out. I have the brightness (which is actually gamma) turned up just a little.
<br/>
3)episodes 2, 3, and 4 require the registered version of quake which is in pak1.pak. it should say map not found if it is missing though. I would double check that pak1.pak is fully defragmented. if the drive is very full it may not fully defragment with a single run. if it is really full then it may not even be possible without taking all of the files off of the card and then putting them back on. the whole disk does not need to be defragmented though just the quake files.
<br/>
4)I am not sure if I will take a look at quake2. if I did it would probably be a multiplayer only version. I already have a ezflash and a supercard, so I am all set in the exram department.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
2) so it is better to change the gamma rather than r_ambient?
<br/>
3) I should format again my card... I don't have windows as said :'(
<br/>
4) why just multiplayer? i don't think there should be much more space/ram free with the multiplayer only.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1)I have never used svn before and I am actually using tortoise svn. It took me a few minutes to figure out the difference between commit and update! it sounds like I should be able to handle it though.
<br/>
2)personal preference I suppose, as it is rather subjective as to what looks better. some people complained that the setting the gamma/brightness too high would wash all the colors out. this is true, but if it looks bad do not turn it up that high! I allowed it to go that high so that I could see the lighting - I wanted the textures to wash away so I could make sure the lights were aligned properly.
<br/>
3)I think if you format the flash card then put the quake files on first then you should be all set.
<br/>
4)by multiplayer I mean that there would be no local server running on the DS sort of like a quakeworld client. plus simon already has the single player covered. the issue is not really ram it is more of a poly count issue and processor power issue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I like the way (I think) the ezflash 3in1 works, in that the rumble level can be set to a certain level without the need to constantly update the device. does rumble conflict with accessing the flash card?

Thanks for your work !</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">thanks for the feedback. I do not think the main fps issues are due to disk reads. disk reads are not that frequent and they usually only last one frame - so it causes more of a hitch or a slight pause. The last time I ran a profiler on it (thanks to simonjhalls function level profiler) the main issue was the recursive hull check functions used for collision detection. I converted these function to fixed point, but it does not appear to enough. I have a few things I want to try, but I am not sure how they will pan out.
<br/>
<br/>
I was playing around with the ram library last night, but I am not sure if I want to add it in to this project.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as launching the MP version from SP goes this is not possible and I do no have any plans to add this functionality. I took a look at the reboot lib a while ago and could not get it to work with my ezflash5 so I gave it up. it would be nice if it was a single nds file, but the MP version loses over 200k with the wifi lib added in. It may not sound like a lot but it really does effect performance on the single player version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

the brighness can be controlled in two ways. one by adjusting the gamma correction - this is what the brightness slider in the options menu does. if you set it all the way to the right everything is white - all the way to the left and everything is black. obviously you need to pick something in between. the cvar for gamma is "gamma" and the default value is "1". there is also a cvar that can be changed at the console "r_ambient". it has a value from 0 to 255. the default value is "0" which is fully black. some people like to set this a little higher around "60" (I think) so that things do not go completely black.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The problem with the Portal gun is that there are no levels to go with it. It's still a ton of fun, though.

Would it be possible to make the keyboard absolutely persistent?

Step 1: Download this file
<br/>
<a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/145625580/Team_Fortress.zip.html" target="_blank">http://rapidshare.com/files/145625580/Team_Fortress.zip.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Step 2: Unzip and place the folder on the same level as the id1 folder. (Also remove the space between Team and Fortress, makes it easier.) If the id1 folder is in the root, place the TeamFortress folder in the root. 
<br/>
<br/>
Step 3: Run cQuake. If the blue list of folders comes up (The mods list) your card is supported. Run TF. If not, blame elhobbs, because it's all his fault. :D
<br/>
<br/>
Note: The maps included are the high quality maps. However, cQuakeDS only supports TF maps under 1 meg. So, you have 2fort and maybe a few others to play around on. 
<br/>
<br/>
Note that binding +gren1 and +gren2 to right pad buttons is a wise move when playing on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
To run on PC, find the "Run..." box, browse, select the game icon you wish to use, then make sure the file name and extension is in quotes and add -game TeamFortress
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BACK ON TOPIC!
<br/>
I'm having a thought here. Is there any way to use lower res models? Surely the models and textures used in the n64 version and the like are a lower resolution and complexity than the PC resources? This could increase performance. Maybe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm pretty sure the blue 'outline' on things like the shotgun are due to the textures being scaled down a bit, and you're seeing some of the surrounding color that exists on the skin image that's embedded in the model file.  The artist that did the textures used a blue border on the axe, shotgun, super shotgun, and super nailgun, so that should be the only weapons you see it on.
<br/>
<br/>
The 'fix' would involve editing the files in the pak0.pak itself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<div class="post">
    <h4>#164770 - elhobbs - Wed Nov 19, 2008 2:51 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">another solution would be to have cquake not scale the texture on the viewmodel quite so drastically. since texture memory is in such high demand in quake textures get scaled quite a bit. everything gets jammed into 128 32x32 and 48 128x64 slots. as a result the models end up looking a little (ok...very) pixelated. reassigning 8 of the 128x64 slots to be 2 x 256x128 slots instead and using them for the viewmodel might improve the results.
<br/>
<br/>
a separate approach might be to separate the model textures into a front and a back texture. they are always split down the middle vertically, so it would not be too difficult.
<br/>
<br/>
yet another approach might be to render the triangles onto the texture surface instead of using a linear scale on the texture as a whole. I think this would result in a better texture coordinate alignment.
<br/>
<br/>
the downside to all of the approaches is that it will have an adverse effect on load times. as it stands the textures get loaded from disk on demand using a very simplistic cache. so, the more cpu or memory bandwidth that is used the more it will adversely effect performance - more black lines and more noticeable framerate drops.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I need to add some code to detect dsi mode and use a larger hunksize automatically. currently you need to add "-heapsize 15000" in dsi mode to the cquake.ini file to make use of the additional memory.

<br/>
memory got a little tight on the arm7 side with the latest libnds and I had to reorder some allocations a little bit. you may have downloaded a version that hung when it failed to allocate before I fixed it.

I was a little disappointed that it really did not run that much better in dsi mode compared to ds mode - maybe 15%-30% faster. though, I suppose any improvement is good.

<br/>
a dsi specific version may be in order with an updated renderer. more things could be cached as display lists - models in particular need to be reassembled each frame and the rendering is really slow.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
