    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I put some early examples and tests up here:

They do not represent the finished project, but do show a bit of what is to come. 
<br/>
<br/>
 As you can see I managed to get 3D floors working on the DS without Slow Down. Also I have included a couple sections with translucent walls that can not be walked directly up to, and therefore do not slow down the game much if at all.
<br/>
 These levels are not textured propper as I will wait to do that last before final release, also the enemy lay out in the Space Station Argento test is random as I merely dropped a few in there for something to do while roaming around the level. Also I've not finished the Deh/Bex coding for the enemies and weapons yet so not everything is acting as it should yet, and since the gfx and sounds are not yet complete some things are still DOOM, but I think you get the idea.
<br/>
<br/>
 Also the Mach 1 demo is ment to show off how I intend to put the player in many situations that can not be resolved by fighting, but by refering to other means for escape, so in this level in order to escape the approaching Mach 1 droid, you have to run down the hall way only to find the door locked, but if you shoot the panel (Return of the Jedi), the door flies open.
<br/>
 I hope to include little things like that, and bits of comedy that pay homage to the films, and most of all the books which far surpass anything that has been put to screen!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. This runs betters on my GBAMP v2 than my M3 Simply for some reason, though both are fully up to date. So I think Wintermute was correct in saying that shady DLDI code might have an effect on crashes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think I figured out what was wrong with the ambient sounds effects. 
<br/>
<br/>
 For instance at the beginning of Space Station Argento, there is a black column in the center of the room which is making a looping sound that has a pop in it. I believe that pop is because of an early beta of the upcoming update to XWE. I'm pretty sure that if I load up the sound in an older version of XWE or Wintex, that it would be fine.
<br/>
 As for the previous lack of volume, I think that was because FreeDOOM has the volume on certain sounds set to low, which can be correct by hand without much hassel.
<br/>
<br/>
 I am still locking up when I die, then try to reload the game. Sometimes I goto a black screen, other time I get to start again! It's really odd, but I think it has to due with the levels size as I do not think there should be any mapping errors present that could crash it otherwise it shouldn't play at all.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Anyhow, there is some progress. I'm certain there will not be any sort of Christmas release, but at least now I've got a better idea of what the DS port of PrBOOM can and can not do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry about this, but two things:
<br/>
<br/>
1. I had merged this with the commercial DOOM 2 wad so now it is merged with FreeDOOM.
<br/>
<br/>
2. This demo had a few quirks that needed cleared up real quick so that players could explorer the entire level so I cleaned them up.
<br/>
<br/>
 On the upside the file size is now much much smaller and the game is running much much smoother! It seems the size of the IWAD has a lot to do with this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Change to Argento wad made at about 4:30PM Arizona time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Boot screen should now say Star Wars DS and not DOOM 2.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
