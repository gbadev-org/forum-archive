    <h4>#103506 - ThaKilla - Fri Sep 22, 2006 2:33 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been working on a new DS app for sometime now. (just learning how to program C and DS hardware) 
<br/>
<br/>
It's called DSBlue.
<br/>
<br/>
It has a few built-in funtions that I think you all would like.
<br/>
<a href="http://allwackedout.no-ip.com:2327/home/files/nds/main.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a> After "Swap Screen"<a href="http://allwackedout.no-ip.com:2327/home/files/nds/main2.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">A few notres on use:</span>
<br/>
this app supports a flip screen type interface (sorry cant think of a better way to say it), but what it does is allow you to swap screens without swaping out the main uitls for each screen. (i.e. Clock, Inet Activity, Curr AP, and the DS Owner name)
<br/>
<br/>
Also to return to the "Home" screen press the "Home" bar on the touch screen window. (Red bar at the top)
<br/>
<br/>
There is now a "system.ini" file in the "DATA" folder that allows you to setup up your own Network information.
<br/>
<br/>
Also be sure to look at the Readme.txt because it outlines most everything.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Wifi Modules</span>
<br/>
AP Finder (used to find and connect to a local AP)
<br/>
Packet Spy (used to view data floating in the air, no recording and locks up every now and again)
<br/>
Port Scan (can scan for open ports on a certian IP)
<br/>
<a href="http://allwackedout.no-ip.com:2327/home/files/nds/wardrive.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Shoutcast (does not work really, but the code should help others)</span>
<br/>
Its needs to be changed from using the sync method of libmad, to a frame based version.
<br/>
Has support for multiple list (hardcoded at the moment  :( )
<br/>
<a href="http://allwackedout.no-ip.com:2327/home/files/nds/shoutcast.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Scratch Pad (will be removed)</span>
<br/>
was going to be a simple notepad, but the Calendar should take its place.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Remote Desktop (still a little buggy)</span>
<br/>
It allows you to connect to a PC (running the server program I made)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Calendar</span>
<br/>
It allows you to view a calendar and enter in text for a certain day. (this will sync with the PC app soon)
<br/>
<a href="http://allwackedout.no-ip.com:2327/home/files/nds/calendar.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Config</span>
<br/>
Just pretty much Wifi Settings.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Desktop Sync</span>
<br/>
Used to sync up information between your DS and PC (mainly for the calendar at the moment, but will also include other settings)
<br/>
<br/>
OK here it is...
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://allwackedout.no-ip.com:2327/home/files/nds/DSBlue.rar" target="_blank">http://allwackedout.no-ip.com:2327/home/files/nds/DSBlue.rar</a> (4MB)
<br/>
<br/>
The main reason for this release is more for Develpoers who are having problems to see how I got around them. This is no means the best way to do things, but hopefully it will help a few out.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Some Notes:</span>
<br/>
This is more of a learning tool than a real project, so there are bugs.
<br/>
A Main one is when connecting to an AP you must use the "Connect" button twice (think its a problem with the WIFI Lib)
<br/>
<br/>
Shoutcast does not work. It will read station info, but playing has been removed till i can figure out how to use libmad right.
<br/>
<br/>
Also the best way to use this, is by compiling the source if you want to change anything. (uses the latest Wifi Lib, and devkitpro r19)
<br/>
<br/>
To use the server program there should be a folder called "VB6" just run "DSServer100.exe" if you dont have VB6 (or missing DLLs). (If you do than the "Server App" folder holds the source.)
<br/>
<br/>
Note: with the "Remote Desktop" and "Sync" just must Stop and Re-"listen" to connect back. It was kinda thrown together.
<br/>
Note2: the Develpoer tab is used to create graphics (using my own format) and creat code to use it, cause im lazy ;)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by ThaKilla on Wed Sep 27, 2006 6:48 pm; edited 8 times in total</span></div>

It will allow you to view your desktop.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have the "zoom" screen (100% pixel to pixel) on the touch screen than you can use your mouse by pressing on the touch screen and the 
<br/>
A button for left click
<br/>
B button for right click
<br/>
Also you can use the keyboard (the "A" with a square around it at top of touch screen)
<br/>
<br/>
If the "fullscreen" view is on the touch screen than you can touch where you want the "zoom" screen to center.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
With this I can view the Nintendo WFC Settings saved in my DS, right ?
<br/>
<br/>
So.... why can I only see the 1. of my saved 2 Connections ?
<br/>
<br/>
And why is the Wep key other than the one I typed in ?
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Well its variables and dosn't use the WFC data (I should probly change it so it can) and the WEP key is the one I use here. and is hardcoded. If you get the latest devkitPro and set it up than you can change this info in the "my_wifi.c" file function "Init_Wifi"

<br/>
<br/>
What does this do ?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Its a simple port scan, you connect to an AP, than use this to check for open ports on any IP.
<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean with this ?
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Note: with the "Remote Desktop" and "Sync" just must Stop and Re-"listen" to connect back. It was kinda thrown together.

<br/>
<br/>
It means that I have checking for the connect being dis-connected on the Server App side, so if you turn off your DS while using REmote Desktop, you have to tell the "Server " app to listen again. (Its a button)

I hope you will implement reading from the Firmware, because my Router is WEP secured...

The coolest App I can use so far is the Packet Spy ;)

May it be that the Packet Spy locks up sometimes (or may it be I'm just dumb and you already wrote that  ? ^^ If so, sorry...)

This thing is pretty cool man, but:

Pretty mush the same problem I only have a EZ-Flash 3 cart so I have nothing to support FAT to test on. That is how the whole sync thing got started. Hopefully by X-mas I can get the money together to get a real Homebrew cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can delet the previous enteries if you:
<br/>
<br/>
1. tap the thing you want to change with the Stylus
<br/>
<br/>
2. Press the Swap Button
<br/>
<br/>
3. Press the Keyboard Buttor
<br/>
<br/>
4. Delete the previous Enterie with the Backspace Button 
<br/>
<br/>
5. Write in the new one you like
<br/>
<br/>
@ThaKilla:
<br/>
<br/>
I have an Idea referring to your Wifi Connection Read from Firmware Problem:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Just ask Dragonminded (the maker of DSorganize) about the Code he uses in his DSOrganize to read the Setting out of the Firmware
<br/>
<br/>
2. Download the Source of DSOrganize (www.youngmx.com, go to NDSdev then to DSOrganize) and look if you find what you need to get your Program to read the settings out of the firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps, and hope to be able to get this cool app used with his Router:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sorry, it works but it doesnt like my wireless as it is on dhcp. i wait and it can't connect in ap settings/ap find. also, the default in config/ip settings, i can't turn the wep off. is that because i am doing something wrong or what? i really want to use all of the features but wifi is not helping,lol. =)a couple of bugs that i have seen are:
<br/>
<br/>
-using the keyboad i can still see the stuff behind it
<br/>
-wep dosent turn off on the settings menu(might be me!)
<br/>
-after i put one remote desktop ip address in, when i click the icon i can't change the ip of my computer.(same goes for destop sync)
<br/>
<br/>
some suggustions:
<br/>
<br/>
-option use of WFC
<br/>
-put wardriving on bottom screen instead of top
<br/>
-when you put ip configurations you should be able to keep them when wardriving for an ap(Example:i put in an ip address of 192.168.0.12,gateway of 192.168.0.1 then i want to keep it when i wardrive and connect to an ap)
<br/>
<br/>
this looks like it will become a very useful ap

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">App GUI looks awesome.. kinda difficult to move around in though.. here are my comments:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Caps key doesn't seem to change till you touch the keyboard.
<br/>
2) Need TAB between fields, so you don't have to keep swapping the screen to move to the next field.
<br/>
3) Readme.txt file wouldn't hurt.. :)
<br/>
4) Firmware WiFi settings are a must..  Almost all WiFi games/apps out there currently use it, so the information can't be top secret.
<br/>
5) Maybe "highlight" an icon, and allow the D pad to move around them, and A to select (if the icons are on the top screen).
<br/>
6) Config for time format?
<br/>
7) Scratch pad needs thicker lines.. and I personally don't think you should get rid of it, as being able to draw notes or scetches is usefull.  It'd be nice if you could link it with the Calander, so you can choose to either type of "draw" your notes.
<br/>
<br/>
Now.. maybe it is just me, but I can't even figure out go to get connected.  I edited all the WiFi settings but can't seem to find a "connect" button you refered to in your initial post.
<br/>
<br/>
8) AP find worked perfect for me
<br/>
9) I saw encoded packets with the packet spy (but without logging, is it really usefull?) and after a few seconds, it locked up my DS
<br/>
10) I know it would make it more difficult for you, but you might want to blank all the settings prior to a release, as it is more work for everyone to delete the current settings before typing in the new one.
<br/>
11) a button (or button combo) for quick "links".. like L or R to swap screens, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, all these tests were done on a SuperCard CF (was just working with DSLinux and was to lazy to go up and get my prefered device, the GBA MP (CF))

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Very similar to DSOrganize!
<br/>
I hate having to choose :(
<br/>
<br/>
Both apps have distinct strong points, so I think you and DragonMinded should team up. (If either is willing...)
<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of synchronizing with the desktop computer. Very PDA-ish feature that I've wanted for a while.
<br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion:
<br/>
Have you thought about actually unifying the calendar with a note pad system, so that when a date is selected it enters scribble mode for that particular date?
<br/>
It would probably mean happier code (I, for one, am obsessed with unified code!), and more importantly it means that adding features to the note pad feature will at the same time improve the calendar. (For example, voice memos attached to notes, a scribble pad attached to notes, etc).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

But you can at least make sure features dont overlap, and switching between the two sets of applications is done easily.

Id rather have things that arnt made yet at all, rather then everyone doubling up for redundancy purpose's.
<br/>
Besides, its less effort for one person to make things work as universally as possible, then it is for two people to build the same thing from scratch.
<br/>
<br/>
I just think its a shame when people develope things that wont really be used.
<br/>
<br/>
In this case, this program has fantastic wireless settings and handeling options. Yet, the notepad is inferiour to the likes of DSOrganiser...so I wont be using it for notetakeing.
<br/>
Some might see that as a reason to try to develop the notepad more, but I see it more as we have a perfectly fine note-takeing app, so we might as well pursue other things.
<br/>
This is a small example, of course.
<br/>
And it goes both ways, I wouldnt want DSOrganiser to start getting this applications features rather then completely new ones.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

There is a better chance of one of the developers "getting it right" when there are a few of them working on the same type of program. For example, as much as I like DSLiveWeather, the UI makes absolutely no sense to me, and on the whole it is not as elegant as is should be for a task so simple.

I agree that improvements could be and should be made on this app because it is a great application created by a smart developer.

<br/>
My oppinion is, that plugins should be made available for such applications.For example we all would like a satellite image that shows clouds over our country and where not. This could be made available through plugins, and from different people/coders but still concentrating on one application and develop it further on to its best.

There is no use to have 3 coders developing the same app at the same time when they could work on a single app, thus work more efficiently and more ideas + experience.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Moonshell and DSOraganiser are already enough, so yes, do something else.
<br/>
Unless theres something really specific you think you/they can do better then those apps, <span style="font-style: italic">or your doing it merely as a learning excercise.</span>
<br/>
Another bootloader isnt going to be used, put simply.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We also already have calender apps.
<br/>
We also already have many drawing apps.
<br/>
And many notetakeing apps.
<br/>
<br/>
Why is it so illogical just to think people should look for things that havnt been done yet?
<br/>
<br/>
A good example is the drawing one.
<br/>
DSOrganiser has a drawing prog, so does this, and theres also the standalone one with the very nice blur function.
<br/>
<br/>
The standalone one, imo, is by far the best. 
<br/>
<br/>
So, I dont see the point in anyone adding yet another "MSPAint" app too that list unless they *really are going to make it better then whats done before*.
<br/>
To take an extream example of what I am saying;
<br/>
Isnt it better to have one paint shop pro, rather then 20 MSPaint clones?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know when your codeing stuff its boring to do one thing, its boring to make your application the best at its specific thing, its much more fun to make a multi-app that has lots of different things. I understand that.
<br/>
But I only wish some of this talent and effort was put into new stuff that wont be wasted.
<br/>
<br/>
So by all means, people should make as many apps as they like, but they should look at whats out there, and try to work with others that have no simerla.  That dosnt mean combineing code, it more means socialy combining brainpower and not treading on eachothers toes.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, this will happen naturaly, as this community works towards a common structure (/data ect).  Maybe re-using plugins between apps, or even haveing commonly agreed standards for using ram.
<br/>
(for instance, maybe we could have something like "cut and paste" betweens apps?)
<br/>
<br/>
In short, I am a great believer in the power of the many and the creativity of the individual. I dont see them as mutually exclusive things in development.
<br/>

<br/>
My oppinion is, that plugins should be made available for such applications.For example we all would like a satellite image that shows clouds over our country and where not. This could be made available through plugins, and from different people/coders but still concentrating on one application and develop it further on to its best. 
<br/>
<br/>
There is no use to have 3 coders developing the same app at the same time when they could work on a single app, thus work more efficiently and more ideas + experience.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, exactly.
<br/>
Allthough not even nesscerly on the same code. (allthough theres nothing wrong with that too).
<br/>
Most big apps can be broken down into smaller apps/plugins, and different people could work on different bits.
<br/>
<br/>
Potentialy the biggest project we could do would be a webbrowser.
<br/>
Wouldnt it be silly for one person to attempt to do that all themselfs?
<br/>
<br/>
Surely its better to design an overall system where tags could be handeled on almost a plugin base's.  This was discused in another thread in more detail, but its a good example of a task that can be split up between many.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

You're getting this wrong. I'm sorry to say, but it's actually harder to work as a team on a new project (even harder to merge existing projects) than to work alone. And the keyword is not competition, it's just 'freedom' of not being bound to something when you're the only developer. 
<br/>
Personally, I think it's luxury complaining that you need to choose between 2 wonderful apps. You have the option <span style="font-weight: bold">to choose</span>. Think of all the little children in Africa.. And the little kittens in Canada..
<br/>
<br/>
But we're arguing about something that in the end depends on the developers themselves. I think we learned your opinion and you learned ours, so let's call it a day.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got to agree that there's nothing wrong with people doing the same application.

<br/>
Look at DSOrganize.  Its file-browsing capabilities could be compared to MoonShell.  DM could've easily decided to concentrate on the notepad and calendar rather than jpeg-viewing, mp3-playing, or whatever, but the result of his doing what he wanted is a phenomenal program that has far more useful features than any other app I've seen.

<br/>
If DS Blue's gonna tackle the same arena, I'm all for it.  Maybe we'll get some more useful features out of the app.  If I've gotta pick between organizers, I'm more content to do so than to deal with the limitations of a single available application.

Yes, and if he did concentrate on what Moonshell had already done, do you think it would be so good?  Do you think it would have been as  fully featured elsewhere if he tried too make a movie or midi decoder as well?

File Browseing is kinda essiential at the moment, and I put that was an exception.

As we have no (current) way to "trigger" a program to load by file type, all homebrewers who want to give users a chance to load a file have too

make their own filebrowser.

I plan on Syncing the "Scratch Pad" and adding some draw features to it (Clear mainly)

Still working on re-writing the shoutcast MP3 decoding, so thats probly a release or two off.

The main problem is that all this from the first line of ASM to the current DevKitPro has been done on peoples free time. I am thankful for the time they put into it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When the page is full, you tap the corner to 'flip the page of the notebook' and get a new page. Then the whole notebook is stored as a file that can be viewed and changed later.
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted the same functionality in a DS, handwrite a note, save all the pages as one file (GIF) and be able to open it and read it back later. Being animated is just an extra bonus to let you view it on a computer without having a GIF program to deconstruct it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Install:

1) Un-RAR "DSBlue.rar"

2) To use the Server Side things. (Remote Desktop, Calendar Sync) you need to install "DSServer100.exe"
<br/>
3) Edit the "system.ini" file in the "DATA" folder to setup your Network Options
<br/>
4) Run "GBFSinclude.bat"
<br/>
3) Add the DSBlue.nds (or DSBlue.ds.gba) to your favorite Rom Loader.

I got a problem on step 4.

When I run GBFSinclude.bat it gave me the following error message.

I admit that I got put off when I was having trouble with my M3. Things not saving and stuff. I have put on the latest DSO build though and am planning to have a fiddle around. The main reason I'm looking forward to this app though, is the 'sync' functions. Could be handy.

Going to start doing some research into a slot 1 card as the bulk on the bottom of the lite is starting to annoy me.
