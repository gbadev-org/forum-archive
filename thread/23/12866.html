    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well after seeing Quake DS, I got inspired and thought I'd try my hand at porting something too, and Descent seemed like a good target.
<br/>
<br/>
So far, after about 3 weeks of working on it, I got hardware accelerated rendering with mostly full sized textures (only explosions and the like are downsized to 64x64 to match the rest), automap on botttom screen (yay), resized menus with touch support... Basically, it needs to run faster (any ideas for profiling?) and sound, and eventually network.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are some screenies to keep you waiting until I'm satisfied enough with it to release a binary and code.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All: thanks for the positive feedback.
<br/>
<br/>
Ant6n: original source, actually the mac source because there seemed to be too much asm in the pc version, which ended up being a time consuming choice due to the many differences between them (resolution mostly, mac version runs by default at 640x480 while pc is 320x200, there is more memory allocation in the mac version, sound is done differently, etc). after a while I ended noticing that the only missing c functions in the pc version where the vecmat ones. So now I have a sort of hybrid pc/mac version. It took me a fews days to get the damn thing just to compile, then I had to fix a lot of alignment issues to get it to run to the menu. I didn't have to rewrite a lot per say, but I've made modifications to almost every file. Memory has been a constant problem (as in the lack of), even though the original Descent runs on 4mb. Right now, code takes about 500k of space plus about 1.5megs of global variables, so that leaves only a bit over 2megs for level data, sound, textures &amp; various scratch pads.
<br/>
<br/>
I have to go for now, more rambling later.

Anyway, interesting to hear about the source you started with and all...

Good luck with it and remember to take simonjhall up on his offer. His experience with the Q1 engine could prove beneficial, even though Quake and Descent used somewhat different engine styles...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

<br/>
<br/>
Notes :
<br/>
You need the 1.5 data files (descent.hog and descent.pig). Shareware files wont work since they never did a 1.5 patch and the lastest shareware version is 1.4a...
<br/>
Sound is in but still a little glitchy. No music.
<br/>
No network.
<br/>
Start is enter, select is escape (for menu navigation).
<br/>
Touch the weapon on the bottom screen to select it.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know it should be pretty much bug free, but I haven't tried all the levels so some may not have enough free memory.
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun,
<br/>

It would be great to be able to change the sensitivity of the touch screen with respect to turning the ship. For me the sensitivity is way too low.

What an odd post. is it spam? *scratches head*
<br/>
<br/>
anyway, this is amazing for an alpha version. runs great on my supercard:cf, no patching needed.
<br/>
<br/>
I only have one complaint: turning with the touchscreen feels a bit 'mushy' when I need to turn by any large amount. When I just turn by a small amount, it feels fine, but say to turn 180 degrees, it takes too many touch &amp; drags to do it. This is probably due to the way descent control works, having originally been meant for keyboard control.
<br/>
<br/>
Also: Is there any way to rotate? I find myself upside down occasionaly, and the only way to right myself without rotation is through complicated manuvers.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the great work! The automap on bottoms screen is a very nice touch, as well as the weapon select. Simply amazing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

 I used the most recent NDS patched file and then I did what xskater101189 said to do and put all files on the root of the card and it now works.  Runs really well too.   
<br/>
<br/>
I have a few quesiton's.  
<br/>
  1. Does it support the touch pad for looking around, I coundn't figure out    how to activate it and it isn't doing it by default.  
<br/>
  2.  Can you save your game in this version?  
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.  Keep up the good work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Working great on my M3 Simply. I actually dug up my old Descent CD for this. XD

I only think the touchscreen sensitivity needs to be a little higher, seeing that the ingame settings are already at the max and turning around is still hella slow. (Maybe it's possible to just change the sensitivity-bar's range?)<br/>_________________<br/>maggiekarp: Aghhh okay guys why would my right ide hurt in my ribs

Touch screen control in this game is great, it almost seems like this is the kind of game the DS was made for. But like Anga said, the look sensitivity needs some work. I wonder if the sensitivity adjustment bar even does anything this early in development, or if it's currently just a holdover from the DOS version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i have problems with running DScent on my Supercard SD too...
<br/>
I patched game files (in two steps, 1-1.4a and 1.4a to 1.5), put them on the root of the SD together with Dscent.nds file and ran the game. 
<br/>
Game itself works, but i don't have a map on the touchscreen. Instead of it there is text about Descent copyrights and trademarks and also "type 'descent - help' for a list of command-line options." Touchscreen controls don't work in game except in start menu. Text is always there, but when i blindly tap on the top of the touchscreen i hear some sounds-probably weapon selector or something...i can't see it!:)
<br/>
After dldi patching for supecard sd problems are still there...
<br/>
otherwise the game plays well, no problems with ingame graphics or anything....
<br/>
<br/>
anyway, a great work done with DScent-one of my favourite games, excellent port! :)
<br/>
<br/>
here is text of my debug:

<br/>
<br/>
A few things to note :
<br/>
<br/>
1 - if you only have the descent copyright message on the touch screen, you have the debug version. Grab the normal version on the first post (or this one) and you should be fine.
<br/>
<br/>
2 - You can change the controls in options/control/customize keyboard. I rearranged the screen (in the version in this post) so that it fits correctly on the small ds screen resolution.
<br/>
<br/>
3 - If the touch screen doesn't work, you probably have the default keyboard-only configuration. Make sure you copied the player.plr file in the root directory.
<br/>
<br/>
4 - You can now access the option menu in-game by pressing start.
<br/>
<br/>
5 - Still working on a solution for the touch screen sensivity. Stay tuned (once I get my ds back anyway...)

<br/>
Will there be support for saving in the future?  It doesn't seem like it'd be too hard to add :).
<br/>
<br/>
What about music?  I'm a music freak, and I've always like the soundtrack for Descent, lol.  Not sure if the DS could handle it with everything else that's going on, but it'd be a major plus in my book!

<br/>
<br/>
New things :
<br/>
<br/>
1 - Fixed touch screen sensitivity, now adjustable in the config menu.
<br/>
<br/>
2 - Saving and loading a game is now possible. Press start in-game to access the option menu.
<br/>
<br/>
3 - Fixed up the error handling to not throw an exception so it is possible to see the error message. Reactivated the exception handler.
<br/>
<br/>
4 - Better handling of texture uploading to VRAM, should could less slow downs.
<br/>
<br/>
5 - Better error message with the 'not enough strings'.
<br/>
<br/>
There's more that escapes me at the moment.
<br/>
<br/>
About music : Descent's music is in MIDI format, so to play it on the ds, one needs a software synthesizer (like fluidsynth) and some soundfonts. So it is unlikely that I can find enough cpu time/memory to do this but I'm looking into it none the less.
<br/>
<br/>
About shareware data files : They simply won't work. There are too many differences between the shareware and registered 1.4 version. Don't even bother trying.

If you have eight free channels, you can play each voice through one of the 16 hardware voices. Or you can make NES-style music using the tone generators if you don't want to load instrument samples into RAM.

Like I said on youtube, the sound lag is because of my digital camera, the sound is synched with the game in real life. It plays really good. I DLDI patched it, renamed it to _BOOT_MP.nds, threw all the files on a CF card, and chunked it into my DS with the movie player and it works like a dream.

<br/>
<br/>
I guess there's two versions, the one I dug up and installed to get the HOG/PIG files is only like 50MB big.  Needless to say, those songs would probably take up way more ram to play, right?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I just played the new version, and it's alot smoother!  Save game support is just what I asked for too, lol.  Good job.
<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought, couldn't you make an option to remove the auto-map on the bottom screen...  Then use that screen's CPU to play the music?  I'm pretty sure that's how the SNES emulators work on the DS.  You wouldn't really have to worry about syncing sence it just plays a single song through out the level.
<br/>
<br/>
Having the map on the bottom is a pretty awesome feature, but I really don't mind bringing up the menu to look at it, if it means you'll be able to play music...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Toma : I would guess there's a problem with either your card or the dldi driver you're using as the files seem to be okay from the debug.txt you posted except that it gets truncated. Maybe scan your cf/sd for bad sectors too.
<br/>
<br/>
For people wanting custom soft buttons, what I'm thinking about doing is having a text file describe them so everyone can setup there own (ie position, size, keyboard key, text/image from descent).
<br/>
<br/>
About music, yes there are 2 versions, one with CD audio (could be compressed in mp3, but would still take alot [too much imo] space) and the midi version.
<br/>
<br/>
Next thing I want to implement is a touch screen keyboard for name entry/save game naming/etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to add multiplayer but as it is I have no way to test it (only have 1 ds).

It doesn't take a lot of RAM to play a .adpcm or .gsm or .mp2 or .mp3 or .ogg file. In these cases, the game typically buffers about a second of sound from the memory card (32 KB if that) and decodes that in real time.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I wrote the music for Payk's DS game Wolveslayer (winner of the last NeoCompo! :D) and he had me do the songs in MOD format.  All the game has to do with MOD files is load the sounds used in the song at the start, then it only streams the note data (which is extremely small).  
<br/>
<br/>
I had the tunes in PCM format at first, but they ended up taking up too much memory once the graphics got past a certain point.
<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me like MIDI files would be much easier then MODs because the sounds are so tiny...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

MIDI needs a sound font. A program that plays a MIDI file needs to scan the song, look for all instrument change events (Cx nn) and drum note-on events (99 nn vv), and load the samples corresponding to each instrument change and drum note. That takes about the same amount of RAM as loading a MOD/S3M/XM file, except a MIDI sound font can more easily be ADPCM-compressed.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Except you have a little bit more control over how much you roll. I'd suggest the same for sliding up and down. I just had to switching from purely "keyboard" controls to "keyboard + mouse" so that I have roll left and right bound to Y and A, and slide up and down bound to X and B. I might have to tweak it again to just do "Roll on" and "Slide on" as it takes up less buttons that can be used for something else.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, despite figuring out the best control combinations, the game plays incredibly well. It maintains a solid framerate and is very smooth. Plus, it fits perfectly to the DS. I say this implementation is great and in such a short amount of time. I'm glad I finally got around to digging my Descent CD out.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

While sliding up and down works okay, banking left and right with the touch screen does not at all. Honestly, I think all would work much better if they worked in combination with the up, down, left, and right buttons. This would then make it possible to use these keys even if the function were bound to a touch screen button.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great job with the port, it works fantastic. Save/load works great, but it took a sec to figure out Start/Select.  I found a decent control scheme (I am left handed), except for one problem.  My controls are:
<br/>
<br/>
Fire Primary: R
<br/>
Fire Secondard: Y
<br/>
Slide on: A
<br/>
Accel: X
<br/>
Deccel: B
<br/>
Bank: &lt;-&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is two fold.  First is sliding via touch pad sensitivity doesn't seem to be same order of mag as rotation.  Do you think sliding needs a sensitivity boost over current levels? Second is sliding left-right works okay, but sliding up-down feels backward.  I will probably fix it myself, but posting trip report here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I know, that is why I would invert the slide where the slide is pulled.  This thing is not going to be hooked to other input devices, so making it intuitive with the touch screen is a must.  I wonder if any other keys do anything during slide on (like the pitch up key).
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe independent inversion of tilt and sliding.  I have not looked at the source yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
The "mission briefings" have their text go off the right side of the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
The text in the button config screens is misaligned, too.
<br/>
<br/>
I have the mouse/joy sensitivity all the way to the right, but it's still pretty low, IMO.
<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if it's because enemy AI uses quite a bit of CPU, but I was running 30 FPS at the start, and after killing a few things, I'm down to 20. I'm sure it's nothing that future optimizations aren't going to fix, but I thought I'd mention it anyway, since I didn't see anyone else saying what they're running at =)
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, also, would be nice if you could get to the options without having to quit the mission, unless I'm doing something wrong...which I very well may be, since I can't figure out how to save either.

For all those people having trouble patching to any version.
<br/>
<br/>
Go into your Command Prompt, goto the directory of your Descent files, put the 1.0 to 1.4a patch in there, and run "patch -ignoremissing", now put your 1.4a to 1.5 patch in there and patch it with "patch -ignoremissing".

You can find the necessary patch files here.

<br/>
<br/>
It should work! For some reason, a few versions don't like to patch the hog and pig files. Using the "-ignoremissing" command will ignore the files and patch them anyway! Also don't use the 1.0 to 1.5 patch as there are some problems regarding the music in that patch.

Thanks, your game loaded for me, which confirmed what I already suspected.  That the problem was in the save routine.
<br/>
<br/>
After discovering that I was looking at the wrong source file during most of my previous experiments, I tried one of the fixes I tried before (this time in the right location) and it works!
<br/>
<br/>
So if anyone else is having the same problem I was having with save files not working on Supercard carts, let me know, and I'll send you the fixed nds file.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, Kayvenm, if you're still reading this thread, here's how I fixed it.
<br/>
<br/>
I suspected that the problem came from writing odd sized blocks of data to the card, so I wrote my own custom fwrite function that breaks the data up into 256, 16, and 1 byte blocks and then calls the standard fwrite function on the standardized blocks.  Then I replaced all calls to fwrite in the save routine with calls to my custom function.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the code for the custom fwrite:

Here you go.  This one is pre-patched with scsd.dldi.  But you should be able to re-patch it if you need to use one of the other dldi patches.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it'd be cool if the keyboard was always available on the touch screen instead of just when you're saving or something so you could use lesser-used commands without remapping them... that way you could have a/b/x/y mapped to sliding up/down and banking left/right, and the touch screen could handle rear-view, flares, things like that.<br/>_________________<br/>DOT MATRIX WITH STEREO SOUND</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can do that by manually configuring custom soft keys in the *.csk file. And I must say that having the automap on the lower screen with touch buttons is far more useful that the micro keyboard being up all the time.

Out of curiosity, does DScent crash on anyone else resulting in a white screen on top and a red screen on bottom? I seem to get that consistently. Then again, I think that there's something wrong with my SCSD because my DS seems to freeze if it is on for extended periods (several hours) while the SCSD is plugged in (regardless of whether I'm running homebrew or not, it just has to be plugged in). I'm just wondering if anyone else has been experiencing this as it started happening with v1, but I never had a problem on the very first release of DScent (that was rock-solid for me).<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL
