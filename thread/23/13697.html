Your task is to conquer the whole game field by rolling dice. Each turn you may attack any opponent's territory from one of your adjacent territories as long as your territory has more than one die on it. When attacking, If you roll more than the defender, you win.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I absolutely love this game! This DS version is even better than the original. I never played it before but now I started I can't stop playing it anymore!
<br/>
The only thing that i'm missing from the original is that you can't see how many dices you got that will heal your on-board troops. I don't really know if you get what I mean, but if you don't, just say it.
<br/>
It would be even more awesome if you could update the game within 4 days because I'm going on holiday for 2 weeks on the 19th of july so it would be great if it's added by then.
<br/>
<br/>
For some reason one my DS froze up in the middle of a tense game. Pretty annoying.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Fantastic game. I've always enjoyed risk on the PC and never played dice wars before now. I've got to say this is very addictive. I've got a couple of suggestions for game play enhancements.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. Option of setting starting CPU AI (2-7) opponents. 
<br/>
2. Different game objectives for example.
<br/>
winner after 20/30 turns.
<br/>
winner for holding particular territory after 20 turns.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the good work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback! I want to emphasize that this is still a beta version, so bugs may occur. Exact descriptions on where the game crashes or goes wrong are more than welcome.
<br/>
<br/>
Spike, option for setting 2-8 players (both single &amp; multiplayer) is already in my TODO - game actually supports variable amount of players, it's just not configurable anywhere at the moment. Laurens, same goes for showing how many dice player got after each turn. Different game objectives - maybe, I have to think about it.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently I'm concentrating merely on the wifi &amp; multiplayer side, before working on anything else.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice game. Fun concept and nicely ported to the DS. The menu graphics is particularly well done. I have a few suggestions: the end turn button sometimes block your view of the lower left corner; it's a bit hard to tell blue and violet apart; and a button to increase the speed of CPU moving. Softreset and sleep mode support would be nice too.
<br/>
<br/>
I find the sound effect a bit unusual. At the beginning, it made me feel very uncomfortable(is this the correct word?). But now I am used to it, I feel it adds to the style of the game.
<br/>
<br/>
edit: it froze on me as well. I pressed the end turn button, the button disappeared, and the game froze. The last line in the console is &gt;&gt; CPU4's turn &lt;&lt;.  CPUs123 are dead, CPU4:10,54 CPU5:6,21 CPU6:7,24 Me:7,14. I'm using SCmSD 1.81, FM7, DS.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDSh" target="_blank">Nintendo DS homebrew on Wikipedia</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">w00t! Love Dice wars, was thinking about doing a mobile version myself. Keep up the good work!
<br/>
<br/>
A few minor suggestions:
<br/>
<ul>Some people might like an instant combat result rather than waiting for the dice to roll when it's not your turn. perhaps an options setting for this?</ul><ul>
<br/>
The raised territory effect when attacking is neat, but it is a little hard to pick who's attacking who. Maybe change the colours of the attacking/defending territory as well?</ul><ul>
<br/>
The combat result popup is a bit too prominent and makes it a bit hard to see what happened where. Maybe there's a better screen location for it, or maybe put it on the top screen?</ul>
<br/>
But these are minor quibbles. Really looking forward to seeing what you do with this :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think this port is awesome.  I agree with that there should definitely be a configuration option to decide how many players.  I think that's the #1 thing here.  Also, seeing how many dice you get it big too.
<br/>
<br/>
Awesome port though.  I think it looks fantastic, and the land raising is great in my opinion.  Excellent work man.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
The game can be fun to play.. though. I haven't really figured out the proper strategy yet..  But, it sucks if you don't have many dice left by the time you get your first turn.. ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry for the lack of updates. My development laptop broke recently and is currently in warranty service. Meanwhile I setup the dev. environment on a Mini Mac, but programming on a living room television isn't exactly productive.

The multiplayer side is still in the works, you can follow the progress through <a class="postlink" href="http://dicewars.drunkencoders.com/beta/" target="_blank">http://dicewars.drunkencoders.com/beta/</a> - there will be at least one more test round before next public release.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Meanwhile I've been on a vacation and haven't advanced much with the game. Things that need to be figured out and tested properly before next public release:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Stability issues (there's known and reproducable crashes in the game)
<br/>
2) Multiplayer issues (losing connections - however "hopefully" this is related to the same crash bugs)
<br/>
3) At least one more test round with multiplayer game mode when 1) and 2) have been cleared out.
<br/>
<br/>
When? Crossing fingers that would be rather soon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes. :) This is essentially how Dicewars differs from Risk. Not being able to place them makes the game more interesting in the end.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
