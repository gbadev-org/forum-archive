monome~ds v1.0 by GrizzlyAdams
<br/>
<br/>
Simple simulation of a monome 40h like device with some artistic license.
<br/>
<br/>
40h buttons: send midi keydown / keyup events 0-63
<br/>
40h lights : respond to midi keydown / keyup events 0-63
<br/>
<br/>
Channel buttons &amp; Up/Down DPAD: select current channel
<br/>
<br/>
Connection light:
<br/>
the small light at the bottom of the screen under the divider between the
<br/>
40h buttons and channel buttons shows the status of the connection.
<br/>
Yellow = Connecting
<br/>
Green = Connected
<br/>
Red = Disconnected/Error
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By default it starts in local loopback mode, press START to connect.
<br/>
<br/>
There is no config menu in this version and you are stuck with the first WFC profile.
<br/>
<br/>
Future plans:
<br/>
<br/>
 - glowing channel buttons showing data flow (33% = data, 66% = selected, 100% = both)
<br/>
 - actual emulation of a monome 40h / wrapper for running monome firmware
<br/>
 - wfc selection
<br/>
 - 2nd display-only monome
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: this program is NOT from, licensed by, or supported by monome.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To get the most use out of this you need a midi router program that takes data from the dsmi interface presented by the server software, and converts that data into control information for whatever program you want to use it with. I'm going to try to make a variant of the dsmi server software mixed with one of the 40h routers. There are bugs in the current build (the X button should send a midi all notes off event, and the ds should respond to the same to turn off all the virtual leds)
<br/>
<br/>
I was working on a 16x16 version but it has serious ui issues (its hard for me at least to tap an exact 12x12 area) and midi issues (midi only supports 128 notes, so it would either have to use something other than notes (like 32 controllers with 8 bits each representing an led / button (similar to how notes work for the 8x8 version i've released) I also considered having it use 4 channels, with it simulating 4x 40h's using the current midi interface.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I've only used this with reason, midi patchbay (to transpose a range of buttons to the range of events used by a reason device), and mighty midi (used to send midi events to the ds for the video I've got up on youtube):

 Also I've not tested your software with any of this yet, but I thought you may find it of interest.

I don't think it's supported yet. I have no idea how the original monome works but for it to work as a step sequencer with Ableton must be quite complicated to program.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've got sequencers, so I guess I don't understand the control signal path. The only way I can think of to ask is: on the video, the monome buttons are flashing off and on but you aren't touching the screen. How is that happening? Is there two way comunication between the DS and a sequencer on your computer? 
<br/>
<br/>
I got the wifi working and I know that's probably the hardest part of this. Just a little more help and I should be able to get it working.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In the video i've got it setup like this:
<br/>
<br/>
Midi Patchbay with a virtual input
<br/>
Virtual -&gt; DSMI [ All channels mapped to channel 1 ]
<br/>
Virtual -&gt; Reason [ Each channel mapped to a nnxt on reason's side ]
<br/>
Mighty Midi w/ ppkres.mid loaded -&gt; Midi Patchbay's virtual input
<br/>
<br/>
I'm still working on a decent way to edit mapping.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently you need something (Midi Patchbay or similar program) to convert the note events into something useful.  For Reason, alot (all?) of the button controls  are mapped to midi note events. I've not got it infront of me so i can't look it up at the moment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I go crazy and move my stylus fast over the buttons to trigger quick changes or whatever it is i'm doing.  midi ons that monomeds receives "stick" if i'm scribbling really fast making the noise e.g. stay green when I'm obviously not pressing them.  i'm using live and it's not sending any messages out but monomeds insists (by staying green) that it is receiving on message.
<br/>
<br/>
but it's not.

<br/>
BUG!

If you would, hell I'll send you $50 right now through paypal for this: incorporate the latest wifi configuration system from the source of DSOrganize so that we can set up monomeDS on the fly with different setups.

<br/>
a note to max/msp (and PD) users:
<br/>
<br/>
it doesn't seem to react to "velocity 0" note off messages but wants raw midi. send a message with "144 0 127" to a [midiout] to turn on button 1 and "128 0 127" to turn button 1 off. Button 2 is "144 1 127" and "128 1 127" etc.
<br/>
<br/>
print a [midiin] if this is confusing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
