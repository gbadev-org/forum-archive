You can transfer it all you want, but you can't play it. There's no flash-player for the DS, so if you want flash-content running on the DS, you're going to have to re-implement it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yup.
<br/>
Flash works in Animation frames, and timelines and things, whereas C programs jump around a single* bunch of code...
<br/>
<br/>
There's no way to recompile a flash thing to run natively, since it's all interpreted.  The best thing to do would to recompile Flash itself, and run it through that.
<br/>
<br/>
At first I was going to say "Not a chance.. Can't be done."  But then.. I remember someone doing this for MS Smartphones, way way back, and those used Arm processors, too.
<br/>
So, not entirely impossible.. Just highly improbable!
<br/>
<br/>
Best bet would be to start from scratch.  If possible grab the sprites and use those, but if you're going to do it properly you might as well use your own sprites, too, and try to build the game around the DS properly, rather than just dragging it over with oversized sprites and levels and things.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(*Obviously the C code could be split up over 1000s of include files, but in the end the compiler clumps it all together, whereas Flash keeps things as seperate individual clips.)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://AGameAWeek.com" target="_blank">A Game A Week.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The beauty of Portal is it's absolutely simplistic design. The gameplay mechanic is so simple that the game is easy to grasp and play for anyone. Its also very well thought out, making it an exceptionally fun game. Adding complexity to it may make it more interesting for some, but you will *drastically* reduce the number of people interested in playing it.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm actually of the mind to not employ the stylus at all, especially if it goes dual screen... as once you are on the top screen, there's no real way to control the gun...
<br/>
<br/>
oh wait. what if the top and bottom screens are wrapped top to bottom. So the moment you fall off the bottom of the bottom screen you emerge at the top of the top screen (which instantly jumps to the bottom screen).  That way you're always controlling the bottom screen. The top screen is just the other screen to get to.
<br/>
<br/>
IMO, however, there should never be more than two portals, too much confusion.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">another idea would be to have larger playing fields than the one or two screens can show. The top screen would then be a "level map" screen, and the bottom screen would show the player a bit more zoomed in, allowing you to more precisely control the character.. It would also allow for a bit more difficulty, rather than just clicking on the point you want the portal to appear at, you simply click in the direction and it gets shot in that direction and appears on whatever wall spot that was in direct line of sight.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

<br/>
not necessarily true... think of portal firing as firing a small chip. When that chip lands on a solid surface, it creates a new portal. IF two portals already exist it deactivates the oldest of the two portals. In a very slow environment, on step 3, firing the chip through portal one and having it go through portal two allows for portals one and two to continue to exist. The "third" portal is still in chip form after it has passed through one and two. As it lands and activates on the wall, it automatically deactivates portal one and recreates it on the wall. Now speed things up to near light speed and you have the same effect, though it seems instantaneous.
<br/>
<br/>
And before you go stating anything about the fact that Portal doesn't employ chips, this was simply an example idea. The idea still has merit if you consider a beam of energy passing through portal one and portal two before hitting the wall and moving portal one. After all, we don't know the physics of how the portals work, for one, and two, the beam of energy simply cannot move faster than the speed of light. It does its job immediately after passing through portals one and two.
<br/>
<br/>
btw, not trying to be argumentative if it seems as such. I've got a head cold right now and it's difficult to focus on the grammar of what I'm typing.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, even if what you say is true, and somehow I'm not understanding the physics of it, the point is the gampelay. The player never actually sees or uses more than one portal at a time, thusly the two portal mechanism remains.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

after rereading it still sounded argumentative, so I'm cutting it out...
<br/>
<br/>
You're right though, it does add a level of additional complexity in how the portals are employed, and that should be discouraged... I'm just getting excited about the idea and am running my mouth about something I have no real control over anyway, as I have no coding skills and this certainly won't be done by me, if it ever gets done.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">FYI: I have no intention of making this, whether anyone else is I have no idea but it would be amazing to be made. As for the top screen, maybe it could have tips? You know like the game has a bar at the top with a few words of advice, or a neat logo. As for controls, there is no need in using more than 2 portals :O. It would just get complex as many people have said. 
<br/>
<br/>
What would be a major barrier is the assignment for the 2 portals. Using the stylus all the time restricts you to only the Dpad and one shoulder button(Unless you use a thumb stylus). Possibly the shoulder button could be used for toggling between the orange and blue? In the corner could be a portal that changes colour according to what portal is currently selected.

If anyone does this I would definately get involved in it, be it graphical design, promotion, whatever. I have some graphics skills.

The main addition are pins that you can use to pin objects to the background or to each other (see the screenshots on the homepage for example uses).

Good idea, since this is confusing people a lot and often causes self-intersecting objects which are not treated correctly in the convex decomposition code.</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>automat wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">0xtob all you software plainly rock. got an iphone yet? :P</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

It's actually possible to create perpetuum mobiles since air resistance is not simulated. Just imagine the objects are on a strange paper planet without atmosphere :)

I actually thought about this! But then again, people would be disappointed to find out I was lying about the cake.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who had ideas for new features and thanks to pas for collecting them! As I said earlier I don't want to work on this project very long (I hope someone is interested in picking it up later). But since the resonance is quite positive (even girls enjoy it!) I might extend my TODO list a little. So I'll just take your list and pick the ideas I like:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">TODO:</span>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">- </span> bigger paper (scroll support, 4x the size of the touchscreen would totally reach) 
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">- </span> loading/saving of levels
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">-</span> non-closed shapes
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">-</span> moving shapes with the stylus
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">-</span> Rubber shapes
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">-</span> Maybe: Duplicating shapes
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">-</span> Maybe: on/off switchable grid that allows easier drawing
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">-</span> Maybe, but probably not: Portals
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your ideas! Feel free to suggest more, but be aware that I'm picky :)</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Add to that another oddity, what if you could shoot a portal through another portal?

Wow... guess you never played the "original" portal aka "Narbacular Drop"

A long time ago, before valve hired these guys to make portal they made the  exact thing you're talking about (for PC)

Personally I think Narbacular Drop would be a much better port to the DS :P

Markzilla, Just proved that a 2D version or portal is not only possible, but actual! I cant seem to find the .nds on that website, but it must be somewhere... right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

OMG, that rocked and sucked at the same time! (oh the story, the painful painful story) And yes, something like that would work beautifully on the DS... makes me wish to gawd I could code... *argh*
<br/>
<br/>
But now you've got me wondering exactly how a game like Narbacular drop could be played on the DS AND, use both screens, AND AND AND... *coughs 'n' sputters* need to breathe here, methinks.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

... But the portal controls are sub optimal and need some tweaking. e.g. one button would switch between red and blue portal and the other would shoot it (just like the current two keys do right now.) When shooting, the portals could automatically switched and only in situations when the players don't want that behaviour, they can switch the portal manually.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope that is clear enough, but I could PM you the idea in more detail, if you liked that.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the good work and I hope you'll add some more levels (e.g. cool user maps) to later releases! :^)
<br/>
<br/>
One remark about graphics consistency: In the top picture, the little guy has green hands and a dark orange line on the jumpsuit, but on the bottom picture, he's got skin coloured hands and a yellow line, which is a little distracting. ;^)
<br/>
I personally like the combination, where he has skin hands and the dark orange line. :^D
<br/>
<br/>
PS: I can't get it to work with my M3 Real, it hangs at the "DLDI Compatible" screen, which, for whatever reason, comes no matter what homebrew I start (with and without DLDI support)... but usually it doesn't hang. :^( Is there anything special I have to watch out for? I have tried to run it from the root, but it's still hanging.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

Do you know why that happens? For example, QuakeDS works just fine (when put in the root)?
