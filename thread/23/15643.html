<br/>
<br/>
This game was made a while ago!  The initial plan was to build a few "BOMB!" levels myself, throw it all together, and pop it online.
<br/>
I'm lazy!
<br/>
The bomb thing hasn't happened yet!
<br/>
So, rather than have it do nothing, here's the version so far.
<br/>
<br/>
The game contains lots of levels.. Count 'em!
<br/>
<br/>
The levels are from 2 sources.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Fraggle's Puzznix game on the Amstrad CPC
<br/>
2. The freeware game "Vexed" available from <a href="http://vexed.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://vexed.sourceforge.net/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully those guys don't mind be clumping all this together, and sticking it online!
<br/>
If they do, let me know..
<br/>
<br/>
Like I said.. I would've added, but.. That's not quite happened yet!
<br/>
Maybe some time in the future I'll pop back into this, add the bombs, stick in a level editor, and all the rest of it.
<br/>
We'll have to wait and see.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd appreciate at least a teensy bit of feedback, so if news sites could bother to write something like "Crap/Average/Good" other than just copy and pasting this, that'd probably help. (You'd think that would be the norm, but unfortunately not!)
<br/>
<br/>
As it stands, loads of levels, and plenty to play through.
<br/>
Should keep you going for a little while!
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
you should definatly keep up the work and not let it go under! considering the a mount of levels there is really plenty of fun involved too :D<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Kojote</span>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also working on a "Vexed" clone for the DS with 48 worlds and 60 levels for a total of 2880 levels.
<br/>
I just have to work on the graphics.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't add CPC levels but i'm interested with your .DSK file containing the 4 packs levels game, to add it to my website CPCGAMES =&gt; <a class="postlink" href="http://www.phenixinformatique.com/CPCGAMES/index.php?page=detail&amp;num=2398" target="_blank">Puzznix By The Fraggle</a>
<br/>
Packs C and D are missing in my version.
<br/>
Jayenkai, can you PM me a link to download it ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
