    <h4>#136843 - AaronBlood10 - Sun Aug 05, 2007 9:13 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok. I have an entirely new project in the works. I've always wanted an animation program for the DS because I love making animations, and I think it would be awesome to have one on the DS since it has a touch screen and would be great for it.
<br/>
<br/>
The program will be called Action Animation, simply because I couldn't think of a better name. I created a blog for the project <a class="postlink" href="http://actionanimation.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">here.</a> You can check there periodically for updates. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don't have any releases to speak of, but the reason why I am announcing it now is because I wanted to let you all know about it and see if anyone wanted to help or had any suggestions on the structure of the program or anything. If you do, you can shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:blood.aaron@gmail.com">blood.aaron@gmail.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm planning on taking it in small steps. First, I'll release a simple drawing program to test, and later, I'll develop that into an animation program and then maybe add colors, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and one more thing, I, being the typical poor college student, have only one device to test things with, GBAMP. So, if you'd like to help test with other devices you can send me an email also. 
<br/>
<br/>
Well thats all for now. I'll let you know when I have my first demo ready.<br/>_________________<br/>Animation program for the DS in progress

It's opensource and very streamlined. In the least, it could be a good tool to use as a model for certain functions animators may use/require.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Awesome idea, there is inchworm from flatblackfilms <a href="http://www.flatblackfilms.com/DS.html," target="_blank">http://www.flatblackfilms.com/DS.html,</a> but except from a movie I caught one of these days there isn't much info, take a peek it has a few nice ideas.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't fret too much about the drawing part, put something really basic up, ang go for the core, for drawing we have colors wich is great, stick to the point and improve later.
<br/>
<br/>
Decide wich technology to use, go 2D or 3D with the core of the program, check the advantages of one and the other, taking in mind possibility for layering and onion skinning wich would be great.
<br/>
<br/>
As for features, right from the bat it would be gret to have 2/3 layers, at least 2 would be great, background and drawing. U could pan/zoom the back, and anim on top layer. This could b eimproved to have scene support sp you could  make more complex animations and overcome memory limitations.
<br/>
<br/>
An export function to save the animation with good quality to the card will be a plus.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll try to sketch a couple of ideas for a UI, with an interesting featureset.
<br/>
<br/>
To refrase.
<br/>
Get to the point.
<br/>
Simple drawing tools to start.
<br/>
Layers, onion-skining (1,2 steps)
<br/>
Scenes.
<br/>
Good media management.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this gets up the ground strongly and develops to be a nice little app.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a DS-X, and will gladly test it, but with the  latest DLDI implemented , u shouldn't have much trouble. Focus on the app, not on the devices, the ones that really aren't that well supported, will mostly have to deal with it, or get a new card to run it. Otherwise, you will spend loads of time dealing with these problems instead of concentrating on app itself. That's my view on it at least.<br/>_________________<br/>DS-Xtreme 4Gb [Fw 1.1.2]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I personally would be looking for frame based raster animation (Like animated gif format), similar in function to a flip book. 
<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be cool for the option of doing smaller "pixel-art" style animations, alongside bigger images. Differences between the two would most likely just be the "painting" tools (Pixel Brush/Soft Brush) and also the zoom on the image.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, actually that would be the only way it would work, vectors would be extremely hard to implement, since the rely hevily on floating point calculations, which the DS is very weak at. Devs tend to rely on fixed point tables to overcome this.

<br/>
A nice zoom system and good palette management would be essencial for pixel art though.<br/>_________________<br/>DS-Xtreme 4Gb [Fw 1.1.2]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i agree that the drawing aspects of actionanimation should be a low priority at this point, since other developers are working solely on drawing rather than on animation.
<br/>
<br/>
aaron, perhaps you could team up with jesse (jens), the developer of colors!.  he's really nailed drawing on the ds.
<br/>
<br/>
i have a few ideas about where you could go with this, though they are not exactly the frame-by-frame drawing and onion skinning approach that has been discussed:
<br/>
<br/>
- create "symbols" out of small drawings, like movie clips or graphic objects in flash, that are able to be moved via keyframes and anchor points.  this way, "cut-out" animations could be made.  i think tweening the x/y/scale of a contained object would be easier than trying to tween drawn strokes.  maybe you could add in motion guides, like in flash, where you'd draw a motion path with the stylus and the object could follow that path over time.  if these objects could have their own little looping animations, that would be awesome.  symbols could be saved into a library that could be pulled from later, or even shared on the internet.  if there were a timeline, you could even record sounds with the mic or drop them in from a computer.
<br/>
<br/>
- make a grid (big blocks, user-selectable grid size i.e. 10x10 or 128x128) and a color picker, and fill in the grid blocks.  copy the previous frame and slightly change the colors/positions of the grid blocks.  zoom this grid out, or keep it big, to view the animation.  voila! a pixel animator.
<br/>
<br/>
i'd love to help dev. on this, but i don't know anything about coding for the ds (i'd be working on one myself, had i the knowledge :) ).  i'm a lowly actionscripter, myself, and i'm on a mac.  if y'all have any guidance on how i could start learning how to develop on the ds in my situation, please lemme know!
<br/>
<br/>
aaron, what do you think about my suggestions?  make sense?  i'd love to see any of the animation concepts.  remember that a very important aspect of this animation app would be to save the animations in a way that they could be replayed - at the very least on another person's ds after they download the animation onto their homebrew card, or (preferably) as an animated gif or something that could be viewed on a computer.  maybe make a companion app for the computer that can translate the ds animation file into a gif or video.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everyone, 
<br/>
Thanks a lot for the suggestions. The whole concept of the application is really starting to come together in my mind thanks to your ideas. I really want to implement a lot of the features described, such as onion skinning, motion tweening, and pixel animations. What I plan on doing is to release a lot of minor updates and adding features one at a time to gradually progress to a program with a ton of features. 
<br/>
As for the format, I've been thinking about using my own simple format with all the colors stored by numbers that could then be written on the flash cart. I also might add a way to convert these to a normal format to use on the computer, though I haven't figured out how exactly I'm going to do that yet.
<br/>
And just a heads up, I have a whole week off from school to work on it. So, hopefully you'll see a release sometime late next week.<br/>_________________<br/>Animation program for the DS in progress
