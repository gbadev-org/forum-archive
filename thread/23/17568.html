I hope the performance is a little better and the save bug was fixed.  Saves okay at the start of maps, but has trouble saving half-way through a map and also cannot overwrite existing saves, crashes to black screens.
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if instead of MIDI it could use MOD/XM files?  The MIDIs could be converted to MODs/XMs with compiled samples and work nicely?  Surely must be better than the MP3 method, at least, and I would be happy to take up that task if it's possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

are there any plans to fix the save/load bugs that cause freezing and/or add in any type of PWAD support like the unofficial 1.1.2a?

i think these things would be a more welcomed edition than background audio.

There's already PWAD support in there, all you need is hbmenu 0.4.0 which gives you the ability to pass command lines :) Get it from <a href="http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Homebrew_Menu" target="_blank">http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Homebrew_Menu</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I just tested this with Knee Deep in Phobos, I guess it should work with other PWADS too. Just create an argv file for your PWAD, I used KDiP.argv with this
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
dsdoom.nds -iwad doom2.wad -file KDiP.wad -save KDiP
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
it'll take paths relative to the argv file as well.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

When attempting to overwrite a save it goes into edit the save name mode and we never got around to implementing that. Press the A button, it will overwrite the save with the existing name. Should probably update the save name so you get the level name when that happens at least.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Brilliant with the keyboard and A to overwrite instantly, couldn't ask for any better.  It's always nice to save right before completing a map so that can go back to find undiscovered secrets or kills, now can reliably do that.  Thank you!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have copied the hbmenu stuff over, which works fine, however it seems to ignore the wad and defaults to the shareware version of Doom.
<br/>
<br/>
I have created a text file called KDiP.argv file with the line:
<br/>
<br/>
dsdoom.nds -iwad doom2.wad -file KDiP.wad -save KDiP
<br/>
<br/>
I have saved KDip.wad on the card
<br/>
<br/>
Is there something I am missing here?

There was something up with my doom2.
<br/>
<br/>
This is awesome thanks Wintermute.
<br/>
<br/>
I still get crashes on some more complex levels during the game and when saving. Is this more to do with the hardware not being able to cope, rather than the software.
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if the crashes would be less often with a 3ds. Does ds doom work with a 3ds I wonder? (looking for an excuse to upgrade....)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
The crashes may be related to corruption on the card. When I fixed the save game code I discovered some buffer overflows which may mean that games saved with older versions will crash eventually. It's probably best to start with a fresh SD card and see how it goes.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently we don't have any way to run code in 3DS mode and even if we do DS Doom will need to be rewritten. From what I've been able to find out the 3DS is opengles based and all the old DS/GBA tile/sprite based hardware is gone.
<br/>
<br/>
At some point there may be a 3DS compatible card which runs in DSi mode which will allow more RAM and the increased CPU speed. Right now I can't say - last time I tried my cyclo iEvo card it was blocked on the 3DS.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Wait, so all the DS's graphics hardware is gone? Then how does the 3DS plays DS games? Does it emulates the hardware?

<br/>
didn't DS homebrew already work through flashcards that work on the 3DS?<br/>_________________<br/>my blog:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I suspect that only applies to 3DS mode.  In that you can still use the DS's graphics hardware in DS mode, but porting the code to the 3DS would be more difficult than, say, porting from the GBA to the DS.
