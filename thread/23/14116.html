    <h4>#139884 - DekuTree64 - Tue Sep 11, 2007 5:44 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yet another little art program for DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Get the latest version (1.5b) <a class="postlink" href="http://deku.rydia.net/program/animanatee-1_5b.zip" target="_blank">here</a>
<br/>
And the <a class="postlink" href="http://deku.rydia.net/program/animanatee-1_5b-src.zip" target="_blank">source code</a>
<br/>
And the <a class="postlink" href="http://deku.rydia.net/program/animanateeconverter.zip" target="_blank">PC .anm to .avi converter</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The controls are explained in the program, but here are the basic features:
<br/>
- 2 layers ("BG" and "Top"). BG gets copied over when you create a new frame, so you can have a persistent background, or modify it as you go.
<br/>
- 60 color palette, which can all be modified.
<br/>
- Brush size up to 16 pixels, with optional pressure sensitivity.
<br/>
- Up to 10000 frames, or until memory runs out.
<br/>
- Undo/redo. Up to 32 levels, or until it fills its 128KB buffer.
<br/>
- Onion skinning.
<br/>
- Copy/paste (currently only copies full layers).
<br/>
- Zoom up to 16x.
<br/>
<br/>
NEW in v1.5
<br/>
- Onion skinning can now be turned on for previous frame, next frame, or both.
<br/>
- Onion skinning works while zoomed in.
<br/>
- Added halftone brushes.
<br/>
- Added 16x zoom level.
<br/>
- Added Merge Layers button, to combine both layers into one.
<br/>
- Added page buttons to save/load menu, so you can now use up to 100 slots.
<br/>
- Added Up/X tool selection. You can now switch between Fill, Eraser, and Dropper.
<br/>
<br/>
Changes for 1.5b
<br/>
- Preview is now loaded one frame at a time, to reduce memory usage (this was effectively cutting the maximum animation size in half).
<br/>
<br/>
Things I'd like to add:
<br/>
- One more layer.
<br/>
- Less stylus jumping.
<br/>
- A Mario Paint style music sequencer.
<br/>
- Playing a wav/mp3/etc. file along with the animation.
<br/>
- Recording a sound track with the microphone.
<br/>
- Stamps.
<br/>
- Save calibration settings to a config file.
<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to add to the list, or to vote for which of the ones on there that you'd like to see first.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow ! I?m really IMPRESSED ! I was able to quickly draw a Stickmananimation using this ! It has a very PC like interface - very professional. The 32 step undo function kicks ass aswell. Some Ideas you haven?t on your Todo-list:
<br/>
<br/>
*A way to copy whole frames or specific parts of a frame to the clipboard so we can paste them in at any time ( and maybe even turn them before pasting them in ? For easier Stickmananimations ^^ )
<br/>
<br/>
*A Zoomfunction to be able to easier edit the pictures  and to fill out some areas that are hard to get filled using the (a bit unaccurate) Filler tool.
<br/>
<br/>
* Giving the already filled slots another color than the unfilled ones (less overwrite accidents)
<br/>
<br/>
*And: a way to convert these animations to .avi or .gif. (Ask Masscat, he knows about this kind of stuff).
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and: once I got a problem, I saved my Stickmananimation, but the program hung up (no corrupted file after that, just did not save my progress</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The easiest film format to build by hand is an uncompressed AVI file. But these get big quickly which is why I made FlickBook's export application run externally on a desktop PC where large files are not a problem.

Wow, thanks masscat! That should save me some time fishing through file format info. Sadly I don't have much to offer in return, although if you want to add undo support to FlickBook, feel free to use/reference Undo.c from mine. It uses a fixed size ring buffer to store undo events, and basically just gives you a section of it to write stuff into. Not incredibly well written, but it's pretty easy to use, and works most of the time (still one bug that crops up now and then).

Yeah, I think I'm just about ready to get back to it. I don't know java or have any build environment for it though, so masscat's exporter will take a while to get working. But for now it looks like youtube can deal with .flc files, which should be easy to export directly from the program, and not as space-hungry as uncompressed .avi.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

Brush size will be done, but probably not for another week or two since I'm going out of town next week. Soft brushes aren't really possible currently since the image is 8 bit. It would be cool, and switching to 16-bit isn't that difficult, but because there are 2 layers, I'd have to add an alpha channel too, and that would start getting a bit more complicated than I want to do.

I've almost got it working outputting .flc files. I may do animated GIF later, but for some reason I'm really bad at coding compression algorithms, so it will probably take a while to get working.

<br/>
I'm hoping to do a small release either tonight or tomorrow. Probably only .flc exporting and button coloring, but if I have time I'll do the folder creation too.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

New features:
<br/>
- Load/save buttons are colored when full.
<br/>
<br/>
- When saving, it also generates a .flc file. When testing, I was playing them in QuickTime with no problems. Currently only using full frame run-length encoding, because I couldn't get the frame delta style to work, and I don't have time to fight with it right now. But that's basically what the native format is, so the files should be about the same size.
<br/>
<br/>
- Animanatee data folder is created automatically if it doesn't exist. Still always in the root for now. Also, QuickTime seems to have trouble playing files directly from the folder it creates, but the files themselves are fine if you copy them somewhere else.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

Here's few more feature suggestions:
<br/>
- While saving an animation, it could say something like "saving..." as now there's no feedback after pressing a save slot and it may take some time until the file is saved.
<br/>
- As already requested, variable brush sizes - color painting with 1px brush is painful, even if it's enough for stickman animations.

<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Hah, I just descovered an awesome feature-bug that abuses the undo buffer to copy/paste between frames. Just draw a box around the section you want to copy, and then while still holding the touch screen, use the D-pad to change to the frame you want to paste on. Then release, and undo.
<br/>
<br/>
Now if I add offsetting, you could temporarily duplicate the frame, offset, and then use this to effectively copy to a different place on the screen... or I could just add a proper copy/paste feature.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">wow, this is really fun to work with!  i just tried it for the first time today.  i really like the live playback of the frames while you work and add new frames, and the variable frame rate.  i admit the aliasing is a little rough, but i'm glad you're focusing on the animation tools for now anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
i have a (probably dumb) question - what does the "cursor" tool do?  i couldn't figure out what it was for.
<br/>
<br/>
i think the music sequencer would be really fun.  in addition, or instead of that, is it possible to load a .wav or .mp3 file into the project and have the animation run the length of that audio clip (probably with a limited maximum time range)?  maybe this would require locking in the frame rate once the audio is in there, which would be fine.  it wouldn't even need to export the audio with the video into the .flc (though that would be cool), since most people can handle laying down an audio track in post these days.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just for accuracy, like if you want to draw a single pixel in a specific spot. I might replace it with a zoom feature eventually though.

Hmm, that actually wouldn't be too difficult... and it wouldn't need a time limit either, since it could just stream from the card. Then maybe use the microphone so you could add voice/sound effects to make a full cartoon :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi deku, i have another idea for you:
<br/>
<br/>
since there is already a working fill tool, what about adding a "paint inside" mode for the brush?  something in which the first pixel color value that it picks up when you touch the stylus down is the painting boundary (like the range that the fill tool chooses to fill in).  this would be great for doing shading/highlights, working within solid outlines, etc..
<br/>
<br/>
is that fill tool logic not transferrable to a dynamic boundary while drawing?
<br/>
<br/>
maybe this could be re-used in a masking tool, as well.  add another, top layer called "mask", which would turn all pixels within the drawn area in this layer to the zero value in the animation layer underneath.  even better, make it toggle-able, so that either everything within the mask layer or everything outside of that shape is what is made invisible.
<br/>
<br/>
does any of this make sense?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">another idea attacked while i was typing that last idea:
<br/>
<br/>
what if you included the ds midi wifi tool in your application, and then connect things like the frame rate slider to midi values?  this would be really fun because you could then connect a midi sequencer and/or hardware midi knob controller and control the animation speed and other things externally.  someone could simultaneously build up a soundtrack or dialog sequence or bg music in their preferred audio software on their laptop or whatever while they draw out and refine the animation, and it should stay in sync.
<br/>
<br/>
i still like the idea of having the audio running on the ds (esp. with the mic input for effects, or the mario paint sequencer like previously mentioned), but this would be another solution if the processing required for audio playback would reduce performance on animanatee.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

After a bit more research on avi files, it looks like you can use RLE, and the header setup isn't much more complicated than flc. I'll probably switch to that for the next version to support sound, and hopefully be more friendly for a gallery.

Dang, sorry about that. I wouldn't put it past the .flc encoder to make a mess of things, but I've never had any trouble with the native format. It writes the frames out exactly as it stores them in memory, and in memory they're only re-encoded when changed, so it seems strange that so many frames would be messed up without happening gradually as you worked on it.

I definitely want to add mask/reverse-mask (only draw on a specific color, or draw on all except a specific color). This sounds like a similar idea, but masking to the region you started in rather than a color. I think the fill logic could be repurposed for that pretty easily.

To avoid creating a site that is too bandwidth hungry, use Youtube or similar to serve the video.

<br/>
It could work something like:

People login and upload videos to animanatee-gallery.com.

The back end of animanatee-gallery.com (computer or human) uploads the video to the animanatee-gallery account on Youtube.

The back end of animanatee-gallery.com (computer or human) adds the an embedded link to the youtube video into the gallery pages and makes the original video file (flc or avi or whatever) available for download (should people want to view the video in its original glory or on their DS).
<br/>
<br/>
Using Youtube also means that the choice of video format at the Animanatee end can be made for implementation reasons (ease and size) rather than if it is good for streaming or similar.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
lets say in the bg layer you have a drawing of an ocean, and in the animation layer you have a drawing of a sailboat.  in the mask layer (which is on top of the animation layer), i then draw a solid circle.  after that, anything in the animation layer that is underneath the circle in the mask layer is visible, while anything that is not under the circle is invisible, showing the ocean bg behind it.  if there was a mask toggle switch, that could be reversed, so everything outside of the circle could be visible instead.  not a practical example, i know, but i hope it's clear now.
<br/>
<br/>
i think that the drawing within a color or colored area is really more useful than layer masking that i've explained above, because then you could really quickly add shading and stuff that is difficult to do now without drawing over lines and shapes that you don't want affected by new strokes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmm, a per-frame delay variable. Does sound useful, especially for editing later, so you don't have to delete one of the copies and re-duplicate it. But for now you could set the frame rate to 12 while working on a slow section, and then go back and duplicate all the frames in one fell swoop.

That's the currently selected layer, so you don't sit there drawing on the wrong one and then throw your DS at the wall when you realize you ruined everything. The marks mean "one" and "two", but really they're just there to provide some visual difference.

Yeah, that would be even better. Since Flickbook already uses AVI, it shouldn't be difficult at all to support both. I'll leave it to you to decide wether to go with youtube or seperate hosting. If sound turns out to be the only problem with bandwidth, I could try writing a PC app to encode it as MP3.

I really have no idea on that one. Saving the .anm file is about as simple as you can get, so I doubt it's a code bug. I assume other DLDI apps are working properly, and you have plenty of free space on the card? And does it actually create a .anm file (or at least the Animanatee folder)? If it does make a file, email it to me and I'll see what's wrong with it.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else reading this has tried Animanatee with a supercard lite, let me know if saving works or not. Because knowing is half the battle.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

While i'm here a feature request would b to have onion skins colour coded. so the frame behind would be transparent red and the one in front (if there was one) would be green.

Could you email any corrupted files you have to dekuree64 [at] hotmail [dot] com? It would be helpful to see exactly what data is off.

As for the feature requests, monochrome onion skinning does sound useful. For keeping track of what's going on, and for ease of implementation (I'd rather not do software alpha blending if I can avoid it).
<br/>
<br/>
And a blank frame insert button would be handy, but I don't know if it's really worth the screen space when it only saves one tap on the clear button. Or are you clearing the BG layer too? Actually that could be a good option, to turn off the stickyness of the BG layer...

<br/>
Daninski finally managed to get some files to me past hotmail's ridiculously stupid virus scanner, and it seems to be the same problem (also the same as Dzozef ran into before).
<br/>
<br/>
I still have no idea what causes it, but from the looks of things, there's just a big chunk missing out of the middle of the frame data in the bad ones. Like it writes out the top 30 or so lines, then skips a bunch, then writes the bottom 30 or so. Then when it goes to decompress you get those lines it stored all up toward the top of the screen, and everything below that is left unchanged.
<br/>
<br/>
Each frame is written in a single fwrite though, so it seems very strange that only a chunk in the middle would be missing. And if the frames are still intact in memory after saving, then the only reasonable explanation I can think of is write errors. I guess for starters I'll try adding more error checking and data verification to at least report when it fails so you can try again.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

Actually not really. I did most of the work on the first day of vacation, then a little more the second day, and then did nothing useful for the next week :)
<br/>
But now I'm fully recharged and back in action.
<br/>
<br/>
I hate delegating the testing work to my faithful users, but since you seem to have the only reliable way of producing errors, could you give it a try on the new version and see if the error checking catches it? And more importantly, wether it errors 100% of the time on longer animations, or if it's just a random chance and will succeed if you try again.

I use a R4, which is a slot 1 device. A nice feature is that it auto patches DLDI enabled homebrew (other device can also do this) so you do not have to worry about doing it on your PC before copying the .nds file across.
<br/>
<br/>
Most homebrew (including Animanatee and Flickbook) does not require (or even use it if it is present) the addition RAM including in some slot 2 devices. So running from a slot 1 or slot 2 device will not make any difference as to how most homebrew runs.
<br/>
What can vary between devices is the speed at which they can read and write to their storage media (i.e. the MicroSD card in case of the R4). But this varies depending upon the device, the DLDI driver and the storage media within the device rather than which slot the device occupies. For example my R4 can read/write files quicker than my GBAMP (which is an old slot 2 device).

Looking forward to the onion skinning feature (colored would be even better like someone suggested)

the only thing I could think of is the ability to switch the layers visibility ON/OFF, this way we can use the background layer to have references in order to check shape consistancy over the animation.( and perhaps an arrow tool to move things ?)

May it be possible to store bmp files in a directory like /Animanatee/Stamps

it could open a menue like the one that opens when L is hold and you could pick a stamp by selecting it with the touchscreen.

    <h4>#150822 - sormint - Wed Feb 13, 2008 2:49 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I love this app! I opened Flickbook, was totally puzzled by the interface and tried this instead. It's so intuitive I was off and running right away. I have since figured out how to use Flickbook, and it does have some great features, but usability is No.1 because when you want to create a million frames of animation you want it to be as quick and straight forward as possible. Huge praise. I'm a big fan.
<br/>
<br/>
Though I'm a computer animator by necessity (can't draw to save my life) I did learn a little about traditional animation in school and there are several things that would make this application even better. Almost all of these ideas have been mentioned before, but some really need to be reiterated because they would hugely improve the workflow. Here is my vote for a wishlist of features in descending order of importance:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Add at least one more anim layer for roughing in your animation. This would be like the equivalent of using a light blue pencil to rough in your poses in traditional animation.  Then you could use the other layer to go back with a darker brush and do more careful drawings and simply turn off the rough layer when you're done. More layers would be even better.
<br/>
<br/>
2) Add at least one more BG layer - again for planning, only this one would be for planning your whole animation. For example if you wanted to draw paths for a bouncing ball or plan the arcs of your character's arms etc. More layers would be even better so you could have foregrounds etc.
<br/>
<br/>
3) Better onion skinning. It's got to be bi-directional. One frame in each direction should be bare minimum. More would be better. It would be extra cool to have different colours for prev vs next, or to be able to turn prev/next onion skinning on seperately (like in Flickbook) but that's gravy.
<br/>
<br/>
4) Zoom/Pan is needed if you want to see prettier drawings. Technically it's two features, but they really go hand in hand
<br/>
<br/>
5) A proper eraser. Painting over with white or BG colour is tough if the BG is anything other than a solid colour
<br/>
<br/>
6) Ability to drag a layer, or even cooler, a selected region. And/or ability to drag just one colour, but this isn't ideal. So you could reposition without redrawing.
<br/>
<br/>
7) Ability to insert frames (pushing all of the later frames back). Preferably for both new blank frames and copied frames - which brings us to #8...
<br/>
<br/>
8) A check box to set certain frames as key poses and then be able to flip between just those frames by adding a modifier to the D-pad or Y/A buttons. Would also be cool if you could toggle onion skinning to work for every frame or just the key frames.
<br/>
<br/>
9) Copy and paste to any frame. Copying is cheating, but animators are artistic cheaters anyways.
<br/>
<br/>
10) Draw on an arbitrary frame number and automatically generate blank in-betweens. This one really doesn't add any new function, just a neat shortcut.
<br/>
<br/>
11) An extra fancy feature would be to have BG layers that were larger than the screen's resolution so you could literally draw a large background and pan it across the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure there are some that I have forgotten, but I think this covers the main ones. Maybe look at successful pencil testing software that already exists and see what features they have: 'Digicel Flipbook' and 'Monkey Jam' are a couple of good examples.
<br/>
<br/>
So again, I LOVE your application. I like that I have the full screen to work with, but if I absolutely had to I could put up with a single row of tiny buttons if you couldn't fit all of the above features into the current pop-up menu. Flipping through the frames instantly with the D-pad is perfect. Without changing anything the application is great for straight ahead animation, but with the added features it will be possible to do really well planned pose-to-pose stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Here's a link to my first test animation: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj2QZiy2CfM" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj2QZiy2CfM</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
The only sugestion, just to add the others that made the same one. A "move frame to" or "copy frame to" function. It would be very useful 
<br/>
<br/>
As you are just one, a clever dude, but one guy doing all the job. A easier tool would be something like "duplicate frame to the end of animation". I mean when you're working on the 5th frame in a animation with 10frames long. The user would press a button to duplicate the 5th frame to the 11th frame of the animation.
<br/>
<br/>

About the homebrew, possible to add the possibility to export the animation into a animated .gif?

And for the memory limitation, I suppose it's the DS memory? With a memory expansion it's possible to make longer animations?

If this program produces an uncompressed AVI file, you can try opening it with Microsoft GIF Animator to save it as a *.gif file.  If that doesn't work, use the "SUPER" converter program.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But even if so, there's no place on the touch screen for buttons. I suppose I could add a way to configure the controls, so you could swap L/R with down/B for example.
<br/>
<br/>
As for building the source, you should just be able to type make in the base folder. The visual studio project is only for navigating the files.It uses tepples' GBFS, so you'll need to download that seperately, and modify the tool folders at the top of the makefile in the Art folder to point to it.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi DekuTree64:
<br/>
<br/>
Animanatee is a great program! Thanks so much for developing it. I have a suggestion that may or may not be plausible... BUT:
<br/>
<br/>
If it were possible to IMPORT an AVI and have Animanatee break the file into frames-as-backgrounds for the entire length of the AVI, you'd be able to animate ON TOP of already-existing animations. For example, I could use it to animate on top of a previously-filmed live-action music video for my band.
<br/>
<br/>
I know little to nothing about programming so I don't know if this feature is something that the DS system would even be able to handle, but if it could, it would make Animanatee super powerful for layered-type effects.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!

<br/>
that's unfortunately beyond my area of expertise. i'm not too well-versed on the inner workings of the code, i've just been thinking about a bunch of great ways that the program could be used if it were possible to code it that way. the only reason i suggested .avi is because i know it OUTPUTS .avi. i don't know much about the filetype itself. i just thought that if animanatee can handle 2 layers (background and foreground) in each frame, it would be awesome if there was a way to drop an .avi file on the microsd card from the computer, then import it into animanatee, (then maybe the user would select the starting frame rate of the .avi and the corresponding frame rate of the animation), and then animanatee would break the .avi into its component frames, assigning each frame of the .avi to the background layer, progressively, through the entire animation. then you could animate on top of each frame of the original .avi, and when you exported to a new .avi, it'd be exactly like the old one, just with awesome (hopefully) animation on top of it. i guess there would be no sound either, but that could be synced up later. it would be a great tool for creating interesting music videos.
<br/>
<br/>
like i said, i have no idea if it's feasible at all, but i thought it was worth mentioning!

I have a problem though. I have an animation that runs about 210 frames and when I load it up the final frame is corrupt. So when I try to export as avi, it gets to 90% complete and freezes. When trying to delete the last frame the first 10-20 frames become corrupt. I've also tried 'clearing' the frame but this crashes my ds and I have to power off. 
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyway to save my work? I spent soooo much time creating this animation and I don't want to lose it.

<br/>
I'm hoping this isn't as bad as some of the other problems reported in this thread and that there's some kind of work around to maybe sacrifice 'x' amount of frames to save most of the project.

So over the past 4 days, I've been typing away and added a whole bunch of new features useful for both animating and doodling still pictures (what I've been using it for most). Check the first post for the list, or just grab the file <a class="postlink" href="http://deku.rydia.net/program/animanatee-1_4.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Particularly welcome is that I got sick of trying to find that stupid undo crash and just threw out the old convoluted system and wrote a better one. Thus far all crashes I've encountered were minor and have been fixed, so hopefully there will be no more lost work from now on.
<br/>
<br/>
I also made a little <a class="postlink" href="http://deku.rydia.net/program/animanateeconverter.zip" target="_blank">PC utility</a> to convert .anm files to .avi, incase you forget to check the export AVI box when saving before you go to transfer to computer.

Found a bug that can be replicated pretty easily:
<br/>
--------------
<br/>
- Start a new project
<br/>
- Set the brush size to anything other than 1 pixel
<br/>
- Select the BG layer
<br/>
- Draw on the very bottom row of the screen
<br/>
<br/>
...you'll get major garbage on the FG/Top layer, and it gets worse when you switch the Tool selection screen on and off.  I'm just guessing: memory corruption because of the larger brush size 'leaking' past the screen memory? :/
<br/>
--------------
<br/>
<br/>
Also, would you consider adding a 16x zoom level, and maybe a dim grid guideline when zoomed in 8x/16x? This would be nice for pixelling stuff. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh snap. Fixed that. Bad clipping check. I wonder why it wasn't destroying the world when drawing on the top layer though...
<br/>
<br/>
I also fixed a crash when trying to preview an empty slot. And added an OK button to the load/save menu, so you just click a slot to preview, and then OK to load/save. Makes more sense than having to click and then drag away if you don't want it.

Nifty, this is why I love open source :)
<br/>
<br/>
I can't find where you download the .nds, but looking through the code and images, the key mapping screen is cool, especially combined with custom pens. And you could even switch the mappings depending on whether you're just sketching frames and don't need fill handy, or if you're coloring and don't need pen switching handy.
<br/>
<br/>
Undo would be another nice function to map to a key.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus then you could have both the drag tool and draw cursor available when zoomed in. It's been bothering me that I couldn't come up with a good a way to do both, and it's irritating using the drag tool to see where I am when pixel editing
<br/>
<br/>
That pressure sensitive pen icon looks like a halftone pattern to me, and reminds me that I should add tones too. Especially now that masking is in, you can do some nice shading easily with tones+remask. My brother is great at it, like <a class="postlink" href="http://lavalizard.rydia.net/oekaki2007/ButterflyCatcher.png" target="_blank">this</a><br/>_________________<br/>___________

You say you'd like to add a better saving system. I hope this means more slots. Especially with the previews it'd be really nice to have any number of slots. (or... at least 25, I suppose. Lots of animation tests I'd like to keep, and laugh at later)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also requesting a double tap to open a file. Right now tapping plays the preview and we have to click OK. It's be cool if we could just tap the slot number twice.
<br/>
<br/>
A quick update to the in game controls explanation would be nice as well. I didn't really know how to scroll the zoom window without a little messing around. 
<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate your work on this. I especially like the mask and remask features. And  it's great to be able to animate anywhere.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When zoomed out, it also lets you see where pixels will be drawn before you draw them. (Useful when trying to put something in JUST the right place) Although... I guess now the zoom takes care of that. 
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I just tried this and found what may be a bug, since it wasn't like this is the last version. If you use the cursor tool to see where the pixels will be drawn, the circle appears UNDER the pixels that are already there, almost like the Mask tool was on. It'd be cool if the cursor tool showed exactly what would happen if you release the button with the stylus still down. (So it would actually change depending on which Mask options were enabled) But if that's not possible, I'd like to see the "pixel preview" on top of everything again, since that's easiest to see.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think it would be better to create a new topic for this.

Also, DekuTree64, you said you wanted to implement tones. I suppose the color picker feature will be needed. I often feel the need for it now when drawing gradients or shadows and highlights.
<br/>
<br/>
And while using dragging while zoomed in it often occurs that the finger on DPad moves a little to the right/left and the frame switches. Does anyone else have the same problem? Maybe do the following: Down-Left, Down, and Down-Right activates the cursor/hand tool, and Left and Right switches frames? Or maybe something else?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Animanatee only has pressure sensitive width. In addition to the advice to calibrate above, you must also make the brush size bigger. Much like Colors!, pressure sensitivity in Animanatee seems to start at the lowest value, and increase with pressure to the current brush size. If the current brush size is one pixel, there's no change.

Actually this is more like an intermediate step before I go making some changes that will necessitate modifying the file format. Most of the feature requests here have been taken care of, plus a handy layer merge function. It's great when you can animate using 2 layers, and then flatten them and add a background at the end.
<br/>
<br/>
The next version will be 2.0, with 3 layers, 80 colors, and sound. Additional colors are just because I had to squish the palette box to fit all the buttons in, so I might as well squish it horizontally too :)
<br/>
<br/>
My plan for sound is a timeline view, where you can trigger .wavs and start and stop music (with optional loop), plus a microphone record mode where you can voice along with the animation. Microphone data will go into a companion .wav file to the .anm, so it will eat your SD card pretty quickly.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has other good ideas related to sound support, post them here and I'll see if I can get them worked in.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

And a feature request: Add an option for something like "R/L toggle" or "R/L hold" in the calibration menu.

Yeah, I was debating whether to make the eraser bigger than the brush. I guess the only time you need a tiny eraser is when doing pixel art, so maybe it should be same size at 8x or 16x zoom, and bigger 1x-4x.

But I'm picky, and it works with all file operations now. I request "confirm overwrite?" and "do you want to save before opening a new file?" dialogs for cases like that.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've noticed a bug (or maybe it's just my M3 lite's fault): first, touchscreen sensitivity doesn't save (it must save, right?...).  
<br/>
Second, sometimes (around 50% of cases) when I launch Animanatee, it gives a black screen for a little longer than it should (around 7 seconds instead of 1 maybe), and after that everything works fine except for when I click "open" or "save" it shows all slots to be empty, and when I click any of them it takes a long time for a button to become pressed which looks like loading, but they don't load in the end; it fixes after I save anything to any slot (and while I were choosing a slot for saving they were still empty).

it would be nice if this was updated to include more than 1 frame in either direction. 5+ would be a nice number. i am not an expert artist, and i suck at animation. i find that when i am animating something i need to see more than 1 frame back while i am drawing the new bit of animation.
<br/>
<br/>
many users have expressed to me that they are confused about the user controls. the app does have a learning curve, but one can figure it out just by toying around. however, it would be nice if with the next release you included a detailed "how-to guide." perhaps run the user through the creation of a basic animation, the controls, what the icons do, etc. hm, perhaps a wiki article set up for the application so users can keep it update.

Not only was I lazy and just loaded the whole preview animation into memory, but I forgot to free it before attempting to load the animation for editing, so it was basically cutting the max animation size in half.
<br/>
<br/>
Now the preview is loaded one frame at a time, so it takes basically no memory.
<br/>
<br/>
And to respond to some other questions...
<br/>
<br/>
Calibration is not saved currently. More laziness on my part.
<br/>
<br/>
Palette drag and drop: Yes, that would be cool. Copy, swap, and swap with pixel remap. Although pixel remap would be slow since it would involve decompressing, editing, and recompressing every frame of the animation.

<br/>
I did actually debate this. I decided to go with the current style because 
<br/>
a) the buttons are tiny so it's easy to miss and select the layer anyway, and
<br/>
b)when you set a layer invisible and then start drawing, it's obvious if you have the wrong one selected because you can't see anything.
<br/>
<br/>
The other way, you'd be able to turn a layer on without selecting it, and then start drawing thinking you're on the one you just activated, but you're really not.
<br/>
<br/>
If I wanted to be fancy, I'd have it select the layer if you're turning it on, and leave the selection alone if you're turning it off.

Gif: So many people have requested this, I may just give in and write it some day. Especially since I may never get around to adding sound, which was the reason I went with .avi in the first place.
<br/>
RAM pack: Since I don't have any hardware to test on, probably not. I'd rather do a swap file on the memory card to allow unlimited animation size anyway. But that will be tricky.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

Headspin, I found out that for ome reason or other, Animanatee runs just great with the NDeSmuME V0.5.0 (well, everything except for the saving)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#170301 - UglyMike - Wed Sep 16, 2009 9:21 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all!! 
<br/>
New user here.... 
<br/>
<br/>
I've been using Animanatee for some time now and it alone (or together with Colors! and Pocket Physics) is reason enough to buy a flash card (at least to me it is..) 
<br/>
<br/>
Animanatee is great especially with all the additional stuff added in 1.4 onward 
<br/>
<br/>
I had a look at Flickbook 0.3 too, but its lack of tools and its on-screen interface kinda put me off. Flickbook does however possess some things that blows Animanatee clear out of the water: 
<br/>
<br/>
1.Layers 
<br/>
Flickbook uses 'real' layers, not just that foreground/background setup used by Animanatee. The layers can be shuffled, locked, destroyed, made visible, visible only in onionskinning. DekuTree64's roadmap talks about a 3rd layer, but I would like to see first how it will be implemented. Currently, if I make a background and at frame 50 find out that I need to add/change/remove something from the background, I need to change the BG on each and every frame. I would like the option to have a static background that I can change at a single point and the change would become apparent everwhere.... (a further feature could be the possibility to 'bake' the background on a selection of frames ie make further changes to the BG pic NOT change the 'baked' BGs.) A third, removable layer would be welcome for motion paths, blueline sketches etc. I'd even like a fourth for eg giving depth to the BG (one fixed, one slightly scrolling) 
<br/>
<br/>
2. Copy buffers 
<br/>
Flickbook has about 8 copy buffers where either full frames or rectangle selections can be stored. Animanatee can currently only copy/paste an entire frame. The copy buffer in Flickbook allows one to store reusable elements to drop in on another cell. (eg a bouncing ball in a scene with some fixed elements: Flickbook stores the smallest rectange holding the ball and this can be copied and moved from frame to frame. Animanatee just cannot do this.) 
<br/>
<br/>
3. Multiple layers of onion-skin (up to 5). 
<br/>
Not really an issue as DekuTree64 has already stated his intention to add more. Flickbook also has a nice way of setting these.. 
<br/>
<br/>
Let it be clear that to me, Animanatee is clearly superior in day-to-day use to Flickbook. It is just that Flickbook has some functionality sorely lacking in Animanatee... 
<br/>
<br/>
As for the rest of DekuTree64s roadmap, I would prefer to see the sound part handled in a separate program, one that loads the .anm files and then allows a soundtrack/soundeffects/mike input to be created, the whole lot to be exported as an .avi but that's just me.... 
<br/>
The stamps thing seems a very welcome addition. All will depend on the flexibility of the tool (of course, just an import of a BG picture would already be nice) 
<br/>
If the option is there to import a small bitmap,it would be nice to have the option to scale it or to rotate it, so it can be used as an element in the animation. Another nice option would be to import a short film strip (or a set of individual frames) as BG 
<br/>
<br/>
Layers and copy buffers would probably require a screen of their own (L/R shoulder button?) 
<br/>
<br/>
Now that Masscat appears to be fully focused on his iPhone port (Flickmation), maybe Animanatee can increase the advantage it already holds... 
<br/>
OK, I better stop here before I write a book....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DekuTree, since you wanted to implement larger palette, I think it may be useful to make a feature to save a palette as a default. Setting all 80 colors from scratch every time would be a pain. I also feel the need of palette import function. I've been playing with Animanatee loading previews file after file, and while every next animation was loading I could briefly see a "glitched" preview of the current animation which used the palette of the next one already. I were surprised that those "alternative" palettes often looked much more colorful than the ones I created.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, you wrote you wanted to implement "stamps", what exactly did you mean? Will it be Mario Paint-like?
<br/>
<br/>
It'd come handy to have some kind of instrument which would paint the hole screen with a chosen brush on touch, as if we had a huge brush the size of the screen to paint with. It'd help to do many things faster, especially to replace a color by another one in a frame.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would anyone have a few of their Animanatee ANM film files to share with me? I wanted to know if anyone could send me a few of their raw files to load onto my DS. I am happy to share few as well.  If you need help copying the ANM , let me know; however, when you save an Animanatee animation, they will be saved on the flashcard?s SD-card in the directory with .ANM files with file name ?Animationxx.AVI? (with the xx corresponding to the slot-number where your animation is stored.) You can then just transfer it to your PC via a card reader.  Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The project seems to be on hiatus now of course, but dekutree64 seems to show up sometimes and work on this project in spurts. 
<br/>
<br/>
So here's something I came up with for the next time that might happen: 
<br/>
<br/>
It's antialiasing using the mask color.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, I select gray as my mask color. Then I tap the mask button until it turns into "Alias" or something like that. I select black as my draw color. When I draw, the edges of the black brush are gray, to blend in with the default white background. I could also set my mask color to yellow and use orange, or colors that don't even make sense for anti aliasing like teal as the draw color and black as the mask color. 
<br/>
<br/>
Let's now assume gray is the mask color, and black is the drawing color.
<br/>
<br/>
When drawing, the outer part of the brush (the gray part) would be masked by the black part. (so the outer antialiased parts would never color the main line). The black part would simply draw over everything as is normal when no mask options are selected. This would allow for 1 step antialiasing while still working in the constraints of the palette.
<br/>
<br/>
Even if the background color changed (say, after the pencil test phase), the user could just remask the antialised pixels with a color that would blend better.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: And just for the heck of it, I'll second people asking for a "stamp" or import BMP option. Sometimes I'll use this program to sprite out and animate a beat 'em up character for a game. But if I create a character on computer, I can't animate them using animanatee. (And... my workflow for animation is actually so much better with it.)
<br/>
<br/>
I don't care if they end up imported with the wrong palette. I don't care if the image that must be imported needs to be a specific size.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, 2 years have past and here I am again...
<br/>
You might remember that I made a small Animanatee manual; along with a simple beginner's tutorial. (also an alternative roadmap proposal, but that is a bit whishfull thinking now....) 
<br/>
<br/>
Wel, the site I used to host the files disappeared a long time ago. (along with all Animanatee related activity apparently....)
<br/>
<br/>
I have now a new webpresence and seeing Animanatee is still (for me) the best animation homebrew on the NDS, I decided to host the manual again.
<br/>
<br/>
You can find the site at <a href="http://www.uglymike.net" target="_blank">www.uglymike.net</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of you will still find the Animanatee info usefull.
<br/>
Feedback would be appreciated. (an easy form is provided)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">UglyMike, I don't think I've ever used AniManatee, or viewed your manual for it, but I thank you nonetheless for keeping your documentation alive.  That mentality alone is admirable.  I've seen too many GBA/DS sites disappear lately (often without archive.org backups) and it's refreshing to see that some people still care about such historical matters.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
