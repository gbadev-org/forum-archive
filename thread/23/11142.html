<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Official Release (95%):</span>
<br/>
DSLiveWeather ?<span style="font-style: italic">Vesper</span>?
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Download URL:</span>
<br/>
[url]ahsodhasodad[/url]
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Information:</span>
<br/>
DSLiveWeather is very complete. Eventhough the progress still states that it?s at 95%, all the features that I originally planned are already implemented. The remaining 5% are probably the <span style="font-style: italic">WiFi Configuration</span> that allows the user to catch weather information on-the-go (connect instantly with free hotspots).
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Changes:</span>
<br/>
- Added reset-to-menu icon (that will save the brightness on exit).
<br/>
- Press key X to cancel a connection attempt.
<br/>
- Fixed the time-display in the Currently-tab.
<br/>
- Fixed the flickering text.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Installation Notes:</span>
<br/>
- Download DSLiveWeather.
<br/>
- Copy it to your homebrew device.
<br/>
- If your homebrew device supports FAT then DSLW can load and save location data known as Location Profiles and downloaded weather data, however, you have to create a directory named ?DSLiveWeather? in the root directory.
<br/>
- When you start up it?s important to see ?DsWifi ready!? and ?LibFat ready!?.
<br/>
- If you see ?DsWifi failed!? then report this as soon as possible.
<br/>
- If you see ?LibFat failed!? then check if your homebrew device is supported. If it?s any newer than Supercard Lite, you can expect failure. Also, I repeat: you need to create a folder in your root, named EXACTLY "DSLiveWeather". If you don't have that folder, you CANNOT save.
<br/>
<br/>
- Press SELECT on each tab to see the Help message for that screen.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Known Bugs</span>
<br/>
- Some devices aren?t supported yet.
<br/>
Please report any bugs that you find so I can remove them ASAP.

    <h4>#101481 - Liter - Tue Sep 05, 2006 9:17 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, first things first - Lick, I think you need a faster server. Yours is very slow right now and highlights my earlier concerns about having to connect to your server - speed issues will only increase once many people start using your great little program. Mirrors will of course help. :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the date and time at the top of the screen - is this the time of the last data update *on the DS*, or is it the time of the last update *from the relevant weather station*?
<br/>
<br/>
As mentioned in an earlier message, the sensitivity of the left/right black arrows needs to be increased a bit to the left and right of the relevant points. It's too easy to 'miss' the arrows and the speed of response is also slower when viewing the Currently screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be possible to enable the user to cancel a connection/update to either the access point or the relevant server of yours? This would then get around the problem of the DS being locked up for ages while it tries and tries to connect but can't because the AP or your server is unavailable.
<br/>
<br/>
Which WiFi setting does the program use? If it defaults to the first one (out of the three) would it be possible to allow the user to select the second or the third?
<br/>
<br/>
A minor issue thanks very much for implementing my suggestion of putting words in brackets the UV Index, Pressures, etc - however, on my current test locations the pressure is steady, and you have written that as 'steady' - it might be worth making sure that all report words start with a capital. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Not meaning to criticise, but you DID want feedback. :)
<br/>
<br/>
It's very good though and I for one think you're doing an excellent job. Well done! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#101483 - Liter - Tue Sep 05, 2006 9:22 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And some more - I really like the fact that it's possible to switch between Celcius and Fahrenheit by pressing on the screen, but if selecting the large C or F under the weather graphic there is no response. I feel that the sensitive  area should include C or F as well as the actual temperature.
<br/>
<br/>
Why is the wind direction displayed in Degrees? Can in not be displayed as compass directions as used to be the case please?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And some more ...........
<br/>
<br/>
Just a repeat of some earlier questions from yesterday:
<br/>
<br/>
If an unknown (or no) location ID is given and the tick clicked for the forecast, why is: 'There is no Location ID!' printed multiple times on the top screen? Why not just print it once?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, will you be adding a list of stations so people don't need to go online with another machine first to find their codes?
<br/>
<br/>
I still think that, eventually, it would be nice for you to display a map of the world where people can then zoom in and tap on their location with the stylus. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
One point I totally agree with you is the server speed!!! It took like 10-15 sec to retrieve the data when compared to the 3-6 seconds before.
<br/>
The problem is that now you're using 1 server.
<br/>
<br/>
Although this urgent problem everything is fine for me the C/F feature etc..but pls work on the speed issue cause that's way more important right now.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">D: The temperature is in... CELCIUS!  Here's an idea, maybe some way to detect what code was entered.  Like if the code starts with "us", then the temperature is output in fahrenheit.  Same goes for any other country that uses fahrenheit... which I don't think is any :P
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: NOOOOO!!!!  km/h!!  Might want mph to be a change too if the code starts with "us" :P
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 2: oh... you tap the screen and it changes XD  Well, you could use my suggestion for which measurments are the default to appear :P  But it should be mph instead of m/h.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 3: ...you're measuring wind direction in degrees? O_o  Try N, NE, NNE, ENE, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 4: I've been meaning to say this... sadly enough, 32 characters for a profile name isn't enough. "Cleveland/Burke Lakefront Airport" is 33 &gt;_&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 5: I FOUND A GLITCH!!  In the Profile name, if you take up all 32 character places, the first 2 digits of the location ID appear at the end of it O_o
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 6: uh... I don't know if you're already doing this, but you should probably save the weather reports to the ram, and then have them save to your flash card device when shutting down or something like that.  It could give your card quite a bit more life, expecially if you ever get anything like radar, cause I reload on those a lot :P
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 7: A small text error, in the "Currently" tab, if the city has a "low" letter like a lowercase g, the g gets cut off.  Try it out with Tallmadge, OH - usoh0940
<br/>
Also, the y in "Humidity" is also cut off a bit.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 8: I just noticed this, why aren't you using sub-pixel text for a selected tab's name?  The background is white if it's selected.
<br/>
<br/>
(BTW, usually the more I like something, the more replies/edits I'll make.  And I just made 8 edits man! O_O)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 9: now this is just nit-picking, but it's annoys my eyes and possibly others. &gt;_&gt;  The text on the top screen is RIGHT next to the edge, making it annoying to my eyes mainly with the capital Cs in "Connecting".  Just 1 pixel to the right wouldn't kill ya, would it? &gt;_&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
First I would like to thank you for this homebrew. It's very usual for me, because with it I know which weather it is on which airport, and this is fine to know if I can fly there or not.
<br/>
<br/>
I only found a bug : The humidity. Try with "Namur" today 6th September ( BEXX0015). It says "58%" of humidity. But on my real meteo station, it says 19% 0_o . With 58%, weather should be overcast. But there is a sun without clouds today 8-)...
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if it was possible to convert the pressure unit IN to hPa when I touch the bottom screen... =) And I hope "Forecast" fonction will be soon on use : )

You sure you created a folder in your root named "DSLiveWeather" ?
<br/>

By the way, when libFat supports directory functions (which is right now, but DevKitPro that contains libFat isn't updated still) I will automatically make the folder for you so you don't have to complain about it here. :Pppp<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">@ trooper: check your Weather.com Location ID. It's probably wrong. You can test using 'NLXX0002' (Amsterdam).
<br/>
<br/>
@ retrohead: hmfffs... The profile data is raw data, so it's very hard to 'manually edit' it if you're not a programmer. Here is the structure:</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">    char profile_name[33];
<br/>
    char location_id[9];
<br/>
    char server_domain[33];
<br/>
    char file[33];</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Just dump this structure 64 times to a file (if you're a programmer).
<br/>
BTW, You have the Aestus release, right?
<br/>
<br/>
@ Dannon: this is really weird. It seems like you cannot create a socket to connect to lick.huuf.net. What Access Point are you using, are you sure that WiFi profile #1 works, when did you buy the DS, have you flashed it?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Lick on Thu Sep 07, 2006 7:23 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

#Faster server: I don't think it's that big of a problem. I think I was unclear about the one-server-setting thing: I meant that you can only set 1 DSLW-server for ALL profiles, instead of every profile having its own DSLW-server. This is easier if you use multiple profiles. You can still choose which server you want to use (later, when that other servers script is updated). And speed is not a big issue, the longest time I ever had to wait (between connecting to DSLWserver and display processed data) is under 5 seconds.
<br/>
<br/>
#Time displayed: it's the time of the last update on the DSLW-server cache. The serverscript automatically caches the weather data and updates only when it's allowed. Weather.com has strict rules about update frequencies and so I -HAVE- to cache the data. The current conditions are only updates every half an hour. (Forecasts are updated every 2 hours, but that's for the future.)
<br/>
- I'm going to make this a bit clearer, somehow.
<br/>
<br/>
#Profile arrows: have you tried holding the stylus on the screen (instead of tapping the arrows)? It's designed for you to hold it. [I don't want to change this to tapping =(]
<br/>
<br/>
#WiFi cancelling: I can cancel AP-connectionattempts but I can't cancel connects to the DSLW server. It's actually the best how it is right now. 
<br/>
<br/>
#Wifi profile selection: I was thinking of this actually. Perhaps I'll write a startupscreen that asks for AP-settings. I have to see if this is possible though. Thanks for this suggestion!
<br/>
<br/>
#Capped text: yes I will change that at the server-side. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
#Conversion sensitive area: Done.
<br/>
<br/>
#Degrees: will make it "NE (deg)". I can't get ? to display.
<br/>
<br/>
#Multiple print of "No location ID": Fixed.
<br/>
<br/>
#Location Search feature: Perhaps perhaps. First things first ;)
<br/>
<br/>
#Worldmap: I'm thinking more of a text-based search. Continent -&gt; Country -&gt; City, like yahoo's weather page. A fullblown map would be cool yes, but luxurity. 
<br/>
<br/>
@qhaxaq: 96% of the users were using this server in the previous versions, so it has always been 1 server, actually. =P But like I said, I think I was a bit unclear about the 1 server-thing. It means that you have to configure the server only ONCE, isntead of for all 64 profiles.
<br/>
<br/>
@Nintendo Maniac 64:
<br/>
#(Edit4)Profilename too short: you'll have to live with this (super) little limitation. If I allow more space, then the loader will stop working hehe. Saving to FAT is just dumping memory actually. I don't want to make it any harder.
<br/>
<br/>
#(Edit5)Profilename glitch: somehow, I can't reproduce this on my system. Is it always like that? Could you post a photo?
<br/>
<br/>
#(Edit6)Not save to FAT 10000 times: any ideas how to solve this without using SRAM? I'm thinking of another button.. =D
<br/>
<br/>
#(Edit7)Letters not drawn completely: I made the font-background transparent.
<br/>
<br/>
#(Edit8)Subpixel for tabname: I don't see a need for that actually..
<br/>
<br/>
#(Edit9)Consoletext too close to edge: I moved it 1pixel right. The letters leftmost will lose 1 pixel, but as I don't use those that often..
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the comments and suggestions. As you see, not everything will be applied, but I am <span style="font-weight: bold">really happy</span> about the interest you guys have in DSLiveWeather. To be honest, I want to move on to the next project XP but you guys keep me holding on to this and wanting to finish this. Keep on posting!

So if it can't connect for ages basically the DS is locked up and 'useless' (unless you power cycle it). Which is a pain.

Yes, but if you use a map then it's a GUI and it would therefore be MUCH easier to use than some text based utility which would involved more tedious 'typing' with the stylus.

<br/>
<br/>
@ Liter -
<br/>
<br/>
A minute is indeed long man! Where does it hang? connect to ap, connect to dslwserver or receiving data? or are they all slower than normal?? 
<br/>
How fast can you connect to lick.huuf.net from a PC with the same connection?
<br/>
Joke: were you downloading pr0n? =P
<br/>
<br/>
I have the buttons time-limited based on - frames. This might be slower if DSLW isn't running 60fps (which it should). Perhaps it's a memorycard-speed problem because it runs at the same speed on my hardware. I'm not sure though.. What speed is your memcard?
<br/>
<br/>
Wifi-hanging is a problem on a lot of ds homebrews. It's just that I can't control it once it's 'inside DSWifi code'. I'm not sure if I can connect asynchronously (I suppose I can though, cause commercial games do it async too). But yeah, fixing this costs a little more time that I actually wanna spend on forecasts.
<br/>
<br/>
The "Textbased Searching" would actually be following "links" (or selecting from a list). The map would, again, be very time consuming to write. Hehe.. We'll see, will see.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Apparently people haven't figured out the format for the weather code :P  It's like this:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[2-letter country abriviation][2-letter US state abriviation, xx if not in US][4-digit number of the city like it's in an alphabetized list of cities for that country]
<br/>
<br/>
So for something like Cleveland, OH, it'd be the following:
<br/>
<br/>
usoh0195
<br/>
<br/>
It's in the US, so the first 2 letters are <span style="font-weight: bold">us</span>
<br/>
<br/>
It's in Ohio, so the second 2 letters are <span style="font-weight: bold">oh</span>
<br/>
(If the city is NOT in the US, the second 2 letters are ALWAYS <span style="font-weight: bold">xx</span>)
<br/>
<br/>
If all the cities in Ohio were on a list from A-Z, it'd be the 195th city.  But you always need 4 digits, so you'd need to add zeros before the number to get 4 digits.  So the last 4 digits are <span style="font-weight: bold">0195</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Using this method, you can always eventually find a city you're looking for through trial and error.  Also, US zip codes work :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Only a small D-pad bug: Settings tab,circling through profiles WITH D-PAD makes the four headlines (Profile name,Weather.com Location ID,DSLiveWeather Server,File) dissappear,and I have to press the Currently tab and then back to the Settings tab to make them appear again. Bug cannot be reproduced using the stylus,pressing on the profile arrows.
<br/>
<br/>
Retrohead,why don't you try formating the card,maybe it'll fix it,just a thought.Really strange,btw.

Lick,there was indeed a small red pixel bug,especially with the number "4".
<br/>
<br/>
You've done an excellent work with this app.Feels so professional.I'm looking forward for your next project but it'll have to wait untill DSLW becomes perfect! And that includes the Forecast tab,some more graphics (time to use the upper screen too?) and a code-search,which,imo,if GUI-based,would rocket DSLW to even higher levels.<br/>_________________<br/>He who laughs last, obviously didn't get the joke.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Against all odds..
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Underground release</span> (please don't slip this beta out of this forum topic, or this build will magically corrupt your cards! Hehe..)
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://lick.huuf.net/DSLiveWeather_AperioBeta.nds" target="_blank">beta</a>
<br/>
- Added forecasting (with same graphics);
<br/>
- Loading is still automatic at start, however saving is done manually with the START button in each tab;
<br/>
- All profiles are downloaded at once for the specific tab: if you download in Currently, then all current data is updated. If you download in Forecast, then all forecasts are downloaded!
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I'm most proud of the last feature! ;P 
<br/>
The final release of Aperio will include the moonshell FATlib.
<br/>
<br/>
Report any bugs or requests!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Works nicely for me! Forecast working although I had to click the green check mark to update the current weather (as usaul) but then had to click it again to update the forecast. Maybe you could make it update everything with one click of the check mark or the 1st time you connect to your AP. Also is there a way to make the default degree measurement to F instead of C. Not a big deal just would rather not have to click on the screen to change it every time I turn it on or change tab windows. Awsome work though, really enjoy it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Updated to do list:
<br/>
- Replace fatlib with a more cross-brand compatible one.
<br/>
- Display wind direction differently.
<br/>
<br/>
DeVS: you -should- only have to switch units once. Changing tabs won't change the units as well.
<br/>
I could make the current condition and forecast batch together, however, in a testbuild I found that rather stupid working so I reverted back to having 2 seperated download-procedures.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot for testing!!

I have to change it every time I turn it on to make it F. It's odd cause sometime it changes from F back to C when I change tabs or update the weather/forecast vie the AP. Not always but every few times. Any way for me to force it to be at F at boot up?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by DeVS on Thu Sep 14, 2006 10:27 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

DL the file above and put it on your SD card no patching needed.

Next step while the SD card is hooked up to your pc make a folder called DSLiveWeather (that was the attached folder in the post i gave) on your SD card.

That is it. You need to get the weather.com code, see my last post on this thread.

You know in this version of DSLiveWeather it takes less time than the previous version to connect and retrieve the data, so that is good. Nice forecast feature I love it!!! 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BTW: is the percentage in the forecast page the humidity??
<br/>
<br/>
AND: I noticed that it does not always update the data correctly, because right now on weather.com the humidity is 94% and on my DS it shows 100%.Even for the temperature etc..maybe a glitch somewhere??

Nice job of the settings locationID in adding the weather.com to the title! Should help with the issue. It would be could to see a help/about button page to show people the version and how to get the weather.com id. This is not a big deal, only a suggestion when it is running 100%.

<br/>
For the not-so-near glitches, probably the stylus jumping artifact. I will need to implement the hack Padrinator made, however, it's a big hack. 
<br/>
The nearer glitches are probably just the lack of 'insensitive padding space'. The  whole field is one big sensitive grid, without ANY pixels between the letters that are free. 
<br/>
As long as you push the stylus hard enough with 70% of accuracy, you'll get the right letter. ;) 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking of adding Help text for the people having trouble using the application. Definitely something to look at, seeing how often the question repeats.

Eww.. Nasty bug. Yeah, if the text is too long it will just go 1 pixel lower, starting at the left side. That's because the screen is one big continuous pixel buffer. Thanks for reporting this. I will either give the more horizontal space, or shorten those terms (given by weather.com).
<br/>
<br/>
I actually like the way the keyboard looks and works. For many people, a PC keyboard is more comfortable. However, I think it looks really ugly and small and will never be the same since you don't have 10 fingers but just 1 stylus. Hehe. The current keyboard is more open and spacy, doesn't do all the characters but only the necessary ones.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the news though, I think I'm going to check it out, see if I can get some nice techniques from the source. (Really nice of DragonMinded, by the way.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ow true, I forgot to mention:
<br/>
- The current scroll speed is not as fast as in the beta.
<br/>
- I'm trying to get timing to work so the 'Updated x min ago' really works as it should: display the real minutes after you fetched the data. E.g. it should display 60 minutes an hour after you got the data and 120 after two hours.
<br/>
- The time of the location will be put beneath the location, just like the weather status. This is only in the Currently tab.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, people who saw my other thread (in DS Programming), I could not implement REIN fatlib because it requires an older version of DevKitPro. Guess we're back to waiting for the next release of DevKitPro (that includes the newer libfat by chishm!!!!)

I only possess a Supercard miniSD. The thing is, card-support depends on libFat which is a library that I use in DSLiveWeather. It's part of DevKitPro, and as long as there's no release, I will not have support for newer cards. Really bummer that Lite support is already in the CVS (versioning system), just that they're waiting (dunno for what) to release it for so damn long.

Hmm.. I think I'm going to add Wifi Access Point selecting, if it is possible. That way it's not necessary to use the WFC profiles (still an option, though) but you can connect to random (free) hotspots. On-the-go weather for the win! =)
<br/>
<br/>
I can't think of anything else to add, that's also within the realistic range. I think I'm going to move on to the next project, and perhaps later on get back to DSLiveWeather, I'm not sure yet. In any case, I'll release builds in the future to support newer cards.

Mubb, apparently all Lite devices aren't supported. Some can load the files however, you might want to ask somebody to dump profiles so you can load them. Just put 'profiles.b' into '/DSLiveWeather/'.

Even though I started this project at scdev.org  it has grown to MANY sites in the scene now. Hopefuly we can continue this project for other homebrew devs down the line and rotate which scene site host it each time. We can set a real example with our homebrew scene by showing that we support our devs and really apreciate them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">He made a developers post about figuring out which code the DSL uses to actually store the brightness level (e.g. going to the menu, setting it to 3 and then the game (assuming it doesn't have its own settings) will be at that brightness..  it's also the info Moonshell uses by default for its brightness setting).  
<br/>
<br/>
So, instead of just adjusting brightness for DSL, you could jump into DSL, set it to whatever and reboot for your chosen level without going back to the mostly-useless NDS menu.

My apologies for the lack of updates lately. Currently I have done:

- Permanent brightnesslevel change. (Yay!)

- Fixed the time bug where the minutes were higher than 59. =/
<br/>
- Fixed a flickering text bug on the Forecasts.

- Reset back to Supercard. (Would this mean I'd have to compile a SC version and non-SC version? That would suck.)

DSLiveWeather does NOT support the Germany and UK specific websites. Only the via weather.com accessible locations. This is not a flaw, it's simply a restriction of the weather.com XML feed.

<br/>
It's a very nice program, but the interface isn't very easy to use. The help is somewhat useful (though not everyone may realize you can press Select to view it) but it doesn't tell you what the icons do. Just kinda guessing at those.
<br/>
<br/>
There are some minor display bugs with long text too. For example, "Clouds Early / Clearing Late" is just long enough to wrap around to the left of the screen, and low temperatures display strangely - when it says "-20 C / -36 C", the second C is overlapped by the percentage displayed next to it; perhaps this should be moved a bit. (What's that percentage anyway, humidity?) Yeah, I live way the hell up North. :-p
<br/>
<br/>
The first 3 times I tried to connect, it failed, but the 4th time it worked. O_o Does wifi have to be on after it's updated though? It's rather tough on batteries.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, it'd be really nice if the reports could be saved in /DATA/DSLiveWeather rather than having to put yet another directory in the cluttered root of the card.
<br/>
<br/>
Nice program anyway though. Now I won't have to turn on my computer in the morning to see if it's warm enough to go to work. :-p (They shut down when it gets really cold, because they're a car wash.)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To save some typing, here is the issue with DSLiveWeather on the DSLink (or others?) that I posted over at scdev:
<br/>
<br/>
"That is the strange part. While the old (failed) dlms.dldi patch you used for Liveweather claims the libfat is ready, it refuses to write to the card. When I saw that it gave a ready status to the file system I automatically assumed it was working, but found this after trying to save settings. When Liveweather is patched with the working dlms_moon.dldi (I patched over half a dozen programs with it and it works perfectly) it fails libfat in Liveweather and does not write. Both patches still do work for grabbing weather of course, just no saving. 
<br/>
<br/>
In other words, DSLiveweather is not writing to the card via the DSLink driver with either patch, and the dlms.dldi patch seems to just be "tricking" the program to give a ready status to the libfat. Very odd. I can say for sure that in EVERY other scenario (every other program I patched) the old dlms.dldi did NOT work, while the dlms_moon.dldi does work perfectly. It has to be a problem somewhere in DSliveweather, and I posted about it over at gbadev...hopefully a fix soon."

Oh and here's another question. When you exit from DSLiveWeather using the little orange circled "X", does the DS stay connected to the WAP? I'm just curious because I did that this morning and reset back to the SuperCard SD menu, but it kept blinking the power LED like it does when it's using WiFi communication. It could have just been blinking still, I didn't check it with the WAP. But it was interesting to note.

It would seem that the reset button works when launched from the SuperCard menu or using MoonShell (both v1.41 and v1.6 Final Final Beta 2 with the DLDI patches for SCSD and SCSD_MOON). DSOrganize has more trouble. Both DSLiveWeather "Vespa" and LoveLite 1.4 will launch and then freeze using the DSOrganize launching method. Using Mighty Max's launching method, both will launch and work, but pressing the reset buttons will cause the DS to freeze. So far, it just seems to be DSO that has the problem with them.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

The Weather Channel uses a proprietary encoding for location IDs, and DSLW's queries to TWC's web service need this encoding. If you have cable television, you can often see the location ID on The Weather Channel's status bar during a local forecast.

<br/>
<br/>
Live Weather was one of the main reasons I wanted to get into some Homebrew stuff...and so far it's the only program I can't get working.
<br/>
<br/>
Problem is it won't connect to AP.
<br/>
<br/>
Everything else seems fine with it DSwifi and Libfat both show ready.
<br/>
<br/>
I have beup, and ndsmail and they both connect fine, I tried setting my WiFi settings as manual, entering in the correct addresses using Animal Crossing.
<br/>
<br/>
My wireless network does have a WEP code if that matters, not sure because beup and the ndsmail work.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any help I could get on this.
<br/>
<br/>
Any more information I can provide to fix this problem just ask

And just out of curiosity, would it be possible to add support for reading and writing the profiles from/to the "\data\DSLiveWeather" directory? I know it's been said before, but I try to keep things cleaner and organizing them all into a subfolder really helps so that there aren't folders all over the place. The "\data" folder idea has been one of the better initiatives in my opinion.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

including DSO 2.8 which i believe uses the latest lib too.

Even puzzlemaniaK isn't working!

I'm sure they were working earlier.

Is it definitely a problem with the ds or could my router or DS wifi config be wrong?

<br/>
Forcasts seem a bit weird, though. For one, I'm getting crazy values for things like updated 16303680 minutes ago, percentages of 24933%, 61460%, 8295%, and all temperatures of 0 degrees F/-17 degrees C. I also seem to be missing a graphic (not sure what for). And probably the most critical is that updating seems to crash on either receiving or processing of cc 10 or fc 10. It will just hang there indefinitely. Yet it seems to connect to my AP fine and looks like it gets the "Currently" information properly.
