    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've just released my homebrew project MaelstromDS (a version of Tempest). This is a re-working of the same demo I did for GBA a few years ago, and includes a feature that I wanted to add to the original: the ability to rotate the view freely, which is now dead easy thanks to the touch screen!
<br/>
<br/>
The demo is just a little tech demo really. To begin with, you are invulnerable. Press "Select" to become vulnerable.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think!

<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.

<br/>
I love Tempest.

The YakYak forums will probably be full of more people that will appreciate this.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

Great game, I enjoy it :) I think left and right keys are a bit too sensitive but other than that it's cool.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
