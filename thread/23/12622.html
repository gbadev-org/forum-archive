    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The latest version is always available <a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/NitroHax/NitroHax.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. Read the included <b style="color:#FFA34F">NitroHax</b>.txt file for usage instructions.
<br/>
<br/>
==========
<br/>
<br/>
This is a homebrew Action Replay DS clone. The first release is version 0.1. It should be able to run any ARDS code, with one small exception. Since I wrote the cheat engine from scratch, any code that modifies the ARDS cheat engine won't work.
<br/>
<br/>
There are 3 added codes that don't exist on the ARDS:
<br/>
C100000000 00000000 - this is the cheat list terminator. It is added to the end of the cheat list after it is loaded, so you don't need to worry about it.
<br/>
C200000000 xxxxxxxx - relocates the cheat engine to xxxxxxxx.
<br/>
C300000000 xxxxxxxx - changes the hook address to xxxxxxxx. The hook can be any address that is loaded then branched to. For example, you could hook the third word in:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">ldr  r0, . + 8
<br/>
bx  r0
<br/>
.word 0x0200AC90</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Codes are loaded from the file "/cheats.cht" on the root of your flash card. All libfat supported cards should work. All codes are loaded; this is version 0.1 after all. The codes should be in a format similar to:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">Infinite Lives
<br/>
220eca80 00000063
<br/>
Infinite Mario Time
<br/>
b20ecf40 00000000
<br/>
10000008 0000001e
<br/>
d2000000 00000000</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
The layout doesn't matter, the data values should be 8 nibbles long. Anything that isn't interpretable as hexadecimal is ignored.
<br/>
<br/>
If you find any codes that don't work, and don't rely on specific quirks of the ARDS, mention them here so that I can try to fix them.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks go to:
<br/>
kenobi - that AR code doc saved me heaps of time
<br/>
Parasyte - thanks to you, hooking couldn't be simpler
<br/>
bLAStY - provided the dumps I needed
<br/>
cReDiAr - gave me the last missing piece required to boot a DS game
<br/>
Everyone else who helped me along the way
<br/>
<br/>
Big thanks to Datel, for creating the original ARDS and the code DB to go with it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

Not going to happen. The code is very easy to adapt to dumping ROMs. In fact, writing a (private, never-to-be-released) ROM dumper was step 1 in writing Nitro Hax.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

It's not like anyone is having trouble ripping DS ROMs currently, I really don't think anyone is going to bother going through the code for this just to put together a ROM dumping tool when it is already so easy to create ROMs in the first place.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You'd be suprised at how incompetent some of the release groups are. Many are using ROM dumping tools that fail for newer DS Cards, and they don't have a clue how to fix it. I'd like to keep it that way for a little longer.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, this code is my precious. It took me 5 solid days of hacking and coding to get it this far. I release many things as open source (libfat, NDSMP) but I think this is too valuable to give away. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, the loader/patcher is completely separate from the front end. I do plan on releasing the front-end code, with the loader/patcher included as a binary blob.

If Nintendo wanted you to play games without changing the SLOT-1 card, then the DS would have included an <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdrive" target="_blank">internal hard drive</a>.

Electronics stores sell wallets for memory cards. You can look in the video game department for wallets designed specifically for DS Game Cards, or you can look in the photography department for generic wallets into which any CF card, SD card, or DS Game Card will fit.

Action Replay is a commercial product, since this has been released there is no need to buy action replay anymore. Therefore people who buy this are pirating Action Replay DS. Yet he claims he doesn't want to support piracy. He needs to stop contradicting himself.
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, since you need a flash cart to make this work to begin with. Most of the people who use this probably don't have many actual carts to begin with. Make this work without a flash cart (Hah, thats never going to happen) and on any DS and it will be of some real use. Until then this is just an excuse not to buy Action Replay DS and cheat on WFC. 
<br/>
<br/>
But if you wanted to cheat you would just hack the rom or the gamesave or get a trainer now wouldn't you...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In addition to its cheat function, Action Replay DS is a cheap NoPass that is available in brick-and-mortar video game stores across North America. This means you don't need to pay as much shipping when ordering DS homebrew equipment.

Piracy is the infringement of copyright. The computer program in an Action Replay DS card is subject to copyright, but its method of operation is expressly not subject to copyright per <a class="postlink" href="http://www.bitlaw.com/source/17usc/102.html" target="_blank">17 USC 102</a> and foreign counterparts. This program by Chishm is an original computer program that implements the same method. If what you say were true, then Taito would get sued for copying Breakout into Arkanoid, the developer of Snood would get sued for copying Bust-A-Move, and Datel would get sued for copying DipStar.

Unlike piracy, Chishm's ARDS clone also works with a GBA Movie Player, with games larger than 256 Mbit, and with local DS Download Play multiplayer.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I'll get the value reason out of the way first. I spent 5 days working on this and it is valuable to me. The 5 days were not simple 1-2 hour afternoons working on this. I was doing this for the entire 5 days, with a minimum of 10 hours per day. That's 50 hours total. Assuming I was to get $10 an hour for the work I did (which is below the minimum wage in Australia) that makes Nitro Hax worth at least $500 to me, and that's just for the time spent. If someone wants the source code, I may be willing to license it for $500.
<br/>
<br/>
Now that I have gotten that out of the way, I'll get to my main point. The source is extremely easy to convert to a ROM dumper. The development of it went something like this:
<br/>
Day 0 (Tuesday): "Gah, this last level of Yoshi's Island DS is a PitA to get 30 stars on. I know, I'll fix that!"
<br/>
Day 1-2 (Wednesday-Thursday): Step 1 - Writing a dumper. This was done using specs available freely on the internet.
<br/>
Day 3 (Friday): Step 2 - Writing a DS Card launcher. This is a combination of the dumper's code and NDSMP (which I have given away free under the GPL).
<br/>
Day 4 (Saturday): Step 3 - Writing the cheat engine framework. The launcher was modified to add a hook into the ARM7 code and a rudimentary cheat engine (only supporting direct writes) was created.
<br/>
Day 5 (Sunday): Step 4 - Writing the cheat engine. I hand-coded the cheat engine based on an Action Replay code document written by kenobi. This was done using pure ARM ASM (GNU syntax).
<br/>
Day 5.5 (Sunday Night): Step 5 - Writing a simple wrapper. This was the easiest bit, since all the important things were done.
<br/>
<br/>
Reading DS Cards is a crucial step for Nitro Hax, and a decent cheat engine that can run from any flash card would not be doable without it. If I were to release only the cheat engine as source code it would take as much effort as I put in to make it work. 
<br/>
<br/>
There are many people that would prefer to simply take the cheat engine and use it with ROM images. For an example of this, look at the DipStar thread in this forum and look at the number of people asking for help with getting DipStar to run from a GBA Cart and use it with official games. Now compare this with the number of people wanting help with M3Dip, which only works for ROM images run from an M3 device.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">So why don't I support piracy? / Why do I hate pirates?</span>
<br/>
Although I'm not religious, I still live my life by a set of ethics/morals/values/rules. These include "Do no harm" and "Treat others as you wish to be treated". By releasing a dumper I would make it so much easier for people to pirate, effectively stealing from developers. As a developer I know first-hand how much it hurts to see people take your work as though it is their right.
<br/>
<br/>
Piracy does damage. There is already a big thread about this elsewhere in the forums.
<br/>
<br/>
Most (vocal) pirates seem to be whining, immature kids who don't care about anything but themselves. I need only point to the threads on various other (piracy related) sites for this one.
<br/>
<br/>
Many so called "release groups" don't deserve any of the respect they get. Half of the release groups are simply people who dump ROMs and stick them on the net. Wow, big deal. So you can operate a tool created by someone else to dump games created by someone else. What, you want praise and admiration for that? F**k off. The only groups that deserve any respect are the ones that create their own software and hardware. If circumstances were different, they may even have done some real good for the homebrew community.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Isn't Nitro Hax pirating the Action Replay?</span>
<br/>
Not at all. I wrote the cheat engine from scratch, based on a document written by kenobi. I'm pretty sure that qualifies as a clean-room approach, as used by Phoenix to develop the IBM clone. I could have implemented any code system I wanted, but the ARDS codes were the best. There are many people who create their own AR codes, and now their audience isn't limitted to AR owners. The code system is powerful enough that I didn't have to extend it with many other codes, which increases cross-compatibility. I do wish to thank Datel for their work on the AR, it has generated a large user-base.
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, rant over.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, to everyone that complained because I didn't release a dumper: Grow up and stop acting so selfish. Be thankful for what you got - no one owes you anything.
<br/>
<br/>
To everyone who stood up for me, everyone who was thankful for what I did, and especially everyone in the DS Homebrew scene who has helped me throughout the years: Thank you. Without you, I would not be going on.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I've tried all of them individually, with nothing in the .txt file but the codes (no descriptors or anything like that).  No luck.  Any idea what's wrong?

I'm using M3 DS Simply, and have tried three different codes for Super Mario 64 DS (US).  The game boots fine, but none of the codes I enter seem to work.  I've tried all of them individually, with nothing in the .txt file but the codes (no descriptors or anything like that).  No luck.  Any idea what's wrong?<br/>
<br/>

Did you get the Nitro Hax working with the M3 DS Simply? Tell me how. I did use Action Replay codes for Mario Kart DS under Text file, <br/>

and i patched it right i think, but in tell i take it out and put it back in (the M3 simply) i just get the loading screen and thats as far as i can go. So does it work with the Back-up ROMs like Mario Kart?</div>

If you get a copy of the AR DS Code Manager software,you wont have to convert anything. You can store any of the codes you dowload in a folder on your computer.

As for Animal Crossing, it might be better to get automatic hooking working with it than to find a master code. As we saw on N64, once some people found a way to prevent the Gameshark hook from working, requiring a master code to disable their prevention, many a game started using it. (DE000400 0000 F10004E4 2400 anyone?) Whatever AC is doing, if it blocks automatic patching then I can see more games doing it in the future. :-/<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

PS: Those wishing to use said code, it is 023CDD57 00000001. To use it, go into single player time trial mode and select a ghost to race against. (Make sure you use the same character and kart as the ghost, otherwise it won't work properly.) When you begin the time trial, your character will follow the same path as the ghost did. This is quite useful for showing off a time properly to friends, and it's the only action replay code allowed on the official sites. That's where I got it in fact.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

<br/>
Actually, ACPG (for GameCube) and ACWW (for DS) have several distinct objectives, including at least the following: <ul><li>pay off mortgage </li><li>get a perfect town, which is based mostly on tree density </li><li>complete the golden shovel sequence (bury and retrieve a shovel in a method that varies per game) </li><li>catch all fish, bugs, fossils (no, you can't wake the fossils; this isn't Spectrobes) </li><li>get all the paintings (dumb luck) </li><li>get catalog fills from Redd and from villagers so that you can buy furniture for a perfect house (dumb luck) </li></ul>
<br/>
The perceived "lack of objective" is due to the game's lack of a numeric rating for how many objectives you have completed.
<br/>
<br/>
But almost none of these objectives are related to wireless play, except that you can do some of them more quickly after someone else drops foreign fruit in your town and buys something from your Nookway store.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The graphics are stored as LZSS-compressed raw tile data that gets copied directly to VRAM. &lt;rant ordinal="2"&gt;There's little point adding a bitmap reading library to a cheat tool, it just adds to bloat.

&gt;_&gt; Sorry, had to say it.  I actually agree with you here, it would be rather silly to allow for custom skins here.

Heh, I suppose I left myself open for that attack. However, MP3 sound quality on the DS is less than FM radio, easily beaten by a semi-decent dedicated MP3 player. Pictures are a bit small to see, often requiring zoom+pan, although the dual-screens and touch screen help with this. Web browsing is pretty awkward and slow to render. IM is difficult to have a decent conversation with on the DS using an on-screen keyboard. So I guess this brings me back to my point about doing one thing well (gaming) or ten things  in a mediocre way.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

The graphics are stored as LZSS-compressed raw tile data that gets copied directly to VRAM. &lt;rant ordinal="2"&gt;There's little point adding a bitmap reading library to a cheat tool, it just adds to bloat.

Making it themeable wouldn't be high on my list of to do's either, but having a default high quality clear interface is a step towards it being more user friendly. Aslo if people see something that's unpolished they're likely to be less trusting of it and therefore believe it to be less reliable.

 I know that most people who use DS homebrew have a certain level of tech knowlege that means there's certain things you can take for granted, but I wouldn't say that presentation counts for nothing. The current theme is functional but I think it's worth improving for more reasons than to just make it look a bit prettier.

Oh, so you mean the whole UI needs updating. I'll admit that the current one is fairly basic, but UI design is not one of my strong points. When the code is stable enough (so I don't have to worry about people using 3 different code bases, like what happened with gba_nds_fat), I'll release the UI code. That way someone with better design skills than me can produce a polished UI.

That sounds good to me, the only reason I'm pushing it somewhat is I think this is one of the most promising projects I've seen and a project that could conceivably be 'finished' at some point soon. I'm a sucker for a slick interface and I think this could be a commercial quality piece of software if it only it looked that way. Not insulting how it is already (the newer interface is clearly better than it was) but I do think it could be made better. Of course this needs to be secondary to adding functionality :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The problem with doing a purely software GBA AR "clone" is that the GBA AR works by intercepting GBA cartridge reads at the hardware level. It's a completely different way of doing things, and can't be done in software, unless the GBA cartridge bus is emulated too. And before anyone asks, I'm not writing a GBA (high-level) emulator for the DS.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi; I first want to say thank you to the poster of the Nitro Hax program (chishm) for this and his other contributions. Being a Linux guy myself, I love to see those who contribute to a growing community. I have been studying various DS programs such as DSOrganize and of course DSLinux just to try to get an idea of how the system works. I plan on making some programs based on what I have seen in source code (mostly copy+pasting so I can learn various things), but my biggest problem is understanding certain concepts. This program has a particular concept I was interested in...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was wondering if anyone would take a second to explain to me how this program works. I don't need a really in-depth explanation or any source code examples... I'm just asking for a high-level overview of what occurs. My biggest question is the following.... how can you make changes to the memory, and then launch a game without those changes disappearing? Maybe I am misunderstanding how the DS works, but I figured that memory would be overwritten when a game is launched (much like how RAM data is soon replaced after you free() it in C programs). How is it that the cheat function remains in memory?<br/>_________________<br/>Linux Kernel Hacker since '01

    <h4>#124496 - chishm - Fri Apr 06, 2007 9:37 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Overview of how Nitro Hax works:
<br/>
Part 1, the GUI:
<br/>
1) Load and parse XML files
<br/>
2) Re-insert DS Card
<br/>
3) Read DS Card header to get game ID
<br/>
4) Present cheat list to user and get them to enable/disable codes
<br/>
5) Convert the code tree to a list of enabled codes
<br/>
6) Load BootLoader into VRAM (bank C)
<br/>
7) Put cheat list into VRAM (bank D)
<br/>
Part 2, the BootLoader:
<br/>
1) Reset memory and registers
<br/>
2) Load NDS header to 0x027FFE00
<br/>
3) Load ARM7 and ARM9 binaries
<br/>
4) Load cheat engine
<br/>
5) Put codes where cheat engine expects them
<br/>
6) Find IRQ handler in ARM 7 binary and place a hook to the cheat engine for when VBlank executes
<br/>
7) Have both CPUs execute SWI 0x00 (soft reset)
<br/>
Part 3, the Cheat Engine:
<br/>
1) Jump to cheat engine after VBlank IRQ handler returns
<br/>
2) Parse cheat list and perform required actions
<br/>
3) Jump back to original VBlank return location
<br/>
<br/>
You'll notice that we load the cheat engine only after memory has been cleared. The loaded NDS file expects the DS Firmware to have already cleared RAM, so it doesn't clear it all again. Because of this, the cheat engine remains in memory.

I currently suspect the loading of the _BOOT_MP_1122.nds (that means
<br/>
the movieadvance correspondent to your GBAMPCF firmware hack): Perhaps it leaves some staff in memory or whatever, so booting up the game does not work. (that also may explain that nds_launcher does not work with mpsd.dldi).
<br/>
<br/>
I have not enough knowledge about it, is there something the mpsd.dldi 
<br/>
driver code can initialize (setting some memory region to zero, for example) to test this theory?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unfortunately not. I tried to buy an WLAN-Adapter with the right chipset (rt2560), but the manufacturer already moved to the rt2561 chipset, so
<br/>
it hasn't worked. I then tried wifiloader and configuring the WLAN-Adapter as Soft-Accesspoint, but the wifiloader didn't work together with my NDS Lite, I couldnt track it down further. 
<br/>
<br/>
But thanks for the reminder, this seems a solution to track it down a little bit further, I will investigate again in <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7912" target="_blank">this thread</a>.

Edit: One question: Am I right, I will need <a class="postlink" href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php" target="_blank">WifiMe</a> to run homebrew, or does it work with the original Nintendo USB Adapter (or compatible)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To run unsigned code via Wireless Multi Boot (WMB), you'll need to flash your DS. WifiMe is like PassMe, and nothing more. You might be able to use the Nintendo USB WAP for WMB, but I think it only works in Linux. If you have a Slot-1 flash card, you could use that as an alternative to WMB for loading the patched Nitro Hax file.

It probably goes like this:

The Action Replay system of R4 is very good, but, unfortunately, still not good enough.  The system is suffering from performance issue.  Take Mario Kart as an example, enabling several codes would make the game choppy while racing.  Nitro Hax, however, runs like a charm !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It uses a Nitro-Hax-exclusive code type, C2, to execute a custom function from within the code list, so it won't work on an Action Replay without modification of the AR cheat engine. It also needs to run on the ARM7, so if the cheat engine is hooked into the ARM9 instead (this doesn't occur without forcing it), it won't work.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

My prove you ask?

Well remember Chishm making a backlight control code which would only work on Nitrohax because of a exclusive build-in command that won't work on the original AR if it isn't modified?
<br/>
Well, how do you explain that the code that supposedly should only work with nitrohax also does run on the newly flashcards with build-in action replay support!

Once you've done that (or entered the code), a man in green is supposed to show up in the Pok?mart (the shop) and give you the Manaphy egg. The man isn't there as he's supposed to be after I've entered the code. I haven't tried the other codes to obtain the other "unobtainable" legendaries yet. Here is a link to the XML file (with the other legendary codes):

In your media device, put cheats.xml in the root or in a folder named NitroHax in the root. You don't need the Action replay.

<br/>
Again, what doesn't work? Here are some options to help us figure it out:
<br/>
1) The game isn't detected at all, and the cheat list doesn't show up
<br/>
2) Nitro Hax freezes when I try to choose a cheat
<br/>
3) The game doesn't boot from within Nitro Hax with cheats enabled
<br/>
4) The game doesn't boot from within Nitro Hax even with cheats disabled
<br/>
5) The game boots, but the cheats don't do anything
<br/>
6) The game boots, but it freezes at a certain point
<br/>
<br/>
Each of the above problems can be caused by a different problem so "it doesn't work" won't tell me anything useful.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

rofl but thats what i'm saying.
<br/>
is there a way that it just like first boot NitroHacks
<br/>
then you choose the game(with the cheats in it so eneble them etc)
<br/>
after that you can choose your NDS game to boot up and you got yourself a NitroHacks with Roms ;)
<br/>
but its just an idea nothing more</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
This is because NitroHax uses a newer version of libfat that doesn't have built-in drivers. The SCSD DLDI file <span style="font-style: italic">must</span> be fully operational, including support for misaligned reads/writes, and I'm not sure either of those DLDIs are.

Really, you did do everything right. Almost, but we're coming to that. You reached the quality of a commercial product while reverse-engineering a lot of Datel's proprietary work. Good job here.
<br/>
<br/>
However, Pokemon Diamond/Pearl are causing problems. There were already posts about it.
<br/>
<br/>
First, I use the German version on a German NDS. If I let NitroHax start, it loads its codes, I remove my SuperCard DS One and insert Pearl. There I select no cheats at all. All I get are two white screens. The final squares were red-red-yellow-red.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you manage to find the source of the problem and eliminate it. We all would be very glad about that and that probably allows you to flag NitroHax finally as 1.0.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For an extra special Christmas present (continuing the tradition), you can has <a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/NitroHax/NitroHax_src.tar.bz2" target="_blank">sauce</a> with your codez. 
<br/>
<br/>
This release fixes Pokemon Diamond/Pearl, and incorporates some improvements to the cheat engine as suggested by Normmatt.
<br/>
<br/>
Now before anyone asks, I am releasing source now because circumstances have changed. Practically all flash cards support AR codes now, either through ripped-off engines or ones they've written themselves, so there's no point keeping that secret any more. I would love to release the card reading functions too, but unfortunately I've been informed that they're actually covered by a patent. This means the BootLoader won't build completely from the supplied source, but a compiled copy is in there already.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, the file is too large. It should be a lot smaller than that; around 2MB should fit. NitroHax has to load everything into memory so that you can pull the flash card out before choosing the game. The DS only has 4MiB of main memory and some of that is used for the program. You could try cutting down the file to include only games that you own. Do you really need cheats for 1000+ games?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

So is flipping burgers to afford authentic Game Cards, but apparently you did that. I would imagine that doing Ctrl+F to find the titles of your games isn't hard. Or what am I overlooking?

    <h4>#167095 - Soib - Sat Feb 28, 2009 9:54 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using NitroHax 0.92 on a DSLinker 8G card that has no feature to cheat like some other cards. Indeed this is not what I was looking for; NitroHax exactly meet my expectations, offering the possibility of cheating with normal cartridges to my 10 years old daughter. I think this is an excellent homebrew. 
<br/>
<br/>
But if I write on this forum, this is to relate a annoying problem. NitroHax loads without problem codes from a xml file that I prepared from a French subscription. After setting up the cartridge games, Pokemon Pearl here, the menu code is displayed and the activation of codes is working well. On the other hand, after the opening of a folder by pressing A, NitroHax opens it, displays the names of codes of the directory and then, hangs completely ! Unable to do anything, no key has some effect. Only solution, turn off the console. 
<br/>
<br/>
I currently have bypassed the problem by removing all the directories so all &lt;folder&gt; tags in file. There are only &lt;cheat&gt; tags with a personnal presentation to get directories visibles, written in capital letters, and codes names are presented with "- " at the beginning. Visually, this is acceptable, but it gives a long, long list of codes. Fortunately, the R and L buttons can move faster in the consultation ! 
<br/>
<br/>
The same problem occurs with a xml file from the Internet, as PokemonDSActionReplay.xml of pokemondiamondpearl.info or "Pok?mon Trash, the best of AR Trash.xml of PokemonTrash.com. 
<br/>
<br/>
What is strange, PokemonDSActionReplay.xml file has not been a problem for NitroHax during the first test with it to check its running and if it met our expectations. This file was renamed cheats.xml and located in \NitroHax folder on the card. It was perfectly possible to open a directory, consult the various codes, change directory to another, etc.. Currently the same blocking problem occurs with this file after opening of a directory. As if there had been a deterioration, after the first use of an xml file created by selection in "Pok?mon Trash, the best of AR Trash.xml" of codes for Pokemon Pearl. This is not my first xml file (job in computer area), I have scrupulously followed the tags syntax for Action Replay xml file. 
<br/>
<br/>
So, thinking that it was linked to the context, I made a soft and a hard formatting of the DSLinker with only NitroHax installed, in the root with a complete cheats.xml file, and also with a reduced one, located in the root and also in \NitroHax. No effect, same blocking problem on opening a directory. 
<br/>
<br/>
The DSLinker 8G cartridge is updated with firmware v1.45 and xmenu 2.55. I did a test with xmenu 2.56 from MK5 cart which DLinker is a clone, without result.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried with the xml file named cheats, or any other name, located in \NitroHax or in root with NitroHax.nds. 
<br/>
I tried with Pokemon Ranger 2. Nothing! NitroHax hangs after opening of a directory of codes. 
<br/>
I have not tried with a game other than Pokemon. I will test it but only after 3 weeks. 
<br/>
<br/>
I just remember one important point I think. When it worked well, ie when the directory was well open and its contents displayed, the default selection is the first line &lt;..&gt;. In this position, in the window to display the content of &lt;name&gt; and &lt;note&gt; (top screen), characters, which are not alpha-numeric, are displayed. This display seemed random. After thinking, it is probably due to bad or none initialization of data field. Depending on the characters read, this could be the cause of freeze of NitroHax.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone has used a xml file with &lt;folder&gt; and encountered this problem ? Did you identified a solution ?
<br/>
Otherwise, we will use NitroHax without folder in xml files. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for your help.
