    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I released new version of ClIRC - IRC client for Nintendo DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Main features:
<br/>
* A clipboard in all dialog boxes. You can even copy from upper screen, holding "L" button.
<br/>
* Using up to three servers at the same time.
<br/>
* DCC chat support and file transfer by DCC in both directions (I really don't know what for, but in fact :))
<br/>
* Storing of logs directly to flash.
<br/>
* Identification of server answers by numbers. I.e. not an interface only but the great deal of server answers is in English (for non-english servers).
<br/>
* An alternative mode of nicklist request. Now you can see user's "away" status plus a complete list of his modes on server.
<br/>
* Flexible settings of colors, highlights, etc.
<br/>
* The prototype of scripts for advanced users. You can set commands, which will be executed after opening or closing of DS (turn away automatically, for example). You can previously make a list of commands for channels, privates and nick list, where the appropriate variables will be substituted as well. I.e. mIRC popups' analog :)
<br/>
* All settings can be changed during a program work - it's no need to bother with ini files.
<br/>
* Something like multitasking. At the same time you can download several files by DCC, get a list of channels and chat. Practically all tasks are working simultaneously, except the moment of connection.
<br/>
* Nick autocomplete on "tab".
<br/>
* Special mode for left handed people.
<br/>
* Input history.
<br/>
* Ignore.
<br/>
* Russian in/out and interface (only for Russian version).
