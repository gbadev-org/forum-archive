<br/>
<br/>
I'm doing a free, open-source operating system for the Nintendo DS. This has been brewing for a few months, and is starting to get ready. Currently FeOS supports loading relocatable code (which includes support for shared libraries), basic console I/O (thanks to libnds? functions), ARM7 code loading support (!!!) and a native libnds-based DS video API.
<br/>
<br/>
As usual, it?s available through <a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/fincs/FeOS" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Pre-built packages (including the FeOS SDK) will be available soon.
<br/>
<br/>
I've also currently ported <a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/fincs/FeOSLua" target="_blank">Lua</a> to FeOS (pictured below), and since there is shared library support, Lua extensions (plugins) are also supported.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are some screenshots:
