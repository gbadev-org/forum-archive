    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I like it.  It was accurate, the key animations looked good and the speech surprised me.  It does look weird being on the bottom right and being so tiny but it was easy enough to push the buttons and if it was on the left, it wouldn't be so accurate on my DS.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hmm, it's alright, I like the feel of it, better than alot of keyboards that ignore you alot of the time. I don't particularly like the elevated buttons look though, they confuse me abit :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
