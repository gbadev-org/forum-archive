    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I made a Bible-reading program a while ago and didn't release it because some extra features (bookmarking, searching, verse look-up) had <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=15032" target="_blank">seemingly unfixable bugs</a> and the code was a huge mess even though it was the second time I rewrote the whole thing.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I've still been using it and have been finding it still quite useful so I've decided to release it here.

Maybe, if I can find some. I know there is another Bible reader for DS that has 5 translations, although they seem to be in a binary format that I can't read. If I find some other translations in the same format as the current one though, it'd be easy to add that feature. Actually it'd probably be pretty easy to make a quick program that converts a different bible format to the one DSbible uses.

Yeah I'm planning to, but first I think I might add some features (searching, verse look-up, favourites, other translations), then I will enter it. Or if I decide not to keep working on it I'll just enter the current one (with a moonbooks splash screen or whatever is required.) I wasn't going to keep working on this but since people seem interested (and since I don't have anything else to work on) I might change my mind about that. :P<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://viewsourcecode.org/" target="_blank">viewsourcecode</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So, as soon as some sort fanatic (or want-to-be) of any of these religions crosses your path, you could verify anything they say. And spilling out religious phrases can be impressive in the right situations (think Pulp Fiction &lt;lol&gt;)... ;^D

Already done. The Torah, or Law of Moses, is part of the Tanach (Jewish Bible). The Christian Bible consists of the Tanach (called the "Old Testament" by Christians) plus the New Testament. So we already have 2-in-1; we just need someone's English interpretation of the Qur'an, as you mentioned.<br/>_________________<br/>Driven from Tilwick by ice storms, couldn't fit in in Flower Bud...

All the good translations, including NLT, are copyrighted so it would be illegal to include it.

Excellent. I've only been using it for a short time, but I'm already a big fan of this software. The layout is nice, and it's very easy to find whatever verse you are looking for. Multiple translations would be really cool.<br/>_________________<br/>Brandon
