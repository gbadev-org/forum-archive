    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi.. here's my first attempt at DS homebrew.. a minigame type thing.... MAGNETIC SHAVING DERBY!
<br/>
<br/>
I made it for a little coding compo where you had to use a random game name generator to come up with a name, and then make it into a game. 
<br/>
<br/>
It's not coded well. I'm a noob, learning C++ as I go. Most of my coding experience is with BlitzMax, though I did mess around with Turbo Pascal and C years ago.  Having stacks of fun making stuff for the DS!   This is the first game I've come anywhere close to finishing :O

enjoy...or something :P

PS.. Scoring works something like this:  You get points for each hair you cut. You lose points the more time it takes. you also lose points for cutting yourself. You lose more points if you're too slow and your beard starts growing again. Popping The Pimple results in temporary reverse polarity, during which you get double the points for each hair cut. If you manage to not get cut at all, you get bonus points....and if you <span style="font-style: italic">also</span> win before regrowth starts, you get even more bonus points.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by nyarla on Wed Aug 20, 2008 5:56 pm; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

<br/>
Wacky/fun gameplay, and challenging...I suck way too much at it to get any sort of 3 digit score &amp; have never even come close to completing.  Damned regrowth! :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the fun reminder.
<br/>
<br/>
PS: Shaving sucks. Really. Especially when you have to shave like every hour to not look like ... needing a shave.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Testing with a Supercard SD and DS Lite, I can't seem to make the magnet move around on the Y axis.  I can move it back and forth horizontally, but not up and down.  Hence, I can only shave the very bottom part of the guy's chin.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone ever heard of such a thing?  I guess I'll try testing it on my slot-1 flash card and see if that makes a difference.
<br/>
<br/>
Looks like a great game.  And sounds like a great contest, too.  Is there a page that has other entries from this contest?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">About the lack of Y-axis movement.. weird! I have no idea why that could be. I've only tested it on an R4DS and no$gba.
<br/>
The magnet is placed directly at wherever you last touched the touchscreen...   
<br/>
<br/>
The thread for the compo is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.yakyak.org/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=72929" target="_blank">here</a>.. it's not actually over yet, and only a couple other people have posted what they're up to so far :/  oops.   <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tigsource.com/features/vgng/" target="_blank">Here</a>'s another older compo I found with the exact same theme. Some awesome stuff in there :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Small update:
<br/>
<br/>
- You can now hit Start to give up the current run.
<br/>
- High score for current session is kept track of.
<br/>
- Made title music sound slightly better on DS speakers.
<br/>
- Beard regrowth score penalty is now on a sliding scale.
<br/>
<br/>
Apparently someone scored in the thousands by being really bad at it. Maybe the updated scoring will fix that :)
