    <h4>#95507 - Turambar - Sat Jul 29, 2006 11:56 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I made a port of Pizza Worm for the DS. For those who don't know, Pizza Worm is an old game where you are a worm that eats pizza and grows bigger, and unlike other similar games, you can rotate in any angle. You can find the official homepage of the original pc game at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.zorlim.net/pizza_worm/" target="_blank">http://www.zorlim.net/pizza_worm/</a> (which now seems to be down for some reason...)
<br/>
<br/>
The game was written in pascal, so I basically had to rewrite the hole thing.
<br/>
To use it, you have to place the highscores file (PWORM.000) in the root of your card. It uses the rein modified version of chishm's libfat.
<br/>
In the highscores screen, you can press R for a 2 players game in the same DS. Player 2 uses A and Y to move. You can then press L to get back to 1 player mode.
<br/>
Also it remembers the last entered name, and you can submit the highscore using START, so you don't have to take out the stylus every time.
<br/>
You can get the game <a class="postlink" href="http://rapidshare.de/files/27975799/PWORM.rar.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
And here is a screenshot <a href="http://img118.imageshack.us/img118/9010/pwormxs1.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I use the Headspin's Simple Keyboard Example, and for the music I used Dennis Kincheloe's DS MOD player.

There's an unskippable delay while the title screen is displayed.  The quit option just displays "bye" but doesn't reset the DS or launch a menu on M3CF.  There's a method to launch a menu <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10390" target="_blank">here</a>.  Moonshell can launch .nds files on many devices, so might want to look at that source if you think fast exit is really important.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Sun Jul 30, 2006 7:09 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh wow...I remember playing that as an old dos game on my laptop a long time ago....I remember the extremely annoying music ^^  I'll have to check it out.  I'll add some better feedback tommrow ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
I think the snake craze is starting...first my game that i'm still working on (Super Snake DS) and now this ^^  Snake is comming back!
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I've been playing wiht it..and it's pretty cool ^^ However, I noticed a couple things you may want to look at. 
<br/>
<br/>
1.  When you get a pizza...the snake keeps movign straight, but the end of the snake doesn't.  Instead of growing and deleting, it grows, then deletes or...bleh..hard to explain and i'm tired :S
<br/>
2.  After getting a high score, then playing another game, then dieing...the start up screen comes up with a blank high scores list and you can't do anything. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think I understand what you are saying. When you eat a pizza, you start to grow, so the tail doesn't move while the front does. When it's done growing, the tail starts to move again (by "deleting" it).

mmmh... I can't seem to reproduce it, but it probably has something to do with the fatlib... maybe I shouldn't be using an lib in alpha. The problem is that the old lib doesn't work for M3SD, so I can't test anything if I use that one.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know of an alternative to save the highscores somewhare??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can save to SRAM.  That will make it work on flash carts and most CF/SD devices but FAT support will still be required for GBAMP and datel MMD.
<br/>
<br/>
The backlight should be turned off on the bottom screen when not in use and both screens when the lid is closed, although it's unlikely anyone is going to drain their battery with this game.  Highest i've got to is 170.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Mon Jul 31, 2006 8:01 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Does it freeze before asking to enter your name? And if you don't make a highscore the second time, you can still see the highscore list and it doesn't freeze?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<div class="post">
    <h4>#95714 - chatterbug89 - Sun Jul 30, 2006 8:22 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry...here, i'll explain in as much detail as posible about what happens and what I did to cause the problem. :)
<br/>
<br/>
For the record, i'm using the GBAMP.
<br/>
<br/>
1.  Turn on DS.
<br/>
2.  Start up Pizza Snake with moonshell
<br/>
3.  wait for the intro to load...
<br/>
4.  Pressed A
<br/>
5.  Pressed A again to start the game.
<br/>
6.  Lost game and gained High Score.
<br/>
7.  Enter High Score name
<br/>
8.  Pressed enter.
<br/>
9.  Pressed A to start a new game.
<br/>
10.  Lose game and gained another high score.
<br/>
<br/>
After that...right after the game ends...the pizza worms high score screen comes up with a blank area for where the scores would be..and no way to enter a new high score.  Pressing anythign else does nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
So to answere you first question, you can't enter a high score the 2nd time you get a high score.
<br/>
<br/>
And...two parts to answere you 2nd quesiton.
<br/>
<br/>
1.  If you continusly lose and dont' get a high score..the game doesn't freeze and always displays the high scores after losing.
<br/>
2.  If you lose a bunch of times, then get a high score...wheather you win or lose in the next game, you just get the blank high scores screen area and are not abl eot do anything. ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I think button A would be better for skipping the intro since if I accidentally push Start twice then I will quit the game and I have to power cycle the DS.  You could also change it so Select doesn't instantly end a game.  Maybe you could ask if the user wants to end their game.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
