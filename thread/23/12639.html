    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great news every body i seemed to have gotten chex quest to work on ds doom this is not thoroughly test but i'll post the .wad file later as chex quest is free i dont see any reason why i cant give you this file so far it seems to work pretty well but the sounds seem to be wrong but im sure i can fix that pretty easily
<br/>
<br/>
also to the last post i would love to make that work for ds doom i think i may be able to if you supply me with a link to where to download it rather then just a video! thanks to all the devs at ds doom!
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
I added the sound and music files to the prboom.wad file they work but so far i havent heard any music i dont remeber when the music plays and how to turn it on/off but heres the files! This is chex quest 1 and 2 hope everything works correctly!
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">im not realy a doom moder so i have no idea what your talking about but im learning if you have any PWAD files then i can make a .wad file that should run on the ds like chex quest does but right now my ds is broken im waiting for my friend to solder on the new part i got so i cant test any code to see if it boots or not but i will try testing it with the ideas ds emulator but i dont know how accurate it will be or if it will even work for test at all i should hopefuly have my ds fixed by friday if not im going to have to buy a new one
<br/>
<br/>
just so you know this was a mishap that i caused not my software i was checking something out when i was putting the case back together the on/off switch snapped off lol

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We need 2 files : one is a IWAD like doom2.wad and a PWAD like prboom.wad.
<br/>
So the free legal TC (total convertion) doom PWAD file like halflife.wad, quake2.wad, etc.. needs doom2.wad to work.
<br/>
DSDoom can't load more than 1 wad + prboom.wad.
<br/>
I try to merge halflife.wad+doom2.wad-&gt;doom2.wad and the game load the structure but hang at the end.
<br/>
I think the pwad prboom.wad must be change.. but how ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks to Link for getting this working. If there a way to have the demos play correctly when letting the game run by itself? I think what's happening is that the demos from the original Doom are runnning in the Chex Quest maps. It's a small thing really but my son loves watching the demos run in DSDoom but I have a problem with him seeing demons being blown away by shotguns. ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
