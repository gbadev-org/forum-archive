    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've just put together a test build that should be able to access both slots.  It's not very elegant at the moment but it should work.  It works by using the old drivers in the DSLinux kernel back when DLDI didn't exist.
<br/>
<br/>
Boot from Slot-1 with either a M3SD, GBAMP, Supercard SD or Max Media Drive (maybe) in Slot-2.  Slot-2 will be mounted automatically on boot to <span style="font-weight: bold">/var/slot2</span>.  You may see some error messages but it should mount fine.  To check, type:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
mount
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
If it's worked, you should see both /dev/dldi and /dev/mmcblk entries.
<br/>
<br/>
I've only tested this with an Acekard + Supercard SD and it seems to work fine although I do lose 16MB off the SCSD RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
Your mileage may vary, use at your own risk and so on:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Your work is really cool and all... but I won't touch DSLinux anymore before any of these function were not included in a handy OS or easy to use Windows like shell...
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your effort none the less ! Keep working.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.petitiononline.com/blizzds/petition.html" target="_blank">Starcraft DS ?</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
