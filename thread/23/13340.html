    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The version 0.3 of Ka-BoOm is available <a class="postlink" href="http://stravingo.over-blog.fr/" target="_blank">on my devblog</a>. Some modifications in this version: when the DS is closed it pauses the game, some little bugs are removed, graphics are cleaned of remaining pink pixels (transparency color), however this is only minor modifications. <span style="font-weight: bold">The main improvement of this new version is to let you know your best scores to the entire world!</span> :) 
<br/>
Indeed, thanks to Sumigushi (and thanks to Mollusk), it is now possible to send your best scores on <a class="postlink" href="http://leaderboard.palib.info/" target="_blank">leaderboard.palib.info</a>, and they will appear <a class="postlink" href="http://leaderboard.palib.info/games.php?gameid=6" target="_blank">on this page</a>. For that, you must have configured WiFI on your DS and you have to be closed to a WiFi Access Point to the Internet.

I will also add this feature to my other game Setsuzoku no Puzzle very soon. In a few days, my sister Eglantine will know if there is other addicts to this game than she is :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://stravingo.over-blog.fr/" target="_blank">My games (<span style="font-weight: bold">Ka-BoOm</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Setsuzoku no Puzzle</span>) and apps (<span style="font-weight: bold">DS Weather Report</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Treasures of Gaia</span>) on DS are available on my blog!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
