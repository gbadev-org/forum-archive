Ka-BoOm v0.2
<br/>
=========
<br/>
  * Highscores management. Up to five best times for each mode are saved. On the highscores screens, you can press B to show/hide the dates of the scores.
<br/>
<br/>
  * DLDI support. DLDI patching is necessary if you want to save the highscores.
<br/>
<br/>
  * The wick of the bomb burns more quickly now. You only have one second to extinguish it ! Puts much more stress on you and your lungs  :)
<br/>
<br/>
  * The animation of the green checker on the upper screen now depends on the game : it zooms by a magnitude that depends on the number of squares cleared, it zooms and rotates during an explosion.
<br/>
<br/>
  * "Arialia mode" (private joke  ;) ) : you can press Select to enable/disable the green checker movement.
<br/>
<br/>
  * Animated menu.
<br/>
<br/>
  * More sound FX.
<br/>
<br/>
  * More animated features.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://stravingo.over-blog.fr/" target="_blank">My games (<span style="font-weight: bold">Ka-BoOm</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Setsuzoku no Puzzle</span>) and apps (<span style="font-weight: bold">DS Weather Report</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Treasures of Gaia</span>) on DS are available on my blog!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
