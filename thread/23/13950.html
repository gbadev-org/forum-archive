    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Quite a long time since the last release, but now there is version 0.3 of DSchess! 
<br/>
DSchess is a homebrew chess game for the Nintendo DS, which is based on the strong chess engine Fruit by Fabien Letouzey.

I have made some changes a year ago, but was too busy to actually release something. Last week I have grabbed my DS recorded some sounds with Nitrotracker and put it all together to version 0.3.
<br/>
The last version had some problems on some devices, so I have made a compatibility table on my site. Please leave a reply if it works (or does not work) for you with a device and/or start method which isn't in the table.
<br/>
<br/>
The new version uses DLDI, but remember that this is only necessary for the bigger opening book and the new <span style="font-style: italic">auto save</span> feature.
<br/>

How about player vs. player instead of automatically versus the computer?  And, if so, how about wifi?  I know that's a lot to ask, but Wifi chess on the DS would be awesome.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Human vs. Human is a good idea, I will think about implementing this. Wifi would be awsome, but without an emulator which supports it, it is too much a hassle to implement it (considering my spare free time).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.vonloesch.de/dschess" target="_blank">DSChess</a> - A chess game for the Nintendo DS</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great homebrew.
<br/>
You can add the R4 to your Compatibility list. The auto saving works a treat with DLDI. One suggestion can you have some where on the options screen that the extra file book_small.bin has been detected and is being used.
<br/>
Keep up the good work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, this definitely is a great release.
<br/>
<br/>
A few suggestions if you don't mind.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd really like to see some ELO rating system.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I remember 25 years ago playing a chess game that featured a real time rating system based solely on the position of the pieces.  I have yet to see that again in all of the other games that I have purchased over the years.  It would give a score like -1.12 or something as an example meaning that basically you were down one pawn and your positional strength wasn't very good.  
<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever heard of such a point system and would it be possible to implement such a feature?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, it would be great to offer more customized features such as board coloring, chess pieces, removing the row and column headings, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I did a graphic hack for Chessmaster on the Gameboy Color a really long time ago.  You're more than welcomed to rip the customized sprites that I drew by hand.

My webpage is about 5 years old so don't expect much.  :o)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for offering such a great release.  The touch screen feature and the arrows for the last move look really good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually there is a point system build in and it is displayed at the top screen (100 points for a pawn down).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.vonloesch.de/dschess" target="_blank">DSChess</a> - A chess game for the Nintendo DS</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh cool!
<br/>
<br/>
Can't believe I overlooked your point scale system on the top screen before now.
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, any possible chance that you could point to a web page that describes this point scale system in more detail?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm really curious as to how it's implemented.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch!  :o)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
