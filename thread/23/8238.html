How often does the screenshot update? Do you think it could be made faster? (Is it resized client-side or server-side?).
<br/>
<br/>
Also... have you thought about using a different keyboard. That particular keyboard always makes me cringe. I suggest seeing about getting your hands on the DSLinux keyboard.

Now, all the more reason to get that wireless router...<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This app is really cool. Can I offer some suggestions for buttons?
<br/>
<br/>
Have a config option to ask whether or not you're a righty or a lefty. The controls here would be for a righty:
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;- ^ v and -&gt; should be for manual mouse movement. There should be a sprite for the mouse on the DS
<br/>
<br/>
L = Left mouse Click
<br/>
R = Right mouse Click
<br/>
<br/>
B = backspace
<br/>
A = enter
<br/>
Y = Mouse wheel Scroll Up
<br/>
X = Mouse wheel Scroll Down
<br/>
<br/>
Select = Zoom. It could toggle between a few settings..maybe first one could be VGA 1:1 (show pixel for Pixel, follow the mouse), second setting could be 2x zoom out, next one could be 4x zoom out, and the last could be full screen?
<br/>
<br/>
Start = Menu
<br/>
<br/>
The options would be inverted if, say, someone were a lefty?
<br/>
<br/>
I realize there's probably no real way to stream sound, but is that a possibility? 
<br/>
<br/>
*tries something crazy and tries to go into a DOS screen*
<br/>
Lol, yeah didn't think that would work :)
<br/>
<br/>
This is an awesome app, though. If only it could animate slightly faster than it already does.. But yeah.. cool app :) I would love to use my DS to "use" my computer away from my computer :)
<br/>
<br/>

Interface is great, refresh speed is ok for me !

I have some requests so:
<br/>
- some keys in virtual keyboard don't seem to work ( return, arrows ... )
<br/>
- When the virtual keyboard is activated, it would be great to have the PC screen on the top screen instead of having the keyboard on the screen !
<br/>
- Zoom would be awesome too :)
<br/>
- Notebook-touch-panel-like control for precise movements ( maybe only in zoom mode )
<br/>
- double-screen enabled, could we swap between two screens connected on a PC ?
<br/>
- mouse middle button :D</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sylfurd on Mon Jan 23, 2006 11:01 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I switched it down to .003 and now everything works perfectly. Someone else mentioned the limit on many routers to around 150 or so which of course 189 is well above. Guess this is a very important thing and will probably solve it for most people who arent having any luck.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Random suggestion. Why not add in a nice BIG movable/floating on-screen keyboard to the PC server side of the app that you could tap on rather than having to bring up the DS one? Something like the one you get by default with Tablet Edition. Basically VERY BIG (For viewing and typing when on the DS display) but I think it might feel a bit more natural and wouldnt rely quite so much on the tiny DS keyboard/accuracy.

<br/>
Its a bit fiddly at the moment. Especialy as for some reason delete dosnt work on mine.
<br/>
<br/>
Other surgestions:
<br/>
<br/>
*Customising DS buttons as hot-links to windows programs? (Windows Assability Magnifier, Notepad, WMP ect)
<br/>
Maybe this would work by having a little "favorate apps" thing sever side.
<br/>
<br/>
*An alternative to traditional keyboard entry could be a program like "Dasha". This would work very well with a stylus.
<br/>
This would be a major addition though, so its just an idea.
<br/>
<br/>
*A simple sound when you click with the mouse.
<br/>
<br/>
* Refresh FPS meter (I am just curious how many seconds an update takes and how my pc/wireless set ups effect it)
<br/>
<br/>
* Feature on the sever to automaticaly make the pc desktop smaller (and returns to the old setting when you exit)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I gave my ideal control scheme. how about we talk about the kinds of things that the DS program will allow you to configure?
<br/>
<br/>
Some of the options you should probably be able to choose:
<br/>
-Every single Key
<br/>
-Mouse Wheel Up and Down
<br/>
-Cursor Key (Left, Down, Up, Right)
<br/>
-volume control up or down, or Mute
<br/>
-Run Custom Program (an option to include separate EXE would appear)
<br/>
-Shutdown computer
<br/>
-Restart computer
<br/>
-Logoff
<br/>
-Media Stop
<br/>
-Media Play
<br/>
-Media Next
<br/>
-Media Previous
<br/>
-Media Pause

Tapping into dual monitor stuff to suit the DS would be pretty cool. I wonder if it's possible...

I'm thinking that it would be more efficient if these button configurations were handled on the PC end?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">just wanted to throw in my 2 cents :)
<br/>
<br/>
1. using the Top screen for a zoomed image while having the bottom remain the same ( possible clearer image, but the zoom would take care of that )
<br/>
<br/>
2. using the D-pad up and down as the mouse SCROLL wheel, (help on web sites)
<br/>
<br/>
3. switch mouse clicks to D-pad left and right ( easier on the hand )
<br/>
<br/>
4. more colors
<br/>
<br/>
5. Save setting to SRAM
<br/>
<br/>
6. MOST IMPORTANT . 
<br/>
Thank you for a great app :)<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just don't give me any credit for it.. I'm only an ideas man and one that is thankful for all the great coders the DS has (I must learn to code on the DS lol).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I was just thinking config stored on the PC side would also make it easier on compatibility / configuration as you wouldn't have to save anything to the DS flashcard/SRAM (Which has been painful for most homebrew developers on SD/CF/Flash Memory).
<br/>
<br/>
How about this for an idea...
<br/>
Break the touch screen down into blocks and allow configuration per block (for things like media player controls) add in a feature to upload any jpeg over it to the DS and people could start designing custom controls.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I diversified too much.. possiabilities seem endless
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway thanks again for the update and keep up the good code as you can see it's very much appreciated!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Why don't you make a to-do list of things that are planned? Or at least list off the suggestions you like, and the ones you dislike...that way you don't get many people repeating the same thing. That way those ideas won't be repeated a million times over.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Thats a very good idea actualy, its slightly off on mine as well.

<br/>
Another option is having the desktop zoomed in, but scrollable...kinda like windows does sometimes. (when the desktop res is higher then the moniter res).
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this would probably take up more bandwidth, as it would be sending more then the DS screens worth of information each time.

<br/>
It is (of course) possible to use the Windows API to capture an image of a single window.

This would be extremely useful for reasons which I can't exactly think how to explain, but I think we all understand with a bit of thought...

(Bigger image, no wasted space, zoom in and out by resizing Window through Windows, scrollbar and window menu always at the same position on screen, no unused/unuseable image content is transfered, and more).

Of course, we would also need a crafty way to switch windows or resume full desktop view, but that wouldn't be too complicated. (I think).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Genius idea!
<br/>
<br/>
You could simple have L/R buttoms to switch active windows.
<br/>
Kinda like a DS equivelent of "ALT+TAB"
<br/>
<br/>
The active window would automaticaly appeared cropped and scaled on the DS screen.
<br/>
The PC could do all the work here indeed, the DS would only need to send the requests. (as always).
<br/>
<br/>
Youd keep the zoomed out mode, naturely, but I get the feeling most people would just have it perminately on the "Just Active Window" view.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to kind of capture to a sort of movie format, and use a codec that would be easily decoded on the DS? Do you suppose it would be too CPU intensive to render a 256x192 window that followed a centered mouse movement that say, the DS's bottom screen could follow? I guess perhaps you wouldn't be able to have a "full screen" mode animating the same way on the upper screen in that case, because of the CPU power that it would need.
<br/>
<br/>
You wouldn't need to decode at  a high framerate, though hell even at most, 10fps would be great (if it were even possible, that is)
<br/>
<br/>
There's gotta be a faster alternative to rendering JPEGs..<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Server IP: 192.168.1.151

The DS can connect to the SoftAP. After entering the password, it shows a menu "Virtual Desktop" and "Disconnect". I choose "Virtual Desktop". Now it freezes with 2 black screens.

The server window on the PC says:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, one lossless (I believe it is this, because pictures of the same resolution are the same size), BMP, screenshot of UT2k4 at 320x200 resolution is 187 Kilobytes 
<br/>
<br/>
"...in practice the maximum 802.11b throughput that an application can achieve is about 5.9 Mbit/s over TCP and 7.1 Mbit/s over UDP." - Wikipedia
<br/>
<br/>
Since we're using UDP, the transfer speed is .888MB/s, not that great of network speed, considering top of the line wired can hit 125<span style="font-weight: bold">M</span>B/s 141 times the DS's maximum theoretical transfer rate. But most of you are probably on what is typically reffered to as 100Mbps which is 12.5 MB/s, still 14.1 times the transfer rate of the DS, which is a significant FPS increase if the DS is only doing 1 FPS (which it isn't.) 
<br/>
<br/>
The maximum refresh rate of the DS- sending lossless files @ 320x200 resolution is...- 4.862631016043 FPS, which is unnacceptable for ANY game. 
<br/>
<br/>
So lets see if we can solve this connundrum. 
<br/>
<br/>
First, we'll take the file and see what we can do to it. 
<br/>
<br/>
I know what all you buzz-worders are thinking 'COMPRESS COMPRESS DAMNIT ZOMG COMPRESS &gt;_&gt;' But no, let's try to stay away from that, compression eats up precious CPU cycles, which could be used on some serious fragging- I mean, hell, the reason we're doing this is so we can get good graphics on the DS without waiting for NST to remove their heads from their anuses, and release MP:H already. ;-;
<br/>
<br/>
What we'll do first is lower the resolution of the file, I mean, why waste good storage space, or transfer speed as it may be. 
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://bigopinionstudios.com/original.bmp" target="_blank">http://bigopinionstudios.com/original.bmp</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Yup, the opening UT2k4 screenshot in it's original glory.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://bigopinionstudios.com/256192.bmp" target="_blank">http://bigopinionstudios.com/256192.bmp</a>
<br/>
<br/>
And that's the slightly squished one made in paint.
<br/>
<br/>
It should look normal on the DS, but there are several other options for clipping off those pixels- removing an equal amount from each side, or running the game in a resolution that can be properly scaled to one of the DS's screens- those of you astute in math and common resolutions have probably realized that if you turn the DS sideways, it's 512x384. this is true, but who wants a big line in the middle of UT?
<br/>
<br/>
You're probably wondering what kind of FPS you would get with the 256x192 image, it's not much better.  6.1667, as opposed to 5.9 something, it's not much, but it's something, we'll keep working with the 256x192 image, just to save the DS some processing power. 
<br/>
<br/>
One option is making it black and white, though not particularly pretty, I'm estimating that it could at least DOUBLE the FPS, let's try. 
<br/>
<br/>
Ok,... here,... it,... comes.
<br/>
<br/>
[size=huge]147 FPS!!!![/size]
<br/>
<br/>
Yup, you could pull off 147 FPS with uncompressed, black and white images AT the DS's resoultion. Cut out a few of the cycles for drawing, controls, and wireless and you're all set! Right? 
<br/>
<br/>
No,.. 
<br/>
<br/>
Wrong,...
<br/>
<br/>
Very very wrong. 
<br/>
<br/>
Click the following image to see why you are wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://bigopinionstudios.com/bw.bmp" target="_blank">http://bigopinionstudios.com/bw.bmp</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Yup, nothing. 
<br/>
<br/>
Let's try that on another screenshot.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://bigopinionstudios.com/2561922.bmp" target="_blank">http://bigopinionstudios.com/2561922.bmp</a>
<br/>
<br/>
A bit more bright.. not the original, but you know what I did to it.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://bigopinionstudios.com/bw2.bmp" target="_blank">http://bigopinionstudios.com/bw2.bmp</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Nope, no black and white- at least not through MSPaint's compression, I've nothing else at my disposal though, so it shall have to do.
<br/>
<br/>
How about file compressions. There is one that sticks out, far above the rest, blending unmatched quality with a filesize that is perfect for transfer to the DS.

<br/>
<br/>
True, it requires more processing power, but if it sends at twice the speed of any other of the file formats, but temporarily takes up only half of the RAM of any of the other types, I believe it's defianatley the way to go as far as compressions are concerned. 
<br/>
<br/>
The final send speed of JPEG is 85 FPS, and I'd settle for half that, wouldn't you? rawr.
<br/>
<br/>

I'd love that speed :)
<br/>
Actually max speed for the DS is less thatn 1/5 of that: DS can connect up to 2 not the maximum 802.11b speed (11), thet would be 2/11 of that, so let's say .153MB/s.

I turn off WEP, put in 192.168.0.100 for the server address as reported by ipconfig, 192.168.2.11 for the DS's address as reported by the router when I use Nintendo WFC, and set the default gateway to 192.168.0.1 as also reported by ipconfig. There's nothing listed under DNS suffix, so I just leave that as it is... start it up, enter the password (blank, since I'm just testing), and it never connects. The DS doesn't even show up in the router's list of connections.
<br/>
<br/>
What I have is my PC, connected to an ordinary router, connected to a wireless router/DSL modem. This works fine for NWFC, but I can't seem to get any homebrew wifi apps to work. They can all find the AP just fine, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Seriously, I understand that your accesspoint is set at 192.168.2.1, your normal router at 192.168.0.1 and your pc running the server on 192.168.0.100?
<br/>
<br/>
If so, try setting the gateway to 192.168.2.1 being the accesspoint's IP. Basically, you're telling your DS which IP to consult first, which (in line) is your accesspoint/router, who knows that the destination IP (192.168.0.100) is located behind the normal router on 192.168.0.1 and will thus forward your DS's messages to the normal router (who will then forward it to your PC, etc)

I'm wondering if the M3 isn't setting some bit or something (although why it would work on occasion is a mystery). Unfortunately, I can't find the Nibbles DS source, so I can't check for any differences myself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was having the same issue.  Mine was hanging on "Waiting..." regardless of what I put in for a password, but if I entered no password at all (on my DS), it immediately gave me the rejected password message.  I tried starting a server without a password and it still rejected my password when I put it in blank.
<br/>
<br/>
Then I realized that I'm an idiot.  So if this is pretty much your problem too, CubeGuy, maybe all you need to do is pop your WiFi game in and manually set up your connection.  I guess Win2DS can't handle DHCP.  ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure someone else has already posted about that (it probably says it right in the readme I didn't look at).  So if you're smarter than I am and already had that much figured out, I'm sorry for wasting your time!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If the problem you're having is with the touchscreen not registering any input, you should say so in your post, instead of just vaguely complaining. I had the same problem on my M3SD.

Made by 2 different developers.

<br/>
The main differences (currently, at least) are that Win2DS allows you to set the speed of the updates (and set them as none), and map the keys of the DS "on the fly", without having to touch the pc. This allows for some games to be played far from the pc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Buy a router, put your DS and the router in a Faraday cage so that the Wi-Fi signals don't interfere, and then configure the router. Or wait until vacation to do this.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

If you're on campus, you'll have to be able to prove to the university's IT department that accessing your desktop from your DS is necessary to completing your course-related responsibilities. Is this the case?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

-Windows runs slower than a snail carrying a boulder uphill through a stream of molasses when the server is running. It takes like 30 seconds to move the mouse!
<br/>
-The client doesn't give any notification when disconnected.

-It disconnects after the first refresh (which takes about 20 seconds)
<br/>
-After you stop the server it won't work until you close and re-open it. The client has the same problem.
<br/>
-The server always disappears to the tray as soon as it's started, making stopping it that much harder.
<br/>
-The mouse jumps around at random. Specifically it likes to jump far away as it nears the "Close Server" button, which is especially bad with the unbearable lag.

I don't know how well it works with different programs, it sends Virtual Keystrokes, so Windows programs will most likely work while more specialized or console-based programs may not. They all should work but it's Windows so who knows!

The zoomed view is a full 1 to 1 zoom, so every pixel on the PC is a a pixel on the DS. If you notice, shrinking down the screen distorts the picutre in any case (you can see the colors a bit messed up on the full-screen view), so it'd look bad shrunk to any extent, and then I'd have to hear people complain about that (just kidding, but not really). That distortion is caused by Windows (everything is Windows' fault!) because I use a built-in Windows function to make the JPG's.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, I am pretty much done with the project in any case. I may take another stab at using TCP for the screenshots (my last try was a horrible failture), but other than that I am planning on finishing up what's there and releasing the source soon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How do I do this; do I need to write up a driver for my imaginary hardware? I also looked at DS2Key but all the downloads except one (which has no source code) were hosted on one of those godforsaken file sharing sites and now no longer exist, and I think it just emulates a keyboard anyway.

Theres no excuse for anyone with reasonable pc knowledge to "just accept"  Vista, especialy as its almost certainly going to be replaced in 2 years or less.

Either dont buy a pre-built pc, or downgrade your os.

As for scrollwheels, guess so.

But Wacoms are certainly pressure sensitive.

And Im sure many joysticks have speed throatals that are another axis...and, indeed, under the joystick settings on custom, it can go upto

that doesnt help with licences.
<br/>
<br/>
However, surely Microsoft wont stop Windows XP licences until Windows 'Vienna'</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got a legal copy of Windows95 Windows2000.
<br/>
I dont plan on chucking them away.
<br/>
<br/>
And, if they broke, and my back-ups did too, Id download.
<br/>
Keeping the disc as proof of purchase.
<br/>
<br/>
I dont care if microsoft thinks thats illegal, I didnt sign any contract of expiration when buying those OS's so theres no way im going to be forced to upgrade.
<br/>
<br/>
I see no reason for people to give up and give in because microsoft tells them its inevitable.
<br/>
Vista's not going to last 2 years at most before another one comes along anyway.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there any way to disable the timeout in this otherwise great bit of software?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm finding that if I connect to my PC from the DS immediately on starting the server then all is well, but then if I leave it for a while the connection times out.
<br/>
<br/>
Coversely, if I start the server software on the PC but don't immediately connect from the DS then try and connect later, it either times out or gives a 'partial' connection where the screen displayed is either blank, incomplete or non-interactive.
<br/>
