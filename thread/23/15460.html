Since you're using textured quads, are you able to squeeze the graphics down to fit entirely on the DS screen or is it cropped like jEnesis?  I suppose I'll find out when I try the emu later tonight, but I can't wait!

Also (especially if you're able to squish the resolution) have you considered extending this emu to work with CPS1 or other similar arcade architectures?

<br/>
@mortys - The converter is basically a stripped down version of MAME, so can you try running your game with your bios in MAME?  If it doesn't work in MAME, it won't work in neods.  In the future, I may try to make things less picky, but using MAME was the easiest way to support all the different stupid encryption/protection stuff that newer games have.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;btw, i had to convert games with -bios1 option ;)
<br/>
Sounds like I have a bug in the converter.  It is supposed to default to -bios1, but it sounds like it is not including a bios at all if none is specified.  Easy fix for now is to always specify a bios =)
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Since you're using textured quads, are you able to squeeze the graphics down to fit entirely on the DS screen
<br/>
Yup =)
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Also (especially if you're able to squish the resolution) have you considered extending this emu to work with CPS1 or other similar arcade architectures?
<br/>
I like CPS1 and CPS2, and I think they could probably be done (although I haven't done much research so I could be wrong).  I don't have any plans to work on this at the moment, but maybe someday.  Or if someone else wants to have a go, they are free to use NeoDS as a starting point.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, but it wouldn't help much.  The graphics are all hardware accelerated, so they are fast.  Emulating the CPU is one of the main bottle necks.  Streaming game content from the FAT file system is the other.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It seems like people are getting pretty widely varied results when it comes to compatibility.  Of the games already listed by some people as not working that I've played with no trouble are KoF'98 (yay!), the World Heroes games, Sonic Wings 2 (ironically, it has no sound, though), Andros Dunos, Prehistoric Isle 2, Ninja COmmando, Twinkle Star Sprites (slowdown is serious--though it was always pretty bad) and Windjammers.  However, I've been unable to get Metal Slug X working and that's reported as a working game by others (it goes to the title screen then reboots continually).

Is this related to what version of MAME your ROMset is from perhaps?  I don't know if Neo Geo games are susceptible to that, but with a lot of MAME ROMs, they change a bit from version to version.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem with people getting "the grid" is that wed on't yet have access to the service buttons and dipswitches, so the games are booting into a service mode and we can't get out of it.  The games I've had this in are Metal Slug 4 and Last Blade 2.  It'd be nice to have control of the dipswitches and service buttons on the touchscreen anyway for adjusting difficulty and things like that.  Options to pause emulation and reset the game would also be useful.
<br/>
<br/>
This is an amazing emulator.  ingramb, you've just upped the value of my DS by about a thousandfold.  Last Blade, KoF'98 and Blazing Star alone will certainly now become my three favorite "DS" games.  Thanks so much.
<br/>
<br/>
If using slot-2 RAM to load ROMs could up the framerate by even 5fps, that would push the vast majority of games to fullspeed, though I don't personally find the 50fps most currently hover around all that annoying anyway.  I thought I would, but they really feel fine.

Could you please post the romset name/filesize/chksum/sfv of KOF98 that you're using? the name/size/chksum/sfv of the NEOGEO.zip bios you're using would be helpful too, along with the -bios# version you're using with NeoDSConvert.
<br/>
<br/>
That could help us narrow down the bugs to whether we're using the wrong ROMsets, or the wrong bios, or the wrong bios# switch for the conversion.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">&gt; we should put up a comprehensive list of which games work properly and which doesn't
<br/>
If anyone wants to maintain a compatibility list, I would appreciate it =)
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; mayvbe if you emulate the Neo CD (less game but less ram use)
<br/>
The NeoCD has 7MB of ram, which can all be accessed by the CPU as far as I can tell, so it would probably require slot2 ram.  It probably wouldn't do much better than a version of NeoDS which uses slot2 ram to cache more data (which is comming).  I still *may* add CD support at some point.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Anyone fancy knocking together a Makefile for the converter so it'll compile under Linux?
<br/>
I am sadly Linux illiterate, but it shouldn't be too hard.  All the dependicies should be included.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; It seems like people are getting pretty widely varied results when it comes to compatibility.
<br/>
Indeed.  I personally can't make kof98 work with the current version, but I know it used to work for me during development.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Is this related to what version of MAME your ROMset is from perhaps? I don't know if Neo Geo games are susceptible to that, but with a lot of MAME ROMs, they change a bit from version to version.
<br/>
It could be.  It's possible that the converter may be outputing .neo files even if the game isn't converted properly (because it's not a compatible dump for example).  The whole thing is kinda hacked together...it really needs better error checking.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I think the problem with people getting "the grid" is that wed on't yet have access to the service buttons and dipswitches, so the games are booting into a service mode and we can't get out of it.
<br/>
I *think* you get the "grid" when a game fails certain tests that it may run on boot.  I will have to look into this more.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; It'd be nice to have control of the dipswitches and service buttons on the touchscreen anyway for adjusting difficulty and things like that
<br/>
Yah, I will do this.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Options to pause emulation and reset the game would also be useful.
<br/>
Pause -&gt; hit Load Rom menu
<br/>
Unpause -&gt; hit cancel
<br/>
Reset -&gt; reload the same rom
<br/>
I agree that ACTUAL options for these would be nice though =)
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If using slot-2 RAM to load ROMs could up the framerate by even 5fps
<br/>
I am experimenting with this now, and so far it's not helping a lot, but it is smoothing out some choppiness.  Even with slot2 ram, there's still only 512k of VRAM for sprite graphics.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

All my MAME ROMs are merged, so I don't know which particular ROM got converted.  In fact I was wondering about that, does the NeoDsConvert app smartly take just the files needed for the parent version or am I getting some bloat in my .NEO ROMs because they include the files for clone versions as well?  I converted 60 ROMs and they totalled 1.6GB of .NEO files.  At least I was finally able to put that ridiculous 7GB of storage in my DS to use.
<br/>
<br/>
I also discovered that the BIOS files were also merged into my Neo Geo ROMs, so since I don't have Internet access at home, I had to put together my own neogeo.zip by taking files out of the ROM ZIPs that looked like they must be for the BIOS.  I'll have to track down an "official" neogeo.zip file and see how the one I put together compares.  Mine had 10 files in it.
<br/>
<br/>
I used the -bios1 switch for all the ROMs I converted.
<br/>
<br/>
My ROMset is for MAME v0.100u1 (which is old, I know, but I hated having to deal with updating things every time a new version came out so I stuck with that one since it was a nice round number).
<br/>
<br/>
I'll post some more info later when I get off work.  How can I calculate the checksum?  Is there a recommended program?
<br/>
<br/>
I played KoF'98 pretty extensively last night since it's such a great game, so there seems to be no problem with it if you do whatever I did right.

Had a quick look online, fsum from SlavaSoft seems to be a decent candidate for a checksum tool.  I used to use WinSFV to create .SFV files, but I'm not sure it's freely available.  I think even the filesize of your romset will be very helpful to the good folks.

<br/>
<br/>
And why not, there is any possibilitie to access to dipswitches menu (to change difficult, language, change coinage and activate blood in games?)?

<br/>
Finally this is a recopiled compatibility list taking personal results and a lot of results from another people on this forums and another forums (elotrolado, gbaYARR, ds-scene):

Is it possible that perhaps you could allow for manual screen stretching?
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, we only have two options (normal, and Stretch(?)), it would be better if by pressing R trigger continously would increase(slowly) untill it fits everything on top screen.
<br/>
<br/>
You could set L trigger to do the opposite in that it decreases(slowly) untill it goes back to the normal screen setting.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps its not possible but if that makes things better than current full-screen fit then I am sure it could be worth it as setting the screen stretching to 90% could look better.
<br/>
<br/>
Or in other words, could please give control over how much we want to stretch out, rather fixed settings.

If you get the green screen, then it's probably not a BIOS file problem, so I would guess that there's something wrong with your ROMs.  How many ROMs have you tried?  If you've tried a lot including ones that everyone agrees are working, then I would suggest getting new ROM files.

Agreed, that would be a better default layout.  Nintendo just has some sort of silly tradition about laying out their buttons backwards.  Allowing custom button mapping is definitely the best option, though.  All emus should allow that, in my opinion.

If you use the Unibios (try -bios10 or -bios11 when converting ROMs, though not all neogeo.zip files include the Unibios ROM) you can change the region, MVS/AES and dipswitch settings via an ingame menu.  I'm going to have to rebuild all the ROMs I made earlier, but using Unibios this time.
<br/>
<br/>
ingramb, is there a reason why you designed the emu to look for a single BIOS ROM inside the game ROMs themselves rather than just looking for NEOGEO.ZIP and then letting the user choose which BIOS they want to use?

The UniBIOS file should be named uni-bios.11 in order to work (or uni-bios.10 with the -bios9 switch, I suppose).  I could only find uni-bios.12, but I just renamed it and that worked fine.

They must be trying to ride Nintendo's coattails is all I can think.  It was especially confusing in the case of the Jaguar because it had three buttons labeled C, B, A (plpus Z, Y, X if you had the ProController).  Two doesn't seem so bad usually, but three?

My most played console is the Dreamcast and I've found it pretty difficult adjusting to the DS.  I'm constantly hitting the wrong button in menus and stuff.

<br/>
Thank you for this Neo Geo AES/MVS Emulator NeoDS! I'm so glad you released this emulator to the non worthy public! For how good NeoDS runs for a first version I feel I have no right to ask for any fixes or improvements, but feel you need to be praised for setting the level of DS development bar higher. I hope this puts pressure on the other people who develop other emulators on the DS to get their code to run faster/better!

<br/>
It's so funny to see regulars on this forum posting questions that can be figured out if they read the readme .txt with the NeoDS. I hope these people don't discourage you from further development. I don't know what's so hard about downloading MAME and checking the Neo Geo roms with that before moving onto your NeoDS emulator. If the Neogeo game it don't work on MAME it don't work on NeoDS.

Good luck on the rest of NeoDS! Thank you for your hard work! I wish I could program and help you with your emulator but I don't know how to.  I hope your emulation style will get other authors to fix up their slow running emulators! Seeing Metal Slug running almost full speed vs the Macra MAME DS of Digdug with massive slowdown puts all the other emulators guys to hang their heads in shame. Same with the game Viewpoint on the Genesis jEnesisDS that has slow down and massive audio issues (not to mention this is not thier first update either) vs NeoDS where it doesn't skip a frame and no slow down at all on the first version of NeoDS! Amazing!

Yeah how does NeoDS run so fast when snemulds and other emulators barely run at a good frame rate? I think whatever technique Ingram is doing should be adopted by the developers who make jEnesisDS (which I think is a VERY good emulator too.) SnemuDS. (Which I don't think will ever get updated anymore.) NeoDS shows that any system equal to or lesser than the Neo Geo MVS CAN be emulated on the anemic DS hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Indeed, this was the post that got me thinking... (And I've read most other posts on the internet that say NeoGeo will never work on the DS.  These were good motivation =)
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Genesis jEnesisDS that has slow down and massive audio issues
<br/>
The Sega Genesis and the Neo Geo are actually pretty different.  The Neo Geo's power comes from its massive amounts of memory.  Besides that, it is a pretty simple, straightforward system.  The Genesis has much less memory, but it is a lot trickier.  Game programmers used lots of dirty tricks to make special effects work on the Genesis, where on the Neo Geo, they would just add more sprite frames.
<br/>
<br/>
So besides the memory issue, I think the Genesis is a more difficult system to emulate than the Neo Geo, and jEnesisDS really is quite impressive.  The audio may be imperfect, but it's emulating 6 FM channels.  FM sound is much more expensive to emulate than the digital audio used by Neo Geo (but it uses way less ram).
<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I would love to see more good emulators for the DS.  And if NeoDS inspires or encourages people to create them, all the better.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT
<br/>
&gt; I think whatever technique Ingram is doing
<br/>
Again, the main trick of NeoDS is managing massive Neo Geo games within the small DS ram.  SNES and Sega Genesis have different problems to solve.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah I agree Lordus, jEnesisDS does NOT have frame rate issues. Also "massive audio issues?" What is that guy smoking? NeoDS and jEnesisDS are both great examples of DS homebrew. I play both almost daily now.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, Lordus is it possible for jEnesisDS to implement scaling like in NeoDS? It seems that scaling on NeoDS does not create too big of a speed hit. I know that 90%+ of games do not really need it, (and it makes them more ulgy) but it would be nice to have for the odd game that you really need to see 100% of the screen for.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry ingramb, i didn't really want to talk about this in your release thread, so i try to make it quick: Absolutely not. The Neo Geo and Genesis graphics work completely differently. The Neo Geo has just 1 BG layer that is fixed, and everything else is a lot of sprites. the Genesis has 2 BG layers of variable sizes with per tile priority, so that you practically get 4 planes + 2 sprite planes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Amen! Lets all get to work and make good stuff! Thanks Mr. Ingram on your info! I hope to read my dummies guide to programing book I just got today. Learning to program seems like it will take longer to master than it did for me to clear a game like Metal Slug. I don't think it will be easy but your inspiration will help!
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and to the guy asking me what I was smoking.. Nothing.  I didn't mean to get on a whole NEoDS vs brand X DS emulator thing (I'm sure the MAME guy is crying why no one is sticking up for his work). Just Neo DS is a good comparison on why releasing an emulator early in developmental stages will causes massive headaches for the creator vs. if they just held on to it for a year and made it run solid. Think of all the people who posted threads and discussions on why emulaotr X  don't play game X and how the can't get full FPS on game X. Waist of time for people who code things and will just put them off from updating. Also it adds to the list another emulators that is not completed. Who is going to want to make another emulator when there are already 1 or 2 half way finished emulators released? I just wanted to give Mr. Ingram some credit.<span style="font-weight: bold"> There won't be another Neo Geo emulator for the DS. Mr. Ingram did it and it's pretty much done</span> and just needs some tweaking.

Sorry, but you're way off.
<br/>
<br/>
It's actually kind of grating seeing things like this said over and over again now.
<br/>
<br/>
It's been touched on already, and I'm not sure anyone will take me seriously when I say this but I'll try anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
NeoDS isn't doing using special techniques that will apply to the so-called "slow" emulators you've mentioned. It's using tweaked versions of publicly available CPU interpreters (and jEnesisDS's 68k interpreter is faster than Cyclone, never mind its Z80 interpreter vs DrZ80). NeoGeo is just a good fit for Nintendo DS. Actually, it's a good fit for emulation in general. In fact NeoGeo emulation has always done comparatively better than say, SNES emulation. It's true on PSP and GP2X, it was even true on PCs.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason for this is because it's just more straightforward to emulate. The graphics are a fixed (non-scrolling) plane which means that it can be rendered in software efficiently (lots of aligned burst writes) or easily using the DS's 2D hardware. The rest of the graphics are a bunch of sprites, which are also more efficient to render than background layers, and fit very well with 3D acceleration, which is what NeoDS is doing. The biggest complication is in caching sprites, but this is a problem for most emulators on DS.
<br/>
<br/>
The 68k is clocked higher than Genesis's, but that's all it's emulating on the ARM9 (and a 12MHz 68k isn't actually as fast as a lot of people think it is, the processor has terrible cycle timings). jEnesisDS is emulating both the 68k and Z80 on the Genesis and is dealing with mid-frame events/raster effects and other things which don't fit that well on DS hardware. Sure, if NeoDS dealt with FM audio and raster effects it'd be more on the same level of complexity, but it doesn't. NeoGeo's library is smaller and more forgiving of these missing features, I guess.
<br/>
<br/>
Lordus already addressed this but it's especially unfair to start comparing scaling when it's something you can easily fit on DS hardware and the same just can't be done for Genesis emulation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not even thinking about the emulator stuff here, but the loading stuff. NeoDS is streaming a whole fuck-tonne of data from the SD card to RAM really fast. Now, QuakeII's got a bit of a problem streaming textures fast enough for them to get rendered during animations. Could the libfat hacks used in NeoDS get ported here, or is QuakeII's bottleneck the write speed of the slot-2 RAM? These are important questions! :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't mean DS-X for gameplay but as NeoDS stream a lot of data, I was wondering if the Nan access will not be faster tha "classic" fat.
<br/>
<br/>
@Warlock
<br/>
QuakeII Ds, use extra-ram which is very slow, so even the streaming is fast, the data transfer is limited by the memory you got (Mine is supercard and is very, very slow...); So i'don't think we'll gain any real speed for texturing with a poor memory expansion.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Whoa, this one came out of the blue! I didn't think it was possible because only the early games would fit in the RAM, but after the introduction of streaming in the PSP NeoGeo and CPS2 emulators (some MVS and CPS2 roms are too big even for the PSP), it never crossed my mind the same technique could allow Neo Geo emulators on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Since Ingram was kind enough to make the source available, I guess it's only a matter of time until someone writes a CPS2 emulator. The CPU is the same (a 68k and a Z80). The video chip is different (it has 3 scrolling BG layers and 900 sprites), but seems straightforward (no BG priority madness) and well suited for the DS: it might be possible to use the DS 2D hardware to emulate the BGs and the 3D to emulate the sprites. The only issue would be the resolution (384x224), which is even higher than the NeoGeo's (320x224).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Also, with all those BG layers you wouldn't be able to scale them in hardware anymore. Somehow I think clipping 384 down to 256 is going to hurt the experience a little.
<br/>
<br/>
CPS2 is decently higher clocked for both CPUs, and I think that 12MHz is already pushing past the limits of what NeoDS can do fullspeed (based on what I hear of various games not quite making it). CPS 1/2 games also actually use their FM synth (or at least Street Fighter 2 does)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes. Start the game holding ABX (ABC in NeoGeo) for entering the uni-bios setup. Midgame START+SELECT opens the cheat menu, but only uni-bios 1.2 does have working SELECT button.

Hey Ingramb, 1.1a doesn't work in my SCCF. Just a white top screen and black bottom one. 1.0 worked ok.
<br/>
Am i missing something?

Do you plan enabling the LR shoulder buttons? I would like to have AB and CD on them.

"Costuming" the uni-bios.23 and rename to unibios.10 patch a game and worked Kof98 "Like" here but could not access the cheats or pause or anything of that (or set the console to a format in specific) but! I patched World 2Jet and what was my surprise ALL WORK! (and is NOTreset!) I decided to test the metal slug 1 and was no longer Freeze to throw grenades and indeed some improved graphics (not always those of pixels) but need to do more tests to see what happens ..

Perhaps with this BIOS patches to improve the performance of the games more problematic to see if there are improvements .... I for my part I will check ..

I know you should have already think of it but I want to share my idea. Maybe the HUD butg in the MS's is due to a bad palette update after the flash when you kill a boss or a mini-boss ?
<br/>
<br/>
I've got another suggestion for next relases. Maybe you can automaticaly turn off the second screen after loading a rom  and mlaybe offer the chance to choose the rendering screen ?

This is likely the case.  I fiddled with the palette stuff a bit in 0.1.1, and I fixed last blade 2's gui, but obviously it's not perfect yet.

What ingramb said is try removing your slot-2 flash cart while the emulator is running and after you've been playing the game for a little while.  If the slot-2 RAM is being used, you should get some graphical corruption.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried this with my G6 Lite and I do get the corruption, so I guess G6 is working as RAM.  However, like others have reported with other slot-2 carts, I can no longer run the emu from my G6 as of version 1.1.  It was working fine in 1.0, though.

<br/>
To access the BIOS settings like the region, console/arcade or dipswitches, press A+B+C (that's A+B+X on the DS) while the UniBIOS splash screen is showing.  To open the ingame menu with cheats and debug dipswitches press START+A+B+C (not easy on a DS Lite) at any time in the game.
<br/>
<br/>
It should be possible to enter the ingame menu by pressing START+SELECT, but the DS Select button doesn't work with higher versions of the UniBIOS.  I think this is because UniBIOS 1.3 or higher identifies the system as an AES (older versions identified it as a 1-slot MVS), but in the emu the Select button is programmed to act as an MVS coin slot, not the AES Select button.

I did not know (Always have the expansion in my lite) as mentioned would be a good idea to know whether this is working with some "warning" (although whether that makes it through this recomendation)

I "testing" to learn how to use other bios already mentioned that as there are some games (I mention) as the "World Heroes" (any of the 4) that normally do not work without bios V2+ While not working properly .. cant play in Arcade mode already playable ..

And in some other games the list of cheats is more comprehensive .. Which although I'm not very supportive for some games is a good support (in console mode) ..

While it could just be a bad BIOS image like McNasty suggested, my guess is that NeoDS will not work on a Games'n'Music card because of the way it has to stream data directly off the microSD.  Try another BIOS image before giving up, though.

Yeah I know the hardware is extremely slow. It just doesn't transfer data very quickly at all. I think the most impressive thing I've seen work on it was ScummVM. Obviously Commercial roms are out of the question, even if there was a work around. Because of the speed issue, so I don't know if these will work now that I think about it. I'll try again and see if I can work it out.<br/>_________________<br/>Games n Music Homebrew:

I think DiggerMan is the only Neo Geo homebrew currently working in NeoDS.  There's quite a few other Neo homebrews, though, including some pretty nice games.  It'd be really nice to get them working in NeoDS.  I think the only reason they're not working already is that they're not included in the official MAME ROMset.  Just looking at the neodrvr.cpp file, it doesn't seem like it would be too hard to add the needed info for the handful of homebrew games.

Last night I tested out all the homebrews I had by just renaming the files so that the converter thought they were Diggerman.  All worked except Neo no Panepon where the blocks didn't show up.  I know the original Panel de Pon on the SNES used some sort of sneaky backgrounds-cum-sprites technique to draw the blocks, so maybe the Neo version is doing something similar that NeoDS currently doesn't support.  Or maybe it's because of the hacky way I tried to get it to work.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll post up some file lists later when I get home.

Sorry, I meant Commercial NDS roms, not Neo Geo. But that brings up piracy, so we obviously can't talk about it here. No, I think it might be the Neo Geo Bios rom. I'm pretty sure the game roms are good. My friend used them in a pc emulator, (mame?)  so yeah I don't know what the problem is, but like I said I think it's the bios, and unless I get a known working one, I'm just gonna give up on this endeavor. I'm starting to think this might not work on the GnM even if it's all 100%.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I read somewhere that the Games'n'Music operates totally differently from most or all other slot-1 flash cards.  It accesses the microSD through the EEPROM bus rather than the regular game ROM bus or something like that, so its data access is about 1/4 the speed of other cards.

If they're trustworthy, why not? My father had no problem with ordering parts for me from the net more than 10 years ago(I'm 23 now); I just gave him cash, and he'd allow use of his credit card for internet purchases.

No, I think it's more to do with how easy it is to hook an SD card to the SPI (EEPROM) port of SLOT-1. The Neoflash MK2/3 did the same thing.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I got to work this morning and was trying to look up info on some things in the drivers that I didn't understand when I discovered the source to MAME Plus!, which already has drivers for all the Neo Geo homebrews, so you might as well use those.

<br/>
Get MAME Plus! source here:

I was never able to get music working in Jonas Indiana or Blut Engels, nor the block graphics to appear in Neo no Panepon, so hopefully using the drivers form MAME Plus! will get those all working.  I see that there's also a couple demos in there that I hadn't heard of.

I mean, maybe some DLDI drivers use DMA. If the hardware is like M3, which uses the same address space for IO and RAM, with some commands for switching mode, you could get corrupted results.
<br/>
<br/>
See the RAM unlocking API thread, page 7, simonjhall question at the bottom:

Test #1: 
<br/>
I have just tested World Heroes 2, whilst the lifebars and text etc. are now as they should be. Previosly, they were blacked out, now, there seems to be a new problem which has only been introduced by the new version. 
<br/>
<br/>
Background is moving as I am moving my character. Might only be with this game. Will test more. 
<br/>
<br/>
Test #2: 
<br/>
I have now tested Garou, from a minute spent on this game, it does not seem to be affected by it. Probably just the WH2. Will update this post as I test more and more. 
<br/>
<br/>
Test #2: 
<br/>
World Heroes 2 Jet is another games that now has a problem with background moving with the character. World Heroes Perfect, KOF 2003 and Snk v Capcom all seem un-affected. 
<br/>
<br/>
Could you please look into WH2 and WH2J? It was not a problem before. Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh the "politics" of grey area development on the DS on here. hehe..
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is wondering where the forum is look at the NeoDS google page for the link.
<br/>
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/neods/browse_thread/thread/d0678c7c3772561a" target="_blank">http://groups.google.com/group/neods/browse_thread/thread/d0678c7c3772561a</a>
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm kind of worried. Does this mean we can't link to the Google NeoDS page now too? As it's a link of a link of a place that is so called "pro-piracy"? 
<br/>
<br/>
I'll just go ahead and write I've been censored here to save some mods some time....

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just discovered this emulator and would love to get it working, but I'm having no luck.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried multiple different rom files obtained from different sources, but I don't think the roms are the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using a Supercard Lite (firmware v1.85).
<br/>
I've tried patching NeoDs.nds with both sclt.dldi and scsd_moon.dldi.
<br/>
<br/>
In either case, I can't even get as far as the rom list screen.  I get a blank white screen on top and a blank black screen on the bottom as soon as I start the app.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried running it unpatched, and I did see the rom list screen, but it was empty (couldn't read the rom files off the card without patching).
<br/>
<br/>
I've run several other homebrew apps successfully, patching them with sclt.dldi.  I'm stumped as to why I can't get this one running.<br/>_________________<br/>-=The Jesster: Gatchaba Goose=-</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks for the info.  Unfortunately, the link in the post on the Google group is broken.  I did a search for "dldi.scp" and came up with this: <a href="http://www.scdev.org/forum/index.php?topic=11942.0" target="_blank">http://www.scdev.org/forum/index.php?topic=11942.0</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Looks like this was mean to be an auto-patcher.  Anyway, I tried putting it on the card and letting it auto-patch, I tried renaming it to scp.dldi and patching it manually, I tried downgrading my sc firmware to 1.84, I tried NeoDs 0.2.0 and 0.1.1
<br/>
<br/>
All of the above give me the same blank white screen on top and blank black screen on bottom.<br/>_________________<br/>-=The Jesster: Gatchaba Goose=-</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
