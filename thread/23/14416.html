    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I figured a seperate thread where people can post up the results of trying different mods and how to get them working would be handy, so here it is! List the name of the mod, the hardware it's tested on, and your results. Here are a few to start off, all run from an R4DS with an EZ-Flash 3-in-1 for external RAM:
<br/>
<br/>
TARGET QUAKE (sidescrolling platform-esque Quake mod)- runs up until a certain point in the regular Quake build when it runs out of memory. So far it seems to be fully playable with EXRAM but the framerate can be rather jumpy on occasion due to the number of enemies.
<br/>
<br/>
QUAKE 1 ARENA (conversion mod with bots that replicates Qyake 3 in Quake)- works quite well with the regular build, but the mod automatically tries to add bots every so often which can cause slowdown. The EXRAM build loads 4 bots and does not continue trying to load any more, but four-bot deathmatch is quite slow. Also, there are sprite errors when firing the rocket launcher and plasma gun which can cause quite a bit of slowdown. These errors could be easily fixed and would result in, IMO, the best bot mod for QuakeDS I've tried yet.
<br/>
<br/>
BEYOND BELIEF (single-player campaign for Quake)- runs in EXRAM build only, make sure to put -map bbstart in the QDSOPTS file though. Quite fun and worth a look.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The general drill for running a mod or total conversion is exactly the same as it would be on a PC. You make a directory at the same level as the id1 directory with the name of the mod, stick all the pak files related to the mod in that directory and then call quake with the -game option, followed by the name of the directory that you made.
<br/>
On the DS it's pretty similar. So to run Malice, make a directory at the same level as the id1 directory (ie at the root of your flash card) named malice and copy in the four pak files and the config.cfg file.
<br/>
Then, in the root of your flash card make a file named qdsopts.txt (the fake quake command line) and type,
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">-game malice</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Then start the game. Sha-zam. You'll need the EXRAM build for Malice to run.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw Malice has 4 extra buttons, for reloading, cycling 'toys', 'use' toys and 3rd person view. The original Malice installer would make a config file which bound these options to some buttons, like this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">//
<br/>
// MALICE bindings
<br/>
// for the love of god, preserve "+movedown" &lt;-- WTF?! Is this for swimming?
<br/>
<br/>
bind r          "reload"
<br/>
bind y          "cycle"
<br/>
bind u          "use"
<br/>
bind e          "external"</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">Since you won't want to use the OSK every time you want to reload your gun, change these to "PAD A" for the A button etc. The touch buttons are mapped to keys "AUX1" through "AUX9".<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Near this one part with an elevator in TG, the gui as well as a few enemies disappear... kind of hard to play that way.

To be honest, this was my first time playing the mod and I just tried it up until the part where you're dumped in the water with the fish, noted the amount of slowdown and tried a different mod. The more opinions, the better :)

As Simon explained in the other thread, there's a cap on how many polygons can be rendered at once, so pretty much any mod that requires the EXRAM build to run is going to have a problem with enemies disappearing, which is a shame...

I know that the Rocket Arena DS mod runs Omicron bot, and the Quake 1 Arena mod I mentioned in the first post runs Frikbot, but I've never tried Reaper bots, personally. If you find one though, let us know!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, I know...I remember reading about this when I downloaded the new version but for some reason it didn't click in my head that this was the 'overloading the GPU' thing.  No big deal, probably play it anyway. :)  And QuakeDS is pretty awesome anyway, I've been playing it a lot lately.
<br/>
<br/>
*edit*
<br/>
I can't get Beyond Belief to work properly...it loads the demos (that's where I saw the enemy thing), but even when I add '-map bbstart' it won't start on the right map, instead starting on Quake's intro level.  My qdsopts looks like this:
<br/>
<br/>
-game bbelief -map bbstart<br/>_________________<br/>----
