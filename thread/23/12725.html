    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
I have a pre-release download of DSQuake at <a class="postlink" href="http://dsquake.net" target="_blank">http://dsquake.net</a> and a video of its current state.
<br/>
<br/>
There is a little blurb about it so read it and if you have questions for us email me or ask them here.
<br/>
<br/>
I had planned on doing a pre-release about a month ago with Simon but it quickly became one of those just one more thing kind of situations.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you guys enjoy it!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So you and Simon have a little Quake Competition going, eh ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Well I just downloaded it and the graphics look really superb to me. And also smooth framerate...Just awesome work. I really like the fog effekt you are using. Gives the whole Game some "depth"
<br/>
<br/>
I am using it on my M3 Mini SD and it starts without problems. However it crashed sometimes in the Necropolis Demo right after getting the Nailgun and shooting at the switch - if this is any help for you in debuggin..
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway keep up the good work :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all, I don't usually post around here but since I gave a little hand in the DSQuake project I thought I'd register and chime in too. I'll be taking a look at those forums from time to time.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you guys like our DSQuake, it's not complete yet but it can already be quite enjoyable. It's hard to release when you always want to push more features in and optimize things a little better!
<br/>
<br/>
Also I'll take the opportunity of my first post here to thank everyone in the GBA/DS homebrew community, we wouldn't have Quake running on a DS without you all. And props to simonjhall - he did a superb job on his own port, and it sure helped to get us motivated and moving again when we saw he had such fast progress. A good dose of healthy competition is good for all ! ;)
<br/>
<br/>
See you guys around!

And kudos on the networking too!
<br/>
<br/>
The race is on to make the finished product! I know what you mean though about the 'one more thing' thing - the final polish always takes so long.

Agreed, I see no reason to merge the projects. Both are coming from different places and taking different approaches to solving the same problem. Personally I'm rooting for simon's version, but that's mainly because his dev process has been more transparent :-)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think LOTP has been slightly modest in his role here as well, he has done at least as much work as I have since he started working on it which was after I went public the first time.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm slightly surprised that some people are having issues with the control, but I guess for whatever reason the ds lite screen is slightly more accurate. At any rate filtering these kind of things is very easy in the grand scheme of things. It wasn't something I focused a great amount of time on just yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I should say that the tapping to jump isn't quite what people might expect. It is actually triggered on lifting the pen after it has been lifted and not on the down contact. So the exact sequence is like this, the pen has been held down for a while looking around and so on, then you lift the pen and place it down if you lift the pen again within 5 frames it triggers the jump then not when it touches down again. I thought it would be slightly faster for people to do and therefore a benefit. I should have clarified before. 
<br/>
<br/>
Some people are having a hard time running it I guess all I can say for supercard users is remember to rename the .gba to .nds before running otherwise the supercard tries to run the .gba in gba mode. Other cards may have similar issues. But I've personally seen it run on an m3 lite, supercard, supercard mini, supercard lite and have heard it works on others as well.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing I am very happy about is the fact that no one even noticed or hinted the fact that ALL of the level textures were in fact reduced to 16 color. I spent an extensive amount of time using 4 of the leading color quantization algorithms and I think it really paid off. 16 colors is a bit to few for monsters and guns and so on except for maybe a few but for the most part is <span style="font-style: italic">just</span> enough color for the walls. In some cases that still isn't enough memory saving so there are a few other tricks that were done as well like weighted precomputed reduced images. So all of the wall textures were only reduced to the closest but lower power of 2 of the texture size. So like a 288x196 would be a 256x128 its the hardware limitation of the ds since we are already low on texture memory upscaling is a bad idea.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried using a texture memory cache so I wouldn't have to resort to 16 colors, but there simply isn't enough bandwidth to the texture memory to do swapping of textures during vblanks. I wasn't able to push enough memory per vblank to make it seem feasible and things like defragging the memory and when you need to load a large texture waiting 20 frames or more just to load the texture between vblanks seemed like a very bad idea.
<br/>
<br/>
Also moving the subscreen to the H and I video memory blocks allows us to use the full 512k for texture memory. Which means later on that options for really fancy subscreen menus are going to have to be toned down slightly but I think thats ok.
<br/>
<br/>
polycount is still an issue, only using 2048 triangles per frame is a big limitation that and low texture memory pretty much forces us not to be able to do anything other than vertex lighting. I can think of a few ways to get decent approximations of lightmaps via vertexes and seeing how the game looks pretty good now I think that will be acceptable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow .. the walls are just 16 colors ? I wouldn't have guessed. Maybe you should't have revealed that secret. I just restarted the game to check, and I have to admit that it is still not obvious to me that the wall textures colors have been decreased at all. Excellent job there.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe to free up some memory you can use some kind of texture compression, which the DS should support. Appearently its similar to S3TC.
<br/>
Some info can be found here:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Texture compression is a no go, I have looked into that a lot too, I even wrote a texture compression program. <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9963" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9963</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The big problem with it is the largest part of the texture, the texture blocks have to be put into texture memory block E and up which is a total of 96k. Also you can only use texture blocks 0 1 2 for compressed textures. After all said and done they are 7bbp unless you do a heavy reuse of blocks but I don't like those type of artifacts. 16 color uses only 4bbp + palette info which isn't much at all.
<br/>
<br/>
And as for keeping the 16 color thing a secret I don't see any point a lot of people see this to be some sort of race but keeping knowledge from each other its not what the community is about, well as long as I do get at least a little credit for doing it in Quake first :). I wouldn't care if Simon did it as well I think he should in fact. Before he started his port he asked me in email for some tips and I told him then that he should help finish the one I started it but he wanted to do it for himself. Which is commendable and he has done just that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In fact I already persumed that you have looked into texture compression, but I still wanted to raise that topic in case you have not (even thought the chance was quite small) :)

As with keeping the 16 colors secret I was just kidding of course :P

I have to admit that when I read it, I instantaniously booted Quake up to check how visible it is - and it is not all...

It works fine, but it's too bad that the Quake protocol wasn't designed for high-latency networks at all. So it lags quite a bit depending on the ping of the connection, and there's no prediction. This has nothing to do with the proxy or DSQuake, it doesn't add any lag... it's just Quake itself.

Precisely. I kind of assume that the polygon limit is an issue in the first place.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the video Miika I quite liked it. Yeah I forgot that I needed to look into the sounds a bit for the Lighting gun, but then again it really isn't in e1. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Sadly Both me and LOTP are quite busy with our work careers for a while, so I'm not quite sure when the next release will be, what will be fixed in it and so on.
<br/>
<br/>
OOPMan, yeah as for the sound I wrote most of that code in like a day or two and never touched it again. I think it probably needs to be completely rewritten because I think the sound code is the main problem for the stability issues. And to be honest I'm not sure how good using a irq-timer would be as a replacement for the lacking hardware sound cursor. Anyone have some good tests/info related to that?
<br/>
<br/>
As for the lightmap/texturing stuff... we are defiantly low on free polys we hit the limit now and then, so rendering the world twice is quite the challenge. We will try hard to do the right thing but working on the DS as we all know isn't without constraints. I can think of some things that could really help out but without them implemented yet its hard to say what the real empirical outcome will be. But the visual quality of Quake is something I am willing to exhaust <span style="font-style: italic">all </span>options on, you can bet on that.
<br/>
<br/>
again, thanks everyone.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
