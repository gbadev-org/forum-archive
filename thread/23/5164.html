Yep, I can still make a pointer to 0x4000006 (REG_VCOUNT), and check it's value like in the good old days... but swiWaitForVBlank() doesn't seem to work the same way...?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The VCOUNT register depends on nothing, you can always read its value. The IntrWait (4) and VBlankIntrWait (5) SWI's however depend on the specified interrupt being enabled and the user-controlled interrupt ack bit at [DTCM + 0x3FF8] being set. Not enabling an interrupt or not acknowledging it will make SWI 4/5 hang as can be seen by running most of the recently released "demos" on a certain emulator.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I do reflect IF and IE to DTCM + 0x3FF8 in the handler (mainly because it will not work on a certain emulator without it) so something is not quite right.  According to Joat the arm9 bios does not requre these flags at all for the vblank wait.  My irq handler is just a c function at the moment and there are a billion other things it could be.  I just got my DS replaced a day or two ago so will do a bit of extensive testing this weekend.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah this occurs only on the real hardware. I haven't had this problem with emulators probably because the mouse-&gt;emulator interface is very concrete as opposed to actual hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
NMcCoy is right. I don't have any problem when I press harder on the screen; it's very accurate. I did some testing with natrium42's "Under Pressure" demo with the same sort of pressure that would make these anomalies occur. When it reads ~85+ the touch screen can be inaccurate, so you might want to try to only take input when the pressure is &lt;85. Another suggestion would be to take a few input samples and then take the average.; though the pressure sensor seems to be there for the purpose of accurate input.

If I have some free time tonight I'll see if I can implement it and check if it works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I got a question how do you compile them ???
<br/>
Because with aaronrogers tutorial i can't compile birds???
<br/>
it gives alot of errors???
<br/>
<br/>
Because i want to use your 2 screen as one screen (engine) because im making a game like breakout wich use both screens as one big screen.
<br/>
<br/>
But i when i use your code in my game then it gives an error that there is something wrong about comparing them?. It says its in here :

(Interestingly enough, Tetanus On Drugs is ultimately a descendant of that code.) During that time I saw TI-82, TI-83, TI-85, and TI-86 graphing calculators in use. The screens of the TI-82 and TI-83 are the same spec (96x64 pixels). The screens of the TI-85 and TI-86 are the same size as the TI-83 screen but 128x64 pixels. The pixel aspect ratio of a TI calculator might not be exactly 2:3; it's probably closer to 3:4 (or in your case, 2:2.667), which means you will need to use some PocketNES style flickery scaling to make it look 100% authentic.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

So the resolution on DS for the ti calc emu should not be the 256x128 like i had it, but 256x160 (but still not the full 256x192)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yes, at least on the 86, the status bar ("y(x)=...") is just drawn over the graph.
<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, I forgot that the screen is twice as many pixels long as it is high; I need to change the ratio to <span style="font-style: italic">2 * yMax / xMax</span>. When I do that I get 1.117:1, much closer to what josath got.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's a catch though: input is broken on the 82, and 83 doesn't even boot :(

 These bugs will be fixed in the next version hopefully.

On a more productive note, you should be able to strip off the ds.gba header and end up with your standard .nds. There should be plenty of info on these forums in regard to how to accomplish that.

1. you don't want this, try moonshell as mentioned above

2. yes, the mp3 is compiled in

3. put an mp3 in sram?? sram is at most 256KB, usually smaller I believe...that's not much space for mp3s...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
