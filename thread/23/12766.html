    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
<br/>
I've developed an app to help mostly with translation of games, but possibilities are endless. It's called Tahaxan, and let you extract any file of any DS ROM file, decompress it if needed (some files come compressed) and (most interesting) display detected palette / image / tiles files. File detection is baed on simple XML plugins (with Lua embedded) that you can edit to support more games without having to wait for another release.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently the app is in BETA phase, so you know what it means. Lot's of bugs!!
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if I'm allowed to post URL's (because this could be called publicity, although I'm not earning a single penny), so check my homepage to go to Tahaxan website, where you can download it and found more info (like tutorials, being written at this very moment, though)
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you'll find it useful!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As I understand it, gbadev.org is devoted to development of original games from scratch. But romhacking.net might like it better.

<br/>
URLs are OK, except for two cases: <ul><li>retailers that sell mostly other manufacturers' products (outside the Retailer Feedback forum), and </li><li>sites that give explicit instructions for running pirated DS software.</li></ul>
<br/>
Does your tool require the user to dump the Game Card to a ROM file first? Or can it run on the DS and dump graphics directly from the Game Card, which would be even more slick?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unfortunately, it does require the user to dump the Game Card to a ROM file first. For things like translation, which deals with a lot of files, an NDS interface would become of little use, but it's not a bad idea. I'll think on it. If you think my post is harmful or something like that, please remove it :). If it's not, and it doesn't go against the rules, please tell me and I'll include the direct URL.

Thanks for your FAST response!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At the risk of whatever I can say I am interested in your app (currently apart from ndstool, ndsdis and a few assemblers I am stuck mainly with my hex editor and a few GBA intended apps as well as what I can dream up myself).

<br/>
I will give it a run through with some stuff I am working on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
