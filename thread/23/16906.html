    <h4>#170627 - filteredperception - Thu Oct 08, 2009 11:03 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Guitar-ZyX(tm) is a LiveDVD/USB operating system distribution, that can
<br/>
immediately boot both your Nintendo(tm)-DS, and your x86/64 PC, into
<br/>
a guitar pre-amp f/x processing appliance, complete with wireless dual screen
<br/>
touchpad remote control.  You can even velcro or embed the NDS in your
<br/>
guitar if so inclined.  In addition to switching among 77+ different
<br/>
f/x presets, the NDS remote control's touchscreen can also linearly control
<br/>
any two of about a hundred independent f/x parameters in real-time.  I.e.
<br/>
a very cost effective TouchScreenWhammyPad.
<br/>
<br/>
Guitar-ZyX-0.3.1 uses the excellent Rakarrack open source guitar-f/x
<br/>
software to provide effects.  Guitar-ZyX-0.3.1 is derived from Fedora(tm)-10
<br/>
and has compatable full access to the upstream software repositories
<br/>
including updates.
<br/>
<br/>
Guitar-ZyX is entirely free and open source software, with all source
<br/>
available, for both the PC and NDS components.  All necessary compilers
<br/>
and build tools are also included, allowing anyone to modify and enhance
<br/>
in any way their imagination and code-fu skills allow.
<br/>
<br/>
For information on many other features, and the best current documentation,
<br/>
please review the latest release notes, available here -
