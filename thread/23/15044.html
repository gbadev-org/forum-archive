    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">colors!, animanatee, and the others, unite!  it's time to converge and create an unholy super drawing/animation app to rival this piece of awesomeness that is about to be unleashed.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
seriously, this is more of a "different, not necessarily better" situation.  it doesn't seem to match the image quality/brush control of colors, nor the unique look of animanatee.  it also looks like it's going to have a proprietary saving format and the size limitations of a retail cartridge rather than a 2gb microSD like my m3simply uses, but it's lookin' good, nonetheless.  multiple layers, primitive shapes, pixel grid editing and variable animation timing, very nice.
<br/>
<br/>
be sure to watch the tutorials on the inchworm site:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It looks like a great art app that combines handy features of both photoshop and illustrator along with the paint-under thing I've never seen before. I'm not hugely impressed with the animation tools, but it's not bad.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">for still, colors! is enough
<br/>
<br/>
but for Animation, i think the timming tool in the inchworms is AWESOME!
<br/>
<br/>
and it is very strange that Animanatee and flickbook dont have a eraser. (i know flipbook has one but it has the same size as the pen, so it nothing more than a white brush)
<br/>
so with Animanatees workflow, i Must click the L R button very often. as you know the LR button is easily broken...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
