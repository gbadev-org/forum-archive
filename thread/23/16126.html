    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone!
<br/>
<br/>
 I'm new here (and to ds development) and I wanted to get some feedback on this game I've been developing this past week. It's a little FPS, with aliens!
<br/>
 At this point it's still a work in progress, but I think there is already enough to show and get some suggestions.
<br/>
<br/>
 The controls are:
<br/>
<br/>
with the buttons:
<br/>
<br/>
 pad - move around
<br/>
 l/r   - strafe 
<br/>
 a     - shoot
<br/>
 y     - reload ( you have unlimited ammo, but have to reload manually)
<br/>
 start - pause
<br/>
 select - return to title screen
<br/>
<br/>
with the stylus:
<br/>
<br/>
pad/buttons - move/strafe
<br/>
L/R - shoot
<br/>
tap ammo icon - reload (in this scheme it reloads automatically when it reaches 0)
<br/>
start - pause
<br/>
select - return to title screen
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In each level there is a blue key hidden that is needed to open the exit door.
<br/>
<br/>
 Also, some credits, I used the NitroEngine to help me code this, very nice!
<br/>

Well, at least until you get "foxed" and have to change the setting and remove all references to the fox franchise - at which point you'll probably have made yourself a nice and solid game. ;^D

    <h4>#163847 - another world - Mon Oct 13, 2008 6:57 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi pac,
<br/>
 great work so far, you asked for suggestions so here goes...
<br/>
<br/>
this game plays like a great doom engine style clone, strafe on the shoulder buttons, shooting, reload, it is only missing a run button. i do not see a need for any stylus controls. personally i found it very difficult to play quake 1 &amp; 2 on the ds with stylus controls. you find that you have to drag across the screen, pick up and drag again to turn around. meanwhile you are getting killed. a simple back up, strafe, turn around with dpad + shoulder buttons is much more enjoyable.
<br/>
<br/>
i can't wait to see where this goes, it already shows great potential.
<br/>
<br/>
i realize this is a demo so i say --&gt; probably already planned:
<br/>
larger/longer levels with hidden rooms (some out door levels would be a welcome addition)
<br/>
more keys (resulting in planned level advancement)
<br/>
objects to interact with and blow up
<br/>
more enemies
<br/>
more weapons
<br/>
armor and health packs
<br/>
a solid intro and outro with credits
<br/>
some great background tunes
<br/>
polished interior sprites. (doom editing has tought me that a few well placed jpgs can make a right angle hallway look scary)
<br/>
faster movement and/or a run button
<br/>
<br/>
the wish list:
<br/>
a level editor
<br/>
wifi play
<br/>
some type of doom style exeternal sprite wad file so we can make addons for your engine! hmm care to code us a set of tools =P
<br/>
<br/>
cheers,

Along these lines...the strength of your game is the mood and suspense.  Do everything you can to keep that up.  I was creeped out and scared playing your game, until after I killed the first couple aliens.  At that point, I knew (or I thought I did) how it worked, and it suddenly became less scary (and thus less interesting).  The more you can do to keep the suspense up, the better.  (although I don't have specific suggestions for how to do that)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#163849 - Pac - Mon Oct 13, 2008 7:25 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, thanks everyone for the encouragement and sugestions. First I've uploaded a new version, that includes some of the improvements some of you have mentioned. 
<br/>
<br/>
   First is the new control style with the stylus, complete with mirroring for left handed people(thank my brother for that). Of course it's optional, there's a menu at the beginning. Though you can use the stylus to look around, you can't look up and down, not because it's difficult to implement but because you can't  do it in the original control scheme. Also everything in this game it's at the same height, no need to look up and down.
<br/>
<br/>
   I also have updated the radar/map thing, now displays the enemies too, the catch is that it only shows them when they move, it's a motion sensor!, so it's still tense. There is too a new decorative element, a light column thing, I think it looks good.
<br/>
<br/>
 About other things, I don't think I'll code a tool set for this. The game it's almost at the point I wanted it to be so I'll probably start something else. When that happens I'll release the source code, though I don't think it'll be that useful, it's ugly and full of hacks. Anyway there are still things I want to do with this! Right now I'm trying to implement a random level generator, so the game can keep fresh, will see how that works. Also more decorative elements and interactive things like barrels or something, that's easy to do.
<br/>
<br/>
 So that's it, please try the new version, it's still a bit buggy but plays fine I think:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great game, the stylus mode works well. Here's some suggestions.
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>Let the map be drawn as you explore the level. This means that you can put aliens in dead ends.
<br/>
<br/>
Add some kind a sound when you get the blue key.
<br/>
<br/>
A torch+gun combo would only heighten immersive feel and add to the scare factor.
<br/>
<br/>
Light switches or power generator switches, to go with the light+scary things in the dark theme.
<br/>
<br/>
Collectible goggles: night vision, x-ray vision that uses batteries[2 min timer] etc. 
<br/>
<br/>
Time pressure modes: Poison alien gas or failing air locks - get to the exit in 5 mins or less. this could be a find the switch mode to flush out the gas or seal the airlock. To add to the panic you could have red flashing ceiling lights and some computerized voice countdown. "warning airlock failing. carbon based lifeforms death in 5,4,3,2,1 minutes"etc.. </ul></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">^ hey very nice ideas, I like the light switches one, I can see the player entering a room and the lights going suddenly off and then frantically looking for a switch, I think is doable, I don't know if I can create a torch convincing enough tough, the engine has it's limitations.
<br/>
<br/>
 The map being drawn as you discover it it's already implemented, just deactivated, I'll switch it on again and you tell em which one you prefer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
About map generation, the overall square grid-based map feeling reminded me of an old Atari ST game named Captive, a Dungeon Master-like which had a very powerful map generation system. Here's a link where the system is deeply analysed : <a href="http://captive.atari.org/MapGen/Introduction.php" target="_blank">http://captive.atari.org/MapGen/Introduction.php</a> . Maybe it could be helpful, (or, let's dream, inspiring for a DS port of Captive :) )
<br/>
<br/>
About the level construction, is it limited to a plan or is it possible to make superposable stages ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#163880 - Pac - Tue Oct 14, 2008 11:40 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey thanks for the link MrSkiz,I ended up reading the whole thing, it's actually pretty close to what I'm trying to do, though mine needs more clearly defined difference between corridors and rooms. Pretty cool game too, I didn't know it. If you want a remake my code would be indeed a good start, if you want to do it yourself I can explain whatever you need. 
<br/>
 About handling superposed levels, if you mean like in Captive then yes it can handle it, it's just jumping form one tilemap to another, if you mean like having bridges where you can see bellow then no. My tilemap doesn't even store height information so all tiles have the same floor and ceiling level. So it's more like Wolfenstein3d than Doom, let alone Quake. My intentions with this aren't to create a fully featured FPS, just one that is simple and fun. Anyway I still have tons of ideas to improve it and I just started it this past Tuesday (my first DS game too) so who knows what this will become, the more people make suggestions the more I want try new things, and I don't start my new job until November so I have time to spare right now.
<br/>
 Keep tuned for the next update(probably tomorrow), featuring colored lights and scarier aliens!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Pac on Tue Oct 14, 2008 2:28 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

And it is already ! \o/
<br/>
<br/>
I just find the alien animations a little choppy. Maybe they're also simply too fast, but it's like they missing a more animation frames because there's too much contrast with the solid framerate your engine delivers.
<br/>
<br/>
To sum it up, I would prefer more aliens moving slower and smoother...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey Pac, how do you implement your world gen?
<br/>
Right now I have a really horrible, hardcoded method.
<br/>
Basically I have a 2d array of x and z 'blocks'.  Y values are fixed.
<br/>
Anywhere you have a block, the appropriate wall is drawn.
<br/>
Planes that aren't flat as opposed to the ground ceiling and walls have to be hardcoded in. Ugh, it's a pain for me to create levels.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Elwing, a shotgun  would be nice wouldn't it, if I add an additional weapon it would be a shotgun. Closer range and slower firing rate but super powerful, it would make a nice change of pace. I still don't want to include ammo or health packs (designer decision lol) so you would have to get rid of it once you run out of shells, that would be cool I think. I was planing on adding some corpses as decoration anyway, maybe I should put a shotgun next to some of them lol.
<br/>
<br/>
MrSkiz, the animation is really choppy, it has like twelve frames for the three things the aliens do (attack, run, die). I should have made more but I was in a rush to test things. Furthermore, the Nitro Engine that I use to load and display the models doesn't support blending between keyframes so it's even worse, it's a really nice engine though. Maybe I'll add the blending myself, I did an md2 loader many years ago, it should be similar.
<br/>
Oh and it's never late to learn! Really!
<br/>
<br/>
3dfx, I think I'm doing the same thing as you, I have a 32x32 array where each position represents a tile with a byte.  It looks like this:
<br/>
<br/>
u8 minimap[8*8] = {  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,
<br/>
                                 0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  2,  0,  0,
<br/>
                                 0,100,100,100,100,218,100,  0,
<br/>
                               100, 50, 50, 50,100, 50,100,  0,
<br/>
                               100, 50,  1, 52,201, 52,100,  0,
<br/>
                                100, 50, 50, 50,100,100,  0,  0,
<br/>
                                 0,100,100,100,  0,  0,  0,  0,
<br/>
                                 0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0
<br/>
                              }
<br/>
<br/>
where 100 is one of the types of wall 50 is a normal floor/ceiling, 52 is a flickering light floor/ceiling, 201 is an horizontal door et?
<br/>
<br/>
for aliens positions and other special elements I use an aditional 32x32 map

I'm sure this hasn't been of any help, but the only way to improve level creation would be to make a tool for it, or an automatic level generator. If you where asking how I made my level generator, it doesn't really work yet, my levels are hardcoded typing numbers like yours.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

 I've been trying and adding a lot of things, and also improving the code a bit. I think I'll do bigger updates instead of incremental ones so you don't get tired of the game before it's completed. I also made a little conversor that allows me to literally draw the levels in a painting program and it outputs the correct code ready to use. Making levels it's now easier and more fun, so I'll make a lot more. I'll update sometime soon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think you missunderstood my question Pac, and I understand why you did since my question was a result of a tired "Made in Sweden" English.
<br/>
Bad in other words. 
<br/>
Okey I explain it in this way instead: 
<br/>
AntonioND has released a new fresh version of the Nitro Engine, the new version is called v0.4.0 <a href="http://forum.palib.info/index.php?topic=5838.0" target="_blank">http://forum.palib.info/index.php?topic=5838.0</a> And I wonder if you are going to update your code so it supports the new version of the Nitro Engine? =) 
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you understand now^^ Sorry for my bad english.
<br/>
<br/>
Some more ideas:
<br/>
<br/>
1. A friend of mine got a crazy idea, that you can make an option where you take damage from the alien corpses since they contain very dangerous acid blood? But maybe they don't in your game, but that would be cool to have as an weird option, haha^^
<br/>
<br/>
2. A flamethrower would be nice to have since it's a common weapon in the alien movies and in the "Alien vs Predator" games, but you are not planning to adding more weapons right? I read that you may add a shotgun. Is the engine powerful enough to simulate a flamethrower?
<br/>
Sounds tricky to code, but I don't know! =P
<br/>
<br/>
3. Is there any way to code the motion radar(map) so it only detects what's in front of you and not what is behind you? in a span of 160 degrees or something like that? Both Visual detection and those "beeps" detections. 
<br/>
<br/>
4. Will the map be invisible in the next version?
<br/>
<br/>
5. Do you have any plans to make a Co-op mode for this project?
<br/>
That would be so cool, but would that involve much coding?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for making this post so long, I'm asking you of curiosity and interest.
<br/>
Good luck with the development, hope you get rid of those random map problems that has occured.
<br/>
You have managed to do an impressive job so far!
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
it'd be nice to be able to play some deathmatch with wifi, especially over the internet, although just local wifi would be nice too. 
<br/>
<br/>
co-op would be cool, say, if there were two keys, but you could only hold one at a time. or perhaps you have to use both keys at once, like launching missiles from a submarine.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lol BastarB long post! don't worry I use "Made in Spain" English myself. Thanks for the tip though, I wasn't aware of a new version of the engine, I'll look into it straight away.
<br/>
<br/>
 Damage from alien corpses and when you attack them up close was something I considered, it's very easy to implement but problematic because most of the time corpses would block the corridors and the player is not even able to jump.
<br/>
<br/>
 You mean making the motion sensor more like the movies? also easy but I though that as the levels grow more labyrinthine the players would feel frustrated without a map, so I made this hybrid. Maybe I'll make the map separate from the motion sensor and force the player switch between the two, not a bad idea.
<br/>
<br/>
 Also I would love a flame-thrower but yeah, I think is difficult(or not possible) to use additive blending on the DS, I haven't looked much into it. Without it it would look kind of bad, but I'll experiment for sure.
<br/>
<br/>
 And sorry no multiplayer, it's a lot of work and I don't even have a second ds to test, but as I've already said I'll release source code once I'm satisfied with it, so if someone is interested maybe they can do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Yes something similiar to the movies =)
<br/>
And I agree, switching beetween the map and the radar is a really neat  idea. Both solutions work fine, but your idea with the switching is much cooler ;)
<br/>
<br/>
But the most important thing however is that the radar shouldn't detect any motions "behind" your back as it do now in the current version of the game.
<br/>
Now in the current version of Alien DS, it's to easy to see where the aliens is coming from thanks to the current radar that covers a 360 degree circle area around the player, it detects motions from any direction, that includes some meters in front of the player, some meters behind the player, some meters left and right of the player etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of the current "super-radar" system, it would be better if the radar where limited to only detect motions that occurs from the left to the right, in the front of the player. Then it will become more like an "eye" that only detects motions within the field of vision it has.. Like a helping "eye" for the player that can detect motions in the darkness and in walls etc, a motion sensoring eye that can catch motions as far as maybe 20 meters from the players face or something like that!!? I don't really know how big the field of vision of the motion sensor should be, maybe between 160 - 180 degrees or something like that!!?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: More simple explained, the motion sensor will look more like a half circle than a whole circle that surrounds you =) Have a look at this link, and click at the first picture for an example^^ :

<br/>
<br/>
Haha, then you have to be chased by the alien to a open room and then kill it, and that would add some more strategy to the game...maybe fun!!? =P.
<br/>
However, I think it's more realistic that you take much more damage when you attack an alien close up then just climbing over it's corpse, since you get all acid in your face when you attack it close up. 
<br/>
Correct me if I'm wrong! 
<br/>
Maybe you should just add a very little healthloss when the player climbes over an alien corpse, more like a "teaser" that doesn't affect the conditions of surviving too dramatically =)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I really really hope you find a way to add a flamethrower, hope it's possible to use additive blending on the DS. It would be soo cool, but if you don't find any solution, it's okey. It will not harm the game, but a flamethrower would definitely increase the "Alien-feeling" in the game, and of course "THE ACTION"^^
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, It accually sounds really hard to make multiplayer with just one DS =P, I now understand the difficulties related to this whole multiplayer idea, maybe someone will pickup the source when it's ready^^
<br/>
It's still a nice game with or without multiplayer =)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey, so after playing a bit more, I came up with a few ideas:
<br/>
<br/>
a more diverse selection of enemies (I'm sure this is already in the works) -
<br/>
perhaps for the hallways, you could have smaller 'crawley' sort of aliens. I imagine holes in the walls, or vents if you please, where they would crawl out of. the vents would be everywhere, so you'd never know when to expect an alien (or 5) to pop out of them and come at you.
<br/>
plus larger aliens, that shoot something. acid spit maybe to keep up with the theme. or maybe they drop more of the smaller aliens. and if you have the aliens try and avoid your fire, or retreat when they're almost dead it would get rid of the whole "run backwards while shooting" thing mentioned in previous posts. alien egg nests? they'd hatch as soon as you get too close, and spawn little ankle bitters. 
<br/>
<br/>
given these things, it'd be nice to be able to look up and down. that way you could shoot down at the little aliens and up at the aliens on the ceilings. 
<br/>
<br/>
misc. things I'd like to see are touchscreen sensitivity, a crosshair, and perhaps a double-tap jump is in order to go with some environmental obstacles? . :)
<br/>
<br/>
I really like your project thus far - I'm hoping to see even more amazing developments! I've been waiting for someone to make a homebrew FPS from scratch. I'm thuroughly impressed!<br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, it's going well, I've been getting sidetracked trying different things.
<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I've uploaded a new version, grab it here:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?1zddnlozyvl" target="_blank">http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?1zddnlozyvl</a>
<br/>
<br/>
 This version should be considered a test, it only has one level and it's not even very good(it's the one I've used to try new things) but should give you an idea of the changes I've been introducing. I'll try to explain a bit what I've been doing.
<br/>
<br/>
 First of all I've changed the map size from 32x32 to 64x64 tiles. Because it's a tilemap, and because of the way it's rendered, there's no real limit to map size other than the DS memory, but there's is a limit on the amount of interactive elements a map could have (doors, aliens...) before it starts to slowdown so I feel that 64x64 is a good size. Also a bigger map, given the game design, would be a drag.
<br/>
 The change in map size forced me to change the way the map screen works, I think the result is better than what I had before though.
<br/>
 I've changed the aliens a bit too. Before I placed them by hand, now th DS gives them random starting positions so every time they are in different places. I've also implemented triggers, that can create aliens when you activate them. It means that now aliens can appear behind you when you enter a room or grab a key and things like that. All this, together with the map size has increased the number of aliens a lot, I think It should be less boring. It's also very customizable so in the final game I'll introduce difficulty levels.
<br/>
 There are also a lot of new scenery elements and I've corrected a few bugs. I've also learned a few new things about the machine ( remember that I'm really new to the DS) and now the whole thing is more efficient and uses less memory.
<br/>
 Right now I'm working on the level generator, with the level size increase and the lack of an editor (yeah I'm lazy) level creation has become a bit of a chore and if I can get it working like I want to you'll have infinite levels, so I think it's worth a try. After that I'll make the new weapons (shotgun and flame-thrower). Both are halfway implemented but I still want to improve some things, especially the aliens reactions.
<br/>
 So i'll stop the rant now. Please give it a try and tell me what you think.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Any chance on getting the source anytime soon?  If you open source I bet quite a few would contribute.  I would.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the particles that come off the walls when you shoot should be front-facing, but they appear to be normal to the wall.  Is there a reason for so?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#164286 - Pac - Sun Oct 26, 2008 8:15 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, simply because I thought they looked better that way. Also with particles of any kind I only make the orientation calculations once at creation, if you turn around them during their life you'll notice. You have to make compromises with the DS! I said that but I haven't done proper stress tests, maybe it can handle it.
<br/>
<br/>
 About releasing the source code, as I've already said, only when I consider the project finished, I want it to be my project. It hasn't been even three weeks since I started it so it'll be a while. Also it's a bit of a mess, as it started as just a test and grew from that, no planning at all. It's also in pure C, the first non object oriented code I do in ten years at least. So I don't know who would benefit from it, it's not something newbies would understand and experts already know everything I used. And if you just want to make some modifications, like textures or enemies I would recommend doing a Doom wad. It has a perfectly functional ds port, it's way more flexible and has a well known set of editing tools.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Thats really nice to have creepy aliens appearing behind your back.
<br/>
Do you have any plans to change the motion sensor so it wont detect those aliens behind your back as I suggested in page 3 in my last long post??? like in AVP??

<br/>
Or have you tried that without success? =/
<br/>
Also, are you going to implement your own idea when you have to switch between the map and the motion sensor??
<br/>
<br/>
You wrote:
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, so you have found a way do make that lovely flamethrower thing??? =D Yeah, that's too good to be true! Hope it will look nice^^
<br/>
<br/>
What do you exactly mean with the alien reactions? Do you mean you want to improve their A.I?
<br/>
<br/>
A thing I have think about is to make the aliens move faster and have less healthpower, that would be nice. 
<br/>
And the player should take more damage from the alien attacks.
<br/>
This can be solved with a decrease of healthpower or with a increase of the damage from weapons and the alien claws.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can make this customizable, so people can adjust the speed of the aliens, the hitpoints, the weapon strength by themselfs in a option menu or something???? =D 
<br/>
Maybe you have already been thinking about this since you have mention the words "difficulty levels" in your post^^
<br/>
<br/>
After I played a while on this version, I noticed that the alien corpses dissapear, unlike the previous versions of the game. So I guess you wont implement a feature that you will get a little amount of damage when you walk over the alien corpses?? I guess the corpses dissapear due to memory limitations, right?!?
<br/>
The way the corpses dissapear looks really nice in my opinion^^
<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm going to play a little more with this game and then post my reactions!
<br/>
<br/>
Have an nice day, and again thanks for your hard work =D

    <h4>#164290 - Pac - Sun Oct 26, 2008 2:39 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well my idea for this is to make it a survival game. You choose a difficulty setting and start in a random level, you can not regain health in any way(maybe a little at the end of each level), and the objective is to survive for as many levels as possible while the difficulty rises gradually. Difficulty will control the number, speed, resistance and strength of the aliens as well as the size and complexity of the levels. Weapons will be kind of temporal power ups there is no ammo for them, you loose them when you run out of bullets. That's the idea, with the level generator I think it should be fun.
<br/>
 About the flame-thrower, don't expect it to look spectacular, it looks like the fire effects from the 16bit era, but hey a flame-thrower is a flame-thrower.
<br/>
 Also the corpses disappear because now that the aliens are more random and there is more of them it's possible that a lot of them are simultaneously on-screen. It's not a memory problem, there is only one copy of the alien model on memory, the ds has a set limit of triangles that it can draw in the same frame, if you try to draw more than that it wouldn't go slower like in pc, they just wouldn't be drawed. I can't really control the number of aliens that end up together but I can alleviate the problem by eliminating the corpses.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Pac!
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if you are planning to make the alien animations better in your game, you know with more animation frames ect, especially the animation when the alien dies?
<br/>
<br/>
I also wonder if you are planning to add some sort of music or a sound atmosphere of some sort to have in the background while you playing?
<br/>
Or is it even possible to make the game DLDI compatible so there can be a feature where you can load your own music from the SD card to play in the game? However, it sounds like it would require quite much of the DS resources to implement such feature, correct me if I'm wrong!
<br/>
But I do know that the homebrew DS port of Puzzlemaniak uses this feature to play mp3 files in game from a folder on the SD card that the user has choosen:

<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice day, and good luck with further development!^^
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I forgot to metion that i would be nice if you add some walking sound to the player movements =)
<br/>
And you are totally right, a flamethrower is always a flamethrower ;)
<br/>
Thanks for the detailed description of the increasing difficulty during gameplay. I really like the idea! 
<br/>
Looking forward to the next release^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes that feature would rock^^
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I agree it would be good if you can turn the walking sound on and off as you wish =) 
<br/>
A highly customizable game is always the best, since I think it will attract more players to play it =)

Dammit, then why can't I use the top screen when I'm playing Tetris DS? =P</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by BastarB on Tue Oct 28, 2008 11:13 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This new version is really good, I like the fact aliens can be behind the player!
<br/>
<br/>
Why not add some ducts in the ceiling, and when player is near it, an alien break the fence and attack the player?
<br/>
For more suspense, put lot of ducts, but some ducts are empty, other no, so player never know if an alien is here :)
<br/>
<br/>
Now I hope you will make a better interaction with the level like an use button to activate switches (for lights or doors for ex).
<br/>
Maybe add medpacks and ammo packs (if you make the weapon not infinite)?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.mariokartsource.com" target="_blank">www.mariokartsource.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the more i play the demo and the more i think about what pac wrote the more i see this working. once he gets random level generation into the mix the game will become so much fun. i don't think med packs and ammo are needed. my first response said they were but honestly they aren't. i like the idea how when you run out of ammo you throw the gun away. i would like to see more than just 2 more weapons added. hand guns, a knife, gernades, bombs with trip wires, all these things have potential.
<br/>
<br/>
i also would still love to see custom level tools or some way of skinning the level to personalize randomly generated levels.

<br/>
<br/>
While being charged at by those aliens, I couldnt help but think how cool it would be if you had a sort of panic room style wave mode, where the aliens get harder to kill/more numerous as you progress through the waves. maybe as you get to farther waves you run into different color aliens to represent their lvl of strength. It would be made even cooler if there was a high score board on wifi... everything is cooler with wifi.
<br/>
<br/>
Even without that, this game is still freaken amazing, nice work =)
