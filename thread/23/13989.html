    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Everyone,
<br/>
SpriteAttack &amp; I released a game called Geo Wars that won the Dev-fr competition in late July.  It's been picked up by some of the popular DS news sites, but if you haven't tried it,  please check it out!

<br/>
It is a space shoot'em up game.  You must battle through waves of enemies to save Trinity and all of humanity.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Characters</span>
<br/>
There are two playable characters and you must progress through the game as both characters.  (Progress for each character is stored seperately)  There are some difference - primarily in the bombs.  Alice has radial bomb controlled by the stylus and Mortymer has guided missles also controlled by the stylus. 
<br/>
The game is easier if you play as Alice but I think you can get higher scores with Mortymer once you master your bomb control techniques.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Modes of Play</span>
<br/>
There are 10 missions, 10 Zones and 2 training missions to play.  Missions allow you to unlock new areas and upgrade your ship.  In Zone, you always start with basic weapon capabilities and can get better weapons/bombs by collecting power ups.  Be sure to enjoy the stereo sfx with headphones. Audio options are in the pause menu during gameplay
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you will submit your scores online to show your capabilities in case of a similar strike against Earth. <a class="postlink" href="http://leaderboard.palib.info/games.php?gameid=1" target="_blank">Online Leaderboard</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Please enjoy!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Requires DLDI Patching</span> (R4/M3 users - do not let the device create the save file...the game will do it)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I missed the announment of the results from the dev-fr contest, so I didn't know your game won.  Cangratulations, sumi!  I knew you'd win.
<br/>
<br/>
Geo Wars is absolutely my favorite game on the DS, homebrew or otherwise.  I can zone on it for hours.
<br/>
<br/>
I never had an Xbox or 360, so I've never had a chance to play the original Geometry Wars, but I've always slobbered over it because it looks so cool and is just exactly the type of game I love.  I played Extreme Onslaught a lot and loved it, but I knew it could be improved on a lot.  So my excitement when I saw GeoWars was pretty high.  The fact that it actually turned out to be probably the most polished and complete homebrew release on the DS yet was like a wet dream though.  Thanks so much.
<br/>
<br/>
I honestly can't think of anything that truly needs to be fixed or improved in GeoWars, which is pretty rare for me since I'm such a nitpicker.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering the same thing, and I think it would've happened if he did any big announcements and kept us up-to-date on the progress well before it was released. But I actually think Bizarre is too confident and excited about there new release, Geometry Wars: Galaxies (whose features are boundless compared to Retro Evolved) to care about more small clones. Plus, Grid Wars was the most accurate clone I ever saw, and it was the most popular, also being on the PC. Granted, I do think the name is a little much.

Yeah - should have probably changed up the name, but it wasn't really a priority.... it was a working title that just got left....

Thanks for all the nice comments.  Hope to see some more high scores registered...so far 970! :D  And some of those scores are freakin awesome!!

So much  so I ended up buying a Williams Bubbles cocktail cabinet off Archer Maclean with the view to converting to a Robotron.

EDIT:  Sorry to nitpick, but there's a spelling mistake on one of the first screens.  It says "<span style="font-weight: bold">unkown</span> enemy" rather than "<span style="font-weight: bold">unknown</span> enemy"

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I see a few problems with the M3...
<br/>
<br/>
So my suspision is, (aka.. I dunno), that the M3 is creating a save file.  Then the game tries to use it and it fails because it is improperly formated.  The game needs to create it's own save file.  Delete geowars.sav from your card and when you start the program, if given a choice, choose to NOT create the save file.   If you aren't given a choice, perhaps, I can upload a blank, but valid save file...that you can use to replace the one created on the card.  But I don't know how the m3 works with saves - so please educate me :)
<br/>
<br/>
To confirm that the problem is save data related...I've uploaded a NoSave version to my website.  This way the M3 users can test it out...but your progress will be lost after a power cycle... sorry :(
<br/>
<br/>
NO SAVE VERSION:

    <h4>#143285 - Kiz - Fri Oct 19, 2007 7:01 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sumiguchi - I *THINK* that the way the M3 works is that when a .nds file is loaded, it internally creates a .sav file. Then, next time you boot up the DS it'll backup that .sav to your memory card. For all homebrew apps, when it tries to backup the .sav to the card, it generates a warning saying that it can't backup the .sav file (probably because because homebrew apps don't use the same method of saving stuff as commercial games I'd assume) so nothing is actually written to the card.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll test out the suggestions you emailed to me/posted here and let you know the results. If I have some luck with the NoSave version, then perhaps a blank but valid .sav file packaged with it would do the trick as you suggested.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit - I tried both Chishm's and agentq's DLDI patch on the regular Geo Wars, no dice. I tried turning off autosave in the M3 options (this makes it so when loading a .nds file, you can choose a .sav file to backup the .sav of the last thing you played. If you hit 'cancel' then it just loads the .nds file you selected, so I'm assuming that it's not trying to use any .sav file, but I dunno what's going on behind the scenes), no dice. I tried the NoSave version, no dice (both with and without the autosave option). Everything resulted in the double black screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried loading up a different app that I don't have any problems with, perhaps to clear out any garbage .sav file that might've been stored internally, then loaded up the NoSave version. This time instead of the double black screen I had the top screen black, bottom screen white. I don't really know what else to try now, but I'll try out anything you could suggest.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a pity I can't seem to get this working, tomorrow afternoon I'm going away for a couple of days, and this like it would've been an awesome time killer.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit 2: Success! GeoWars_nosave.nds didn't work, but using dsbuild to make a .ds.gba version did! And there was much rejoicing. Hopefully with a valid blank .sav file, the regular .ds.gba will work for me.
<br/>
<br/>
Your game is really cool, and has quite a professional polish to it. It's got me thinking about trying my hand at my own little shooter type DS project now that I've finished classes for the year (haven't done much for the DS other than compile and run some examples). For one of my subjects I needed to make an Asteroids clone, so might try porting that from Qt to VideoGL.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
