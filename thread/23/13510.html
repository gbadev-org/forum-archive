=== THANKS ===
<br/>
Mollusk - for PAlib
<br/>
<br/>
=== INSTALLATION ===
<br/>
Copy DrinkS.nds to your cart.
<br/>
<br/>
=== ABOUT ===
<br/>
DrinkS is a utility to help you and your pals with your power hour and century club excursions.
<br/>
What is power hour  or century club?  They are drinking games where you take one shot of beer
<br/>
every minute for either one hour (power hour) or 100 minutes (century club).
<br/>
Doesn't sound like much drinking?  Let's do the math:
<br/>
One shot = 1.5 ounces
<br/>
One shot * 60 minutes = 90 ounces
<br/>
12 ounces per beer (bottle or can)
<br/>
	90 / 12 = 7.5 beers in an hour!
<br/>
<br/>
Or one shot * 100 minutes = 150 ounces
<br/>
	150 / 12 = 12.5 beers in a little over 1.5 hours!
<br/>
<br/>
=== GAMEPLAY ===
<br/>
Just boot up DrinkS, select either power hour or century club and start the drinking.
<br/>
DrinkS displays the amount of drinks taken, seconds until next drink, starting time, and current time.
<br/>
A great feature of DrinkS is the audio cues:
<br/>
Start of game: Super Mario Bros. coin sound
<br/>
Every minute: Super Mario Bros. power up sound
<br/>
5 minutes to the end: Super Mario Bros. hurry up sound
<br/>
End: Super Mario Bros. game over sound
<br/>
<br/>
