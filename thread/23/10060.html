Roffle. Sorry, trip lasted more than I expected (waaay more), it wasn't under my control :(
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway:

<br/>
<br/>
Changelog: Lots
<br/>
- Added support for sending / receiving user display pictures through MSNSLP
<br/>
- Added support for sending / receiving INK gifs (not sure if works with official client, it does work with aMSN, kopete and others)
<br/>
- Can handle now 302 Transfer in SSL auth (I think, if it doesn't, contact me)
<br/>
- Added keyboard pressed key mask thingy a lot of people asked.
<br/>
- Updated to devkitpro19
<br/>
- Fixed bugs where some transaction ids were expected to be 1 char long
<br/>
- Changed principal interface
<br/>
- Can change now avatar / display name
<br/>
- Fixed bug where would crash if disconnected while chatting
<br/>
- Fixed bug where MSN would still consider you online / in some session even after closing (in my PC works fine, probably an error of socket closing of the lib)
<br/>
- Fixed some stuff where a principal would create new tabs continuously because beup didn't recognize that it had left the one before
<br/>
- Tabs now appear only after partner sends a message (so sessions used only for avatar exchange don't clutter the tab container)
<br/>
- Added some sounds
<br/>
- Tabs now use principal names instead of account
<br/>
- Fixed chat tabs in general
<br/>
- Changed button look
<br/>
- Simplified principal synchronization (hope it crashes less now)
<br/>
- Implemented composite glyphs for dstype (now can display accents / tildes / stuff)
<br/>
- More other stuff that I can't remember.
<br/>
<br/>
Stuff still wrong:
<br/>
- DHCP still fails sometimes (probably the lib, probably *I*'m using the lib in a wrong way)
<br/>
- SSL still fails sometimes (tell me somebody is writing a native SSL lib for the DS...)
<br/>
- WEP seems to crash regularly (can't check it since I don't use WEP)
<br/>
- I probably should create an interface to update network config on beup itself, so people shouldn't rely on firmware / weird dhcp behavior.
<br/>
- Still uses small keyboard (even though many have asked for a bigger one). Anybody knows where to get a simplistic keyboard bitmap that doesn't have dozens of shade effects?
<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I'm sorry for making you wait. I'll start working on .3 soon.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: <span style="font-weight: bold">beup 0.3</span>
<br/>
If you don't want to get to page 23 to get .3, downloads are here:
<br/>
<br/>
With no fat lib support (for people using WMB, or who just don't want their card to be touched - saving is done in SRAM):

I didn't test already, but did you include the last version of dswifi ? The DHCP is more stable...
<br/>
<br/>
And what about a website hosted on drunkencoders ? You could post there screenshots, news, etc...
<br/>
<br/>
More thanks, Kevinc.. This one of the biggest homebrews (I respect the others projects too ^^ )

The version before the last, actually. I'm waiting for sgstair to implement FIONREAD (required by the SSL lib).

About the page in drunkencoders, I don't know, I'm not a fan of keeping blogs. I'll think about it.

It has been working 95% of the time now... I guess I was very unlucky to encounter that freeze bug on my first try :/
<br/>
<br/>
It froze once when I clicked on the 'X' for closing the chat window. Maybe that was caused by something else and it was just coincidence that I just pressed it that moment though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I didn't test already, but did you include the last version of dswifi ? The DHCP is more stable...

And what about a website hosted on drunkencoders ? You could post there screenshots, news, etc...

The version before the last, actually. I'm waiting for sgstair to implement FIONREAD (required by the SSL lib).
<br/>
<br/>
About the page in drunkencoders, I don't know, I'm not a fan of keeping blogs. I'll think about it.

<br/>
<br/>
1. Install SuperCard's patching software and go to it's folder.
<br/>
2. Copy 'save.sav' to the same directory where you keep your beup binary (make sure it's the .ds.gba version with a renamed ext - let's presume it's called 'beup.nds' - '.sc.nds' extension won't work, for some reason).
<br/>
3. Rename the .sav file to the same name as the beup binary (in our example 'beup.sav')
<br/>
4. Pop the CF back to your SC and run beup.
<br/>
5. Log-in using your data and then disconnect.
<br/>
6. Now turn the DS off and <span style="font-weight: bold">immediately</span> on again, go to the saver menu;
<br/>
7. Find 'beup.sav' and press A two times
<br/>
<br/>
There - every time you will run beup, the SRAM data from the .sav file will get copied into SC's SRAM. This way you won't need to enter the account info all over again :)
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: This works on all version of SuperCard. Tested &amp; working on my SC miniSD (yes, I know it has a battery backed SRAM, thankyouverymuch).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To compile, you must have:
<br/>
- devkitarm 19
<br/>
- latest libnds
<br/>
- DEVKITARM environment var set to the directory where you installed devkitarm
<br/>
- wifi lib is provided (until the cvs tree implements FIONREAD)
<br/>
<br/>
Then type make in the root folder.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you can put your own avatars in the "avatars" folder. But you must do "make clean all" in the root folder so that it takes in account the new files.
<br/>
They do have to be 96x96, and in png format (since that's what the spec asks for; normal clients do the transformations themselves, but I want to keep beup small). Reading from SD/CF cards is planned for the next version :D
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Again, a very small CVS update, addressing a few issues brought to my attention by people bugging me :)
<br/>
This CVS update contains:
<br/>
* DHCP fix! Now the intermittent failing of DHCP and the days of getting an IP of 0.0.0.0 should be over.
<br/>
* FIONREAD support (As requested)
<br/>
* connect() now operates in blocking mode! If you enable non-blocking mode before calling connect, it will still return immediately indicating success, but several people have asked for blocking mode (and I?ve been planning to add it anyway, just to be more ?correct?)
<br/>
<br/>
That?s all the feature updates at the moment, and I must apologize because they?re not very well tested at this point, but they should work. (I just don?t have the time to test today? at all)
<br/>
If for some reason they don?t work, please let me know, of course.
<br/>
Additionally, this is already known to some of you, but I have plans to add many new features and release a new precompiled library on friday or saturday this week - among the features planned to be added are: select() support, shared key authentication, support for ?hidden? APs (by way of probe requests), lingering TCP connections on close (so they shut down properly), and a few other large and small items. If you have requests, please post them :)
<br/>
Anyway, need to get back to work?..

I just uploaded the program compiled against the latest wifilib, the changelog reports a fixed connection bug, you can try again.

Anyway, WEP support in the lib is not excellent, so you may have better luck with WEP deactivated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As I said in the first post, while I'm not new to programming (coming from Java), this is my second big project for the DS and C++ :D (that's why my makefiles and my init routines look nooby - ok, the whole program *is* nooby).
<br/>
My philosophy for the CPU thingies is: arm7.c for ARM7, all the rest for ARM9. I was never a multitasking person myself.

Any help much appreciated, im using an M3 SDMini and launching it by pressing START rather than A. Im using a Ralink Soft AP from my computer, and when I sign into beup I'm guessing username is your passport email address?

good work Kevinc, and good luck with Ecuador ;)

i'm using DS (first European generation) with SD CF and all seems ok.
<br/>
drawings work, i can change avatars, sounds are ok, event the QPC method works
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't try DHCP or WiFi Hot-Spot

<br/>
About drawings: i think it could be more "sensitive", it's really hard to make a good drawing or writing, because even if the pen is well on the screen, there is sometimes no line or no plot.
<br/>
<br/>
There's still some problems with the keyboard but it's better.

Some ideas, what about

- Microphone ? ;)

- Several accounts ?
<br/>
- Smileys ?

Bad luck? *ducks* It depends on so many factors it's hard to count...

I'm really sorry, SSL is admittedly the worst part of my program, and even worse because I can't understand much of the lib (I didn't write it, I half ported it), and it seems most of the failures come from it...

I could add full unicode font support, but that would require 3+ MB fonts... and with it GBFS or some other system, and many cards can't handle that.

Bad luck? *ducks* It depends on so many factors it's hard to count...
<br/>

I'm really sorry, SSL is admittedly the worst part of my program, and even worse because I can't understand much of the lib (I didn't write it, I half ported it), and it seems most of the failures come from it...

I will give it first priority for the next release (even if I have to rewrite it), that I can promise :)</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Awesome :D! Thing is, nobody else on here seems to be having this problem - I've been trying to get on msn with it most of the day and it never gets past SSL.

Very likely. Does the DS Lite have a different channel alignment than the normal DS?

(and if it does, is there any way to detect in runtime if it's running in a Lite?)

<br/>
<br/>
"dude they made pictochat online?!"
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, here's a couple things I would like to see in the future: 
<br/>
<br/>
1. When using the drawing screen, you can press a button to make it maximize to fit most of the bottom screen, at least taking over the keyboard, so you can have more drawing space.
<br/>
<br/>
2. A button that instantly clears everything in the drawing space, like the one in Pictochat. Sometimes when I put the stylus down, it randomly draws a line across the screen. And it takes forever to erase - which brings me to my next point, more eraser options. The one on it is really tiny.
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, this program is already really awesome. Thank you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah! It outputs loads more writing now, far too much for me to take in actually. Plus there doesnt seem to be any way to scroll up :(

Anyway it says the date at the bottom, followed by "connection: close" and the number 500.

Very likely. Does the DS Lite have a different channel alignment than the normal DS?

I get stuck on the handshake every time. I have no trouble connecting to online games like mario kart but homebrew apps like this that use the firmware wifi settings seem to give me grief. I can use apps like bafio's wifi chat fine (that uses the wifi transfer settings right?) and as far as I can tell I have used the same ip's, gateways, etc. so I can't see why it has this problem.

<br/>
When drawing in Ink mode, it would be fantastic if the text box expanded to take up the entire screen.
<br/>
This way, one could communicate entirely with Ink in a more efficient way, since it is much easier to use than an onscreen keyboard (with some basic enhancements; Ink could still use some work... check out the drawing stuff in <a class="postlink" href="http://bafio.drunkencoders.com/" target="_blank">Bafio's DSChat</a>).
<br/>
Also with the Ink mode looking very different from the Text mode, it's easy to tell which one is being used.

Another thought: Why does Start log me out?

If you're referring to "search", the problem is that phpBB search 1. defaults to "any terms" (OR) unlike Google which defaults to "all terms" (AND), 2. creates a POST query unlike Google, which uses a GET query that can be copied into a forum posting, and 3. requires a wait of several seconds between queries unlike Google.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

If you use Ink mode, you'll notice that it bounces around a lot, too.

<br/>
I guess this is a good thing, since there are some vastly improved stylus libs available which someone may be able to just throw in.
<br/>
(Although, the keyboard could use replacing. Has anyone else noticed that Caps Lock doesn't work?)

I have the source with me, so maybe if I stare at it for long enough...
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
NVM... I can compile this thing mostly, but I'm having trouble with the Wifi lib.
<br/>
I think Kevin says it is included, but the compiler can't to find the included Wifi lib files. I added the wifilib to libnds, but still getting the same problem :(<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">my fiancee and I have been mucking around with v0.2a alot in the past couple of days and have been enjoying it thoroughly, but I do have a few suggestions for it.
<br/>
<br/>
Using the left and/or right triggers for shift/caps lock... i.e. click the trigger to toggle caps lock, and click it again to turn it off. You can also hold the trigger and click on any key to have it act like a shift key. This would allow for faster input with the stylus. (Left trigger would be better as shift, IMO, but have an option for Left handed people, remapping keys accordingly).
<br/>
<br/>
Have an option to automatically login the user after starting the program (rather than hitting Start) and then, once logged in, either have it set the person to Online, or the last selected Status.
<br/>
<br/>
Add the ability to select background color as well. Also, foreground and background color should be dynamically displayed in the entering box.
<br/>
<br/>
The color box should be larger, allowing the user more precise control over the selection, with perhaps some further dialog, like HSB, or RGB values, etc..
<br/>
<br/>
Add the ability to remap the keys. A and X work nicely, but, IMO, should be A and B, though some might prefer A and X.
<br/>
<br/>
Have a scroll bar on the right of the bottom screen that allows you to scroll the top screen through however much of a log can be kept in memory.
<br/>
<br/>
A menu button, similar to a Start Button on Windows, should be implemented for any additional functions, esp. all the simple things like logging off. Start is easy to use, but can be bumped and get annoying. Assigning it to a menu option would make more sense anyway (but don't stop people from being able to map it, via the remapping option mentioned earlier).
<br/>
<br/>
A timestamp function should be added - perhaps in an options menu, to append a timestamp to every message sent.
<br/>
<br/>
Are there any plans to add in a function to add contacts to the list? It's a bit of a chore to do so when away from a computer, and noone can seem to message us if they're not on our list.
<br/>
<br/>
How difficult would it be to add support for smilies and add the smilies built into MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger? (OR a generic list of smilies if there're copyright issues with using the ones in the official messengers).
<br/>
<br/>
These are just suggestions, and not demands - not trying to make them seem that way, and if they are, I apologize.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

Just tested it out and ink between beup and Windows Live Messenger works very well - just need some new options for the ink mode, like thicker lines, more real writing (for smoother lines - perhaps slower writing, not exactly sure here), an ability to change the size of the pen tip and eraser tip, an option for clearing an entire drawing, etc..<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

I'm not sure exactly what you mean, since your wording was a little confusing to me, however I think I have an idea about what you're trying to say.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think that any parties involved could charge you for using beup on based on two things. First you have entered into no such agreement for a payed service. Second they have no way to way to bill you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
The only reason why it says "Mobile" on a computer end is because a little bit of code in beup instructs the opposite side to see you as a Mobile messenger.
<br/>
<br/>
(I could be wrong on that last part - it might be because of the way beup logs into the system, causing the servers to believe it's a mobile unit. It still doesn't change the fact that you can't be billed for using it)<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i very much like this app... after confusion on why i couldn't connect to it with my AP or even the other IRC application. I noticed i could use this on my neighbours open connection. So my only issue seems to be that if you do not Broadcast the SSID (but know it personaly) it will not work. and also if you use wep it seems to not work...
<br/>
after changing in my AP to broadcast the ssid and took off wep, in other words completely open, it worked however. Anyways to address this issue so it can work better with WEP and a non broadcasted SSID? Mario Kart and other games can do this through these settings, so i'm sure it is possible...  other than that i'm very happy someone out there figured this out , it's a great program! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Turning off SSID broadcasting isn't going to do anything security-wise, FYI.  Anyone that is seriously interested in getting into your router isn't going to be stopped by either of those methods.  If all you want is to keep casual passersby off of your router, WEP is all that is necessary.

<br/>
yes, like i said you can turn off SSID broadcasting, but then the application does not work, mario kart will work, but not this application, also having wep on screws with this application aswell. So when i finally Broadcasted the SSID and turned off WEP, i could get this MSN thing to work.... also an homebrew irc couldn't connect unless i did this aswell, (but some various DS games can get online with no ssid broadcast and WEP turned on)
<br/>
<br/>
anyways, as for the security of other people connecting, i think i figured out something good enough. i just added my nintendo ds mac address and turned on Wireless Card Access List, and Turn Access Control On.... so now only varified macs can get on.

beup supports SRAM saves, so if you've got an M3, you can create a savegame for it, and it will work fine like that. I don't know how the other flashcarts work, to be honest, but the Supercard probably works almost the same like that.. if you have any trouble, just ask, and someone should answer you :)<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

It appears to be due to the subpixel order being different on the DS-Lite's top screen. I suspect that any homebrew utilising sub-pixel fonts from now on will need to perform a check for whether a DS-Phat or DS-Lite is being used and then use the appropriate font.
<br/>

you will be able to see your <span style="font-weight: bold">Fake Friends </span>(people who deleted you from there list, but you still got them in your own list)

and <span style="font-weight: bold">Faked friends </span>(vice versa)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">even without using an external file. if you have a savegame for beup, the savegame has the user name and password in it, other unsavory homebrew could just send the save games up to their sites, etc.. I like the idea of external files though, because it would allow for logs to be created, full friends lists that would only have to be updated on reconnection (rather than having no friends list and it has to be downloaded every single time).
<br/>
<br/>
OT, Kevinc, what does the name Beup mean? I've been reading these forums a LOT and haven't found why it's called that.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

So the GBAMP does not use any kind of save system like other, more recent flashcarts? useful bit of information - I didn't know that.. Adds another good reason to have external files for settings, et al.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

Also, is it possible to get Ink/Drawing to work normally with official MSN clients such as Messenger Live (ver8)? As I talk mainly in Korean to heaps of my friends/family, Ink would be the only way to write them as BeUp doesn't support Korean. =P

But... as lots have pointed out:

<br/>
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">The keyboard is a usability disaster!!</span>
<br/>
<br/>
It is so frustrating to use and I hit the wrong characters all the time.

I have mocked up my ideal solution. If you like it and think it is better than what we currently have, then please push the author to include it in the next release.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well when i press the wrong buttons it's not actually <span style="font-weight: bold">me</span> pressing them, it's the touchscreen code in the lib or wherever, to make this more accurate I reckon the touchscreen should control a little mouse cursor and a button should be devoted to *clicking* (eg. the L shoulder button).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
here's an example to show how well it actually works

(stylus to move cursor, L to 'click')

also when trying my example try tapping in one place, if you have the same problem as me, you'll notice sometimes the cursor goes flying off to a random place (though the touchscreen works perfectly on emulator)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Perhaps Kevin can persuade DragonMinded to lend him the keyboard in DSOrganize?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have been trying to compile it lately to attempt changing the keyboard myself, but the special (in a good way ;)) arrangement of the program is causing me a bit of trouble.
<br/>
Could anyone who has compiled it successfully please post what platform you used, if you encountered any problems, and how you overcame them?
<br/>
(And I'll try to get those error messages again so I can write them here).
<br/>
Thanks in advance!

Other features I noticed, in case you forgot you added them :)
<br/>
Added support for better readability with the top screen of a DS-Lite.
<br/>
New graphics.
<br/>
Logout button. (Hmmm... that icon confused me...)
<br/>
Improved touch screen support. (I now can use Ink mode).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

<br/>
Just a little bit stressed &gt;:)
<br/>
Rewriting 10K lines of messy code isn't a relaxing exercise. But fun! You can do a lot of planning in advance to create some cool effects. 
<br/>
<br/>
You eventually notice that you can't just rewrite text manually at a fixed pixel location everytime, keep pushing bitmap pixels by hand on every repaint() event, and expect that system to be scalable. Right now, with a set of widgets, I can create whole forms in 15 lines of code, that just tells me when an event happened (on click, doubleclick, mouse move, etc). And not specify a single position! everything just positions itself; that's useful when strings might change size, and would not look centered anymore on another language. And *that* has been where most of the bulk of the rewriting has been: reusability and automatization.
<br/>
<br/>
And about the fat libs, yeah, that I wasn't very enthusiastic about. Especially when at one time I had to recompile the program for 5 different libs. Right now is either you're libfat compatible or too bad. Each widget loads their bitmap skin from the drive, font and strings from translations are all read from configuration files (which are outside the program), so no FAT access would be impossible.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://akzeac.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://akzeac.blogspot.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by kevinc on Sun Oct 29, 2006 1:47 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, Bomber here...
<br/>
<br/>
I am just another person who needs help, after tryin' to get Beup workin' right serveral times. This is all the information I've gathered and I hope someone can help me out. Please help after readin' the followin: 
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">First things first:</span>
<br/>
* Passcard3 and a Supercard (DS Lite)
<br/>
* Mini SD
<br/>
* Wireless internet (Usin' WEP)
<br/>
* IP: 192.168.1.12
<br/>
* Usin' Beup 0.3 chishm (also have Beup 0.3 rein, but usin' this as backup.)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Problem:</span>
<br/>
* I power up my DS Lite and execute Beup 0.3 . Then, if I do nothin', Beup himself uses 'firmware' and I arrive at the next page. From there, if I fill in my email and password, leave the two boxes for 'auto loggin' and 'fix blur' open, change my start status to everythin' BUT offline and hit the connect button, Beup begins to connect. And that's where it all ends. Last two words:
<br/>
<br/>
"Doing handshake.."
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Things I have already done, but do not understand:</span>
<br/>
* I can interfere from the moment I execute Beup and need to fill in my IP address by pressin' 'stop'. Then I can make Beup find a couple of SSID's, includin' my wireless connection, but even then if I choose my own connection I will get the same outcome. Normally, Beup uses 'firmware' to connect and the SSID stays blank. W...what?
<br/>
<br/>
* I read somewhere that in order to save your settings, you have to copy 'save.sav', rename it to the same Beup you're using and then add it, in my case, in the SD Card. Enter your settings one time when executin' Beup, immediatly disconnect, goto the saver menu of the Supercard and press A two times to save everythin'. I did this, although as discribed earlier, if I connect usin' SSID, disconnect and then save in the saver menu, Beup will not remember the SSID I logged in with. Huh?
<br/>
<br/>
* I've changed my WIFI connections in the DS usin' Metroid Hunters/Lost Magic (Great games =D) I've changed the last digit of my IP address. So to say, .12 became .13 . Question: My normal IP ends with .12 , but I've changed the IP address to .13 in my DS. Which IP must I use to log in at Beup? .12 , .13 or somethin' else?
<br/>
<br/>
* I've taken a good look at my internet connection and I think everythin' is supposed to be as it is. The connection is OPEN, not SHARED. I can't seem to disable my WEP, but from what I have heard Beup can work with or without WEP. The WEP keys are HEX, not ACSII. The only thin' I haven't seen yet is 'DHCP'. I heard that DHCP can be the problem, but then again kevinc himself said that Beup is supposed to work with DHCP.
<br/>
<br/>
That's 'bout it. If I forgot somethin', please let me know. I hope someone took his/her precious time to read all this and help me out. I would appriciate it from the bottom of my heart.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Many people have today been complaining that they cannot connect using beup. The is infact a valid reason for this being that the IP address that beup is trying to connect to, is no longer a valid MSN dispatch server.  
<br/>
<br/>
There is a fix for this as posted by kevinc but nobody has posted any fixed versions yet:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Beup is trying to connect to an IP which no longer points to a valid MSN dispatch server. I don't have the resources to recompile beup right now, so if anybody wants a quick fix, go to msn.cpp and change the Dispatch_IP line to: 
<br/>
<br/>
#define Dispatch_IP IP(65, 54, 239, 20) 
<br/>
<br/>
then recompile as normal. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've begun work on 0.4, so sorry if I'm not properly maintaining 0.3 for the moment  
<br/>
<br/>
Normal Recompile: 
<br/>
There is no default makefile. Instead, if you want to compile, for example, the "nofat" version, try make -f make-ds-nofat. For the "rein" version, try make -f make-ds-rein. And so on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I had it too, most of the time its caused because of you being to far away from your router/wi-fi stick.

try to move as close as possible to your router/wi-fi stick and see if it works then.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is based on libfatdragon, btw the make-ds-dragon has LDFLAGS set to -lfat-rein instead of -lfat-dragon, so it took me a lot of time to understand why it didn't work.

Remeber that settings are stored in beup-user file.

when i type the word, C ... O ... M ... P. Now what would be nice if the client automaticly fill's in the remaiming letters. Or just asks me in some way "do you mean 'computer'?" The i click on yes and then it fill's in the word "computer" itself..

<br/>
<br/>
First of all, thanks to guys like you, the DS has demonstrated to be more powerful and versatile than people think. 
<br/>
<br/>
And now the serious thing. I still can't connect with BeUP. Have the common SSL trouble, it gets sticked there all the time. I have the european black DS Lite with Supercard DS One (micro SD 1Gb). It's a so-called Slot-1 card. Does that have anything to do with the malfunction of BeUP?

I've been reading from the first page of this thread and I thought that the problem was gonna be solved by increasing the SSL Authentication time limit but I'm still not able to connect. I also tried to run the test.nds (SSL test that appears some pages before this) but the link doesn't work anymore.

I have set up my connection properly meaning I can connect an play online with Mario Kart, Mortal Kombat and download Puzzles with the Layton game.
<br/>
<br/>
So the connection is fine (I strongly assume)
<br/>
<br/>
I've been testing Beup earlier (think it was 0.3e), but I always got stuck on "doing handshake". Is the latest version working? And in that case, do someone have a direct link? There are som many different versions. Hard to find the correct one.
<br/>
<br/>
That would have been really great! :D

I downloaded this file from his site:
<br/>
File name: Beup Live 0.3e.nds
<br/>
Disk usage: 1 261 568 byte
<br/>
<br/>
I tried to run it without DLDI patching, and with DLDI patching. The result was the same (anyway I think the software on my R4DS chip can patch on the fly so..)
<br/>
<br/>
I still get this message when trying to connect:
<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="font-weight: bold">Starting connection</span>
<br/>
Connected to the MSN dispatch server
<br/>
Doing handshake..."
<br/>
<br/>
Then after 1-3 minutes (varies), it says:
<br/>
<br/>
"Lost contact to server, disconnecting"
<br/>
<br/>
Is this a regional problem? To me it seems to be no relation between correct installation/setup and being able to log in successfullly.
