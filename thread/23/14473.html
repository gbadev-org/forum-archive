    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">PokeyDS is the new emulator released by the great Alekmaul.
<br/>
<br/>
Version 1.0 features :
<br/>
<br/>
* complete Atari 800 XL emulation (no roms needed)
<br/>
* keyboard (with stylus)
<br/>
* sound emulation
<br/>
<br/>
I've tested a few games so far. All of them are playable and most of them run actually pretty fast. Make sure to try out Fort Apocalype. This one really works great on this emu and the game is still very addictive.
<br/>
<br/>
You can download Pokey DS here (down the page) :

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh that would suck! I know the C64 has more bells and wistles when it comes to sound and color, but I've always had a soft spot for the Atari 8-bit, maybe because it is the forefather of the Amiga hardware, I dunno, but it is definatly good hardware, I should know I ran them from the early 80's on into the mid-90's along side my Amiga. :)
<br/>
<br/>
 Anyhow, this emu's sound needs work, and the controls are messed, it's like you can't hold down the button and change direction and what not, which really screws up game play when you are trying to ge through Crownland or Yoomp or something and you are stuck going in one direction or constantly jumping...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It might be, but the real question is does it matter for a system that is 24 years old?
<br/>
That being said I really regret selling all my atari stuff a while back :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it is called Abandonware. Besides even if they did want to re-market it, it would only come as part of a pack in on some large game compilation which would prolly sell for $20 or less, then drop down to about a $5.00 value a few months after that, so I ask,"how badly are you hurting the industry by downloading that OLD game?". :)
<br/>
<br/>
 Anyhow, I really regret getting rid of all my old Atari's too. I literally had a closet STACKED to the ceiling with 800Xl's in the box with manuals and all. Plus floppy drives with boxes and manuals, Atari's with there RAM doubled, an OS switch with built in OS's in them, you name it. I had a TON and used my Atari(s) every day for years!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Infact they just persuaded me to buy another 130XE, now that I know the cart slot now has an IDE interface for it, which supports CF cards with no external power supports. On top of that, it supports ATR images! :)

Infinite.
<br/>
<br/>
There might just be the chance that a copyright is running out and not requested for another period after the first phase (50yrs in the EU, 95 in the US) so that a creative work might be opened for the public.
<br/>
<br/>
Historic artwork could be lost otherwise. (Imagine the inherited copyright holders on Beethoven's compositions to "not care" and thus very valuable historic work beeing banned for the public)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is no saving on disk possible on Pokey DS.

Frodo sux. IT can play some commercial games but it sux when running demos. If somebody is going to port Frodo, he could spend that time in more productive manner.
<br/>
<br/>
There are 3 other c64 emulators that work much beter - VICE, CCS64 and the new one Hoxs64. Thoug they are all need a lot of computing power to run smoothly. VICE runs ok on my GP2X (2x 200MHz ARM processor), but occasionaly slows down on some more intensive demos, especialy ones that run some code on the disc drive, even with sounds turned down to low quality.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

Thanks for asking (and translating) the question for me.  It'll be worth the patience.  This is the kind of excellent homebrew that makes me consider doing some homebrew myself...i continue to be amazed at the homebrew community on the DS</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
