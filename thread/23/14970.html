    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i tried to run it in no$, but first i got some warnings, then i got a black bottom  (3d) screen when "touching" it. i guess it's all "start", no other options available right now, isn't it? note, that i tried the blank .nds i downloaded - with the latest publicly available version of no$ (means the second last version, the newest one is only available via a donation.)
<br/>
<br/>
well, i'd love to see it work, but i haven't access to my hardware atm, so no$ was the only way to try. btw: sound works just ok, it's just the rendering that doesn't.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
