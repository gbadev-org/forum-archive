    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just looked at the Lilou FTP web page. The DSFTP server executable is supposed to be just a demo of libdsftp, which embeds a server in any .nds file so that the user can "cut to a server" without rebooting the DS. Do you plan to also package your FTP server as a library, in order to make your claim of succession more complete?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Given the recent work going into nds launching code it may not be long before we have the ability to launch the server from within other apps. That's probably the best solution all round.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

First of all, I am <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> the programmer. I am a happy user, only! 
<br/>
Maybe 'Lilou' - who ever she/he is - will tell us something about it. 
<br/>
<br/>
Second thing, I have never heared somebody using DSFTP as an integrated ftp server. So I do not know the worth of it... 
<br/>
<br/>
For me, I use it as a standalone ftp server (and in the future as ftp client as well) - like many others do. So I am much more interested in a reliable and fast connection.

Basically agreed.

Give the guy some credit. We all run the risk of corruption when we test new homebrew without other's prior commetary. and one persons corruption might be an isolated case.

Quit your pathetic brown-nosing.
<br/>
<br/>
I support these endeavors and realize that there is a risk involved.
<br/>
<br/>
However, if something like an ftp client corrupts data during typical operation, then the simple thing is to warn against using it as it is very likely to corrupt data for other people, at least until the kinks are worked out.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, your post was little more than a disguised attempt to plug-in your site.  Of course, since you're going to try to do that by bashing me, I'm just going to call you out for being an idiot.
<br/>
<br/>
The corruption was not an "isolated case", and strangely I've never had any "isolated cases" with other, more/longer developed homebrew.  I'm not the only one who has had corruption using this ftp client and so if I experience bad corruption while using it I AM going to warn others no matter how much you wet your pants over it.
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't bash lilou and I respect him for working on something that the DS homebrew scene could use.  However, I also realize that data-damaging bugs during normal uploading/downloading operation on a ftp client make it too risky too use consistently.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
