    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SaTa was the maintainer of REIN, a backup tool for the save chips on DS Game Cards.  Like DragonMinded with DSOrganize, he stopped developing his work after it became clear that the community could no longer keep up with the new makes and models of SLOT-2 storage devices.  But unlike DragonMinded, SaTa did not resume REIN after chishm introduced the DLDI framework for SLOT-2 device drivers. A few other tools, such as <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=12848" target="_blank">eepinator</a>, came in to fill the gap.
<br/>
<br/>
Though REIN had specific support for <span style="font-style: italic">Daigassou! Band Brothers</span>, no program to my knowledge has had specific support for <span style="font-style: italic">Animal Crossing: Wild World</span>. Until now.
<br/>
<br/>
RAC is a homebrew tool to back up an ACWW town (or the save data of any other DS Game Card with a 2 Mbit save chip) to a SLOT-2 storage device for Nintendo DS. It is capable of displaying the town name and names of residents in ACWW saves, and it names each backup after the town name and current date. It can also restore saved data from a SLOT-2 device to such a Game Card.

RAC uses Cardme, the same SLOT-1 save I/O library that REIN used before SaTa abandoned it. You'll have to ask DragonMinded whether plug-ins can access SPI bus directly; if so, you can use Cardme.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It's not an issue with DS Game Cards but with SLOT-2 devices. SaTa terminated REIN before DLDI became popular. It doesn't work correctly with every make and model of SLOT-2 device. Specifically, it doesn't work with the version of SuperCard SD that my cousins have. It also doesn't name backup files after the town name, making it difficult to sort out backups of Picken, YoshiX, and MegaTown.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah thank you, that is an improvement in naming.  I use M3ProLite  (micro sd) in slot 2 and it seems that is supported by REIN hence no issues.  Thanks for posting this.  I will give it a try.  Just the naming alone is a big improvement.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

According to a video tutorial posted on Youtube (and I believe here at GBAdev as well), REINMOON works on a standard Supercard SD.  However, I'm guessing that it would not work on newer Supercards that have the hardware change that prevents older homebrew like NES DS from accessing the filesystem correctly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
