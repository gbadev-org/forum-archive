    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hyena is an AudioGame player for multiple platforms.
<br/>
<br/>
Inspired by the AudioBooks, Hyena allows game-books to be played with only sound and just one button. This makes it possible to play games while your body is occupied with other things, like driving or out running (or while sitting in class :)).
<br/>
<br/>
Hyena v1.00 is bundled with:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And do try to play the game with the lid closed. It's probably the first DS game where you fully can do that. :)  (as long as you have headphones).
<br/>
<br/>
I also want to thank the people making it possible to do homebrew like this for the DS; they receive far too little credit. Hyena uses libnds, libfat, efs_lib and as_lib, so a huge thanks goes out to joat, dovoto, noda, chishm and everyone else who has contributed to these libraries. Also, extra special thanks the people behind this forum that provides so much information and support and last but not least to wintermute for the whole devkitPro setup that makes things so much easier: I owe you all.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.

Added later: I discovered my problem. I needed to install the AudioGames folder along with the Hyena.nds. Now I get the Lone Wolf AudioGame. I'll try it out now. Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I often thought games played purely with audio would work well on stuff like Ipods.

A DS version where you can play a game with the lid closed is a cool concept.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Had a very quick play with this. Here are a couple of initial thoughts:
<br/>
<br/>
The volume is quite low.
<br/>
I get some corruption of the hyena logo graphics at the start. Only a few pixels and it varies between runs.
<br/>
<br/>
Could you make it so that you can scroll the text upwards with the stylus?
<br/>
Something like tapping the top part of the screen scrolls up and tapping the bottom scrolls down. And/or drag (up and down) the text with the stylus. And/or place the stylus on the screen than then scroll up (or down) by moving the stylus up from this starting position, the further from the starting position the faster the scroll.

That message only appears the first time the app is run (or if you move the .nds file to another location). But it seems like the problem is later on, since that screen dissapears. I would guess that it fails to load the external data files but since I've omitted to have a decent error message, we can't be sure.
<br/>
<br/>
splotch, make sure the files on the in the archive are on the memory card in the same structure (i.e. in the AudioGames folder that should lie next to the Hyena.nds). If that doesn't work, I hope to release a small update soon that should be a bit more talkative if something is wrong.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm seem to have more problems where the sound-engine shuts down when you boot the game. But since it's not that often and it doesn't affect the game-experience I haven't bothered to track it down. If you have no audio when you start the game, just reboot.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I want to know - is the text-to-speech conversion integrated in the game itself and will Hyena speak other English language text provided as TXT gamebook, or is reading only available for the Lone Wolf game thanks to the 40 mb file? The 40mb file contains what - WAVs of spoken text or real text-to-speech engine? Can it be reused for other games?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got surprised as well when I heard the this speech synthesis the first time. It's generated as mp3 offline on my PC and as you guessed, stored in the big data file. Having this kind of quality speech synthesis would probably not be possible on a DS since the speech engine is a couple of 100 MB and I also doubt that the DS would have the processing power needed. Also, it's worth noting that this particular voice is a couple of years old, and I've actually heard a few newer voices that sounds even better. I haven't been able to get hold of one of those for use with SAPI5.1 and a license that makes it usable. Working on it though. :)
<br/>
<br/>
But as to if it can be reused: The PC version of Hyena generates all this audio from the game-book itself, so as long as there is a game-book in Hyena format, the voice comes basically for free. I would prefer someone recoding the voice though. :)<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
