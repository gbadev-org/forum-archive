dSTAR is the first MIDI sequencer for the Nintendo DS.  dSTAR aims to be an x0x style sequencer 
<br/>
with unique music programming capabilities.  With drawable modulation tracks and quick tap
<br/>
beat entry, dSTAR takes advantage of the Nintendo DS's touchscreen to become a tactile

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Very good work! Now that it has DSMI, I could finally test it in action, and it's really fun! I tested it with Ableton Live, which has many great synths, and it's just cool to make sequences and vary them in different ways.
<br/>
<br/>
The one criticism I have is that if you want to change the numerical controls like BPM, say, from 0 to 100, you have to tap 100 times. Maybe it would be better to automatically count up/down if the stylus rests on the control for a second or so.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, very cool stuff!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks, and thanks again for helping me bring the project back to life ;)  Yah I was noticing that problem again too.. especially with the BPM since it can be varied so widely.   
<br/>
<br/>
The source code is horrendous at this point... I need to organize it a bit.  :)  
<br/>
<br/>
If I add more features they will be:
<br/>
-Fix numeric inputs for faster input
<br/>
-Note length input.
<br/>
-Multiple note/chord input, with MIDI in
<br/>
-Pattern chaining
<br/>
-MIDI Clock out.<br/>_________________<br/>DSMIDI and dSTAR sequencer brought to you by TheRain

I'd love to be able to use it, but lock on my DSX right after booting :( (yes it's DLDI patched).<br/>_________________<br/>DS-Xtreme 4Gb [Fw 1.1.2]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Mmm, there are a couple of random apps that don't work, ZXDS 0.5 beta1, is the latest one. LMP-ng also has graphical corruption, but does work somewhat (not counting the problems of actually playing mp3 files).
<br/>
<br/>
There are really very few apps that don't work on the DSX :(, and I've been crossing my fingers for a very long time waiting for the day when DStar would actually work. I'm sure someday it will, or I'll eventually buy another cart for my DS, giving me some scope for the few random apps that don't work. Perhaps u should make a list of the devices it does work well on!
<br/>
<br/>
The app has always actually boot but always hangs without ever giving any interaction, before the DLDI version graphis were corrupted and wrongly placed, with the DLDI version it's all well drawn with slight graphical corruption, but hangs just after booting.
<br/>
There was some probs with saving and loading with nitrotracker a while back but have since been corrected with a fix on the DLDI driver.
<br/>
<br/>
I've seen you have on the todo to make a better skin for it, if you want help on that field I can help with that, I can at least see that part on my DS :). I've done payk's wolveslayer menu's, and am working on the flip ebook reader (if you want so see a samll sample of work...).
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: red">EDIT:</span>
<br/>
Well I've actually gotten it to work, moved both binary and patterns.bin to root and it now works.
<br/>
It still has graphical corruption, and strangely I can't ear any sound at all. Coud I be doing anything wrong? I got every track with lenght 16, different pattern on every track, tried keyboard, changing midi channel, play with A, and nothing, does it have to be connected thru wifi to work? I assume the dstarpatterns.bin is already loaded with some somples!<br/>_________________<br/>DS-Xtreme 4Gb [Fw 1.1.2]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah yes... patterns.bin has to be in the same directory as dSTAR :)  
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what kind of graphical corruption you're getting... but dSTAR itself makes no sound unfortunately, it only controls remote devices and programs over MIDI...<br/>_________________<br/>DSMIDI and dSTAR sequencer brought to you by TheRain

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ahh, I thought that might be the case, are you envisioning having it work as a sequencer with output capabilities on the ds itself in the future, it would be a really great app to have and to sketch ideas on the go! Nitrotracker is great aswell but different, dstar is much more flexible to work with.
<br/>
About the skin, does my proposition interest you or are you not? If it is I can at least put down some ideas whenever I get a feel for it :), even if you are not planning on getting to it soon!<br/>_________________<br/>DS-Xtreme 4Gb [Fw 1.1.2]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yah, your proposition sounds just great... e-mail me at <a href="mailto:collin_meyer@collinmeyermusic.com">collin_meyer@collinmeyermusic.com</a> and I'll e-mail you back with my .psd files for all the graphics.  
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure about putting some sort of audio synthesis into dSTAR... I mean, not long ago it would have been my dream but now I'm more concerned about where I'm going to be working at the end of school and stuff, so taking on a challenge like that seems less interesting :?/   I may consider something simple later though, like a drum sound per track.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well you can always do little bits now and then whenever u get an urge to! But would it be very difficult to load samples from a cart instead of fetching the midi's, at least as a basis.
<br/>
Anyway, as long as you have fun with it, that's the main issue :D.
<br/>
I do hope you finish school with a good grade and manage to grab a cool job :).<br/>_________________<br/>DS-Xtreme 4Gb [Fw 1.1.2]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
