love the brush size pressure sensivity, the interface is great with transparency for brush/color choice, perhaps a little less transparency would be cool to see more clearly everything ... but thats great ^^.

i seem to be getting a bit more of that "jumping" behavior than 1.05, but i've only spent a few minutes with it so i'll see if that is just coincidental.
<br/>
<br/>
the solution to the brush outline while you are in dynamic brush size mode works great.

truly nice Jesse. The pressure controls size works great (lots of stylus jumping but useful).
<br/>
Playback controls rocks.
<br/>
the only thing I miss is the minimalist approach for the interface (plain colors mainly).

<br/>
I'm running an M3 SD, and 1.05 works perfectly fine. I've tested 1.06 with the original m3 sd dldi patch, as well as the alternate, and I've tested it with/without the colors folder, and with/without an sram save, etc.. Nothing I've done has pushed it past that error, however.
<br/>
<br/>
Any clues as to what might be causing this, and anything I can do on my end to fix it?

DLDI patching works, in general. You usually need to use the .gba version of homebrew, or better apply a GBA header to the .ds version.

That happen to a few people during testing as well. I'm been trying to get around it, but haven't found a solution yet. It's hard to track down since it doesn't appear for me.

DLDI patching works, in general. You usually need to use the .gba version of homebrew, or better apply a GBA header to the .ds version.

I dont want to promise too much and then disappoint you.
<br/>
Things I want to get sooner than later:
<br/>
- posibility to delete your own submissions (there wont be edit, but you could delete pictures if you messed up with naming, etc. and reupload them).
<br/>
- posibility to manage your own data.
<br/>
- visualisation of the favorites feature (all pictures you like are being added to the list already, just there is no presentation for that) and posibility to reorganize them.
<br/>
- some more ways to browse gallery (sorting, maybe search feature)
<br/>
- some more info about pictures (number of strokes, painting time, how many comments there are, etc.)
<br/>
<br/>
And i have some more down the list.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

Sorry. The DS doesn't have enough memory to paint in that resolution. It is only the .drw that is uploaded and the painting is redrawn on a bigger canvas by the server where I don't have to worry about memory. It has been suggested that I could take advantage of RAM cartridges on the DS but it would be a lot of work for a small segment of the users.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The only things I can ask for now are, a square brush and the ability to constrain the size of the brush between fixed values when pressure is controling it. It can perhaps help prevent stylus jump because it seemed to happen more at vey small sizes.
<br/>
<br/>
At second thought I like this interface a lot, I'm getting old, not so used to drastic changes I guess.
<br/>
I was wondering if the animated background under menus is a random thing created by the software ?
<br/>
<br/>
something weird happened.
<br/>
1.6 worked fine but I just wanted to try the WiFi so I put 1.6F on my M3lite/dslite/SD1gb and I got this error after initializing "EFSlib could not be initialized". I tried patching with the two DLDI drivers without success.
<br/>
Then I put back on 1.6 version and I have the same error. I don't understand what's happening because this version worked before I tried 1.6F .
<br/>
So I put 1.5 back on, just to dry my tears in some sketches.
<br/>
But 1.6 was really good and I wanted to try more so, finaly I decide to give a last try and I remove 1.5, put 1.6 again and it worked !!!
<br/>
Anyone has some clues on what cause this behaviour ?

I think adding support for a RAM pack would benefit a lot of users, not because people have RAM packs, but because they might have to buy them to enjoy this app :)  Some people say they've even bought a DS just for this, I might head online and buy the original DS browser if homebrew this good utilizes the pack.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Hey, you are one of the people that taught me how to code Wi-Fi for DS, so you better tell me what the problem is! :)</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
Not knowing much what is actually causing the slowdowns: You could try the following - test if merely connecting but not sending over wifi does anything to the network. If it's all ok (as it should) then it's something about how you're sending the email that is flooding the network - in that case try limiting the send speed or packets artificially and see if that helps. Trying out different TCP packet sizes might be worth a shot as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course if you don't have this problem on your DS / network setup it might be hard to test... Also I don't know if any of the DS FTP programs have source code available, these might be useful references.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I also had the nasty text asking to update my card software (M3simply), I did it and 'Colors!' runs again with pride. At first I was a little confused with the new user interface (who wouldn't?) and I'm not really fan of the colorfull backgrounds of the new GUI but the extra zoom makes this version a must-have anyway. I didn't test the extra precision, 'unlimited save slots' and WiFi stuff yet but untill now Colors! didn't stop improving (and the Gallery too!).
<br/>
<br/>
One thing for the undo fans (what I once was): when you are satisfied with your work at one point or if you are about to try an incredible daring move with the stylus: save it. If you fuck up you'll be able to restart there like a check point in a videogame. Doesn't everyone do that?
<br/>

I've been doing that, but now I don't have to because of the playback. It's not that I screw up that I'm worried about (having to suffer the consequences teaches me to be careful) it's that sometimes a bad line shows up at random, whatever the cause is. It still happens with the new version and it seems to be the screen flaking off or whatever. But now that's not so bad either because with playback you don't have to expect it in order to deal with it.

<br/>
Stylus jumping usually happens when the pressure is very light, so changing the min-size would probably not improve things. 
<br/>
<br/>
About the min-brush size request: The current implementation says that min-brush size (that appears with the lightest pressure) always is the same (2 pixels width). Do you want to set that yourself, or should that be related to the max-brush-size instead (say like minbrush size would be 10% of the max-brush-size). That implementation was a bit hurried, and I never looked into how Photoshop/Painter does it and if I can get away with not having another option, I would prefer that.

I wanted to dig into the compability issues next and here is the status:

M3 SD - efs-lib problem, Looking into it.
<br/>
DS-X - two black screens, Looking into it.
<br/>
Games'n Music - One person had trouble, but seemed to work for another. I need more info on this.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just chiming in to say that Colors! is absolutely amazing. Just took v1.06 for a quick spin to test out some of the new features, and you've done a really good job with it. The look, feel and polish all represent the level of quality one would expect in a commercial application worked on by a team of programmers, and I hope that some day I'll be able to say similar things about my own programs.
<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to having a bit more time to get some proper drawing done. I'm not even an artistic person, but Colors! has inspired me to do more doodling.
<br/>
<br/>
(P.S. I'm using an M3 Lite (SD), and a DLDI patched v1.06f worked fine for me.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

* Some compability solved - Let me know if there still are flashcards it's not working on.

* Colors data-folder located next to executable instead of in the root
<br/>
* Minor graphical artifacts removed (thanks Noah)
<br/>
* Continue from mid-playback bugs fixed
<br/>
* Fixed a out-of-memory crash (thanks adamrgolf)

I'm not sure I see what you are seeing, but there was a cursor-bug there that I did a quick fix for.

That is true. Colors! can't really load a picture without all the files available. If you really want to get that .png into Colors!, you can replace a .png in another slot that has the .tmb and .drw files. It will look like the old in the load screen and the playback will also be from the old file, but you'll get the new .png on the canvas after loading that slot.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

About the min-brush size request: The current implementation says that min-brush size (that appears with the lightest pressure) always is the same (2 pixels width). Do you want to set that yourself, or should that be related to the max-brush-size instead (say like minbrush size would be 10% of the max-brush-size). That implementation was a bit hurried, and I never looked into how Photoshop/Painter does it and if I can get away with not having another option, I would prefer that.

You could have something like this one. Two limiters ,can be grey out if not active, draggable only if active. Automatic reset to the lowest value if the main slider has a higher value when switching modes.
<br/>
<a href="http://whitenights.free.fr/limiter.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
shifting a bit the top of the sliders might help selecting the max value on it.
<br/>
If low opacity is the factor, perhaps this can work ?
<br/>
With this type of setting you can have a feeling  closer to 'tradionnal painting', a subtle variation in the stroke. It works great with small sizes quite like a thick brush with ink. But I'm already happy with Colors!, just bitching.

I want this feature too, but I agree with Jesse that it's good to avoid too many sliders muddying up the options, but it's not very useful if it can't be set exactly, rather than a percent. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also note: disabled and zero are exactly the same option. If you put on two sliders, I would propose having a minimum distance between them in order to avoid stuck sliders. If you want anything less, disable sensitivity maybe?

Jesse, BIG FAN, loved your radio interview.
<br/>
<br/>
I also was having lockup errors, but I haven't tried g yet.
<br/>
<br/>
I know you get alot of requests for features,  but I havent seen eigther of these, so I thought I would mintion them.
<br/>
<br/>
First, i have the problem of not knowing what my brush stroke will look like, and I cant just draw and undo, so I was wondering about a small white box in the corner of the color/brush screen that lets you srcibble a line on it.  The line would then dissapear after like 1-2 secs, and you could repete this over and over, testing new colors and brushes.  I don't know what this woud do to memory and layout.  But this feature would ROCK.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Second, having a tiny address book, maybe just remembering a few emails would be great, I email almost every drawing to myself, my girfriend, and not having to type them in over and over would be sweet.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the awsome work.

Something like that has been suggested earlier. It's a good idea, but I'm still not sure how I would implement in a simple enough way. Also, there is a trick in there, if you just want to test out the brush size on the canvas. If you press and hold one of the zoom-buttons, touching the canvas will only display the cursor, and won't draw anything. Perhaps that helps.

Just an idea, but perhaps when holding L or R to bring up the color/brush screen, you could then choose your size and hold a second button, like the down arrow and it would bring up a white area with an area that says "test" or something. Then you could draw and see your stroke, release the down arrow and adjust if needed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yea. :) Depending on which hand you use, the test area could be brought up with L + Down, or R + B.
<br/>
<br/>
But even if you hold the DS in a way that makes this button combo hard to do, you don't really have to "draw" anything in the test area, you just need to be able to see a quick brush preview. So I'm sure users can get used a quick rotation to test out their brush selection.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: It's probably not a good idea to do a feature request for a feature request. But what would be really cool for the "test brush option" is if the test area had what you've drawn already and then you could test your brush against your current drawing, then upon releasing the test area buttons the drawing would be as it was before testing the brush.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Well, it is very much a gimmick and there is no other value than for it to look cool. :)
<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, you are not the only one who thinks that it is distracting. Still, I'm not completely sure how to look at that feedback. The way I see it, it could be the reaction of surprise that causes the distraction, because people are used to the way v1.05 looked and just get surprised when they open up the main menu and things are moving. Therefore it would be interesting to hear from people that didn't use v1.05 if they also find it distracting. Also, I'm not sure what people are distracted _from_. Do people have a harder time understanding the buttons or do they lose focus on whatever they were painting on? If it's the second, it's not necessarily a bad thing since the main reason to go into the main menu while painting is when you want to flip to reevaluate your composition, or if you want to save and shut down (well, not completely true, since you may want to save for other reasons). But still I agree to some extent, and my reaction was the same the first times I open the main menu after getting it in there. I?m just not sure what it means and that is why I wrote this long-winded post.

Jesse: It's colorful and moves which are both attention grabbers for starters. If it was only on a start up menu I don't think I'd mind but the menu is something you bring up while working and the extra fluff just kind of breaks the focus on what you are doing.

Got to know about it yesterday, and you asked for opinions about the animated background from new users. So here we go:
<br/>
I don't really find it distracting, however, it would be nice with an option to have a white background, or at least freeze the animation.
<br/>
<br/>
Saving, loading and wifi functions works perfect running Colors on an M3 Lite Micro. Earned a few points by mailing my GF a cute pic earlier today :&gt; 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also have a couple of feature requests: 
<br/>
<br/>
1: Would it be possible to implement a timeline slider in the replay control screen, to move around freely along the timeline?
<br/>
A nice extension to that would be if you could use that as an undo function by going o into replay mode, drag the slider to the position you want to go back to, and resume painting from there.
<br/>
<br/>
2: Not surprisingly, it seems like some areas on the touchscreen are not as pressure sensitive as others. Would it be possible to implement an advanced calibration option using some sort of "calibration grid" where you calibrate the pressure in a number of points on the touchscreen, and then interpolate the values between those points to overcome the sensitivity differences?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

"it's not necessarily a bad thing since the main reason to go into the main menu while painting is when you want to flip to reevaluate your composition"

I totaly agree with this statement. Now it makes sense to me. It can even be a feature, finding the best graphical way to wash your brain in order to stay fresh.

You really have a strong concept with Colors! and it shows with every release of your software. Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I own EZ5, my girl - EZ4.
<br/>
To make Colors work on her card I got to find out how Colors works :)
<br/>
"First time running" it checks some string in nds itself (in own binary file).
<br/>
If string is empty - then program change it and create COLORS directory.
<br/>
This is not behavior of programs that i'm used to, but anyway, in some cards (like EZ4), Colors probably couldn't write to itself!
<br/>
<br/>
I take my EZ5 initialized version, repatch it for DLDI, open in textpad (not notepad), found where "fat:/Colors.nds" and a bit change, for other card (But I mustn't do this, initialized NDS works well, I change name only for placing it in other directory than root).
<br/>
The only other thing I had do - copy /Colors directory.
<br/>
<br/>
Whatever, can you release both versions, initialized (with some standard filename in nds body) and current one?
<br/>
<br/>
It would be very nice for many people with those cards to look at colors ;)
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Colors - greatest homebrew for NDS yet!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here is a random thought...
<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that makes colors so wonderful is how simple it is.  That anyone can pick it up and be able to use it well in minutes.
<br/>
<br/>
However, for the hardcore COLORERS,  how about an advanced mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Rather than continueing to add more and more features in the main menu and therefore killing the simplisity of the program.
<br/>
<br/>
I for one would love switching to advanced.  Settings like: setting the pressure and it remembers, changing the menu background to white, maybe even changing the color selection screen layout, maybe diffrent skins...  There are hundreds of features that could be added.   But adding those settings to the program would kill the simplicity.
<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe asking you the first time you load the program if you want basic mode or advanced,  then adding a little button in the corner of the screen on the menu to switch back and fourth.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I duno, just a thought.

That would be much safer.

I would personaly liked that to have colors writting to the default direcotry only root:/colors than having a chance it wont work at all on some systems.

You know how alot of programs have a simple and an advanced mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Colors could have an advanced mode button, that would mabye give you a settings menu and such so that you could cusomize the program alot more.
<br/>
<br/>
That way you could add all of the features people are requesting, without making the program too complicated.

Yes. It's a bug. You can see the same thing if you are painting on the right or bottom side of the canvas. I've tried to fix it, but only manage to reduce it.

Okay, nice to hear. Guess time will tell if you manage to come up with something good then. If you don't, it still works to move the picture around to keep drawing in an area whose behavior you know :)

By the way, it would really be nice to be able to select a secondary color that you can activate by holding one of the shoulder buttons or something.

I believe I had resumed painting from playback. If you check the .drw you'll see why, my hand slipped and a fat light blue line went right through it.

I see your point, but even if they know your style and techniques in drawing you can't (i am speaking from experience) just become as good as the artist you learned your techniques from.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to share how i draw my Anime girls in colors so others could take something from my techniques and follow. That is my only way to help colors and fellow artist as well. They learn from me i learn from them.

I hope to see lots of Anime artist in the colors gallery in the future!

That is planned from the beggining too, at least posiblity to render images in higher resolution, but it will take some time.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Java applet/app has reached the grand old age of version 1.0.
<br/>
I believe it makes a good effort at rendering all current .drw files, i.e. those drawn using Colors! 1.06 or less.
<br/>
<br/>
Jetboy has made the .jar file available through the <a class="postlink" href="http://colors.brombra.net/downloads.php" target="_blank">Gallery's download page</a> so you can download it from there for off-line use.
<br/>
<br/>
Version 1.0 of the application can generate large renders (up to 2048 by 1536). In order to support the larger sizes you may have to increase the amount of memory available to the Java virtual machine. Here is an example of allowing  the VM to use 256 MiB:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">java -Xmx256M -jar ColorsDraw_1_0.jar</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
If not enough memory is available the application will try to fall back to a smaller render size. If you change the scaling whilst a .drw file is loaded there will be a pause whilst the renderer is set up for the new size.
<br/>
<br/>

If there was no rotation on the front page, there wouldn't be a chance for other pictures to break thru.

and on a related note, when i use the wifi option in the program it completely kills my connection, pretty much disconnecting everyone using the router (wifi and cabled connections) or just making it so slow noone can even load webpage,

once the transfer is stopped everything starts working fine, not sure why its having this effect as i've been able to use other wifi programs on the ds and haven't noticed any problems like this</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey.
<br/>
<br/>
New to the Colors! scene and suddenly, horrifyingly in love with it.
<br/>
I have a feeling I'll stop playing games on the train altogether. C'est la vie.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, first I'd like to exress my massive appreciation for the masterminds behind this homebrew and the web-gallery, and so on.. Nice work :D
<br/>
<br/>
And then I'm going to demonstrate my ignorance, general newbieness, and say some other stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok. Someday... Higher res canvas? It's my understanding that the DS lacks in the RAM department.. but is it possible to have Colors! read how much extra space is available on the SD card and then provide a variety of larger res options (or smaller) based on available space being turned into VRAM? &lt;--- this is undoubtedly more complicated than I make it out to be.
<br/>
<br/>
Square and chisel brush shape?
<br/>
<br/>
Also.. as social networking loser, I wonder if someone who knows what they're doing, would be interested in creating a Facebook app, that linked an author gallery to a slot on that persons Facebook profile.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Higher res canvas is probably impossible, but taking the idea that when you email the file it is re-rendered at 1024x768, would it be possible to edit in normal, but when the file is saved, have it re-render the drw to a 1024x768 png, or possibly an export function to export the smaller file to a larger one (possibly give options like 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1024, 1600x1200, etc, the ones I gave are just popular desktop background resolutions.  I think that would be more feasible than a large canvas, because if a drw is a point list, then colors is essentially a vector image tool that saves vector and bitmap output, so the drw I guess could be exported at higher quality.  Only question would be if converting to a large png on the DS would be possible (convert a portion of the image, save, blank RAM, convert another portion, save, blank RAM, repeat until image is totally exported, though I might be just throwing out impossible info).<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

:) But it is already possible thanks to <span style="font-weight: bold">Masscat's</span> genuine java applet.
<br/>
You can download it from gallery download section and run on your computer. It loads drw files and repaints them in higher resolution (though you set it up by entering multiplier - might be a little bit not friendly to those who dont like math). You can also export painting process to the avi file.
<br/>
<br/>
To be able to run it in higher resolution you need to give java more memory to work with:

I'm having the same problem on my SC Rumble Lite microSD. Says it's initializing but stays forever (20+ minutes, obviously not going to happen).

DLDI patched the same way I DLDI patch all of the other homebrew. 1.05 worked (just downgraded as a test, it's fine).

Is there a certain amount of free space that's needed? I have a 2gb microsd card but only about 25mb free, could that do it?

<br/>
I feel I often work landscape because that's the nature of the DS so the buttons will be at the common place.  The most advantage would be that there is also a bit of space left for my pinky to rest when drawing landscape. Portrait mode just maybe not that convenient for me being left-handed?
<br/>
If I'm alone with this idea, I should probably just get over it :)

It also freezes around 40% of the time for me, in Colors! 1.06g. I'll draw a picture or load one, then it'll usually freeze on centering o the playback button. I'm using a GBAMP CF, so there has to be someone else with this problem.<br/>_________________<br/>My favourite DS apps:

Well. I've found that leaving the DS closed for a while (over an hour), mid-painting, and then opening it up pretty much guarantees an app freeze in the latest version, and the one before it.

I've also noticed that in v1.06h, randomly coloured pixels appear in, well, random places from time to time. They look almost like "dead pixels" on a screen.

The funny thing about them though, is that they're not actually affecting whatever drawing is behind them, and they come up over the colour picker screen as well. And they disappear after a short while.

 my expectations have already been surpassed.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">that inchworm drawing software by sabiston is NOT pressure sensitive.  the variation in line width is time/speed based.  i played with it, around a year ago.  the pixel drawing feature is pretty neat, but the drawing line quality and lack of pressure control make it less useful than colors for traditional sketching/painting.  he also is trying to get it published, which means it will also not be free or community-driven like colors.

I am definitely with you on the idea of a bigger canvas, and with that comes the need to zoom out a bit as well, in case you have to make broad strokes across the whole thing.. as opposed to just working the tiny details nice and close up (:</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Bigger canvas would be much harder to implement for Jens, than unlimited drw lenght. With limitations of DS i think its as big as we can go.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

Anyway, to avoid a debate about using photos as reference I deleted some of my pix, but couldn't find the pantyhose pic which should also be deleted.

Mind you all, they weren't traced, unfortunately I don't have a cuffed  naked model, or any hot babe like shakira, around here, so I had to resort to the www :P

<br/>
On a technical note, I also occasionally got the crazy pixels, to let them disappear I flip to the pallete menu for a second.
<br/>
And the bigger canvas would literally be great, would love to hear Jesse expand on the possibilities ..

zooming out is another one I would find very useful, even on the current canvas size.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How about I will make you madwurmz.brombra.net subpage so you could post your colors pictures there? No censorship whatsoever (unless you push it to the point of breaking the law).

Also please check if pantyhose picture is still invisible? It should be visible.  I fixed the code (at least i think so).

i'm not against this pictures, just they can make people think twice about posting amongst them. It's all about what you want Colors! to be taken for. Perhaps a section like 'photo refs used' might do the trick. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I thought to myself, adding 'photo refs used' to it's description is cool enough, just to show I'm not trying to fool anyone. 
<br/>
Then I started thinking some more and some more, found a interview of a great artist somewhere saying "It is important to remember that photographs should not be copied, but rather used as a guideline. I do have a very large reference library for everything from costumes to animals. The internet has also become an invaluable resource for visual reference. " 
<br/>
Also read about "After all, the worlds greatest artists throughout time have learned by copying their predecessors' work."
<br/>
My ultimate happiness would be te be as great as, for example, pinup artist Gil Elvgren, but I don't want to copy him, I want to practice photorealism and there's my problem, the unfortunate situation that a beautiful model isn't within reach. 
<br/>
So ultimately I came with the solution to delete it all and have sort of a fresh start..

If you are adult and still do not like to get controversial pictures, uncheck "do you want to see all" option.

<br/>
There is also an option to check if you are uploading picture that might be adult only or otherwise controversial.

<br/>
Pictures that are marked as controversial should not appear for those who do not have the later option checked, unlogged people included.

If you find any errors do notify me. Please note that pictures need another rewiev - so they might not be marked as adult content yet.

I'm not saying they need to be. I kind of like the browsing in order of uploading (or ranking), and places like deviantART have perhaps gone a little overboard with all their categories.. and still don't quite get it right.

My reply to recapsure wasn't correct,  because I didn't have the freezing problem within short period, only whenever I close the DS for a longer period. Today I did 10 minutes of painting to an already big file, and didn't save, closed it and opened it 15 minutes later, bam, frozen..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've been trying to work out what the trigger is, but I'm not sure.
<br/>
So far about the only thing I do regularly before closing it, is save my work.
<br/>
But having tried a few times just scribbling, no save, and closing.. it can still happen. Not every time, but more often than not on my DS/card.
<br/>

Provided I remember to save, it's a manageable issue :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I Just want to say that this app is fantastic and thank you for all of your hard work! 
<br/>
<br/>
-With the most recent version of Colors 1.06h i am getting 2 problems though.  
<br/>
1.  First, the line jumping is much more frequent that prior versions. 
<br/>
2.  For some reason I cannot see any pictures that I created with prior versions of Colors like version 1.06g and before.  The old *.png, *.drw and thumb nail files are all in the Root/COLORS directory but in the Load screen they don't show up.  I can create a new drawing and save and then can see that one but no others.  So i reverted back to 1.06g and I see the same thing as with 1.06h (no old files only ones created in 1.06h).  Weird?  
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that all made sense and by the way i am using an R4DS as my flash cart.

Lets get it straight. There is no stylus jumping caused by software now.
<br/>
<br/>
All the stylus jumping that occurs past 1.06, especially 1.06h is caused by the user.
<br/>
In some models if you hold firm the DS you can cause a streess that acts like pressing the screen at the very edge, release stylus then - and you have your "jumping". Stop squeezing your console and the jumping is gone. You can also unintentionaly press keys during drawing that can also mess with your drawing. I saw some people touch screen with their hand while painting too. (i dont do it coz my hand is too big) :)
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I guess there is possibility that stylus will be jumping if you did not calibrate pressure correctly. 
<br/>
<br/>
I did not encountered stylus jumping in the last month. We tested it on more than 10 different machines, from at least 7 different production runs, mostly on lite but also on 2 phat DSes.  
<br/>
<br/>
The fact is stylus jumping is GONE.

Where do you have your colors "installed" on your card? Now it looks for files relatively to the colors executable. So if you had your drawings in ROOT/COLORS and your colors in the same place, it looks for pictures in ROOT/COLORS/COLORS now.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

My bad, I'm using 1.06g. I'll upgrade to h and see if I still get the problems.
<br/>
<br/>
jetboy - in regards to line jumps being caused by the user due to a method of holding the DS, I'm not sure that's entirely accurate. I hold the DS the exact same way, and when I was doodling the other night the amount of line jumping pretty much destroyed my picture. Also, I noticed every now and then during replays that there's some line jumping that didn't occur during the actual drawing process - each time it's happened to me, another replay has fixed it, just thought I'd mention it though.
<br/>
<br/>
Jesse - is there any chance we can go back to seeing the fully zoomed out picture up in the top screen when we are zoomed in? Or was that removed due to hardware constraints?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, when zoomed in, the little icon in the lower left corner disappears when you start drawing. I'm sure that this is intentional, though when you're applying a whole lot of smaller strokes it becomes rather distracting (it essentially 'flashes' a whole lot), is there any chance it could be moved to the top screen or something? Then there would be no reason to make it disappear.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have always had Colors.nds in the Root of my card with a folder in the root called COLORS.

I really appreciate all the hard work you have put into this, from the simplicity and functionality to the troubleshooting you've done.

Oops! I'll chalk that up to my own stupidity, thanks for the tip!
<br/>
<br/>
I upgraded to 1.06h and did some drawing last night, I noticed the same increased jumping trend that I had with previous increments of 1.06. It couldn't have been due to holding the DS too tight, because it was just resting on my chest (I was lying down), and in regards to painting under heavy light; all the lights were off.
<br/>
<br/>
Last night I also experienced for the first time the 'stuck pixel' problem that someone discussed earlier. It would generally happen when I zoomed in or out. I could paint over the 'stuck' pixels fine, though panning around the picture or changing the zoom level would generally recreate the stuck ones. If you need further clarity on what exactly the problem is, I'll try taking a couple of photos of it if I can recreate it.
<br/>
<br/>
If it makes a difference, I'm using an M3 Lite SD, patched Colors! with the M3 SD DLDI in Chism's page. If you need any more info to try and find the cause just let me know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's weird.
<br/>
I had a couple line jumps a version or two ago, but really not many. I don't think I've had any at all since the new version went up for download. Is it maybe something to do with people's different cards? Or even pushing too hard with the stylus? Hmm..!
<br/>
<br/>
Also, what with people clamouring for an undo button.. and I know Jesse never wanted one. Kind of against the philosophy of the thing.
<br/>
(but maybe a one-step undo..?)
<br/>
<br/>
Or.. on a semi-related note what about adding the ability to hold two colours at once, and switch between them with a button press. Kind of like the photoshop two-colour swatch.
<br/>
That way, you effectively have an eraser, if you're working in basic colours, or you can have a light/dark colour if you're doing shading on something, without constantly colour picking..?

Well, some people are having jumps with R4, i and a friend of mine both have R4 and no jumping at all (i even spent 20 minutes a day or two ago to get the jumping on purpose - not a chance). AFAIK Jesse use M3 and AFAIK there is no jumping for him too. We have like 10 persons with DS and SC DSOne/SC Lite in the office and there is no jumping for them neither.
<br/>
<br/>
I would rather think that certain machines have tendency for jumping than blame it to the cart.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

If you do that, please dont upload them to the gallery. Hopefully it wont allow it anyhow, but you could get funny results when trying to paint it with java applet (or maybe not).

Maybe concider bringing it back to two columns? The title bar isn't matching it's width anymore and the columns are so full of different images it's distracting and top ranks are losing their power.. ?

I'm going away this weekend, so I'll be sure to put v1.05 on my card before I do and put a bit of time into both versions. If I remember I'll try to note down jump frequency. Before I upgraded to any version of 1.06, I'd used 1.05 earlier that day and had no problems (just the occasional jump), and instantly noticed a heap more jumping.

This is just a humble contribution via a suggestion that if implemented would make me and some pros, happy happy happy :)

i had this idea, put it on paper so i wouldnt forget, just scanned and upped.

the amount of work and technical hurdles are beyond my knowledge but i want this :D

in future, navigation between tiled drawings would be nice also (jump (loading) from 4 to 5 to 6 to 1 to 5 etc)

Hey. That's a cute idea. But, whoa. If the DS isn't capable of a much bigger canvas (or a biggger one at all) then this could be a bit much too..
<br/>
<br/>
Plus, because if you were ever going to line up your images properly into one, you'd have to be able to paint across two canvas's at once.
<br/>
So the DS would have to be able to load a portion of each canvas as you scrolled scross from one to the other..? Or is that what you're saying..?
<br/>
<br/>
Still. Neat idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So, let's see if I got this right. You start off by making a normal painting, but you save in some special way so that the painting is divided into different tiles. Each tile can then be loaded as so you can work on in more detail, perhaps with the top-screen still keeping the "big picture".
<br/>
<br/>
If that is what you meant, then that's a pretty neat idea and would be very possible to implement. I'm not sure it's good enough to warrant the time it would take to implement it and the increased complexity of the program, but it's still a good idea. :)
<br/>
<br/>
But even better. I think it would be technically possible to stream the canvas to the flashcard. That means that you could have much bigger canvas with the only drawback that it would take some extra time when panning around. It would of course be a much simpler experience for the user but so much harder to implement than what you are suggesting. Still, that would probably be the way I would like to implement bigger canvases, but I wouldn't expect it until version 1.20 or something. :)<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That could work, but would be a pain, both to upload and download the thing.

Since yesterday evening I'm unable to use the colors wifi. Co-incidentally two days ago I've tried some homebrew which also uses wifi, is it possible it interfered with the Colors settings?
<br/>
<br/>
Brings to mind another question, how can I blow up and export images with the ColorsDraw_1_0.jar? I've tried changing 'size scaling: 1.0'  but without effect..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
It does not update automaticaly. Change scaling 1.0 to whatever you desire and press enter. After a couple of seconds, depending on your system, try to rescale window, or move the slider, etc. It should be looking right now.
<br/>
<br/>
Quick image size chart:
<br/>
1.0 = 512x384
<br/>
2.0 = 1024x768
<br/>
3.0 = 1536x1152
<br/>
4.0 = 2048x1536
<br/>
<br/>
I dont know if it can go higher than 4.0. Well it surely could, but you would have to up java memory pool even more.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

<br/>
<br/>
yes you got it right.
<br/>
my idea was to avoid streaming (ideal solution prolly), since my idea is simpler structurewise since it would be an agregation of separate drawings which happen to belong to a series generated by a master drawing.
<br/>
i think its a cool idea, but im biased.
<br/>
drawing history could be retained per pic part. streaming solution would kill this...unless...
<br/>
if i was the coder i would do it :D

Also... what with the hinge-close-crash issue, how possible is it to have an option (that could be ticked on or off) to load whatever file you last saved, when Colors! starts up...?

The purposal was to automatically load the last used painting, and I personally prefer to start with a clean canvas. I prefer the clean canvas from starting in the load screen as well.

<br/>
I've a couple of suggestions, I don't know if they are really desirable or feasible :
<br/>
<br/>
1) the sensitivity pressure option is use to control size or  transparency, it could be interesting to add an option to use it for controlling   the intensity (by example  from a pale blue to a dark blue)
<br/>
<br/>
2) is it possible to have a reverse reading of the drw (for the undo feature) ?
<br/>
<br/>
3) I do not know how to make nice drawing, an interesting option for people like me will be to be able to display a .drw (downloaded on the color gallery by example) on the top screen to use it as a model (I suppose it is infeasible).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Pixels drawn with the tools cover up the pixels that you're drawing over. As I understand it, a .drw can't be played in reverse because it doesn't know the value of the pixels that you have just covered up.

<br/>
What you can do is clear and save, then use a program other than Colors! (such as Finder or Windows Explorer) to replace the PNG, and then start Colors! and load. You might want to change the replaced PNG's colors so that you can distinguish which pixels are yours and which are from the original image.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

With the latest M3Simply firmware the patching goes automatically on first run of Colors..  So are you using v1.07 of M3?

    <h4>#145336 - takieda - Wed Nov 14, 2007 6:22 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've FINALLY tracked down the the problematic file that kept killing my ability to play Colors on my M3 SD... other people seemed to have no problem, so I updated my M3 and tried again, still no luck.. kept trying different dldi patches, using powerloader.bin, etc... and nothing seemed to work. In a matter of desperation I tried it on a completely blank SD card and voila, the program started fine. I copied everything over to my SD with everything on it and everything worked. So now I have a working Colors 1.06h on my DS... BUT -
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a terribly curious fellow. I decided there HAD to be something weird on my card that was causing the problem. After cleaning the attributes to ALL my files (I had a lot of them set to hidden, some as read only, and some as system), and still failing, I started getting rid of individual files, then replacing them when the program kept failing. Doing this rather tedious task has led me to the culprit file that seems to totally loathe Colors 1.06: Geowars.nds
<br/>
<br/>
Apparently there's something about this homebrew that will not allow Colors to continue. Every single time I tried to start up Colors (when it would do it's initialization) it would come up with the EFSlib error. When I got rid of that ONE file, and ran Colors from a clean install (no Colors directory, clean Colors.nds file, etc.) Colors booted and initialized cleanly. I've since copied Geowars.nds back onto it and even played the game, and Colors works flawlessly.
<br/>
<br/>
Colors cannot initialize with Geowars on the same SD card. Now to figure out WHY... not like it's a major deal. deleting it, running Colors, then copying it back over works flawlessly (even leaving the Geowars.sav file on the SD allows Colors to work fine).
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">On a side note</span> Colors seems to crash when attempting to upload pictures when you don't have a wifi access point close enough for it to connect. There should be a cancel button because if you haven't saved, then you're out of luck when this happens.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

My guess would be its the library that checks form which place colors was run. Or maybe it was just usual filesystem fuckup which happens sometime with homebrews.

On the other hand i have Geowars on my ds, and colors works fine. But i have geowars in TEST folder while Colors is in COLORS folder.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

Sure friend! Just copy Colors.nds to _DS_MSHL.nds located in root directory.

You need home enabled slot-1 cartridge to put colors on. There are many brands of those cartridges. Most popular are R4, M3, Super Card DS ONE, Cyclo DS. You also need micro SD card to put into cartridge. After you buy them, you isntall your card software to the micro sd, and put colors on it. If you have any nore questions - ask here.

Did you calibrated pressure in Colors? If no that can be the cause.
<br/>
Also - there are those little checkboxes under size and opacity sliders. They need to be pressed for pressure to work for respectively size and opacity. But i guess you got this part right. Also remeber that when pressure is used, the slider sets up max value that can be reached with pressing hard.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

DaveB, making the image temporary grayscale is something I need to think about. Perhaps that can be worked into the levels-tool screen I?m hoping to implement.

Square brush is perfect for... making squares. I too think that square tool is not that necessary. Easy to implement, yes, but really needed? I don't think so.
<br/>
<br/>
However I see lots of applications of custom brushes, painting foliage, adding details to surface... On the other hand, custom brushes would require drastic changes in drw format. You would have to store custom brush with your drawing, plus there are possible efficiency problems. You wouldn't want to loose responsiveness i guess.
<br/>
<br/>
And adding brush editor to colors would require some extra work, but what's more important it would take away a lot of simplicity from colors.
<br/>
<br/>
I would fancy custom brushes. But i'm not even artist myself. I hope Jens will make right choice, seems he was choosing right up to now, i believe that trend will continue :)<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

The size-scaling used isn't really perfect and could be improved. It is possible that when that bug is fixed, the problem would disappear for this painting (and others). Still, there is always a possibility that this stuff will appear even if the scaling was perfect since you can only see the edges in the resolution you paint in and the anti-alias can never be as precise as higher resolution.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Jesse on Tue Nov 20, 2007 9:57 am; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

Possibly. Still, I've heard this request from a number of good artists, so there must be something to it.

Well, new brush shape - new possibility for me to experiment in the series of Cloud Experiment :) Square clouds - could be interesting :) Not to mention new serie will be born - Square ZOO :)

Will it be just square, or square and square with fading edges?

<br/>
There are some gaps even when rendered at normal size.
<br/>
Therefore, the Java app is rendering the brush slightly differently (from the DS) which seems to be causing the edge of the brush not to be rendered, leading to the gap.
<br/>
<br/>
I will have a look at it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They also show unintentional gaps on playback within Colors itself.. It's sort of the same problem with soft-brush strokes on half opacity, don't show well on java app, don't show well on playback within Colors</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks! I'm pretty satisfied with that one myself, although I'd like to do that without photo-ref, so nowadays I'm studying anatomy like mad...

No use of dynamic brush width, except for the hair. No use of soft brush either, except light on ear-ring.

You say 'wimpy little ds' but I heard that Nintendo is building a new DS with a bit bigger screensize, makes me excited!

is it possible to add the possibility to move directly the cursor from the progress bar? this could facilitate the back to a precedent frame with the pencil. with this method we could control entirely the speed and the "direction" (back or forward) of the draw progression.

Poeple work with the zoom function. You see, ds screen has limited precision. With 2x zoom you get 2x precission, with 4x zoom you get 4x precission.
<br/>
<br/>
So i guess usualy people paint rough sketch zoomed out, then add detail in zoom mode,
<br/>
<br/>
But you can do wahtewer suits you best.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">How Ben's applet can repaint pictures in higher resolution?</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Colors is crossover of vector and bitmap application. It stores all the strokes you used to paint in a "vector" form in drw file.
<br/>
Those strokes are rendered to bitmap as you paint. Having all that 
<br/>
information you can rerender picture in a higher resolution. What the 
<br/>
applet does it uses all the same strokes just on a bigger canvas and 
<br/>
with bigger brushes.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing worth note is that if you paint in zoom mode you get more 
<br/>
precision. This is not technically exact but its only to demonstrate 
<br/>
the idea in hopefully clear manner:
<br/>
<br/>
DS screen has 256x192 resolution. If you paint on it in normal mode 
<br/>
you get 256 unique values. Every value represents 1 pixel. Now, when 
<br/>
you render it at 1024 resolution you still get 256 unique values, 
<br/>
that means you can address every 4th pixel, that's every 8th in 2048.
<br/>
<br/>
When you paint in 2x zoom mode - you see only 1/2 of the image - so 
<br/>
full image is 2 screens wide, hence you get 512 different values - 
<br/>
that means you can address every 2nd pixel in 1024 resolution, or 
<br/>
every 4th in 2048.
<br/>
<br/>
When you paint in 4x zoom mode - you see only 1/4 of the image - so 
<br/>
full image is 4 screens wide, hence you get 1024 different values - 
<br/>
that means you can address every  pixel in 1024 resolution, or every 
<br/>
2nd in 2048.
<br/>
<br/>
edit: That brings a question - can we get 8x zoom mode in next version?<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

I believe those higher percision values are used. I just used 256x192 for the sake of explaining the idea. Its easier to imagine for people, especialy digital artists, when they think in pixels.

Leaving it as is seems for me as bad as limiting users to posting only x pictures per day.

What comes to my mind is limiting people to only put 1 pictures per day, but upping that limit besed on the average number of stars...

Nah. Pople do not have time to visit gallery each day, so they visit once per week, or even less frequent and they dump all pictures they painted on the way. Forcing them to visit gallery every day wouldnt be nice.

Yes.

<br/>
Pictures can be also flagged as inappropriate (not the best word i guess) by admins. In case admins are not available (i guess we visit more often than enough) all freshly uploaded pictures may be flagged by users if enough of them "report" picture. If picture was reported "for fun", admins still can change it's status.
<br/>
<br/>
All pictures flagged as inapropriate will not be shown if you are not logged and dont have "Check this to see paintings flagged as inappropriate. "
<br/>
So guests and people visiting for the first time wont see Madwurmz' wild fantasies :(
<br/>
<br/>
In your panel (Me) you have an option "Check this to see paintings flagged as inappropriate. " so you can turn visibility of controversial content on and off. You need to be adult to be able to turn it on.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe word controversial would be better than inappropriate.
<br/>

Some kind of search would be cool too, as we have over 1500 pictures now.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I slept with the problem and have some more thoughts about it.
<br/>
I would like to know Jens' point of view, before i decide anything.
<br/>
<br/>
With so many artist contributing recently the idea with limiting to 1 picture per day wouldn't help much, there are still more pictures posted per day than is displayed on the first page, even as i changed number of them from 10 to 15.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course the limit would help the case, but on the other hand it would be confusing for users, and it would take away form the simplistic feel of the gallery, and i can imagine all those emails - "hey i posted 2 images and so one of them didn't show up! So i posted it again 5 times, and it still didn't show up!".  Can you imagine the mess it would cause if admins were offline for a week? 
<br/>
<br/>
For the whole idea to work i would have to add queue editor in users profile, so they could manage pictures awaiting release - again taking away simplicity :)
<br/>
<br/>
So for now i upped limit of pictures on fist page from 10 to 15. It does not solve the problem at all, but it makes it a little less annoying, but only a little.
<br/>
<br/>
I also added possibility to decide not to display your picture in the middle column of front page. (i doubt if anyone will use it)<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

Its a test of new script for first page. All the difference is that it takes number of stars when displaying middle column, so pictures people voted on get some boost, and stay longer on the first page.
<br/>
<br/>
edit: And another version - much better in my opinion.

Actually alt text should not be displayed when you hover mouse over the image, and it is misinterpretation of HTML by IE. Text that displays when you hover over image is defined in image'  title.

Removed that, as in effect this does not prevent people from posting 5 crap pictures in a row and spamming the frontpage. What's worse people missread it and worthy pictures do not appear on the front page. Instead i will block pictures without drw from showing there.

<br/>
Yes :) Gallery is evolving all the time, and with Jens still on his trip there is nobody to slap my hands when i mess up with the code :) Hopefully he will be back soon.
<br/>
<br/>
What's interesting - i was thinking about making decent function to add bonus for starts, in a way that pictures with stars be promoted but pictures that are really new wouldnt be moved down too quickly.
<br/>
<br/>
I come up with idea i will make another column in the query to sort it with.
<br/>
I tried formula:
<br/>
<br/>
picture_id*picture_id+number_of_stars*picture_id
<br/>
or 
<br/>
picture_id*(picture_id+number_of_stars)
<br/>
<br/>
At first it seemed very clever, but in the end it gives the same results (the same sorting) as:
<br/>
<br/>
picture_id+number_of_stars*0.5
<br/>
<br/>
That is true for id's greater than lets say 100, and number of stars &lt;30 (i didn't tried calculating it further). It seems much simpler for the human mind, but its exactly the same for computer  (1 addition and 1 multiplication)
<br/>
<br/>
ps. i'm using 0.6 as multiplicator in the real script.

Unless we will earn millions - then we will split the cash among people that worked on gallery and colors and run away to mexico (or any other cool place :)

<br/>
In case those adds will not give a chance to pay for the server, i ll remove them so they wont disturb our users if they are useless.

Colors! development has been idle for a while, but now I hope to kick-start it again. I'm still figuring out what's going to be in there for the next version. I have a road-plan going all the way to v1.1 but I think there will be a version inbetween. The only features that I'm more or less decided on for v1.07 are .drw memory-card streaming which will give unlimited .drw size and a one-step undo (!). I also want to have the two known major bugs in there fixed: The closing-the-lid lockup and the pixel-trash being left by the cursor. My plan is to have a new version out before the end of the year. I'll post more information as soon as I have it.

Try upgrading your card firmware if there is such possibility. 
<br/>
<br/>
If that wont work I would suggest getting one of the decent cards that make no problems. R4, M3, Super Card DS ONE, Cyclo Evolution are working just fine.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

Here's how to chkdsk in Windows 5.x (2000 Pro, XP Home, XP Pro):
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>Open "My Computer". (Depending on the version of Windows that you use, this may be on your desktop, or it may be in the Start Menu.) </li><li>Find the removable disk drive with your microSD card in it, open the drive's context menu (right-click), and choose Properties. </li><li>In the Tools pane, click Check Now. </li><li>Make sure Automatically fix file system errors is checked, and click OK. </li></ol>
<br/>
Here's how to defrag:
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>Start &gt; (All) Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Disk Defragmenter </li><li>Select the removable disk drive with your microSD card in it. </li><li>Click Defragment, and follow the prompts. </li></ol>
<br/>
If you have Windows 4.x (95, 98, ME) or Windows 6.x (Vista), some of these steps will be different. For one thing, if I remember correctly, Windows 4 calls chkdsk "ScanDisk", and it's stashed next to Defrag.

Unlike the R4, which loads most of its firmware from a file on the card, the GnM will run a homebrew program even if it is the only file on the card. I haven't tried it with Colors though.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I hope a future version will finally kill those jumping or darting lines. This is my biggest obstacle to fully enjoying the program. In order to avoid them, I have to bear down and give a fair amount of pressure when I'm drawing, and if I let down my guard for a moment at the beginning or end of a stroke, the line darts out again. I encounter the phenomenon with every homebrew application that involves drawing or handwriting, BUT IT DOES NOT EXIST IN NINTENDO'S OWN PICTOCHAT, so I have to believe there is a secret key out there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Mine are about the same as madwurmz.com, usually short, but some can go about a quarter of a page long. They always head towards the lower left corner. I'm shocked to hear that madwurmz.com has the same problem after seeing the amazing art he is able to accomplish in the gallery (with no evidence of the darting lines).
<br/>
<br/>
My DS Lite is not so sensitive in the center now after a year's worth of abuse so I have to turn off the pressure sensitive option or else the lines go thin and transparent when I cross the middle territory. I can live without the pressure sensitive option. I wonder however if that lost sensitivity may contribute to the errant lines. 
<br/>
<br/>
I still suspect Nintendo has found an answer to stopping the darting lines completely, and it's a secret that might be within reach of the Homebrew developers if they can discover it.
<br/>
<br/>
On a different note, last night I was playing around with my DS and discovered I can connect to the internet via my wife's wireless hub. I had no idea! I actually e-mailed a drawing to myself. That's so cool!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And let me guess - you hold your DS with your left hand. Those strokes are what you cause. You trigger it by pressing unintentionally on the different part of the screen, or squeezing the shell too hard. 
<br/>
<br/>
And that's not true that its non existant in official titles. Just in most cases games don't need such precission, and that's why you don't notice it.

<br/>
Those strokes are user generated. All Jens could do about it, was already done.

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">TIP:</span> If you have tablet for your computer, try painting with tablet's stylus. You will get more control over pressure thanks to the soft tip, and stylus is thicker so it holds beter. You will probably also hold it higher in a way that causes less unintentional touches.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

@Jens: I have idea. It could be that reading pressure might be unreliable if there are some types of DMA transfers going, some interupts trigger, or you read it in the wrong moment of VBlank.

It looks exactly like bad calibration. You can get similar effect. Go to your setting and when calibrating press right dots in proper place and left dots to the right.

for starting Colors!-users is good to be aware of the jumping lines occurring when touching two points at the same time, but I'm a frequent user, and I understand the talks is more about those lines that occur when pressing very lightly.
<br/>
But really, my jumping lines aren't frequent, they seem to appear only ones every ten hours of Coloring  ..really, my eraser on paper is making more unwanted artifacts than those jumping lines.
<br/>
It's like Bob Ross said, when painting we want little accidents to happen...

Just for comfort I've used the wacom pen and also the retractable ds stylus for a while, but at some point this gave deep scratches in the protector screen, probably thanks to the brick-dust in my apartment. Luckily these screens are easy replaced and cheap.

You want a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.robotstxt.org/" target="_blank">robots.txt</a> file. You can use this to direct well behavioured web bots (of which googlebot is one) what to and what not to index.
<br/>
<br/>
For example if all the .drw files are in the directory /drw_files you could have a robots.txt file as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">User-agent: *

<br/>
Unfortunately, I do not believe that wildcards are supported in the Disallow statement so:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">Disallow: *.drw</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

On the subject of lefties:

Colors could be used to test the hypothesis that left handers are generally more creative than right handers. If this is the case then the ratio of left handers to right handers submitting work to the gallery should be higher than the ratio of the general population.

The pressure-controls-opacity probably hides a lot of the stylus jumping on bad DS'es since stylus jumping seem to appear mostly during low pressure (and even more so for you). With pressure-controls-opacity turned on they will mostly generate transparent strokes. Thanks for the detailed information; it gave me an idea of introducing a cutoff-value where any input below a certain pressure is completely ignored.

Not a bad idea, but I would have to save unfiltered input for it to be very useful. Still, that's something I was planning to do for the improved calibration feature anyway. Thanks for the input!

Unfortunately every DS production run has different color profile. It can differ slightly in one production run even. As far as i know, Colors! dont take this into consideration. One thing to do to correct that is to paint with screen set to lower brightness. Well - outdoors at day - use highest brightness, indoors, and in the evening/night use low brightness. (that does not solve the problem  - but its a trick that can help a bit)

If I understand what you said correctly, your painting suffered much more than other paintings. Is that correct? I not sure I can understand how light-blue could come out 0,0,255 in the .png if your screen is remotely sane. Have you compared your DS against another one?
<br/>
<br/>
As always, screens of different kinds vary greatly (and not only talking about DS screens, computer monitors and flat-screen TVs can really suck as well). I guess it would be possible to create some sort of screen-calibration tool for Colors!, but I'm not exactly sure how. Also, it would have some impact on the performance as well as lose color precision.
<br/>
<br/>
Implementing support for changing the contrast sounds like a good idea. I?ll check if that?s an easy thing to do.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">just curious, how is the new pressure sensitivity setting going to be implemented? i have read the pressure on the ds is based on the number of pixels being detected on the touch screen, hence a harder stroke will lead to more area of screen being pressed down then light, like a simulated pressure.
<br/>
<br/>
when im trying to find a precise pressure to paint on, it is not easy to get a consistant reading from the calibration tool, i was thinking maybe a slider or something that adds precision to the pressure tool would be great</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Its unfair to other artists if their pictures get bumped off so quickly by some 2 minutes blurry spots, before those pictures even have a chance to get voted for.  Usually galleries are not ment to be showing all art by some author, just the best of his works. Yes, if someone is as good as Ernst, i don't mind if he posts everything he paints, especially if he puts so much effort into his works as he does, but i don't fancy spamming with 2 minutes scribbles. Nevertheless, to make this equal for everybody the rule of 2 pictures per author on the first page apply to all.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

Layers won't happen, it has been discussed and it's too complicated for the software and/or hardware.
<br/>
Still, theoretically, I wish for the same. Maybe, thinking out loud, a (blue) sketch brush could be introduced, with an option to have it invisible. When visible it should be on top of everything. ...Whining, I know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There are three issues here: <ol type="a"><li>Layers would use more RAM for each layer's red, green, blue, and alpha channels.

<br/>
Download the Java ColorsDraw_0_1.jar application from the <a class="postlink" href="http://colors.brombra.net/downloads.php" target="_blank">Colors Gallery download page</a>. You should then be able to run it by double clicking or right clicking on the .jar file.
<br/>
<br/>
Select the menu "File-&gt;Load .drw file" to load your .drw file.
<br/>
<br/>
The application will whir for a bit and then you should see your picture.
<br/>
<br/>
You can then create an avi from the menu "Export-&gt;Save AVI".
<br/>
You will be able to select the output file and set the frames per second and strokes per frame of the result avi file.
<br/>
There is currently a limit on the size of the avi file the application can make. The application stops you from generating an avi file it cannot handle by setting the minimum strokes per frame value.
<br/>
<br/>
For all the above to work you must have Java installed on your PC. Get it from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.java.com/" target="_blank">http://www.java.com/</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">NOTE:</span> the resulting avi file is uncompressed, meaning that it is rather large. Depending on what you want to do with it I would suggest transcoding it to some other format.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try grounding you down before painting. You can do it by touching the heat radiator.

<br/>
Those rogue lines are something that happens for people with different quantity. For example I and Jens are no longer able to reproduce them at all, while i see them on some pictures in gallery that pop up quite often.

Also make sure you are using latest version of colors (1.06h). Unfortunately there is nothing more we can do about it.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

That is not possible. DRW stores the strokes, so the program knows what strokes to make one after another, but it doesn't know what was under previous stroke, so it cannot remove it.
<br/>
<br/>
AFAIK Jens is working on some undo solution, but its extremly difficult on th DS with limited memory and processing power. Could be done for a price of responsivness but that's not an option.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

Can backtracking be limited to those users who have SLOT-2 RAM cards? As far as I can tell, 512x384 pixels in 16-bit color take up 384 KiB, and 21 undo steps will fit on the 8 MiB card included with Nintendo DS Browser. The steps can be made even smaller if only those pixels that differ from step to step are stored, with the rest being run-length encoded out.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Memory is not the only limit. You need to analyze image over each stroke and do actual copying which takes some power too, much less than streaming to the SD but still considerable time. Plus Jens would have to code that,  and i think its not worth it for the quite small group of people who have slot-2 cards. It would be more beneficial for everybody if Jens could use his time for other solution that would serve everybody.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know which approach is being worked on but i once suggested other solution that could be used once streaming drw to the card would be implemented. 
<br/>
<br/>
With streaming drw it would be some more free memory that could be used for buffers. So there could be 2 processes running one is being done all the drawing and stuff as it is now, second one waiting for process 1 to be idle. If it detects that it flags buffer1 as invalid and starts copying current image to the undo buffer and stores which stroke are we at. 
<br/>
If process 1 is still idle it can finish copy process and flag this buffer as valid.
<br/>
If it is not finished before process 1 is active again then nothing happens.
<br/>
<br/>
Lets assume the copying worked.
<br/>
So now you drew 20 storkes and made mistake, and want to undo.
<br/>
So what would colors do? It "loads" buffer and redraws 19 strokes from the remembered stroke number. 
<br/>
Want to undo one more step?
<br/>
Do the same just redraw 18 strokes.
<br/>
That is not instant, but the time to draw last couple of strokes is nothing compared to time to redraw the picture from scratch.
<br/>
Yes, that relies on the user making pauses, but observing people drawing - they tend to do that a lot. Even 2-3 frames break is more than enough to copy the buffer, and it wont hurt responsiveness.
<br/>
Of course we would need 2 undo buffers for that to work, but with no need for keeping drw in the memory that would be doable.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope i didnt messed up my explanations too much, but i do believe i explained it to Jens in more clear way once :)
<br/>

yoolda thinks it would be good if various people made followups to his picture to further the story behind it, which is the rabbit saving everyone. Then, with all the pictures together and if it's OK with the creators of Colors!, get them published in some magazines to do with art, multimedia or the DS.

Well, creators of colors don't have anything to say in that matter. Colors is just a tool, and every art made with Colors is only property of the author. So Colors! creators cannot allow nor deny any publication. Its up to the people taking part in the play.

The story is pretty simple, the first picture that i draw represent "the" magic rabbit and 5 persons praying for some help. 
<br/>
You just have to draw what's going to follow.... 
<br/>
If everyone does one picture that's follow the one before, it could be cool to see how the story will end up!!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is not perfect and needs a lot of tweaking, but i bet you can make good use out of it.
<br/>
<br/>
I tagged 2 first pages of pictures from the rankings, plus some more. I hope you will do the rest :) 
<br/>
<br/>
Please use only 1 word tags, english only. If you need words like still-life use - instead of spaces. 
<br/>
<br/>
You need to be logged in to be able to tag. Well try not to mess up, and we will slowly tag all the database. 
<br/>
<br/>
I hope it will be fun for everybody.
<br/>
<br/>
I ll be making adjustments and changes as I see fit. All comments are welcomed.
<br/>
<br/>
I ll add tag sugestions when we get some more data. (there will be most used tags recomended)<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

<br/>
Yes, you can load an image in Colors! after in has been modified (for example with photoshop). 
<br/>
First, to have the playback to work with the new image you should start a new, totally empty painting and save this as colors_slot1.
<br/>
Then download the empty colors_slot1.png from your card and open it in photoshop and when modified save back as colors_slot1.png.
<br/>
Put the image back on your card. Now open the image in Colors! again and it should have the new image.
<br/>
The empty playback makes sure it will only capture the new strokes.
<br/>
You can start with the playback so the new image will appear on the final result or you can start painting and without playback save it and the background image will then be gone..
<br/>
<br/>
Yes it's a long and a bit confusing instruction, but i guess that's the way it is..

I would modify the headline of this article, as it's inaccurate. There is no pressure sensitivity on the DS. They merely simulate it with airbrush effects and transparency, the same way Photoshop works.
<br/>
<br/>
The effect of course is similar to pressure sensitivity but I assure you it's based on position and duration of a stroke, not pressure. I've been using Colors! for months and it's an awesome little program.

He paints quite good, and he uses colors for months and didn't realized there IS pressure sensitivity. What a looser. One of those persons that if he was took to the orbit and see for himself that the earth is round he would still claim that its flat.
<br/>
<br/>
Too bad Jens is adding to the confusion claiming in his mail that there is no real pressure sensitivity. That is real pressure sensitivity.

<br/>
Well. Since they were mostly arguing semantics I saw no reason trying to simplify things and just gave my point of view. You could call it pressure, but since the hardware is not actually reporting actual pressure (I mean like in Newton or something), it's not completely true. With the assumption that the area you use to touch the screen is constant (as it mostly is with a stylus), then it's probably correct to call it pressure (as I do in the Colors! feature specs) but it's still different than for example a Wacom pen that I think actually measures pressure. I guess we should put that question into the FAQ. :)
<br/>
<br/>
But anyway. It generated about 10 times more hits on the Colors! homepage, which makes me happy. Also, I'm happy to report that we recently passed the 50000 downloads of the latest version, which is in my opinion a huge number (and I'm not the only one hosting it). 
<br/>
<br/>
As for the new version, I'm a bit reluctant to say that I haven't made much progress yet and I completely missed my target of getting a new version out before the end of the year. But don't give up on me; I hope that will change soon.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, i guess we are all here mature enough to realize that you rarely measure the actual value we say we are measuring.
<br/>
<br/>
Clock does not really measure time just counts ticks, be it mechanical or quartz.
<br/>
Wacom pen does not really measure pressure just the (missing english words) change in resistance of electricity.
<br/>
Thermometer does not really measure temperature just the volume of the quicksilver.
<br/>
No touchscreen really measures pressure... 
<br/>
We can go like that forever!
<br/>
<br/>
Still we say that Clock do measure time, etc. etc. Because in a way its true. Those tools measure mentioned values but they do it indirect.  Texas Instrument touchscreen measures pressure in indirect way too. There is specification of that in the part description - the link to it is posted several time on those forums if you are really interested look for it yourself i have read it many times.
<br/>
<br/>
We have full right to say it with clean conscious that Colors! do measures pressure.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

AFAIK Colors! is developed on M3. Yes it does work on all major slot-1 cards. Make sure you have the latest firmware for the card installed (that is simple you just need to download zip file from manufacturers site and copy content of proper folder from the package to your microSD).<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

Yes, because M3Real ships with an old firmware, they already upgraded twice,  so just be sure to follow jetboys advice..

Congratulations!
<br/>
<br/>
Recent links also gave more visitors to the gallery. Too bad it happened in the same moment i implemented tagging system so i don't know what had bigger influence, but one is nice - we got 6x increase in the traffic in the last days.
<br/>
<br/>
The experiment with installing Google adds seems to be promising too. There are big chances that I will be able to pay for the server for another year, and there will be something extra for some contests prizes. But that must wait until i actually get some payments from Google.
<br/>
<br/>
I also got promotional offer for AdWords so I can start advertising gallery.  That can get us about 5 more visitors per day for 100 days.
<br/>
<br/>
For that to work best we would need a subpage describing what colors is and how to "get portable digital sketchbook cheap". With photos, screen shots examples and some propper English explanations - something  like the guys at concept art did. I could use some help on this so if you have some spare time and feel that you could contribute - please send me private msg.

  I just posted a black-and-white lineart piece to the gallery, and it gave me a great idea for a Colors Gallery contest (a 2 part contest in fact).
<br/>
<br/>
  I think we should do a contest where users submit "Coloring Book" style line-art pieces.  Then, once a winner is picked, a second contest could be held where other users download the winning entry, color it themselves, and then submit it!
<br/>
<br/>
   This could be a cool opportunity to see some great collaborative work amongst Colors users.  And as a bonus, it would create many "coloring book" pieces to have as a resource for other users to color with (or let their kids color).
<br/>
<br/>
   Anyways- I think it would be a fun idea.  Thought I'd share.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wonderful!  Its up to you I suppose, but I would say it might be more fun to have all 3 first places used in the coloring part of the contest-- ultimately I wouldn't do any more than the top 3, as I think alot of the fun will be seeing the many different interpretations/colorings of each painting.  Very cool- I look forward to participating.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think I go the Colors gallery just to see every new painting. That's really great.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, as some people said before, people are talking about Colors on art forums, that's cool ^^.
<br/>
<br/>
The other day, I was trying to draw something and someone was looking at me and then said "you have a kind of painter on your DS? Can I try it?". So, he tried it and did something really nice but I didn't save it. He said me he's video game graphic designer... So, it's not a surprise he was drawing like that...
<br/>
<br/>
He said he think that Colors is a great thing, like a portable Cintiq. I do agree ^^.<br/>_________________<br/>めくらの国では片目は王様</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone explain me what I do wrong... Somewhere I read how to continue an old painting started with different application than colors, but now I can't find that post anywhere.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I made a new picture in Colors and saved it. Then I made a new picture in Photoshop (256x192) and copied it to my colors_slot0.png. Then I opened that slot in Colors, but I had to zoom in once to make my Photoshop painting fill the screen. So basically first it fills only 1/4 quarter of my screen. And when I tried to paint over that, I could paint only for that area, that I originally made in Photoshop.
<br/>
<br/>
BUT
<br/>
I have R4 in my DS Lite, and when I open my Photoshop picture 
<br/>
in Multimedia (is it Moonshell, I don't know, I just bought my first Nintendo a couple of days ago) and go to Colors directory, choose my .PNG file, it fills screen just perfectly. 
<br/>
<br/>
So my question is, if I want to do graphics to games or somewhere, Colors won't be best program to do some test viewing?
<br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone understood my questions. Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Your problem is simple, you have made a wrong size in photoshop..
<br/>
it's 512x384px instead of 256x192 .. Further explained: When you look at an image at 100% in 'Colors!' you actually look at 50%
<br/>
<br/>
here is a old post explaining how-to:

DiM</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you can load an image in Colors! after in has been modified (for example with photoshop). 
<br/>
First, to have the playback to work with the new image you should start a new, totally empty painting and save this as colors_slot1.
<br/>
Then download the empty colors_slot1.png from your card and open it in photoshop and when modified save back as colors_slot1.png.
<br/>
Put the image back on your card. Now open the image in Colors! again and it should have the new image.
<br/>
The empty playback makes sure it will only capture the new strokes.
<br/>
You can start with the playback so the new image will appear on the final result or you can start painting and without playback save it and the background image will then be gone..
<br/>
<br/>
Yes it's a long and a bit confusing instruction, but i guess that's the way it is..

Colors is much more lika painting application - good to paint some backgrounds maybe. Colors is not much use for pixeling.

Phidias is good for more precise work like sprites and fonts.  Its good for pixeling.

Jetboy, can you remove 'rabits' from the tag-list? I've spend last half hour adding 'rabbit' to all images tagged with 'rabit'.
<br/>
Rabbits are just like rabits .. they're just spelled correct
<br/>
<br/>
I've also added 'environment' to some 'landscape' images.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a technical term to describe 'realworld painting' or 'life painting'? I was thinking maybe this could be called 'study'. Would be fun to have those tagged as well..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thank you for making the effort.

<br/>
You are confusing Rabbits with Rabits. While Rabbit is a well known animal, Rabit is a hero of Yoolda story so its special case. So if you want to just see all Rabbits you go for Rabbit  tag, if you want to see Yoolda Rabit - you get the other tag :) At least i try to look on that this way.
<br/>
<br/>
Next time if you need to do tag to tag change, or tag based on tag change, just let me know. I could do it with simple SQL query in no time, saving you a lot of time.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

I was quoting someone else from the feedback page on collectingsmiles.com/colors..
<br/>
But if we read it carefully, I'd say:
<br/>
1. No, <span style="font-style: italic">try</span> to run it. It doesn't work, it only vibrates
<br/>
2. no, it was working properly without the rumble pack so it was running on slot 1 card

2b. autopatching works on all M3 products

And for the colors site  now they is the tag recherche who was so cool,
<br/>
but for the communication betwen drawer...a systeme of mesage box will be so cool ( with the message send , message have...)
<br/>
And perhaps in the personal galeri there is an option Archive so there is the galeri who i can make 10 draw ( my better) and the other go to the archive gallery.
<br/>
I Know that so much work, but in the futur perhaps... :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, pictures are sorted based on the number of stars, so best ones show up at the top. That kinda makes up for personal gallery for now.  In the future - maybe it could be done. Not anytime soon.

if i've created an account, would it be possible to have a 'block this user' button for someone who's style I don't care for, esp if they post 5 paintings a day?
<br/>
<br/>
the other thing I thought might be useful is a 'I DON'T like this' button, so that pictures earn both positive and negative ratings? then logged-in users could set a viewing threshold, so anything under, say -1, doesn't come up in the list. yes, i'm full of positive energy with my feature requests.

I think not, every body can draw and post what they do , and i think ( perhaps your daly) but when you start drawing that wasn' t so good ?? :)
<br/>
and that isn't a good motivation for people who start to see a draw with-5 or more. But you if you don' t like a draw of somebody , give him a post and give him to some advise, that is the  good mentality,  i think :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't have idea who might you be talking about. Well, with almost 1100 users now, you would have to hell of a lot authors to ban :) I will think about it, as it might become important if gallery will get more widespread user base. Thanks god we don't have hordes of 14 years old spamming us with male organs (yet). However it is not the top priority now (please do not convince me that it is by posting pictures of male organs :)
<br/>
<br/>
When Jens first talked to me about gallery, he wanted for it to be positive, and I agree. Negative votes are so... negative :) 
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if we would add negative points, that are not visible to anybody but the viewer who gave them. So you could block those pictures, or authors of those pictures if they have more pictures flagged as "i don't like it".  User could be able to filter those pictures out, or authors of those pictures out if they have enough bad pictures. On the other hand "i don't like it" button itself is negative enough. Anyway I'm not planning to do it, for sure not before version 3.0 which is not even planned yet :)

OK. So here I go.

<br/>
There are OTHER things you could paint except pink bunnies. 
<br/>
Yes - they were funny, yes i like the humor, some of them are painted pretty well, just its too many of them.

It's like that with every joke. Even if its funny like hell, if you do it too often, it stops being funny, it starts being annoying.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">'Colors!' is turning out to be quite a wonderful little app!
<br/>
<br/>
I have a few suggestions/requests for the program...
<br/>
<br/>
- Press and Hold D-Pad LEFT to Pan the display while dragging the stylus.
<br/>
<br/>
- Double-Tap-and-Hold D-Pad LEFT to Zoom while dragging the stylus (vertically).
<br/>
<br/>
- Press and Hold D-Pad UP to allow for brush-resizing while dragging the stylus. Now you can remove the brush-resizing slider, as it is redundant.
<br/>
<br/>
- Double-Tap D-Pad UP to toggle brush size pressure control
<br/>
<br/>
- Double-Tap D-Pad DOWN to swap between soft and hard circle brush. Now the soft and hard circle brush buttons become redundant and can be removed.
<br/>
<br/>
- Press and Hold D-Pad RIGHT to activate eye-dropper
<br/>
<br/>
- Double-Tap D-Pad RIGHT to toggle brush opacity pressure control
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Use the space freed up by the removal of the brush-resizer to include a couple of "brush preset" slots. Pressing and holding on a slot for a short delay stores the current settings into that slot. Tapping a slot briefly loads the brush settings from that slot.
<br/>
<br/>
- Use the top screen to hold a HUD with a few indicators to show the current brush size (can be numeric, or just show a horizontal line indicating the diameter) current paint colour, and soft/hard brush mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, if you don't like the idea of double-tap controls then perhaps hitting the D-Pad while the L or R shoulder buttons are depressed might work, too.
<br/>
<br/>
You might want to look into a 'marking-menu' system. Alias Sketchbook Pro has a fairly nice implementation of it.

- If Colors! is left in Suspend mode for oh, maybe an hour, it freezes, and the DS must be switched off. I'm using a CycloDS Evolution on a DS Lite with a Kingston MicroSD, by the way....
<br/>
<br/>
- Depending on where your stylus is on the screen, the DS may report LESS pressure at the edges. Maybe a calibration mode where you get additional buttons at the edge to calibrate might be a good idea. Of course, to get any sort of consistency, you'd have to use a small weight to apply pressure to the stylus to the various regions of the screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I dont think tapping its the best idea. It makes interface too complicated.
<br/>
Hard to use for kids, and not very intuitive.
<br/>
Removing presure controls and sliders is not the think i would personlay like. I would like to have them avaliable somewhere.
<br/>
<br/>
Adding some brush presets would be nice. Tapping here would make perfect sense. But i thkink that having actual presed somewhere on the screen and dragging it to the presets slots would be more intuitive (there could be both methods implemented at once.
<br/>
<br/>
My idea would be to chcange shoulder buttons functionality a bit.
<br/>
1. You dont hold them just press them once to switch modes.
<br/>
2. There are 3 modes - 1. painting 2. color picker as it is now 3. brush presets and alternative color picker (HSV /RGB sliders with shown numbers)
<br/>
<br/>
But i hope others will share their thoughts and Jens will choose one method that he thinks is best.

That is known bug, and usually it hangs up much earlier. It happens only in paint mode though. If you go to menu you should be safe. AFAIK is pretty high on Jens todo list.

That differs from DS to DS. Jens said that he is planning to do something about it, but it is extremly difficult to deal with it correctly.

<br/>
That's a quite interesting idea. I've been seriously considering adding a button-configuration-screen where you can map what ever you want to the buttons and perhaps Double-Tap could fit in there. I wouldn't like to add it per default, since it would be quite easy to do it by mistake and not having a clue what happend.
<br/>
<br/>
The button-configuration-screen would of also solve the problem of left/right handed people accidently pressing the buttons on the right/left side. As I've mentioned earlier I don't really like options, but perhaps this is worth it.

<br/>
With respect to jetboy -- I agree that some of these suggestions trade ease-of-learning for increased speed. When I program my own applications, I try to combine as many functions into as few buttons as possible -- a single button could be used to execute multiple functions, depending on how you hit it.
<br/>
<br/>
<ol type="1">
<br/>
<li>tapping the button briefly
<br/>
</li><li>holding down on the button
<br/>
</li><li>double-tapping the button
<br/>
</li><li>tapping the button once, then holding it down
<br/>
</li></ol>
<br/>
<br/>
It's certainly not intuitive, but the user doesn't have to switch hand positions as often to execute different functions. I know it sounds picayune, but the DS must be firmly supported by only one of the user's hands (which is also burdened with the task of button-pushing). The other hand is occupied with the stylus.
<br/>
<br/>
If you assign one more button as a sort of "shift key", then two buttons would be capable of performing 8 combinations. If you allow their roles to be reversed, with the first button acting as a "shift key" and the second as the "tapping/holding" key then those two buttons alone would be capable of performing a dizzying 16 combinations!

I love the power-saving functionality. There's nothing quite like being able to clap the DS shut when I have to put a drawing on hold because I have to get off the train. But entering Menu Mode is a suitable workaround for now. Maybe it could automatically jump to Menu Mode, or a standby screen when the DS is shut. I have an inkling that if you have any time-dependent code where you have a variable set to a "start time", then another variable that sees how much time has passed since the "start time" -- then you may wind up with an overflow error when the DS is suspended for a very long time. Unless there's an emulator that allows you to simulate closing the lid, it'll probably be a tough one to trace.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
As for "marking menus"... they are a type of popup menu that displays up to 8 choices in a radial arrangement around the cursor. You drag in the direction of the choice you want, then release the stylus pressure to select it.
<br/>
<br/>
Sketchbook Pro used small icons instead of text to indicate the choices, and it only showed the icons if you kept the stylus stationary for a short delay. Advanced users who had the marking menus memorized could simply drag in a direction without waiting for the icons to appear.
<br/>

For now, it seems that Wifi is unstable on the CycloDS Evolution. The program enters an endless loop on the message: "searching for wireless Access Point." My power light continues to blink, so I think the program needs to give up after enough tries, or perhaps pressing the B button to cancel would be a nice option.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been able to connect to my AP through commercial nintendo cartridges, but I think the real problem with my inability to connect has to do with an incestuous love-hate-triangle between my DS, my AP and the homebrew wi-fi lib.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I strongly disagree. It would suit me pretty fine - i can deal with it and i wouldnt mind it myself but... While taping is excelent function for profesionals, it is too cumbresome for little kids, older people, etc.
<br/>
As far as I understand colors is not ment to be photoshop replacement, but nice tool for wider user base. Colors was ment to be simplistic tool, and thanks to that philosophy it got as wide user base as it have now. You just run it and paint. With different kinds of tapping, before user would start doing things, he/she would be bored and wont get hooked to the app.

    <h4>#150164 - moatdd - Wed Jan 30, 2008 8:18 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are many variations of marking menus out there. There's the aforementioned pie menus, radial menus, and even stylus gestures. Come to think of it, single-stroke stylus gestures would be the easiest to implement and less burdensome on the CPU.
<br/>
<br/>
I can also understand where a lot of people are coming from, especially jetboy. We've got two goals between which a balance must be struck, and on the surface, they appear to be mutually exclusive. There's "ease of learning" and then there's straight out "speed".
<br/>
<br/>
I am incredibly fussy when it comes to any piece of software I use with great frequency. As a result, many of the things I program are done so out of frustration with inefficient user interfaces. I also don't particularly enjoy having to put what I'm doing on hold to go off and program them because I prefer to spend my time doing what the programs are meant for -- drawing or painting.
<br/>
<br/>
Jesse, is coding the program out of his own time and is probably receiving meagre (if not nonexistent) charitable donations. I've coded donationware in the past and made a lot of video drawing tutorials and the donations are never enough to pay for the time spent developing them. The only thing that truly spurs development is my own frustration with my own products, until they've been optimized to the point where the diminishing returns are no longer feasible.
<br/>
<br/>
So rather than bark at Jesse for updates (when the program is offered for free) I'm offering to aid in the development. Now this doesn't mean that I want to eliminate every single graphical button and slider and replace it with a scrolling matrix display, nor does it mean that I want to rewire the buttons and hotkeys until only an epileptic octopus that's addicted to fighting games would be capable of executing the combos necessary to get something done.
<br/>
<br/>
For the time being, I can think of a few ways to do this:
<br/>
<br/>
One way is to share the source code with me. This is probably the easiest way, but from Jesse's point of view, unfavourable as I'm an unknown guy sitting miles away and probably difficult to prosecute if I were to try and run off with his hard work and market the program. Trying to sell software is a big pain in the arse and really, it's never worked for me in the past. Also, once you sell something, you become obligated to support it, and that is something I would absolutely detest as it means more work for me. The only people who seem capable of selling ANY type of product have to either be very slimy bastards who promise that the product is capable of everything you ever wanted and even destroy the mold and mildew on your bathroom tiles, or they gotta be plugging the product at every turn. I am neither slimy despite needing a shower badly and a misanthrope to boot, so I am highly unlikely to be out there hocking the software.
<br/>
<br/>
The other way, which is probably safer, is to implement a plug-in system. This has many disadvantages, in that coding the plug-in system itself is a pain in the arse, and that the system will probably wind up being a source of problems, especially since each plug-in will come with an overhead on system resources. It also means that gearheads like myself will be at the mercy of whatever functionality is offered through the API and I'll probably wind up pestering Jesse more than ever.
<br/>
<br/>
If I had the time to code something like this from scratch, I would -- but what Jesse has made is already about 95% of what I'd like to see in a portable painting app. Some people would probably tell me to just roll with it and shut up, but telling me to overlook a program that is missing 5% of its functionality is like telling me not to mind tripping and falling flat on my face once for every 20 steps I walk.
<br/>
<br/>
I dunno Jesse, it's your call!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Other suggestions:
<br/>
<br/>
* When you're zoomed in, the brush radius should decrease by the zoom factor to match the brush radius circle you see in the colour/brushsize picker.
<br/>
<br/>
* Combine the hard/soft toggle controls into the brush radius indicator. Tapping the brush radius indicator should toggle the hard/soft brush.
<br/>
<br/>
* Display the current colour in the gaps between the saturation/value triangle and the hue circle.
<br/>
<br/>
* Rotate the saturation/value triangle so that the saturated colour corner (not the black or white corners) points toward the current hue in the hue circle.
<br/>
<br/>
* Include a tiny "+" in the circular indicator that shows which colour is picked within the saturation/value indicator.
<br/>
<br/>
* Make the hue circle also indicate the currently selected value/saturation. When picking pastel colours, the hue circle changes by being redrawn in less saturated colours. If you select black, the hue circle becomes black. If you select white, the hue circle becomes white.
<br/>
<br/>
* fringe the hue circle with the original rainbow colours.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all: Colors is so fu$%! great, this exactly what i wanted for years! The gallery is awesome - seeing other artist  doing magic ... Whow!
<br/>
<br/>
Here are some ideas I had for Colors/Website, some ideas were already published here. 
<br/>
<br/>
Website (I know you are not currently planning to expand the websites functions, Jetboy, but I guess it does not hurt to tell some ideas)
<br/>
<br/>
- ignore this user
<br/>
- PM to user
<br/>
- Guestbook - user specific comments additional to the picture specific
<br/>
- MY favorite user list (I "liked" so many pictures in the past that my favorite list is getting a little bit unclear - and of course I want to keep "liking" to encourage the artists)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Colors:
<br/>
<br/>
- Color and Brush Palett
<br/>
<br/>
- currently selected color should be better visible (maybe on top screen?)
<br/>
<br/>
- showing the pressure dependent size of the current brush while painting
<br/>
<br/>
- Top View shows the unszoomed Version of the picture and the bush , so you can paint in two different resolutions at once (I guess this is a really hard one, but it would compensate for the small DS display a lot).
<br/>
<br/>
- Color calibration, to make it more comparable to the PC look
<br/>
<br/>
- pressure calibration via painted grayscale, to compensate for poor pressure sensitivity on the edges
<br/>
<br/>
- Remap keys (painting with the original key settings in other orientations is sometimes complicated)
<br/>
<br/>
- failsafe message for clear
<br/>
<br/>
- Clear with current color
<br/>
<br/>
- zoom OUT (compensate for week pressure sensitivity
<br/>
<br/>
- swap screen for brush testing, color mixing (could be delete when leaving the screen due to memory reasons)
<br/>
<br/>
- Finally of course the UNDO, Layer, smear, multiply etc. stuff everybody wants ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bugs in Colors:
<br/>
<br/>
- Display problems (weird pixels)
<br/>
<br/>
- Sometime DRWs are broken. Mine maybe due to Power-Off while saving over original. Solution: First save picture and then rename it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Finally I want to thank you for all your work you offered for this great homebrew! 
<br/>
<br/>

Yeah, Perfect Dark used it.

Probably inspired while they were making assets for the game.

<br/>
Regarding Menus;
<br/>
<br/>
See: "Advanced Wars" (specifically the most recent two on the ds)
<br/>
<br/>
Best, quickest easiest user interface ever.
<br/>
On the surface its just basic menus, but they are *really* well thought out. Letting you access the most common functions quickest.
<br/>
Stylus or DPad controller, either way you literally fly though the options.
<br/>
<br/>
It might not be the easiest to take inspiration from, but theres a lot of good design in it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

<br/>
  I don't know how familiar you guys are with Comiccon, but its a huge conference in the art/comics/animation world where each year many artists and art groups will put together art books and sell them...
<br/>
  So, I was thinking that it would be a huge promo for Colors! and just an overall neat thing if we put together a Colors! art book for Comiccon this year.  It could feature either all the art on the gallery, or if anything all the top-rated/most-viewed stuff.  It wouldn't need to be a fancy, professionally printed book per se, but at the very least could be a book from moo.com or a Kodak/Apple photo book of sorts--
<br/>
  Just an idea- I don't know who would want or could be involved with making this sort of thing happen, but I figured Jetboy at the very least might.  I'd be interested in helping in anyway I could for sure.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Time for the response to splotch I promised
<br/>
<br/>
- currently selected color should be better visible (maybe on top screen?)
<br/>
Yes, that could be a good idea. I'm not completely sure how the top-screen is used and if people would dislike me cluttering it down with misc information. Anyone has an opinion here?
<br/>
<br/>
- showing the pressure dependent size of the current brush while painting
<br/>
You mean to have the cursor change size depending on the pressure? That wouldn't be an improvement, would it?
<br/>
<br/>
- Top View shows the unszoomed Version of the picture and the bush , so you can paint in two different resolutions at once (I guess this is a really hard one, but it would compensate for the small DS display a lot).
<br/>
It's easily done, but it slows things down. I could do an option in the .xml-config in future version where you could test this.
<br/>
<br/>
- Color calibration, to make it more comparable to the PC look
<br/>
I would like this, but it would also slow things down a bit. Also, it's quite a lot of work to do a proper calibration screen. I'll revisit this request the day that we have the levels tool in there.
<br/>
<br/>
- pressure calibration via painted grayscale, to compensate for poor pressure sensitivity on the edges
<br/>
I still haven't made any more progress as regards to pressure calibartion. The thing you are suggesting would probably be a step up, but I still hope for something better.
<br/>
<br/>
- Remap keys (painting with the original key settings in other orientations is sometimes complicated)
<br/>
Yes. Very possible for future version.
<br/>
<br/>
- failsafe message for clear
<br/>
Will be in next version.
<br/>
<br/>
- Clear with current color
<br/>
I still haven't heard a convincing argument why painting the background with a color is too cumbersome 
<br/>
<br/>
- zoom OUT (compensate for week pressure sensitivity
<br/>
Good for composition as well. Will be in next version.
<br/>
<br/>
- swap screen for brush testing, color mixing (could be delete when leaving the screen due to memory reasons)
<br/>
I'm still not sure that this is the best solution.
<br/>
<br/>
- Finally of course the UNDO, Layer, smear, multiply etc. stuff everybody wants ;-)
<br/>
Noted. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
- Display problems (weird pixels)
<br/>
Fixed in the development version.
<br/>
<br/>
- Sometime DRWs are broken. Mine maybe due to Power-Off while saving over original. Solution: First save picture and then rename it.
<br/>
I can't improve the handling of powering off during saving as there is no working rename functionality yet (as far as I know). If there is some other problem, I need more info.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello Jesse,
<br/>
<br/>
- color should be better visible 
<br/>
Yes, that could be a good idea. I'm not completely sure how the top-screen is used and if people would dislike me cluttering it down with misc information. Anyone has an opinion here?
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; you could position a color box near the visualization of the currently selected brush in the menue. Or better: some boxes to have a palett and the current color has a thick frame around the box.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- showing the pressure dependent size of the current brush while painting
<br/>
You mean to have the cursor change size depending on the pressure? That wouldn't be an improvement, would it?
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; I take back this one. It?s not a feature of PSD or other apps. I guess you are right with a lack of improvement here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Top View shows the unszoomed Version of the picture and the bush , so you can paint in two different resolutions at once (I guess this is a really hard one, but it would compensate for the small DS display a lot).
<br/>
<br/>
It's easily done, but it slows things down. I could do an option in the .xml-config in future version where you could test this.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; As for the performance: how slow is slow ;-) It would be really a great thing to experiment with the feature and check if you can work with it fluently. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Color calibration, 
<br/>
I would like this, but it would also slow things down a bit. Also, it's quite a lot of work to do a proper calibration screen. I'll revisit this request the day that we have the levels tool in there.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; ok. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- pressure calibration via painted grayscale, to compensate for poor pressure sensitivity on the edges
<br/>
I still haven't made any more progress as regards to pressure calibartion. The thing you are suggesting would probably be a step up, but I still hope for something better.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; ok
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Remap keys (painting with the original key settings in other orientations is sometimes complicated)
<br/>
Yes. Very possible for future version.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; great!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- failsafe message for clear
<br/>
Will be in next version.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; great
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Clear with current color
<br/>
I still haven't heard a convincing argument why painting the background with a color is too cumbersome 
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; It?s not. But I thought it would be an easy feature to implement and it seems consistent to me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- zoom OUT (compensate for week pressure sensitivity
<br/>
Good for composition as well. Will be in next version.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; great!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- swap screen for brush testing, color mixing (could be delete when leaving the screen due to memory reasons)
<br/>
I'm still not sure that this is the best solution.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; I was  also not very sure about this. But I often paint colors transparently over another just to get the mix color or try a big brush with a very low transparency to work on the contrast. I therefore need to save the picture, try the brush to get a feeling for the pressure etc. I guess a second screen would help me here but I?m not entirely sure.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Display problems (weird pixels)
<br/>
Fixed in the development version.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; great
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Sometime DRWs are broken. Mine maybe due to Power-Off while saving over original. Solution: First save picture and then rename it.
<br/>
I can't improve the handling of powering off during saving as there is no working rename functionality yet (as far as I know). If there is some other problem, I need more info.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; I could not reproduce the problem, sorry. As for the renaming: I thought this would be an easy one. The DS is sometime a mistery ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can?t wait to get my hand on the new version especially the two screen zoom feature!
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Thank you for all the time you put into Colors! It's one of the coolest apps there is for the DS.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to things to come, there are many interesting ideas here and I guess you still got a few things up the sleeve yourself ;)
<br/>
<br/>
There is just one idea I'ld like to add ...
<br/>
<br/>
Child Mode: Kind of a "safe mode" where you don't have access to the save, load and other system functions.
<br/>
This mode should be difficult to exit, so maybe it could be toggled by a difficult button combo (R+L+SELECT). In effect it would just disable the START button.
<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this mode would be to safeguard the existing pictures from my son who loves to draw but also gets into the system menu overwriting other pictures, changing the calibration and messing with the WiFi upload. I've lost some pictures already and I know I could just do a full backup, but I think this would make a very useful feature for any parent ;)
<br/>
<br/>
You asked for opinions about the use of the top screen, so I want to say I realy like how it's working now, switching modes with SELECT. The help screen is very usefull when you give Colors! to someone new to play around with, and the full-canvas view is very nice to have while zoomed in. So, if you have any more information to be displayed just add another mode to switch through.
<br/>
<br/>
I love the WiFi uplaod feature, even if it's just to email a picture directly to someone for now. I think there is a lot that can be done there. As I'm fluent in php I'ld love to see the server side end become open source sometime, so I can play around with it myself ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

@Jesse: I recently used the playback feature as an "poor-man?s" undo. I stopped the playback at the estimated location and continued the painting from this point. I think it could be a promising idea for future versions to give the painter more control here. E.g. clicking the progress bar for jumping in the Ani, settings playback speed, jumping forward/backward one stroke for exact placement.

<br/>
This is not quite as easy as it may seem.
<br/>
The .drw files only provides the information for generating a picture in one direction, i.e. from a blank white page through to the final picture.
<br/>
<br/>
Therefore to jump to a particular point in the playback the program must start with the canvas in a known state (a blank white page if the frame it not the frame immediately after the current frame) and run all the stroke/brush/colour information from the .drw file up to the desire point in the playback.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Ha, but the playback applet on the gallery allows you to jump around in the playback.</span>
<br/>
The Java ColorsDraw applet/application has a couple of advantages over Colors!.
<br/>
<br/>
It does not have to worry (too much) about memory.
<br/>
This allows ColorsDraw to keep a set of render states for various points throughout the playback. This means that to jump to a point in playback the applet does not have to start with the blank white image but can begin at the closest previous stored state.
<br/>
<br/>
The average PC is a little faster than the DS.
<br/>
This speed allows ColorsDraw to generate the required image (from its closest previous stored state) quickly enough to provide the user with a smooth experience. As an example of the spees, the "Initial Setup" bar that appears after you click the "Begin Playback" button is the applet running through the complete .drw file generating its set of stored states.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Thinking out loud</span>
<br/>
One possibility for Colors! may be to maintain one historic render state, something like, 10 strokes behind the current state. This would then allow the user to go back to any point within these 10 strokes and continue painting from there. By keeping the number of strokes small the DS should be fast enough to keep the experience smooth.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Also a user defineable save-state would be realy nice too. When you are unsure of where it's going or how to do something you set a save point, mess around and then reset to that safe point until you get it right. This can be done by saving and loading now, but it's quite a hassle.
<br/>
<br/>
If memory is getting realy sparse, how about using a slot-2 memory extension for these features. I have no idea about how complicated that is, though ...

Not sure it's possible to do a file-based system for undo/playback, since the files are so large. But it is an interesting idea to asynchronosly save states down into a temporary directory.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what masscat means with the 10-step undo idea. If those 10 strokes are covering the whole screen, I would still need ~6MB of additional memory. Of course, this could be a variable depending on how large the stroke is, using a cyclic memory buffer, which makes the idea really interesting. I'm a bit afraid of having the performance degrading though, since copying these large bulks of memory-states could slow things down.

For the 10 step undo thing you only need the screen data for two screens worth (still some 1.5MiB so a sizable chuck of memory).
<br/>
<br/>
The first set of screen data is used as now (what is currently on screen).
<br/>
<br/>
The second set of screen data is what the screen looked like 10 .drw steps ago. Along with this screen data, the drawing state is kept (the brush colour, alpha, type and some other things).
<br/>
Any point within the previous 10 .drw steps can be regenerated by starting with the screen data and drawing state and rerunning the required number of .drw steps.
<br/>
This is what the Java ColorsDraw does and whilst I was writing the post a couple back it occurred to me that Colors! could do something similar to provide an undo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Ah, I see. But that means that you reduce the performance by 50% since you need to continuously paint two paintings. Then again, you could probably paint the Undo painting during "idle" time, with the only drawback that it would need to catch up when a really "fast" painter pressed the undo button. Hmm, I like it. I would have to be really careful to not introduce any form of input-lag (since I can't create a real idle thread), but it is has more than one undo-step, uses less memory and is more reliable than my current plan.

seeing you speaking of undo features kinda scares me a bit, but i guess there's no real harm in it if you might add a little "turn on/off" button for it.

<br/>
No the real scare is the loads of memory copying, it kinda feels like there are better tasks to waste that performance on. Still you'd only need to actually save "patches"... Argh no i don't even want to think of it!
<br/>
<br/>
What really interests me though is a few extra blending modes, like "multiply". And perhaps customizable brushes, i'm not quite sure how you spawn your strokes at this time, but an inverted softbrush would be much appreciated ( also known as a wet-fringe-brush ).

I have the same problem, and it used to happen when I drew things in Tony Hawk's American Sk8land.  I believe it can be brought on by holding the DS too hard close to the touch screen (though I don't have anything to back up that theory).  One thing that I'd REALLY love to have in Colors is the ability to undo.  Is there a chance that we'll be seeing that anytime soon?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
So you checked the blog and could see that other people have this problem, but you couldnt see that Jesse is aware of it?
<br/>
<br/>
It's fixed as much as it can be fixed.
<br/>
It's a matter of touching screen accidentally in other place, squeezing your ds  near TS too much, or being electricaly charged. Try discharging yourself before painting, and pay atention if you dont touch the screen wcidentaly while painting.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

absoluteley.

<br/>
but i think it is because i use a screen protector.
<br/>
<br/>
i've just made an other test:
<br/>
choose a very thin size for pen, and very gently and very slowly draw some vertical lines. it doesn't appear all the time, it's sure, but sometimes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well - that might be the case if the screen protector was sticked in improper way. Touching and untouching could generate some stress on the protectors film. However, I have been testing it on a couple of different DSes with and without screen protectors and i still cannot reproduce the error :(
<br/>
<br/>
What's more. I used to be able to generate touch errors, but i was working in the office where walking over the carpets generated a lot of static. It was happening in colors and in official titles, and picto chat. Since i changed the job - no more stylus jumping occurs. Not in Colors - Not in commercial applications.

I reade the entire topic for a help, I found this.

I'm having this same problem of stylus jumping, the lines goes to same direction. The previous version 1.05 works fine and all other homebrew drawing aplications as well.

It occurs everytime a tap the screem with the stylus. And pretty much when I try to draw something.

Once opon in a time, just once, it worked fine.

Another thing funny; I have both versions instaled 1.05 (renamed as colors5.nds) and 1.06h. they share the same files and playbacks. Is it normal?

AFAIK Jens was adding some stylus jumping prevention functions in 1.06, but maybe it is working wrong on some models of DS.

nope, it worked before and if you were right I would expect an error-message like 'you need latest java', although that's just based on other software behavior.
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking maybe the support desk at the office once again tweaked my pc profile and messed up but that wouldn't affect my Mac so maybe they blocked java through the proxy.. if that's even possible..
<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned it works at home so I will follow your link and re-install java to check if that works.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought I post this here as well (taken from the comments of the v1.06 release blog-post):
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the silence on my part. I've been busy with other things. :)
<br/>
<br/>
As usual, thanks so much for all the compliments and feedback. I'm currently not spending much time on Colors!, but I still plan future version. This means that I don't have an ETA for you.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a bulk-response for all the questions stacked up since my last comment.
<br/>
<br/>
Undo - Next version will most likely contain an Undo, and it may be more than the one-step Undo I've mentioned earlier.
<br/>
<br/>
Save time spent on a painting - I hope to have that in there as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Rewind Or Forward during Playback - Can't be done with the current approach, sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
Send the drawings via Http/FTP/Name subect etc. - I hope to expand on the SendToEmail option to include other things as well, but that may take a while.
<br/>
<br/>
I keep having problems with the ?jump? line - It seems that some people have this problem. I'm not sure what more can be done to solve this, especially since it doens't appear for me. If anyone want's to donate a "bad" DS there may be something I can do.
<br/>
<br/>
First, the ability to ?quicksave? the current state of a painting, and I?d suggest the creation of two modes: one that saves just the PNG and *.tmb file, and other that saves it with the *.drw aswell. - Saving the .drw usually only takes only a small portion of the time, so it wouldn't be very quick.
<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest an automatic numbering algorithm that could be reset - I've actually done a Storyboard version of Colors! that has this functionality. I'm not sure if I want to integrate this into the real version though. I'll think about it.
<br/>
<br/>
Additional features on the brush/palette screen - In general, I am having trouble visualizing more features on the brush/palette screen. Personally, I think it's a bit too crowded and complicated as it is. There are many great feature-requests here and it's something I need to take into account when redesigning it.
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the palette screen, I think an option to make it toggle would be appreciated. - I agree. I hope to do something like that.
<br/>
<br/>
I?d like to be able to easily select plain white/black - Agreed.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be easier to navigate the files menu if the shoulders were user to skip pages - Agreed.
<br/>
<br/>
For that I would suggest an off-by-default ?advanced mode? - It's possible that there will be a few options that can be turned on in the .xml config-file in future versions. That would allow me to implement "advanced" features without sacrificing simplicity or having to spend time on making them fit into the user-interface.
<br/>
<br/>
Is or will the source code be available? - No, it's not, but a number of people have been granted access to it. If you think you have what it takes to help out. Feel free to contact me about that.
<br/>
<br/>
ability to load my own images for work in Colors - I hope to have something where you may load a reference image that you can try to replicate in future versions.
<br/>
<br/>
Have a ?lefty/righty? setting in there somewhere - I hope to have a button-configuration screen in future versions.
<br/>
<br/>
is it possible to add a ?rough paper? - It's an interesting idea of having other backgrounds than plain white. I'll definitly consider it.
<br/>
<br/>
Size of the brush relative to zooming might be nice - We've been playing around with that. I'm not really sure what's best.
<br/>
<br/>
When I try to send pics to my email I do not receive them. - It's may be caught in your (or your ISP's) spam-filter. I hope to improve the mail-handling a bit to make this less likely.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of having single image files, it had an ?art pad? mechanism - I like that idea, and I've been considering something like it. Not for the next version though.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess your program might not support DHCP - As far as I know, it does. Colors! uses DSWifi for access-point communication, and DSWifi should not have a problem with DHCP.
<br/>
<br/>
How about putting the color picker and brush settings on the top screen as on option? That way it?s accessible directly without having to push a button every time you want to change a setting. - Well, the top-screen is not touch-sensivity, so that wouldn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
I just need to buy one of those DS card?things. Does anyone have any recommendations as to which one I should go for? - Check <a href="http://colors.brombra.net/faq.php" target="_blank">http://colors.brombra.net/faq.php</a>
<br/>
<br/>
A lasso/marquee feature/line tool/simple layer function/different brush shapes/a smudge tool
<br/>
 - Probably not. At least not for next version.
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding saving corrupting your memory card - It's sad to hear that some of you have experienced this problem. Colors! uses libfat for file-handling which relies on  every flash-cart's individual DLDI driver. Basically, that means that any corruption is most likely due to bad drivers from the flash-cart manefacturers and nothing I can do anything about. It seems though that it may be related to running out of space, so a work-around for some of the problems may be for me to refuse saving if you are running low on space.
<br/>
<br/>
"I wish you the best of luck and inspiration on your algorithms." - Best good luck line so far. Thanks. :)<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Jesse on Fri Apr 25, 2008 12:33 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Jesse, Jetboy and Madwurmz thanx for all your hard work. 
<br/>
<br/>
I had a DS lite before that works well with Colors 1.06h but now I got a new one (Nintendo sent me a new one after I ruined the old one) and it's giving me problems with the accidental strokes. I had a very few instances with accidental strokes with my first DSLite but I think I touched the corners and drawing on it was fine for however long it lasted. 
<br/>
<br/>
I know, I know... I had already read all 42 pages of this post and I remembered one of you was saying it can be an issue of either static or touching the corners. With this new one, I tried not to touch the corner, nor the rims. So I thought it's static, right? But then I was able to replicate 
<br/>
the problem. 
<br/>
<br/>
So if I touch my stylus point on a particular spot with various light pressure, I can see the brush size ring flash between where it is and 2.5 centimetres horizontally left to that location. Sometimes a line will be drawn between these two points. 
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a line is drawn between where it is and a spot just right outside the screen border, always this spot that's sitting 2 centimetres north of the bottom right corner of the screen. 
<br/>
<br/>
Both of these situations happen with or without control pressure on. 
<br/>
<br/>
Some background info: 
<br/>
I had R4 with auto DLDI patch. I had Hori screen protectors installed on both the old and new DSes. I tried playing with Kirby Touch Canvas and Pictochat with the new DSL; the screen input was fine. I calibrated the screen within DS' OS menu, I calibrated the screen within Colors [110 hard; 193 lightly]. I re-downloaded and re-installed Colors 1.06h from your site. 
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if there's a bad circuitry contact underneath that spot where the lines are sometimes drawn towards. Any better guess? 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for bearing with me, yet another "accidental stroke" post.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

(concerning only this jumping problem) I went back to ver 1.06h and tested and consistantly I could reproduce the glitch by pressing on the same spot with various pressure (soft, hard, harder, soft usually does it). 
<br/>
<br/>
As to why I don't have much problem with v1.06h with my old DSLite but with this new one, I have no clue. Too bad I don't have the old one anymore or I could test it more.

<br/>
It was supposed to be cheap r4 clone. And it is, and as with most cheap solution - you got what you paid for. 
<br/>
Sorry for any inconvinience, but there is not much we could do. It probably is the problem with DLDI for n5.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the line jumping. It is possible that they got their screens from other manufacturer, or at slightly different specs. That's why pressure sensing is not official feature of Nintendo DS. Pressure sensing is somewhat hacked (reading registers we shouldn't) and it might not work on all systems equally well.

I hear lots of bad things about n5 around.
<br/>
There might be better DLDI drivers released, or you could try DLDI drivers for other cards - they MAY work. Check if there is update to n5 firmware - it might help. I dont own the card myself so i cannot help a lot here.
<br/>
<br/>
Please note that there is a bug and your card can get corrupted on r4 if there is not enough space to save.

<br/>
I'll assume that you have a machine running Microsoft Windows NT 5 (Windows 2000 or Windows XP).
<br/>
<br/>
First see if chkdsk can fix it without formatting:
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>Open "My Computer". </li><li>Right-click the drive containing your SD card and choose Properties. </li><li>Switch to the "Tools" pane by clicking its tab. </li><li>In the "Error-checking" pane, click "Check Now". Turn on "Automatically fix file system errors" and click Start. </li></ol>
<br/>
Now try deleting the folder again. If it doesn't work, you're going to have to copy all the files on the SD card to the hard drive and then format the SD card. But in order to show you how to format the card, I'm going to need to know what flash equipment you use, as the firmware of some older SLOT-2 cards is not compatible with FAT32.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Every device should work as long as it has proper DLDI drivers (you need to patch yourself).

I dont know if your particular device has proper DLDI.

Still not quite back from my trip (next stop is to be a speaker at the Nordic Game conference if anyone is going to be there) but it's been interesting to hear about the stylus-jumping problem with v1.06h vs v1.06g. v1.06h has all the smart logic to avoid stylus jumping but if it is true that this has made things worse on some DS's there may be more things I can do (at least have an option to turn off the "smart logic").

I forgot that I limited the scaling to a maximum of 4.0 (i.e. 2048 by 1536 pixels).
<br/>
<br/>
I have been playing around locally with the scaling limit set to 100.0 and can get results with a multiplier of 20.0 (10240 by 7680 pixels). To achieve this I have to give the java runtime environment 2000MiB of memory (<span style="font-style: italic">java -Xmx2000M -jar ColorsDraw_1_0_3.jar</span>). Higher multipliers cause the java environment to run out of memory (which the application attempts to cope with but depending where it happens can break the app).
<br/>
<br/>
Generating such large images does slow the app down a lot (especially as my system only has 2GiB of physical memory).
<br/>
<br/>
Since people may want to generate these big images you can get <a class="postlink" href="http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/colors_ds.php" target="_blank">release 1.0.3</a> with the scaling limit set to 100.
<br/>
<br/>
Apologies for two releases within two days.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have a system with lots of memory please let me know what is the maximum size of exported image you can achieve. Anybody get to x100 size (51200 by 38400)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Based on my experience with a DS and a DS Lite, if you don't let anything harder than your stylus contact your DS's touch screen, it won't get scratched. There might be a bit of stylus residue that looks like scratches, and it will look like vertical lines (if you play a lot of Meteos) or a grid of dots in the shape of a keyboard (if you play DSOrganize's text editor or Animal Crossing), but that will disappear once you take up a different game. So you don't need a screen protector; you just need to close your DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

What kind of dirt was on the thumb strap? If anything harder than the stylus gets embedded in it, you could end up scratching the screen.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
The lesson I learnt it that screen covers are cheap and easily replaced, touch screens aren't. If you get a decent one it doesn't impact on performance in any noticeable way. If you don't use one, you may be very careful not to scratch your screen but eventually a piece of dust or dirt will get between the stylus and the screen and leave a permanent scratch. A scratch that can't be removed simply by changing the screen cover.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

If you have to reseat the adapter repeatedly to get the DS to recognize it, there's probably dirt on the adapter's edge connector. I would recommend cleaning the edge connector, but I don't know how to do that. I know of a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/nes/clean/" target="_blank">cleaning procedure</a> that works for NES, Game Boy, SNES, N64, and GBA Game Paks, adapted from the one described in the NES Cleaning Kit manual, but it doesn't work too well for DS Game Cards or anything else that has plastic teeth between the contacts.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I think tepples is right and there is a problem with your flashcart. During painting, Colors! doesn't access the file-system at all. Entering the Start-menu on the other hand do, so if this fails for some reason (like if you had removed the memory-card), the program will probably lock up. Nothing much I can do about it, but I'll try to implement an informative error-message, even though the user's painting is pretty much screwed if that happens.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try to capture the ColorsDraw window as it's rendering your .drw on the PC/MAC - I recommend the freeware virtual dub for capturing on the PC.
<br/>
That way you will get a video that you could upload to touyube. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
Just remember to compress the video and reduce it's resolution. For encoding I recommend the Xvid codec.
<br/>

Sorry for being a lazy bum. I've become involved in a bunch of other projects that have been prioritized over Colors!. I do want to get another version out there, but I don't know when that'll be. It's not likely it'll happen before mid-september though, when I'll have a bit of free time again.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Considering the flash player for .drw format i've made a working version, but did not released it for slow speed reason. 
<br/>
Pixel writting in flash is far slower than Java, and big brushes are a problem cause they demand a lot of processor power with flash, i fear it could hang some older computer.
<br/>
<br/>
For recent computer and using the latest browser like firefox 3/opera 9.5, the speed is more acceptable ... but still not enough, so i'm waiting for flash player 10 who promise some better performances (x3), to optimise the player with the new possibilities, finish the interface and see if it can be released or not.
<br/>
<br/>
My last iteration can be found here.

An option ,though, would be to use palette map, but 256 colors to draw a painting is kinda limited ...

<br/>
I've also tried a vector approach which is a lot faster, but i block on variable alpha inside a stroke, i hope the new drawing api that will be introduce in flash player 10 can help me find a way for this(not sure at all) or else i'll be obliged to stick with pixels.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No. I'm talking about genrating  512x386 square objects and aranging them into an array (and on the screen). You manipulate colors of those objects.

There are mixed results there too, but there is almost 5 000 images, with hundreds if not thousands of them being really, really good. Most of them have .drw and .tmb included, so you can download it to your DS, or watch them painted there or on the site - or you can repaint them in higher resolution on your PC.

Well, I am the only one using it thus far because I just created it.

If you install java on your laptop, then you can watch replays online without the need to move drw to DS. Just go into details of picture and click "begin play". It is worth noting that its much more bandwidth friendly than videos. 
<br/>
<br/>
Plus you can use Ben Jaques's Colors Draw java applet on your PC. You can read more about it here:

I tried to do tag system that would help categorizing and searching images, but it seems it fails in its current form. Thats because people are not tagging pictures, but its actually my fault. Current system is not intuitive enough. I was thinking about upgrading it, but its not a priority now.

Pictures can't get hidden once i approve them. And i approve all appropriate pictures that are being posted usually within 10 hours max. You don't realize how much work is going on behind gallery :) But it is also very rewarding :)
<br/>
<br/>
I already done my homework for the weekend.
<br/>
<br/>
There should be 2 changes going on the gallery this week. First one is mentioned a couple posts above, second one is... there will be a list of most recent comments you got for your pictures. That should make communication a little easier. I will also think about "joker" problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Theres is not much i can do about the joker, but there is a guy who reports pretty much everything.  I ll remove reporting functionality for him. 
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: LOL! it seems some new dumb crawlers are cruising the site clicking every possible link... Seems the problem is solvable - just i need to take proper rest and take some free time :)<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

<br/>
No they were drawn on one screen, just the screen was turned 90 degrees to left or right. Pictures in the gallery are scaled so they all are the same width, so vertical pictures seems bigger. If you go to details they are all the same size, just rotated.

<span style="font-weight: bold">Question about java applets.</span>
<br/>
Since applet tag is depreciated, i was thinking about switching to object tag. The problem is applet tag seems to work on all browsers without any problems, while object tag behaves diferently on all browsers... i cant make it run properly on IE and FF at the same time - i didnt even tried other browsers yet... so i think staying with applet is the way to go, isnt it?
<br/>
<br/>
Another problem is: once in a while i get "failed to download .drw file" before recent changes i had to close all browser windows and reopen the page to fix it.  After recent changes that is not enough. I need to restart browser, open old version of the page - paint any iomage, and when i get back to the old version of the page it works for some tries. Then in some time it gets broken again.
<br/>
<br/>
It is the exact same applet - nothing was changed there, it is the same code to display the applet. The only difference is that its now hidden when page loads. Could it be the problem? Any ideas how to fix it?<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

Here is some info for putting applet into web pages and how to use the different tags. <a class="postlink" href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/deployment/applet/deployindex.html" target="_blank">Applet deployment</a>
<br/>
That also links to the W3C specifications for the applet, object and embed tags (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/struct/objects.html" target="_blank">Objects, Images, and Applets - html 4.01</a>).
<br/>
From a quick read of it, it seems easier just to continue using the applet tag as it works in a similar way for most browsers (and their older versions) that people use.
<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what is happening with the "failed to download .drw file". I will build and email you a version of the applet with some more diagnostics in it to attempt to track down what is failing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yes. You are downloading torrent files. Just download homebrew files form their homepages. If they are zipped or rared unpack them, and put them on your card. For colors you can either get it at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://colors.brombra.net/downloads.php" target="_blank">http://colors.brombra.net/downloads.php</a>
<br/>
<br/>
For other homebrew - you need to get them from their sites.

No DLDI patching is needed on R4. Try testing it with just some strokes. And see if it was one shot problem or does it repeat. I assume you run latest colors (1.06h afair). If problem persists - try redownloading colors.

I uhh, Just heard about colors yesterday. I've been trying to get it to work on my g6flash card. The g6 has two folders, one NDS folder, for all the roms, and one System folder for the skin/whole system. I've downloaded the patch for the g6 and placed it in my NDS folder. When I started it, I just get a black screen. I tried without the patch. Still a black screen. Odd thing, I even tried putting the files in the System folder. What I get is a white screen message saying that colors wasn't instalized and got a link to community colors.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not much of a tech junkie. I don't know how to use the patch correctly. So sorry if this is annoying anybody with this question.

Have you tried latest version? It's 1.06h.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">HI GREAT PROGRAM!!! I just have one problem that i cant seem to find an answer. I am running colors on a R4 NDSL card. and it works fine, it saves AND loads teh painting fine. Problem is, when i put the SD card into my MAC laptop or PC computer, i cant seem to find the files. I have done a foind/search for the png files as well as drw files, but it says they arent there. the only thing that gets updated is the SAV file. i have removed and replaced the whole folder, including the nds and sav files and put a fresh colors.nds file back on the card, when start it up, it all works fine and it can stil load the images, even though i have removed all folders.
<br/>
<br/>
Please help, as i have a WPA2 encrypted router and cant use WIFI to upload the images as it seems the DS only supports WEP. Any help would be greatly appreciated as i have just bought my DS especially for colors!

the first time your run colors (assuming your dldi is working) it will create a folder in the same directory as the .nds file called "colors." inside that folder will be your file named by which save slot you used (IE: colors_slot5.png).

<br/>
that is correct the ds requires wep or no encryption. your only option is to purchase a ds compatable usb dongle, which will forward the wifi packets to the router bypassing the encryption. but i warn you now, you will spend the bulk of your time trying to get it set up and in the end be disappointed with how it works. perhaps if you have admin access to the router can you run wep? you should not be paranoid unless the neighbor living within 30 feet of you likes to crack wep keys to have free internet.

DS version to 1.1 with as many features introduced on iPhone as possible.
