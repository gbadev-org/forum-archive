    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrdictionary.net/lemmings/" target="_blank">LemProject</a>: Open-source Lemmings for the DS, original levels, level editor (and maybe some other stuff too).
<br/>
<br/>
-----------
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Latest news:</span>
<br/>
<br/>
June 20th 2007:
<br/>
<br/>
Lemmings v7 Full has been released! HUZZAH FOR ALL! ^_^
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>- DLDI support
<br/>
<br/>
- Automatic progress saving - Lemmings DS automatically keeps track of what levels you have completed!
<br/>
<br/>
- Make your own levels and traps using the included level editing tools, and share them with others online using the official MrD.net forum!</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
-----------
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Controls:</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the controls:
<br/>
<br/>
The default style is called 'Tapper style'. 'Tapper style' is the closest to the original Amiga Lemmings control style: use the stylus to tap a lemming, and the tool will be assigned instantly.
<br/>
<br/>
There are two 'Tapper style' preferences, 'Hold' and 'Toggle'. These refer to the shoulder button pause command:
<br/>
Hold means the game is paused while you hold either shoulder button. While holding one shoulder button, you can tap the other button to advance the game by a single frame.
<br/>
<br/>
Conversely, Toggle means you toggle pause with the shoulder buttons.
<br/>
<br/>
The second style is call 'Holder style'. In 'Holder style', you can hold the stylus against the screen to pause the game temporarily. Holding the stylus against a lemming cause that lemming to be highlighted. While a lemming is highlighted, tap any shoulder button to assign the current tool. This style can be useful if you are trying to pick a single lemming from a large group.
<br/>
<br/>
The final style is called 'Tactics Style'. 'Tactics style' is basically a reversal of the original Lemmings style. You must click on the lemming &lt;i&gt;first&lt;i&gt;, and then the tool you want to assign. 
<br/>
<br/>
'Tactics style' offers the same 'Hold' and 'Toggle' preferences as 'Tapper style'.
<br/>
<br/>
Use the directional pad or XYBA to move the camera in any control style. Hold the Start button or hold the stylus against the Fast Forward button to increase the game speed. You can use Fast Forward while the game is paused. (The game will stay paused once you release the Start button)
<br/>
<br/>
Zoom in and out using the zoom controls in the lower left corner of the touchscreen.
<br/>
<br/>
Shutting the DS? lid will pause the game.
<br/>
<br/>
-----------
<br/>
<br/>
May 30th 2007:
<br/>
<br/>
I've done a whole load more stuff to Lemmings... alternative ways of doing stuff that should be more R4 friendly: copy everything in <span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrdictionary.net/lemmings/releases/final/2007_05_30_v07_test_b_LemmingsDS_Alpha_DLDI.rar" target="_blank">here</a> </span> to the root of your card (don't forget to patch it, too), and see what happens. <span style="font-weight: bold">(New version! Works on R4! Possibly! Really this time!)</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it still takes half a minute to start up and to begin a level. (Enumerating levels and stuff)
<br/>
<br/>
I took out all the .xms except one to speed things up a bit. If you want to put them back, use the xm's from the rar in the post below.
<br/>
<br/>
The final version of this will boot and load levels instantly. (It's debugging stuff that slows it down.)
<br/>
<br/>
There are only a couple of test levels in this version to test traps and hazards. Levels made with LemmingsDSBuilder -will not work- on this version. This version is just to test these levels for now.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Dave2 for putting up with a barrage of nds tests! :D
<br/>
<br/>
May 16th 2007:
<br/>
<br/>
Alrighty! Here's a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrdictionary.net/lemmings/releases/final/2007_05_16_LemmingsDS_Binary_Alpha_DLDI.rar" target="_blank">DLDI alpha version</a> for y'all!
<br/>
<br/>
Unrar that into the root of your card, and update the config file if you don't like the 'LemmingsDS' directory.
<br/>
<br/>
It works on my Supercard SD, and that's currently all I know. :(
<br/>
<br/>
Give the levels that are there a shot... the level system works a bit differently now:
<br/>
<br/>
There are two level categories, Standard and Custom. When the game starts, it'll take a minute (it won't take this long in a non-debug version ^_^) to cycle through the directories in /LemmingsDS/levels/1player/standard and custom and tries to identify all the levels it can find. It groups them together based on the directories they're in... (you'll know what I'm talking about if you give it a go.)
<br/>
<br/>
The level format for this version is different to the old one, so old levels won't work. (If you try and copy them into the directories, they should be ignored by Lemmings DS.) I'll get to making a convertor when I've figured out what needs to be in the new format.
<br/>
<br/>
If anything weird happens, post about it and include the debugout.txt which magically appears in the root. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Edit - As with all homebrew, back up before you run this! I don't take responsibility if this makes your flash cards go funny. (It hasn't done anything weird to my SCSD stuff in these last months, but I can't guarantee behaviour on other devices, 'cause SCSD is all I got.)
<br/>
<br/>
-----------
<br/>
<br/>
Dec 26th 2006:
<br/>
<br/>
Nope, I'm not asking for programmers. It's finished. Go get it.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.mrdictionary.net/lemmings/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/ingame-1.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Download the files, and slap 'em on your Supercard. (Or whatever SLOT-2 device you've got handy.)
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of levels for the game. If you can, give the level editor <span style="font-style: italic">Lemmings DS Builder</span> a whirl, and try to come up with some cool levels. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum.

<br/>
I hope you get around to using the original levels. There are a few docs floating about on the net, with details of the level formats for different versions, i think the msdos level info is easyest to find (perhaps just code a converter from the origional levels to yours format.)
<br/>
Great work all the same, I for one will keep my eye on any futer updates.

    <h4>#113350 - MrD - Tue Dec 26, 2006 11:27 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know if the original levels could be converted... Lemmings DS levels are designed around a similar philosophy, but there's subtle differences that would have to be taken into account. (Lemmings levels are a series of stamps placed one on top of the other. Lemmings DS levels are a series of textured rectangles one on top of the other.)
<br/>
<br/>
You <span style="font-style: italic">could</span> write a converter that makes a level from an original Lemmings level where the graphics from one of the Lemmings level styles (such as the Earth &amp; Rock style from Fun 1 and Tricky 1) are embedded into the level file, and all of the stamps are recreated as Lemmings DS texture areas... Hmm...
<br/>
<br/>
I don't really know enough about the original Lemmings format to do that though :/
<br/>
<br/>
And don't stop making! Make make! Make it into something else if you have to! :)<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by MrD on Tue Dec 26, 2006 11:28 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <h4>#113351 - bob_fossil - Tue Dec 26, 2006 11:28 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've just tried this on my m3sd, using the raw binary download. It works, but I get something like this on the level select screen:
<br/>
<br/>
Level 1 Rating Funk
<br/>
Level 1 Wait... A doddle?
<br/>
Well, hey. It -looks- safe!
<br/>
ERROR - Canonisation Failed
<br/>
ERROR - Canonisation Failed
<br/>
ERROR - Canonisation Failed
<br/>
ERROR - Canonisation Failed
<br/>
ERROR - Canonisation Failed
<br/>
<br/>
All the rest of the levels have the text ERROR - Canonisation Failed. If I select this level, the preview graphic for the level is the text 'error' in red characters. I can even select this 'level' and it plays briefly before locking up.
<br/>
<br/>
On the main screen it says I've got 120 standard one player levels and 0 custom one player levels.
<br/>
<br/>
That aside, what I've seen so far is really impressive. Keep up the good work!

    <h4>#113353 - MrD - Tue Dec 26, 2006 11:30 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah... that's a side effect of not having any main sequence levels. I've covered it <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.mrdictionary.net/viewtopic.php?t=7" target="_blank">here</a> in the mrd.net forum:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Matt wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">This message means that when the ROM was compiled, there were holes in the level lists.

<br/>
<br/>
Any missing files are filled with failsafe.lds (the makefile takes care of this), and that level has the title Error: Canonisation Failed.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Just ignore the canonisation stuff for now, and make a ROM with your own levels and use the custom level menu. :)
<br/>
<br/>
There is a simple, logical reason why it locks up after a few seconds on the 'error' level. For 500 Trivia Points, can you guess what that reason is? (You only get 200 Trivia Points if you figure it out by looking at the source code.)<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum.

Fast forward runs the game as fast as the game can run. (You can optimise and rewrite my DS_SPRITE exrot background sprite blitter if you like. :P)

I believe it wont work with DKP &gt;=19 as that's when the EABI format was introduced. The need for a specific version of DKP is due to 0xtob's NitroTracker player core living in the ARM7 (plus I never really saw any need to upgrade... ._.), and I'm afraid I wouldn't know the specifics of why this is the case, or how you'd change it.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum.

Possible solution: Load entire level into RAM, then you can use random mem access again via pointer. You'd only need minor changes to your level loading code, the rest of your game code would be unchanged.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I.e. you can keep one of these structs in ram, copy the .lvl there, and then load from there, which should make things easier. When I was  was sort of planning out lemming for gba, i was thinking that the gfx could be load from rom/ram (whatever the fat libs give me), and could load the lvl from the card.
<br/>
this code above is totally untested, just quickly cooked up, and there could be some problems due to endianness.

is that the "believe" thing? i've got a windows install of lemmings sitting right in front of me..
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: oh wow. believe magic indeed. (though it'd be nice if it could pick up on bottomless pits or difficulty ratings!)</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty ratings aren't stored in the level file, as far as I know. This'll have to be a manual thing.
<br/>
<br/>
Use N flag (Believe &lt;level&gt; N or Believe Magic N) to get exported level names.
<br/>
<br/>
The new Believe is much, much uberer though.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nice improvements to lemmingsDS MrD.  The expanded level set is nice, and it's so much easier to add more now.  I love the thought you've put into the controls, this is easily the best non-pc lemmings port.  With pause-mode I don't even need to use the zoom function.  Are you going to add a score function?  That should be the next step once dldi has been well tested.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmm... back when I started this project (14 months ago, ACK!) libntxm didn't exist as a discrete library; I was using 0xtob's groovy NitroTracker player core code mashed up into my source tree. I made some minor edits to allow for one-shot sound playback, and module playback volume settings.
<br/>
<br/>
All of the changes I made to the NT core code are in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrdictionary.net/lemmings/releases/final/2007_01_04_LemmingsDS_Source.zip" target="_blank">the Lemmings v3.2 source</a> download at the LemProject site. I haven't touched any of that code between then and the latest version.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want the code updates to work with libntxm seperately, then you should download the customised libntxm source by litghost. (May still be available in the libntxm thread if sendspace hasn't deleted it yet.)

<br/>
<br/>
It's likely that your card is already supported by the old pre-DLDI libfat but not the SCSD.dldi file.  As many projects still include the pre-DLDI libfat, you're able to use it on the old code, but when you patch with the nonworking DLDI file, it takes priority.  Like MrD said, try SCSD_moon.dldi, which is based off the Moonshell FAT code and usually has a higher chance of success for programs that don't require Supercard ejection and subsequent reinsertion.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

(tepples your final build of luminesweeper had such awful SFX and such unbelievably slow difficulty ramping - whether or not this was true to the original, it's hardly compelling enough to merit with or without flashing lights - that it was really a shame given how otherwise brilliant it was).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, only tried Xmas 1991 so far and a couple of things:
<br/>
<br/>
a) It's definitely slower than it should be (however, just tried Xmas 1992 and the speed is fine in that)
<br/>
b) Where's the Christmassy music gone in Xmas 1991? The Amiga version has this excellent Xmas ditty playing away (it may have been a jazzed up version of Frosty the Snowman, I forget now). Music does play, it's not that, it's just that it's not the music that I remember.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, a suggestion - with all these levels it takes ages for them all to load on start-up, would it be possible to give some kind of animated feature to indicate that the DS hasn't locked up or, better still, a perceantage countdown to indicate how far along the loading progress is?

Sorry, it wasn't a criticism, I was just puzzled and thought the music had got mixed up somehow with the wrong tunes. Hadn't realised that you weren't using the modules. :-)

Xmas Lemmings '91 is definitely too slow, strange why the other levels are fine.

BTW, the consistent slowdown problem that I noticed on Xmas Lemmings 1991 only seems to occur on the levels with snow. Any ideas why? Perhaps it's the extra animation of the snowman causing a speed hit?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, a minor info screen inconsistency - on Lemmings it says to press L or R to start a game, yet on other incarnations (e.g. Xmas Lemmings) it says to tap the level you wish to play (although L or R still work). Not a big deal, just thought I'd mention it. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, despite my stylus being correctly configured, I still find that tapping on a lemming doesn't always work. This is without zooming in though, so perhaps I'm just missing by a pixel or so?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's all the animated stuff, the scenery... Everything basically.

Umm... don't know what you're talking about here. On the level select screen there are a selection of about six captions that loop around, telling you the different controls available to you. It's possible that you're just switching between level sets at the exact same time as the captions change, so it looks like the captions are linked to the different level sets. Try leaving the screen on a level set to read the different captions. :)

Yeah... the default setting is quite strict. Try increasing the range of the stylus in the config. if you're having trouble.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The only thing I noticed was the arrows on a few levels don't animate, they're supposed to animate left and right, as if pointing. Did this just not happen in the conversion process? Or did you not program the capability for this particular animation...?
<br/>
Other than that great stuff. What would be really cool is either a level creator on the DS using the stylus, or a mode where you used the stylus to get the lemmings across gaps, and maybe other gestures etc. (Have you seen that lemmings Eyetoy game on PS2? Genius.)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
