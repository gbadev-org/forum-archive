    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.milkytracker.net/" target="_blank">MilkyTracker</a>, a cross-platform music editor and tracker, is now open source and licenced under GPL. And no, there's no DS port of this application, but I thought this might nevertheless interest few people out here.
<br/>
<br/>
The authors claim that even for portable version one should have at least a 150MHz CPU, but then again DS has both graphics and sound hardware that make up for slower CPU (as NitroTracker has shown us, making a solid tracker on DS is very much possible).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, this is great news! I really love the new manual, since this is pure gold for implementing the XM effects, which are not all documented correctly/completely in the FT2 manual. This is like gbatek for XM! I don't think MilkyTracker can be ported to the DS easily, but if someone wants to prove me wrong, please do so :) Anyway, the source release will help a lot for making NitroTracker FT2 compatible.

Thanks for pointing this out, melw! I need to get in touch with the Milky guys and give them a hug :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Late last year a friend of mine had a demo version of it actually. I didn't get the impression from him that reduz was intent on completing it... and I might have gotten the opposite, but memory fails for clarity.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
