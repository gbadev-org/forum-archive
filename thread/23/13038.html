<br/>
Suggestions:
<br/>
<br/>
*Show the answers after the round (some of us suck at these games and use it to learn)
<br/>
*In Time Attack A, after I unlock the longest word I can advance to the next stage but when time runs out, I automatically go back to menu.  It should advance me to the next stage since I achieved the goal of getting the correct word.  Maybe it's supposed to do that but I found a bug?

    <h4>#126633 - Banzai8th - Wed Apr 25, 2007 6:53 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Couple ideas;
<br/>
-Tapping the checked off letter on the bottom unchecks it and removes it from the word you're currently building.
<br/>
-Have a button that clears all the letters in the word you're building without wrapping the letters.
<br/>
-In endless mode have a timer that counts up, so you can see just how long it took you to find all the words. If you feel that adds too much pressure to find words (it is supposed to be relaxed gameplay) maybe have it only display the end time after you've found all the words, before it loads the next puzzle.
<br/>
-In time attack A, completing any other word other than the longest word required to continue should give you more time, so you can bide yourself some more time while trying to work it out. Maybe like 5 seconds per letter in every word you find?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Someone else asked for this, so I've cobbled something together.

<br/>
<br/>
Note that that word list is about a quarter of the size of English list and that umlauts and the <span style="font-style: italic">B</span> character are replaced with ae ue and ss. I'd like some feedback on the quality of the words generated.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who has contributed feedback and suggestions. Unlocking the longest word doesn't move you onto the next level as I thought that's how it worked on the original PC version. Hmmm....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#127874 - zAlbee - Sun May 06, 2007 12:57 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, this game is awesome. I find myself playing it all the time, when I want a quick game to play, much faster than loading up Brain Age or finding opponents on WFC... =P. I have to agree with all of Banzai8th's and wormy's comments above ("Clear" button, answers, etc.).
<br/>
<br/>
I also have some new suggestions:
<br/>
<br/>
- The Wrap button shouldn't erase the letters. It should leave the letters that you've selected and only wrap the others. I used this strategy all the time in the PC game TextTwist, to find matches for prefixes/suffixes like "-ing" or "re-".
<br/>
<br/>
- Some words have more than one longest word. Can you make it so finding any of the longest words will unlock the next level (in game A)? Currently you have to find the "right" longest word.
<br/>
<br/>
- There seems to be a rare bug where the game will freeze at the "Thinking" screen indefinitely. The last time this happened, I was plaiying Time Attack A, and found the longest word ("zipped"), then continued to find the rest of the words (there weren't very many). I got the "you've found all the words! tap to continue" screen, then tapped and got stuck at the "Thinking" screen. I waited a good 5-10 minutes to make sure it wasn't just taking a long time to compute.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#127905 - Banzai8th - Sun May 06, 2007 12:43 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After playing this game for a while, I came to notice that it accepts abbreviations (several I found include 'doc' and 'sub'), which I personally don't think should be allowed. It is also unclear as to when plural versions of words are allowed, it seems to be arbitrary. I like the inclusion of Old-English words, but I think there were some missing (including I believe, 'olde'). And then there were regular words that were downright missing (only one I can remember is 'meld').
<br/>
I don't know where you got your world list from, and I know it would be a huge pain to go through and correct any changes you might wish to make to it, but maybe an entirely different source for acceptable words could be found.
<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed that it was possible to 'cheat' a little bit. The list of found words at the top are in alphabetical order, from least letters in the word to most. So you can sometimes know what letter(s) a word starts with that you have not found yet. I do not know if this was intentional or not.
<br/>
<br/>
I agree with zAlbee's ideas, and I have also encountered that same freeze, but I don't recall what mode I was in when it happened, just that it was after solving a wrap and moving on to the next.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
It has some debugging code in it to try and get to the bottom of the freezing during thinking bug. On the top screen you should see some numbers progress across the bottom line, e.g. '01234'. If it freezes, make a note of this number and let me know. I've made some changes to fix some possible freezes, so we'll see I guess. I've made a lot of internal changes to the code so I may have inadvertently broken some other things too.
<br/>
<br/>
Other things fixed in this version:
<br/>
<br/>
- In Time Attack A mode, if you unlock the level you are now advanced to the next stage when your time runs out.
<br/>
- In Time Attack modes, you now get some time back depending on the length of word you submitted.
<br/>
- You can now tap a checked out letter to remove it from the current word.
<br/>
- Low time warning sounds weren't being played after you ran out of time and started a new game.
<br/>
<br/>
As regards the word list. Well it's not perfect but it does the job. I'm happy to add words that are missing but I don't fancy compiling a new word list. If someone wants to do this then fine. Make sure each word is on separate line, is in lower case and send it to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have you looked at the wordlists available at <a href="http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/</a> ?  Another word puzzle homebrew on the DS, Word Up!, uses one of the 12dicts lists (I'm not sure which one, but I think maybe the 2of12inf list) and I've been pretty impressed by it in playing the game.  Of course, the differences in gameplay between the two games mean that wordlist problems would be more noticeable in Word Wrap than in Word Up!, but at the same time the quality of the wordlist is more important in your game than in Superpanic's, too.

Nice! Trying it now.
<br/>
<br/>
Haven't gotten it to freeze at all. But I noticed some funny bugs =). Such as "find %d words to go to the next level" appearing in Time Attack B, after about 5 levels in =D. The actual number was supposed to be 8 (maybe because only 8 words were possible). This didn't affect gameplay at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Also in easy (6-letter) difficulty, you can click the space to the right of the 6th letter, and input a space... lol.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
- Fixed text on the objective screen for Time Attack B.
<br/>
- Fixed spurious inputting of a space in easy difficulty.
<br/>
- In Time Attack A, if there are multiple longest words, you only have to find one of these to unlock the next level.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using 2of4brif.txt as my word list from the 12dicts package. I'm only using the 3 to 8 letter words from this list so I've got around 33,000 words.

<br/>
- Press START in game to pause.
<br/>
- Added some code to let you clear the current submission word quickly. Hold the stylus down in the submission word area and draw a straight line / upwards line from left to right - as if you were crossing the word out and lift the stylus. The word should be cleared away. You'll know if you've done it correctly as you'll see a white line left behind (for debugging). Appreciate some feedback on this.

One issue I've noticed (and hadn't seen reported) is that if you play something other than time attack a, then quit, the selection screen shows time attack a, but acts as if it's whatever you just played (e.g. if you were playing time attack b, it would show time attack a, but hitting play would launch time attack b, and hitting the right arrow goes to endless).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is a fantastic game and the number one played on my cart.
<br/>
<br/>
I know that this a a year after the last post but I've got some suggestions for new features if you're interested ...
<br/>
<br/>
1. The ability to enter a game number/seed to play a particular word. My wife and I often play this game at the same time (the kids think that we bought the DS for them ... he he). It would be nice to be able to play the same game (especially for the time attack version) - sort of like a pseudo-multiplayer.
<br/>
<br/>
2. A nine letter version where one of the letters has to appear in all the words. The newspaper where I live has this version (with minimum of 4 letter words). For example, see <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/puzzles/target.html" target="_blank">http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/puzzles/target.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for a really great game.<br/>_________________<br/>Brad.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
- Added two new game modes - Challenge 1 and Challenge 2 where you can play time attack or endless modes on a specific word.
<br/>
- Added exit to menu functionality.
<br/>
- Rebuilt with latest libnds. Should fix sound / mod playback issues.
<br/>
- Removed EFS code. Settings now saved to /data/wordwrap folder on your card.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
There will be bugs. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
