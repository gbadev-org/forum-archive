Ok, so here is the deal.
<br/>
After my failed foray into a Quake-based Halo DS, we put together a new team and have begun work on iSlayer.
<br/>
Models and maps are practically coming out of our arses here, while images, sounds, and other game files are being set aside, waiting to be used.
<br/>
But while everything else zooms ahead... the engine lags behind schedule.
<br/>
The 2 DS coders we have each have conflicting ideas, each making seperate engines, trying to get the other to merge with them. So I come here asking for help...
<br/>
Basically, any and all available coders familiar with DevKitPro and making 3D/FPS games are needed. We NEED to speed up the development of our engine.
<br/>
Below is our only update on our new project. All iHalo videos can now be considered old.

<br/>
Please, we need all the help we can get, and our situation is most... time sensitive. If you have any questions, please MSN me at <a href="mailto:randomnessatedge@live.com">randomnessatedge@live.com</a> . Thank you for your time,
<br/>

<br/>
PS- Yes, this IS a Halo-based game... it will center around multiplayer functions. And all models have been checked (save for the player models) to be compatible with the DS specs.

Sorry, I came to flame.  Ok, not really, as I'll try to be polite and helpful, but you won't like what I have to say....

Well, you've got at least one part right, which is having something tangible to show to try to generate interest..

Throwing more developers without strong leadership won't fix the problem you have -- if you have 2 coders, and the problems isn't their skill, but it's them working together, you need a strong team leader more than you need a bunch more coders.  And one of the last things I, as a DS coder, would be interested in is joining a team where the existing coders are already flailing against each other with no direction or leadership.  Maybe you should advertise for a coordinator or leader?  (tongue-in-cheek:  we seem to already have tons of THOSE floating around ;-) )

Are you targeting jalbroken iphones?  Because I'd guess you're not going to have much luck selling a game with someone else's IP on the app store...

Thanks, I appreciate it! And yes, we do target the JailBroken iPhones/iTouch's... we arent exactly looking to sell. And as for the coders... I should probably edit my post. It turned out one of them had an ace in the hole and was stalling for time. We can have a beta out within 1-2 months.
<br/>
But really, thanks for the criticism. I like it honest, it actually helps me out.
