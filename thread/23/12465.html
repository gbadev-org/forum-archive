Anyway 2 things :
<br/>
<br/>
1. the game runs verry slow on my sd card, is this because it's just a beta version or, does someelse has a almost normal speed?

<br/>
2.when i'm going into the option, i've no way to go back

Those things could be because of the shareware versoin.

<br/>
<br/>
 As far as clones go, yes FPS' have been cloned since they finally gained mass popularity when Wolfenstein 3D came out (certainly not the 1st by any means). As for Duke it is no mere "DOOM" clone or what ever you want to call it as it and Shadow Warrior (might as well toss System Shock in there too), have brought FPS interaction to a level that really has remained untouched until recent years. Each enemy had a variety of ways in which they could die, nearly everything in the world could be interacted with in a real world way, vehicles could be driven, etc. And of course the potty humour was always silly too.
<br/>
<br/>
 It's a shame we don't have Shadow Warrior, it's really a shame System Shock was never open sourced as it was MADE for the DS, but at least we have DUke and QUake, and that's a good thing! Now let's just hope that port of PrBOOM get's it's bugs worked out, of which I've found many while designing my new stand alone Star Wars iWad for it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i sent him a PM on dcemu (where his site is hosted?) a few weeks ago but haven't heard anything back yet.
<br/>
<br/>
also, the nintendo-ds section of dcemu has been down for ages now. i keep asking on the irc channel how things are going, but it hasn't been fixed yet...
<br/>
<br/>
see, his latest version hosted on dcemu forums is a corrupted zip file or something, and so it's unavailable to download anymore.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
