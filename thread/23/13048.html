Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the IRC channels.... another web browser with a silly title is announced! Except this time it is by someone who has a history of <a class="postlink" href="http://geocities.com/quirky_2k1/" target="_blank">actually releasing things</a>. What's more, here is the first release.
<br/>
<br/>
I started this a couple of days before DragonMinded announced his 2.7 alpha series with web browser included. I thought it would be impossibly difficult and so far I've been right. There is a lot of tag soup out there.
<br/>
<br/>
It is currently buggy and incomplete. It really does the minimum to allow you to search stuff on Google and that's about it. However, it <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> proper Free Software (GPL), compiles using all the latest stuff (devkitArm r20, dswifi 0.3d, etc) and there is an issue tracker for you to add your feature wishes/bug reports to.
<br/>
<br/>
Please keep in mind:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li> It uses wi-fi auto connect. So routers only and configured from an official game, I'm afraid.
<br/>
</li><li> It has the font compiled in - originally it read them from the card but...
<br/>
</li><li> ... my EZF 5 has stopped working, so DLDI is now more or less un-testable by me.
<br/>
</li><li> The keyboard is crap
<br/>
</li><li> It has no history feature (yet)
<br/>
</li><li> There is no cache (this is good since it means no corruption and bad since it goes slower)
<br/>
</li><li> No, it doesn't support Flash, javascript, images, style sheets (or most HTML in fact).
<br/>
</li><li> There is a lot of room for optimisation - "make it right, then make it fast"
<br/>
</li><li> I can only test on the phat DS, so it might not work at all on the lite.
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
That is all for now, hope you like it. Or at least, hope it isn't too offensive to your senses.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just tried it out myself.  Very fast for what it does, and fairly usable.  Like the previous poster stated, password fields don't work, but at least Google searches do.  Great for viewing the Random page at bash.org and such.  They keyboard may be unconventional but at least the buttons are large and easy to hit - I like that.
<br/>
<br/>
All in all, very good for a first release.  I actually really like the fact that there's no cache system and that it runs all in RAM.  While this may present issues down the road if images are to be implemented, for the moment it's fast enough without it.  Or maybe it's because I no longer have a card reader and am extremely paranoid about screwing up my card (using DSFTP to transfer Bunjalloo was somewhat risky by itself), lol.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nice one. I had no way of testing SuperCard CF compatibility since I have an EZF5. 
<br/>
<br/>
One Q: Is it the logo or the image that has to be removed? 
<br/>
<br/>
Your comment mentions "-b common/data/icon.bmp", but the patch removes the logo ("-o common/data/logo.bmp").
<br/>
<br/>
The icon is the image shown when navigating .nds files from within moonshell. The logo is only shown when wirelessly multi-booting the code. It is usually the Nintendo logo.
<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that the patch is the most correct, that it is the logo that has to gogo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've had some beta-testing help so it isn't full of major bugs (well, it is, but not the ones you spot at first glance).
<br/>
<br/>
The big addition this time round is a re-done UI with better controls for navigating about the pages. It makes use of the new dswifi 0.3.3, so any connection bugs are all my own work ;-) Fuller details of the changes here:

<br/>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/quirkysoft/wiki/BunjallooChangelog" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/quirkysoft/wiki/BunjallooChangelog</a>
<br/>
<br/>
As this is a devver's forum, I'll add a note about the actual coding here, in case anyone is interested: First of all I'd just like to say - what a nightmare writing sodding GUI widgets is! :-) My design for the GUI library ("BWT" - Bunjalloo Widget Toolkit... naff, eh?) is semi-inspired by Java's Swing library, but in mini-minature. This sort of OO design seemed the only reasonably sane way to go, but it requires a fair amount of discipline to not add nasty hacks (which I've fallen into temptation and added several times). I already had a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller" target="_blank">MVC</a> thing going on for the HTML Document(M) -&gt; Rendering/input(V) -&gt; Controller(C), so this release is aimed at rewriting most of the "V" part. There have been changes in the "C" part too, mostly fixing the annoying "unable to load" gaffs. The "M" part is pretty stable for 0.3, if somewhat incomplete. But if I'd known how much work was involved to get a DS web browser to do *anything* I probably wouldn't have bothered. It's a bit late now..
<br/>
<br/>
BTW it's only known to work on my particular EZF5 and my particular US-import old-skool phat DS (with 2 dead pixels; one green, one blue). It uses all the latest mod cons - DLDI, libfat, dswifi, etc - but it's all pot luck and no doubt won't work on whatever hardware you happen to be using. If it does, nice one! but if not, there ain't much I can do I'm afraid.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But could you check the keyboard a little, dunno if it's just me but it feels sticky, when i press a key it lags to release after i release the screen. It sometimes double type some characters, what's annoying. And makes hard to type long URLs.
<br/>
Don't know if is just me or my DS, DSOrganize's keyboard works nice.
<br/>
The keyrepeat also is a bit fast, and would be cool to have a CLICK sound with each key stroke.

My problem is that I have my routers ssid masked so that it can't be seen, but it works fine with all retail games and has never worked with any of my homebrew wifi apps. is there any way you can improve it to support that, also does it support images? maybe it wuld be cool to have a mode where it can be held like a book.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right.  Commercial games have Nintendo's own Wifi code in them, which tends to be more compatible in various situations.  For instance, I bought the Opera DS browser specifically so I could connect to a wireless network that has a hidden SSID, as I could not connect to it via homebrew.  There's a chance the homebrew library could be updated to support them, but it depends on who is able and willing to work on it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Not sure why the private subnet thing's a problem - I test it against my own local web server occasionally no problem. Might be a port thing though, I'll check that (i.e. 192.168.2.100:8000/index.html links to just "index2.html" -&gt; loses the port info)
<br/>
<br/>
Odd, it does blink here on my phat DS. I think that bit dswifi handles automagically. Do any other online DS homebrew things flash the power light? And if you close the lid what happens?
<br/>
<br/>
As for the images... memory is a hassle. Perhaps a "not resized when clicked" or something. No download-and-save-of-images is a regression too, so you can't even save the xkcd files and view them offline with something else.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the other bugs: nintendomax is a gzip problem (it sends me the site zipped, as I request, but then I screw up the inflating and just sit there passing 0 bytes to everyone). I'll see if I can sort that out. the other 2 seem to load on the SDL build, maybe I run out of mem on the DS? That'd be a bit lame.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone had any amazing disappearing files? I got a bug report that some files go missing "randomly"... nice. I totally can't reproduce that, so I assume it's a dodgy fat/dldi driver thing. sigh.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can hardly believe that no one else is publicizing this browser anymore... it's definitely more stable and quicker than the DSO integrated one.  Anyhow, here's the changes from 0.7.1 and 0.7.2:
<br/>
<br/>
Changes 0.7.2:
<br/>
<br/>
Update code for devkitARM r24
<br/>
Italian localisation courtesy of Paolo Ferraresi
<br/>
Automatic DLDI patching of downloaded NDS files from within zips no longer works. I'll remove the option in the next release. I can no longer test patching, as my card's firmware auto patches anyway. If this is a feature you really need... er.. sorry!
<br/>
<br/>
Changes 0.7.1:
<br/>
<br/>
Fix url parsing stuff so Google Images searches show
<br/>
Added \ to the keyboard
<br/>
Add ABXY functions (A=URL, B=Stop, X=edit config, Y=Bookmark)
<br/>
Add left-right handedness switch for d-pad and ABXY
<br/>
Fix for  issue 74 , bookmarks have incorrect title

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, that's probably my fault for not releasing a new version since 0.7.2. The problem is that with the DSi out, it seems a bit silly to keep writing a browser. Its version of Opera is pretty good.
<br/>
<br/>
At this point I think the most likely catalyst for a new release would be if someone posted a way to access DSi-only features, like reading the photos from the internal memory. But there has been a real lack of progress on that front. The DSi doesn't seem to have caught on too well, at least not in the homebrew world.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well the main advantage over the DSi of a homebrew browser is being thoerticaly able to download stuff to the card right?

<br/>
As for the DSi/Homebrew, Id guess it will take another year to get the ball rolling as regards to homebrew.

Key people probably need to get one before they will start tinkering, and there isnt a massive incentive to get one at the mo.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --
