    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all.
<br/>
<br/>
It's been a month since I released AmplituDS, and it's time for a huge update.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
To quickly summarize the new features:
<br/>
- Fixed the garbled background present on M3 and some other cards
<br/>
- Multiple difficulty levels (mellow, normal, brutal and insane)
<br/>
- Powerups (autoblaster, freestyle, scoredoubler)
<br/>
- Support for FAT (Chishm's latest <span style="text-decoration: underline">official</span> FAT library)
<br/>
<br/>
What does this all mean? Well, first of all, the gameplay is now more similiar to the game I based this on. Second of all, you can now create your own stages. It takes some effort but it's definitely worth it. I will be creating new stages myself as well, and hopefully other people will get excited about this too, and help me out with making AmplituDS more diverse.
<br/>
<br/>
You can find all information on the website. Make sure to also read the online readme linked to, because it contains information on how to set AmplituDS up and how to use the newly available powerups and such.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all like it. :)
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">P.S.
<br/>
I made a new topic for this version, because the topic of the first version turned into a large "discussing new possible features" topic. With this version, I won't add any new features for a long time anymore, so consider this more of a final of sorts. Of course, this excludes bug fixes.</span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Dark Knight ez on Sun Oct 15, 2006 9:43 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're trying to use one of the FAT versions, you're definitely out of luck.
<br/>
Chishm's latest official FAT library supports the following devices:
<br/>
<br/>
(write &amp; read)
<br/>
GBA MoviePlayer CF
<br/>
Neoflash MK2 and MK3
<br/>
SuperCard CF
<br/>
M3 Adapter CF
<br/>
<br/>
(read only)
<br/>
SuperCard SD 
<br/>
M3 Adapter SD 
<br/>
EFA 2
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you're using the non-media versions and it doesn't work either, then I blame MMP. As far as I know, on other cards those versions work perfectly.
<br/>
Let me know which version you tried to use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as I understand, Chishm's latest official FAT library supports SuperCard SD with read-only.
<br/>
That means you should be able to use the AmplituDS version which supports FAT and saves to SRAM.
<br/>
If you use the QPC method, the save should be fine.
<br/>
<br/>
If the Rein FAT driver supports write for SuperCard SD as well, the only advantage would be that the savefile is a file in the amplituds folder. 
<br/>
Currently, when you'd use the SRAM version and use the QPC method, you'd still have the save, only in a different location (in the standard location for save files, instead of in the amplituds folder).
<br/>
<br/>
To me, this advantage is so small that I have no desire to also release other builds with other drivers.
<br/>
I will release the source code of this latest version of AmplituDS as well though, so people can make versions for other devices as well if they so desire.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's because you probably haven't downloaded the premium package and installed that in a folder called "amplituds" on the root of your media.
<br/>
Like I <span style="text-decoration: underline">explicitly</span> mentioned several times, check the online readme on how to set up the game.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lyptt:
<br/>
The online readme should give you a clue as to how to play. Check the website.

Alternatively, you could check out FAQs (and videos) on the game this is based on: Amplitude.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I myself do not like the Freestyle powerup.  Not only do I know fully understand what it does and how it works, but I feel like a retard rubbing the screen with my knuckle.

<br/>
AmplituDS v2 can only use IT files. I know Marfitude creates layouts automatically, but for various reasons I cannot support those created layouts. I was working on my own converter some time ago, but with dissapointing results. I might have another go at that converter, but not in the first upcoming months, I'm afraid. Plus, nothing can beat layouts created by hand. ;p
<br/>
<br/>
@strager:
<br/>
One more level is coming up, already working on it. It'll take me some time, but hopefully I'll have the new level next month or so. The creator of the new piece of music is tssf (who also created the Turrican remix), and he has done a superb job once more.
<br/>
About the freestyle powerup... you can only succeed or fail. Success will net you 50 points (no increase of multiplier), failure will make you get 0 points and also lose your multiplier. Succeeding is quite easy though. No need to go all crazy on the screen. Just make sure you're using the entire screen.
<br/>
1100 points in mellow, eh? I believe that's quite good, maybe almost a perfect score on that track? Good job. You should definitely go for normal. :)
<br/>
<br/>
@Devel_Spawn #2:
<br/>
I could... but am reluctant to. You see, once you get to insane mode and you try to use Y, X and A for shooting, you'll probably end up not performing really well. One finger to handle all those buttons that fast is not advisable, probably also bad with cramped fingers (and RSI) in mind. I advise you to try and use L, X and R for shooting...
<br/>
I do see now how - if you're using Y, X and A for shooting - it would be nice to switch tracks with L and R instead of with the D-Pad.
<br/>
<br/>
@Bkid:
<br/>
Did you try the non-media versions yet? Both available stages have their own non-media .nds file which I put in one zip-file. Please try those out. (You might need to prepend a loader to make it .ds.gba, but I don't know how Max Media Player generally starts up NDS homebrew.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For the first couple of months, I'm only willing to work on bugfixes. I also don't want to create all kinds of options which could confuse users (even more ;p).

I assume you mean to create the track layouts. Retrohead made a nice <span style="font-weight: bold">mock-up</span> for that. <span style="font-weight: bold">Mock-up</span>, mind you. <span style="font-weight: bold">Not</span> real. I really want to make that clear. Here's the picture:
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
It does look nice, but know this:
<br/>
1) It would not add any functionality over the direct use of the textfiles. It looks fancier, but chances are you'd be working just as long on a layout as you would without it.
<br/>
2) I'm not willing to code this on Windows (or any other platform) myself. If someone is willing to create such an application, I'd be happy to provide details, suggestions or answer any questions but nothing more.
<br/>
<br/>
Considering point #1, it'd be more productive if I gave my automatic layout creation another shot. That will have to wait a couple of months though, and I might be unable to get it to create good layouts... So don't build your hopes up for that to arrive anytime soon (or at all).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Download a tracker such as Modplug Tracker. ( <a href="http://www.modplug.com" target="_blank">http://www.modplug.com</a> )
<br/>
This will help you to "view" BPM, and how the entire music file is put together.
<br/>
<br/>
The section called amplitrack should also help you out, but that only covers on what AmplituDS needs and not how you can obtain (or create) such data.

<br/>
<br/>
And last but not least, a PM to me with your MSN name in it, so I can walk you through the process (only if you're serious about creating a stage) and give you more advice when needed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try prepending a loader to the amplituds.nds file.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are using Windows, put the amplituds.nds file and this file <a href="http://down.7mc.org/ds/flashme/ndsloader.bin" target="_blank">http://down.7mc.org/ds/flashme/ndsloader.bin</a> in C:\ (not in a subfolder).
<br/>
Then go to the Start menu, and choose Run.
<br/>
Then type in "cmd" and press Enter.
<br/>
<br/>
In the new window, type the following
<br/>
copy /b ndsloader.bin + amplituds.nds amplituds.ds.gba
<br/>
and press Enter.
<br/>
Now there should be another file in C:\ which is called amplituds.ds.gba and hopefully that one should work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have the same problem. I think you should add 2 control methods:
<br/>
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>L R and Y control shooting with X, A or B as power up
<br/>
</li><li>X A and Y control shooting with L R or B as power up</li></ol>
<br/>
<br/>
What do you think? Though you would probably need to rework the options menu with that sample i sent you that time to make more room for the new control option ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I dare you. ;p Seriously though, I think it's cool you're into the game as much as you are. Keep it up.

<br/>
@Pikanya
<br/>
<br/>
I updated the downloads so they work better with starting up. Hopefully this will fix your problem. Download the new nds-file from the website (same link as you used for your current nds-file). Make sure you get the newest version this time, which includes both a .nds and a .ds.gba version in the zip-file. Let me know how things work out.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
edit:
<br/>
@Retro
<br/>
You posting at the same time as me at several boards. Heh. ;p
<br/>
I do see how that could be a (small) improvement.
<br/>
Wouldn't it be better to leave all your "shooting-fingers" where they are though, and use D-Pad up or down to activate power-ups (B-button remaining the same)?
<br/>
I really think that if you're in a pattern, trying to hit all the targets properly is really, really hard if you need to shift one of your "shooting-fingers" to another button.
<br/>
And take in mind that Turrican's and SMB's insane are probably not going to be the hardest layouts for AmplituDS there will be.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Up and Down could work but you would have to make it !=diagonals as you can easily press those when in the heat of the action and completely at the wrong time.
<br/>
<br/>
That is my only fear of the Up / Down scenario is accidental use. The benefits  of X or A button as power up is that A or X are easier to reach without moving your thumb as far. A button from the Y button requires just a simple bend difference in the thumb.

After figuring out what the point was, I still have a hard time with the three-button layout.  I'm okay on left/middle or middle/right, but switching hurts my chi.  
<br/>
<br/>
Any chance of big buttons or other input options on touchscreen, or is it too slow/inaccurate?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#107167 - Dark Knight ez - Fri Oct 27, 2006 10:30 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I suggest you use the following controls:
<br/>
use L-trigger for shooting left targets
<br/>
use X-button for shooting mid targets
<br/>
use R-button for shooting right targets
<br/>
<br/>
That will make sure you don't have to switch buttons with your fingers, but that you can rest them on the required buttons.
<br/>
<br/>
Use D-Pad left and right to move the vessel.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, using the touchscreen isn't the best way to play this game (unless played in low difficulty settings). Lifting the stylus from the screen and putting it down in another place just isn't fast enough for brutal and insane difficulties, and it's hard to do right in normal difficulty. Pressing 3 seperate buttons with 3 seperate fingers is a lot easier (above control scheme).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
