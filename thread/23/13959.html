    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have recently bought a Supercard Rumble (sd)+Superkey+Corsair 2 Gb sd card.
<br/>
<br/>
I have loaded moonshell 1.7 onto it and when I start up my ds and select the SCSD moonshell .nds file the screen goes white. I have tried all the other .nds files but the same thing happens.
<br/>
<br/>
I really want moonshell 1.7 running on my ds 
<br/>
<br/>
Any help appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, which is why I said that it was fine if it said either FAT16 or FAT, as they are the same.

The Supercard DS does, but the slot-2 Supercards must use FAT16.

<br/>
Yeah, that's my best guess at the moment as well. 
<br/>
<br/>
Actually hold up, wait a sec.  I remember now that there was once an issue with homebrew programs built in DevKitARM r20 not launching from the Supercard Rumble menu at all, so you had to use Moonshell 1.61 to launch them.  Moonshell 1.71 was built with r20, so it too fell victim to this.  The latest firmware however (1.82) should fix this issue.  Hold L+R upon bootup to see what firmware you have.  
<br/>
<br/>
The order of firmwares is 1.63 -&gt; 1.7 -&gt; 1.80 -&gt; 1.81 -&gt; 1.82
<br/>
Upgrade in order, and do not skip steps.  The 1.80 upgrade file is not on the English main site, so you can get it from <a href="http://romnet.co.uk/ffm/" target="_blank">http://romnet.co.uk/ffm/</a> (which despite the name appears to be 100% piracy-free from what I can tell).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
To upgrade, just put the UPGRADE.SCU file on the root of your card and boot up.  It will prompt you to upgrade, after which point you can replace the file with the one for the next firmware update.
<br/>
<br/>
To check your SD card for corruption, put it in your card reader.  Go to My Computer and right-click the drive, clicking Properties.  Go to the Tools tab, click Check Now, and select only the first checkbox and hit Okay.  Then check your card to see if any files are missing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
When I say check to see if any files are missing, I mean just that.  Look through and see if there are any games or files that have gone missing as a result of the card checking.  Corrupt files usually go into a "FOUND000" folder on the root of your card, but this is a system folder, so you'd have to go into Folder Options and specifically change a couple of options in order to see it.  Then the files inside it don't have distinguishable names, so it's very difficult to identify specific files that have been moved there due to corruption.  It would probably be simpler to just have you manually check your card and see if you need to add any files back onto it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
