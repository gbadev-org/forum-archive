Unfortunately, not all of them in Illinois do, but a lot of them do.  The one I frequent the most doesn't carry it.  But I visit enough of them to have found one. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I don't think the compatibility of the GnM is all that bad, it's just slow.  I think the main problem people have is because there are two DLDI drivers available, and the v2 makes you "think" it will speed up the card.  If you stick with version 1, you should be fine.  If your in a hurry, spend more then $20 and get something else.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
