    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys. For my 3rd year Comp Sci project (and an excuse to learn C programming), I've been trying to create a racing game for the Nintendo DS. I haven't done much programming before this (a few Java examples in my 1st year and Visual Basic in college). Not much has been implemented when compared to what I wanted and it's REALLY SIMPLE, at the moment it's just a ship which can be moved along a single track, but hopefully I aim to one day evolve this into a full game! I'd like some criticism and thoughts, keeping in mind that I've never programmed anything properly before and that this is my first real foray into coding and game development :)
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. If you mind me using your reply for evaluation purposes in my project, please let me know and I won't use it!!
<br/>
<br/>
Download Futuristic Racer 0.0.1:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.MegaShare.com/580264" target="_blank">http://www.MegaShare.com/580264</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Controls:
<br/>
<br/>
Ship Selection Screen:
<br/>
* Left and Right - Select Ship
<br/>
* A - Confirm Selection
<br/>
<br/>
Main Game:
<br/>
<br/>
* Y - Accelerate
<br/>
* B - Brake
<br/>
* A - Manual Grip
<br/>
* L - Strafe Left
<br/>
* R - Strafe Right
<br/>
* Left and Right - Turn
<br/>
* Select - Reset ship position
<br/>
* Start - Render Skybox On/Off (With the skybox on, you can see the graphical direction I was going for, but not the track ;) I'll fix this later)
<br/>
<br/>
Points:
<br/>
<br/>
* A box is rendered to show the direction that the ship is moving in.
<br/>
* ManualGrip defines whether or not the ship will attempt to counteract the ship moving in a direction away from where it's nose is pointing. Will be useful in the future for turning at sharp edges in hairpin turns without slowing right down. Play around with it when not accelerating!
<br/>
<br/>
Problems:
<br/>
<br/>
* The track can't be seen when the skybox is being rendered.
<br/>
* The camera jerks sometimes, will be fixed.
<br/>
* Sometimes when the ship falls off the track and replaced on it, it doesn't get rotated properly and starts jerking. For the moment reset with Select.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Rajveer on Sat Jan 31, 2009 5:10 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

Very impressive for first project.  I see the palib icon on the menu. Did you use any other tools?
<br/>
<br/>
Looks great.  3d feel is satisfying.  I get good sense of speed even in this early build.  
<br/>
<br/>
I had fun trying to flipping the ship off the track, tryng to see the graphic on the side of the blue ship.  Will you release the source in the future?
<br/>
<br/>
A basic timer or finish line would be satisfying too.

Yeah, I hated this about the new Kirby on DS (the name escapes me...)
<br/>
So they have A and B on the NES controllers;
<br/>
SNES controllers have them switched, so they make B=A and Y=B;
<br/>
N64 and Gamecube move them back to their NES positions;
<br/>
DS adopts SNES style buttons, yet many games still use A and B as original functions, what gives?

That is exactly the reason why you (should) implement keypad layout configurations, different people prefer different key configurations. Making your game likeable by more people is always the best way to create a successful game.<br/>_________________<br/>Private property.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks to all you guys for the replies and support, nothing better for a first time programmer than support! I'll definately be continuing work on this project after university exams are over.
<br/>
<br/>
@Devil_Spawn: Thanks! :-D
<br/>
<br/>
@HyperHacker: I guess the controls were setup for how I found them easiest during testing, but I see there is no general favorite control scheme so I'll implement configurable controls!
<br/>
<br/>
@xler8: Cheers for the kind words! I did use PALib but only for text output (guess I find it easier for debugging!) I used Sausage Boy's TexMex 0.04 (highly recommended!) for texture conversion and created MAXscripts for exporting levels and 3d models. I will eventually release the source code, although I don't think it's anything "pretty" right now ;)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I am a new user here, right from Italy. I own a NDS Lite with R4 and a 4GB Sandisk MicroSD. I registered here first of all because I seen this project... I tried this demo, it's really good, I think it would be a fantastic HB at the end of the project! I will be pleased to help with the graphics, I'm quite good with simple 3d models and with Photoshop CS. If you need help with 2D and 3D graphics, I'm here to help, but I can't speak a word in C programming... Go on with the project!
<br/>
PS: Rajveer, you have a PM!
<br/>
EDIT: Wow, I find a nice bug!!!! When jumping, try to press down on D-Pad so your ship is upside-down, then land on the track. The ship starts to jerk, and it won't be controllable until you rotate the ship correctly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Look at these images: they are two tracks I made, maybe they can be added in the game!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is a really fun racing engine.  I totally like the way you can drift around a turn rotating your vehicle and then hit the accelerator to boost out of it.  I guess this is an aspect of the Manual Grip system you mentioned.  It's excellent and really has me wanting to keep playing the demo even as simple as it is.
<br/>
<br/>
This game absolutely MUST be continued beyond the current demo state.  A lot of school projects get abandoned, but hopefully this won't be one of them.  If you end up too busy to work on the design elements, I hope you will release the source so that someone else can continue it.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything you think can be done to increase the draw distance, by the way?
