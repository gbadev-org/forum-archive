Straight from Gorgull's website

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote"> DScratch is the first module made using Protein engine - it's a little audio manipulation software running on DS which ables you to play with an existing .wav file or recorded audio sample; you can pitch it, scratch it, rewind, mute and apply effects on it. Moreover, DScratch sends MIDI through wifi connection, which ables you to control external applications, like a VJing software as I do. 
<br/>
<br/>
FEATURES:
<br/>
load .wav file or live-recorded audio
<br/>
scratch 
<br/>
pitch control
<br/>
FX "Retrig" 
<br/>
FX "DownSampling" 
<br/>
Midi OUT (wireless)
<br/>
stylus control 
<br/>
NDSMotion control </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Right now, the devoptab doesn't provide an API for applications to determine how much space is left on the card. So I don't see this happening until at least devkitARM R21, when it's rumored that statvfs() will be added to devoptab and libfat.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Do you mean you overwrite the original sample with a sound-editor?

Did you try using an original sample, or what do you mean with save quality settings? ...Just curious

About the mic to DS connection:

Basically I bought a basic NDS headset (10euros online), cut it, and plugged one stereo mini-jack for line-out, and one mono mini-jack for line-in.

<br/>
<br/>
It seems there's a problem :-p
<br/>
<br/>
Could you tell me the exact situation you get the program crashing/freezing? 
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think the problem comes from the file browser (since it's a really simple module), but I'd rather suspect the paused [DScratch] module still running in background... 
<br/>
<br/>
Does the problem occur when triggering filebrowser after a wav sample playback or mic streaming mode?
<br/>
<br/>
Another question: is the sample still running properly when freezed? (which would mean the audio engine's not frozen)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

but found a different reproducible bug:

<br/>
if the looper isn't stopped before launching the browser to load a new sample, there is a load pop when the new sample finishes loading (and it shows in the top screen oscilliscope).  I think the browser launch code needs to clear the audio buffer before loading up the sample.  there's just a little bit of the previous sample left in the play buffer when the loading of the new sample is done.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

can you post the images/diagram, etc. of your wiring setup for the mic i/o?  i'd like to set up a mic/instrument input as well.  is it just a line-level input, or does that port on the ds next to the headphone jack supply power to electret mics?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In fact, I spent my protein coding time working on a real .wav player (a bit tricky!) and fixing bugs - there's no new effect for the moment, but I'm thinking about enhancing the bitcrusher for the next release.

I think it's hard to code, but one thing could be great : midi sync with music app's on the computer, via Wifi (with DSMidiWifi).
<br/>
<br/>
With this feature, i'll can synchronise my scratches with my music. I would be great ! I saw you've got a "beat repeat" function on DScratch, I think it will be better if it's synchronized to music background.
<br/>
<br/>
I know that it's hard to program, but I use my DS more than a game, I use it more on a musical way : and I speak english like an illiterate pig, I guess.

I've got tons of ideas and experiments left in my backpack, and I never feel like my work is "ready" - however I really wanted a version to be available for my birthday!

WavePlayer:
<br/>
<br/>
In DScratch, I replaced my old SoundPlayer (which loads the wav file fully in RAM), with my brand new WavePlayer which streams the wav file from the cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
As the .wav file are now read as it's played (= streaming), the length is no more a limitation - the limitation now comes from the cartridge.

Might it have to do with the so-called "canonical WAVE format" (only header chunk is 'fmt') vs. extra optional header chunks? If you want to rule this out, you might want to try running a wave file through <a class="postlink" href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">SoX</a> to see if it comes out clean.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Just out of curiosity:

<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: It works but it's unbelievably slow.  It's taken 6 minutes to convert 30 seconds of mp3!
<br/>
EDIT2: Madplay is included in the official builds and converts from mp3 to wav, still takes a while though
<br/>

<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Any chance of getting a binary for SoX or a DSLinux patch?  I'd be interested in having it available on my DS if needed, even if mp3 conversion is slow.  Thanks for the madplay commands though; I wasn't even aware it could do conversions at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
