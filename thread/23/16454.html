This one's for me!!
<br/>
If other folk enjoy it, then so be it, but I made this for myself because I was getting really ticked off by the lack of decent crossword games* on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
There's 3479 crosswords in the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Each one's selectable from the very uninteresting title screen, and playable whenever you want.
<br/>
<br/>
Pick a level, play it, done.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to save midway, hit start to return to the menu, then quit.  When you come back, it should be right where you left it.
<br/>
Only one save is available, though.  It only saves the last puzzle you were playing.
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, it's nice and simple.
<br/>
Reds show up where you've got a letter wrong, and nothing fancy when you're right.
<br/>
<br/>
There's no "COMPLETE!!!!!" screen.
<br/>
If you've got it all right, you should be able to tell... it's a crossword!!
<br/>
<br/>
So, enjoy it for what it is.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* Not that the crossword games on the DS don't have good crosswords.. They do.. It's just that stupid UI that they all use is really really really rubbish..<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://AGameAWeek.com" target="_blank">A Game A Week.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Uwe linked me to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.fernuni-hagen.de/mathinf/studium/lehre/praktika/programmierpraktikum/2008_2009_ws_kreuzwortraetsel.shtml" target="_blank">this page</a>, where they hold some data files from an old Freeware German Crossword game, ?Kreuzwortr?tsel 2005"
<br/>
<br/>
I'm about 98% sure I managed to decypher it ok, and have recompiled a bunch of puzzles, using those German Clues and Answers.
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://socoder.net/uploads/1/crosswords_german_jxw.zip" target="_blank">This file</a> contains the new .jxw file.
<br/>
Pop it into the jxw/ folder, and rename it to crosswords.jxw, so that the game loads that instead of the English one.
<br/>
Then play the game, and it'll be in German for you.
<br/>
<br/>
Note : Although I made sure that all the answers are Plain Letters (ie, work with the keyboard!), there might be instances where the clues end up in bizarre gobbledygook,  because they might use odd characters or something.  It should still display ok, but I didn't fancy going through 200+ puzzles to check!!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Homebrew sites that decide to "NEWS!" this, should do all the hard work, and <span style="font-weight: bold">then</span> have a different download, specifically ready for folk, in German.
<br/>
If I add any more languages, I'll probably end up having a different frontend, with selectable languages, or something..
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants any more languages, point me to some files, and I'll do the whole decyphering/recompiling thing for you.
