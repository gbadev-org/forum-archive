    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all,
<br/>
<br/>
I already posted this over on the devkitpro forums, but figured it might just as well be welcome here.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have ported our <a class="postlink" href="http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=54489" target="_blank">original PC-based musicdisk</a> to the NDS. The musicdisk features 26 songs in a mixture of streaming (.ogg) and various module (.mod/.xm) formats, with nifty visualizers running at a full 60fps. Sound quality is extremely good when using headphones or earphones (the internal speakers are OK, but not great).
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't use maxmod as I have my own replay code, and I had to make some custom additions to the ARM7 side, but we finally got it done.  :) Next year we'll try to do a simultaneous PC/NDS release.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks goes to WinterMute and the libnds team for providing the low-level libraries and a libtremor port that worked flawlessly the first time! \o/
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Silly me, I forgot the download link.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
