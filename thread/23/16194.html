    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. This is my first post here and it is also my first homebrew.
<br/>
Here is DexterDS. It's a pokedex for the DS from a pokemon fan perspective. Therefore it does not include where to catch or different descriptions for each game. Let me know what you think.
<br/>
<br/>
Kanto Edition:
<br/>
151 pokemon
<br/>
search function fully implemented
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i think it's a pretty fun project.   There was a pokedex released for the psp (!) that was pretty good, if you need inspiration, check that one out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#164537 - benjifs - Thu Nov 06, 2008 2:05 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well this doesnt use a database mainly because of the problems with people messing around with it and stuff. Its basically just imaged based since the font was way too small for the look i wanted. It's just alot of work getting everything there thats why it takes so long.
<br/>
I'm also a pokemon fan. since it first came out. I'm 20. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have seen the pokedex for psp. I thought it was good but unless it was developed by the same person its almost an exact copy of one that was released for pc. I still have that one in my computer and when i saw the psp version i thought they were way too alike.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going for more of a actual game look pokedex. What I'm thinking of adding once I'm done with all the pokemon is when you touch on a pokemon in the evolution you go to that pokemon. This might help if you're in pichu which is number 172 and want to get to pikachu number 25. 
<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime if anyone has any suggestions, features or bugs just let me know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes dont worry. This will be implemented. I dont know if all of it but I will do something like if you type BULB it'll go to bulbasaur.

Yes image based makes it harder to update but other than that there shouldnt be any problems. I mean you still have to go through the trouble of gathering info, sprites, making it all the right format. I chose to do it this way just because it was the only way i figured out to make it look nicer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry I haven't updated in a while. I had midterms and then thanksgiving break and all so didnt get time to work on it. I'll release the Kanto edition by the end of next week. It'll have 151 pokemons and all the features already implemented.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
