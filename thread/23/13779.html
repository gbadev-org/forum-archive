Features are Dual Slot Copying, Pasting, and Deleting, soon to be Renaming if Wintermute and Chishm get DevKitARM working with rename().  I've redone the interface to fully use two screens, but the keyboard does nothing as of now.  It's implemented but commented out because Renaming doesn't work yet.

The GBAMP works, I've also heard the SuperCard CF works, but I doubt the newer SuperCard Lite or M3 Lite or whatever (obviously I'm not up on my new Slot-2's lol, I like my GBAMP the way it is).  Check the libfat topic that Chishm posted to see if your slot 2 is internally compatible with libfat (otherwise, sorry, but it's impossible...and it's not my fault, the libfat library only allows one DLDI to be patched...you can always beg Chishm to change that but I don't know how successful that'd be).<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Some Feedback:
<br/>
<br/>
Copies flawlessly using my R4 and my Gbamp. But, why does both Filelists only show up if I open DSFile in my Slot 1 Card ? If I open it up using my Gbamp then it just shows the Gba Listing...
<br/>
<br/>
Requests:
<br/>
<br/>
What about an option so we can copy WHOLE Folders ?
<br/>
<br/>
Or something that let's us unzip (or maybe even unrar ) our .rar or .zip archives ?
<br/>
( for .zip extracting just ask lucas (DS Ipod ) he may help you with it, because I know that his and lick's DS Ipod clone uses zip extracting to load the skins)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.petitiononline.com/blizzds/petition.html" target="_blank">Starcraft DS ?</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by pas on Wed Aug 08, 2007 11:06 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I've made the interface a lot smoother, and there's a keyboard but as of now it's a nice decoration, since Wintermute informed me that Renaming support is broken in DevKitARM and there isn't an update to fix it yet.  Typing and renaming is implemented, but with the current devkit it crashes your DS, so I disabled it.  Here's a pic.

If I knew how to set up the displays and draw a background (preferably a PAlib easybg, already converted, but I can always convert to a different format if need be) and sprites and 16c text.  Or if you can do a tiled text on top of a bg in libnds.  I assume all the file code would be the same, and the arrays and strings the same, the pad input is different though.
