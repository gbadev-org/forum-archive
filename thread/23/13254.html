    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From the company that made that game Trogdor, and that game Rabbit Algebra, comes a graphical video game of reasonably large proportions.
<br/>
<br/>
Everyone's played the Videlectrix hit game, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/pop_tire.html" target="_blank">Population: Tire</a>, and now is your chance to play this classic on your DS!
<br/>
<br/>
The game adapts well to the DS, played with the touchscreen, and a two-screen-tall play area. Sure, it's annoying when a Cold One is thrown at your tire on the top screen, where there's nothing you can do about it, but it wouldn't be a fun game without a challenge!
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrphlip.com/ds/pop_tire/" target="_blank">Get it! You know you want to!</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Doesn't need DLDI or anything like that... everything's in the .nds file, just dump it on your DS and away you go.
<br/>
<br/>
This is my first DS homebrew project, so be gentle, but comments and criticism are welcome.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope to eventually remake more of the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Videlectrix#Playable" target="_blank">Videlectrix catalogue</a>... Pigs on Head will probably be next, then maybe Trogdor...
<br/>
Stinkoman 20X6 would be great, but a lot of work... and I'd have to learn a lot more about DS coding than I know now...<br/>_________________<br/>&lt;link rel="signature" type="text/hilarious" href="/funnysig.txt" /&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great game. Plays well on the R4/Supercard SD.
<br/>
The only issue I can comment on is that the fence "sprite" is displayed half way up the flag pole and is half the size of the original flash game sprite. I noticed on your web site that all the graphics seem to be in order in the gameplay photos. I guess this is an R4/supercard problem.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you were to do Stinkoman20X6 you would of course support the XML custom levels wouldn't you? :)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

Oops, my mistake...
<br/>
I did some tests, trying to get the fence to appear properly in Dualis, gave up, and forgot to change it back before uploading it...
<br/>
<br/>
Should be fixed now.

Yeah, it was hard to fit him in... but if I halve his size, then he's <span style="font-style: italic">tiny</span>, and anywhere in between looks ugly with scaling artefacts. I guess I could have redrawn him from scratch, rather than copying the original pixels, but... meh.

Scale him on the PC using decent resampling (not nearest-neighbor) and edit out the (already less apparent) artifacts.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Bah... one of these days I'll get the hang of actually testing my release builds before releasing them...
<br/>
<br/>
Right, this is fixed, along with another glitch I found if you run it from DSChannels... certain stuff I assumed was inited to 0s wasn't. Now it is.

You could also try the "Supercard Magic Homebrew Patcher" program, which checks for the existence of such a header and adds one if it's not present.  Just drag and drop the file onto scmhp.exe and it should spit out a working *.sc.nds file.  Granted, it sometimes places the output file several levels above where it should be (gets placed on my desktop if the original program is inside a folder on my desktop) and it sometimes has a weird output name, but it's usable.
<br/>
<br/>
Like phlip said though, renaming the *.ds.gba version to *.sc.nds should also work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, I used a flash decompiler to look at the original... a lot of it is redone from scratch though, and tweaked... since the timing and the scale are different (12fps vs 60fps, 550x400 vs 256x464), it's hard to copy much exactly... but yes, I did use the code to the original as a reference.
<br/>
<br/>
Ditto for the graphics... all the pixelly graphics in Flash are just shapes with rectangular edges on them... they're not real bitmaps, since Flash would automatically interpolate them, which'd spoil the effect. Now, as a result, they're not always actual pixels...
<br/>
Many of them are... in fact, there's things that were obviously drawn as pixels first... clues, like The Cheat being exactly 32 pixels wide, the balloon is exactly 16 pixels wide, Strong Sad exactly 64...
<br/>
But if you look at the Tire in the original, the light grey shiny bit doesn't line up with the pixels, and it grows and shrinks as it rolls, by a fraction of a pixel. The bird and the flag, too, don't quite line up.
<br/>
Worst is the Videlectrix guy... when he leans up to give the thumbs-up, if you look closely, his head's obviously been cut off in an image editor and rotated a bit, after it was pixelated... the pixel lines go at an angle...
<br/>
<br/>
Random fact: the colour of the liquid that comes out of the Cold One bottles when you smash them, in the DS's 16-bit A555 format, is 0xB33F, which could be seen as dodgy 1337 for "beer".
