    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It was a while that I didn't update my puzzle game <span style="font-weight: bold">Setsuzoku no Puzzle</span>. The goal is to remove all the tiles on the screen by connecting two tiles that have the same color and the same symbol. The link between the two tiles can have at most two corners.

<br/>
The version 0.2 is now <a class="postlink" href="http://stravingo.over-blog.fr" target="_blank">available on my blog</a>, featuring major improvements:
<br/>
<br/>
- I have received many comments about how difficult is the game. Now, there is more time to complete the first levels to be easier for beginners, but the time speeds up at each level.
<br/>
<br/>
- When you quickly remove several pairs of tiles, you gain more points thanks to a combo system: when the combo progress bar fills up, instead of gaining only one point when removing a pair of tiles, you can gain 2 points, 3 points, 4 points or 5 points. The progress bar fills up when the time between two removals is less than 3 seconds. Else, the progress bar gradually empty.
<br/>
<br/>
- You can pause the game by closing the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
- A the end of each level, the remaining time and remaining number of helps are added to the score.
<br/>
<br/>
- The 100 best scores are now saved (you need to DLDI patch the game).
<br/>
<br/>
- You can send your scores on leaderboard.palib.info to compare your skill with other players worldwide (beware of my sister Eglantine ^^)
<br/>
<br/>
- You don't loose anymore when there is no more possible moves. Now, the remaining tiles are randomly moved so that you can finish the game.
<br/>
<br/>
- More user friendly as you can use the stylus in the various menu screens, highscore screens, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
- More sound fx.
<br/>
<br/>
- Some graphical enhancements (special fx, removal of magenta pixels at the edge of sprites, etc.)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://stravingo.over-blog.fr/" target="_blank">My games (<span style="font-weight: bold">Ka-BoOm</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Setsuzoku no Puzzle</span>) and apps (<span style="font-weight: bold">DS Weather Report</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Treasures of Gaia</span>) on DS are available on my blog!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

However, I wish you could consider altering the palette of the game pieces. I'm a red/green color blind myself and somehow all the good puzzle games around seem to use lot of red and green tones.
<br/>
<br/>
Concrete suggestions:
<br/>
- Have colors that may get mixed to use always different shapes (star, moon, cross, whatever you're using) - in fact even for the non-color blind players it may be useful if color matches a single figure.
<br/>
- Broaden up the palette, perhaps including more blue, violet or other darker colors that can be easily distinguished from the others. Or orange... there's lot of colors to choose from.
<br/>
<br/>
8-12% of the male population in Europe has some form of color blindness, so possibly someone else might like an update on this. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, having played 0.2 for a while now, I agree with tepples' comment about the difficulty. In v0.1 I could get to about level 5/6, sometimes 8 if I was lucky. I can now get to about level 18. :) It starts to get a bit samey after a while. The sense of urgency from the first version as the clock races down is missing as it's taking a long time to get there.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could have a time attack mode - 2 minutes, 4 minutes, 6 minutes etc. where you just have to get the highest score - using the difficulty ramping system from the first version? Or maybe you could vary the board sizes - smaller boards with less time to solve them?
<br/>
<br/>
I do like the new combo system though. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Melw : I will add more different tiles in v0.4. By the way, expect a quite different design ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Tepples : yes, the game is more and more difficult as the time flows more quickly at each level.
<br/>
<br/>
Bob_fossil : time attack mode is a good idea. There is now various board sizes in the new v0.3 :-)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://stravingo.over-blog.fr/" target="_blank">My games (<span style="font-weight: bold">Ka-BoOm</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Setsuzoku no Puzzle</span>) and apps (<span style="font-weight: bold">DS Weather Report</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Treasures of Gaia</span>) on DS are available on my blog!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Out of curiosity, what kind of sound file format is used for the music? I like it and all, but it can get a tad repetitive after too long. In any case, fantastic game! Very well done and very polished.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

Given the 100 percent channel separation, it's probably a .mod derivative.
