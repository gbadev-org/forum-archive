    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everybody
<br/>
<br/>
It's surprisingly one day short of a year ago now I messed around with the Quake source "just for a weekend" and decided to show my findings in this thread:
<br/>
<a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=107263#107263" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=107263#107263</a>
<br/>
...however I didn't expect it to take this long to complete!
<br/>
<br/>
The game is now feature-complete, aside from ad-hoc wifi play (which is in the game but disabled) so I figure it's time to release it! I hope you enjoy it - it's taken an insane amount of work and the help of dozens of people to get here.
<br/>
<br/>
For full info, visit <a href="http://quake.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://quake.drunkencoders.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Notable changes:
<br/>
<ul>* The game now supports the RAM available from certain slot-2 flash cards in order to obtain near-perfect compatibility with Quake mods and total conversions. Everything I've tried works correctly, however some mods overload the DS' GPU and stuff starts to disappear...
<br/>
* Rendering performance has improved by ~30%
<br/>
* In game performance has improved by ~20%
<br/>
* All graphical effects are now drawn, included animated sprites (for explosions), and particles (eg for blood)
<br/>
* 99% of texture maps are rendered correctly
<br/>
* The sky box is now rendered correctly
<br/>
* GUI corruption has been fixed
<br/>
* Animated skins are now supported
<br/>
* The on-screen keyboard has been improved
<br/>
* Eight user-configurable quick-access touch buttons have been added
<br/>
* Pen sensitivity has been fixed and view snap disabling a la GLQuake has been added
<br/>
* QuakeC compatibility has been enhanced
<br/>
* Command line (through qdsopts.txt) is now easier
<br/>
* Sound corruption has been fixed
<br/>
* Console corruption has been fixed
<br/>
* Cut scenes and 'intervals' have been cleaned up
<br/>
* 'freeing precaches' bugs have been fixed
<br/>
* Improved support for the second Quake Mission Pack: Dissolution Of Eternity
<br/>
...and too many other fixes to list</ul>

The slot-2 build (aka the EXRAM build) is not the silver bullet that many of you hoped it would be. The #1 issue is the poor performance of this memory - when overclocked, this memory seems to have 4-5x the latency of the already-slow internal DS memory and this will of course slow down the game. I've spent many months hiding this latency, but you can still see it on some heavy levels. Quake's random access patterns to memory don't help, neither does the size of the data cache.
<br/>
Also when using this build I would *highly* recommend using a slot-1 card in conjunction with it where you keep your data files (make sure you patch it with your slot-1 DLDI driver). To know more about the EXRAM build please see <a href="http://quake.drunkencoders.com/exram.html" target="_blank">http://quake.drunkencoders.com/exram.html</a>
<br/>
If you're too lazy to read it, don't forget that you can hold 'R' during startup to force detection of your flash card and overclock your RAM :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, a big thanks go out to all the people who have given me technical help, tested the game, donated money, donated hardware or just general support :-D

BTW, am i suposed to open any port on my router so it can connect with winquake?
<br/>
I remember playing some deathmatches when the wi-fi build came out, but i formated my pc after it and reseted the router firmware also.
<br/>
Now i get "no games found" everytime i try to host a game in PC or when i host it in DS, the PC side keeps "trying" =[
<br/>
<br/>
Worth the wait none the less, QuakeDS is fantastic.
<br/>
What you say if the three builds were merged togheter? Wi-fi initializes if "multiplayer" were chosen, EXRAM would be used if it's said so, or else the game would be the normal one.
<br/>
<br/>
And could the bottom screen be customized? With a bitmap background, coordinates limiting the text output and such?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by MasterMan on Sat Oct 27, 2007 11:48 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well this is a relief, no mega problems! Release a game and go out for the day...score... :-)
<br/>
Ok,
<br/>
@devil spawn, no I would not recommend using the exram build unless you actually need it or want to see more particles. For regular Quake I'd use the normal build.
<br/>
<br/>
@theli, for some reason I spent a lot of time on the mp3/cd music playback but was too lazy too do the final work to get it properly into the game. Not enough free time or demand I guess! The code is in the game - maybe I could enable it at a later date if I get the bugs worked out? What do you think?
<br/>
<br/>
@spike, notice how that demo you couldn't run in hipnotic works now? :-)
<br/>
Thanks for the help finding that!
<br/>
<br/>
@sonny jim, it's netquake, going to qw would most likely be a mega change the code base. Tbh without someone who was very familiar with the code moving from one to the other would be a lot of work. Porting QW would just be a better option IMO!
<br/>
Btw thanks for the DS, very useful and totally improved productivity! Ad-hoc's still on-going though...
<br/>
<br/>
@sunray, that's very interesting. Do you have any other flash cards you could test it with? Which dldi do you use? Does it auto patch or what? It sounds to me like the driver is using some of my precious memory...something I don't think it's allowed to do!
<br/>
<br/>
@master man, thanks. If you're just playing on the same network you should just be able to play. The game defaults to port 26000. However playing over the Internet is something else all together. The Quake network protocol requires some kind of IP tunnel or a protocol converter to get it to run across the 'net. This a well-known problem, so have a look for it... But if you're just playing on the same network it should be dead easy to get going.
<br/>
<br/>
I did consider merging the three builds together as maintaining three is a bit of a pain. Merging the exram and regular builds wouldn't be too hard, but the wifi would be a problem. If we had some kind of DS DLL system it'd be easy, but as we don't I'd have to rig something up which meant you'd need some kind of wifi DLL with the game and I would get so many support mails if I did this from people who couldn't figure it out!
<br/>
However when I add ad-hoc adding a fourth build would just be overkill, so maybe a solution needs to be found. Not a problem for 11pm today though :-)
<br/>
Finally, no you can't customise the bottom screen. I really wanted to jazz up the eight buttons on the subscreen but VRAM is pretty much gone, and plain-ass buttons and a plain background is the best you're gonna get, sorry!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
@creebo, what was the matter on the lites that couldn't play it before? There's been an obscure bug that I got rid of that caused it to lock up on a few DS' for no reason...could be that!
<br/>
<br/>
@lazy1, I did spend quite some time diagnosing the 'getting stuck in stuff' problem as it is annoying when it happens. I'm afraid that this is (as we guessed) a problem with me going to fixed-point maths, and as a result sometimes the physics ends up in a place it wasn't expecting to!
<br/>
<br/>
@9th sage, once you change the settings for your RAM, it will test it to confirm that that it works correctly (and it will print the size of the memory that has been found - you need to confirm that it's got it correct). If it can read you RAM (ie your RAM can handle the 'clock for at least ten seconds) the game will then progress. If in fact you can't actually clock it that high, you'll get weirdo errors.
<br/>
Btw just so people know, we haven't found one supercard yet that can be overclocked.
<br/>
<br/>
@jlsoft, what does host_framerate do &lt;looks embarassed for not knowing&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
@username, you'll get this model disappearing lark on the other ones too, it's just more apparent on the exram version since quite often you'll be running really big mods. The DS can only draw so many triangles and vertices in a frame, and when you go over this (ie there are loads of monsters on the screen) stuff will start to disappear. If you look on the console there should be some letters that appear on the far-right of the bottom row when this happens. Get a 'V' and that means the GPU is out of vertex memory, get a 'P' and it's out of polygon memory.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thank you for paying attention of my problem
<br/>
<br/>
If you are talking about the white and blue character which replace the "Q" of "quake". I never see it doing anything, pressing L or not.

<br/>
I can't find qdsopts.txt. Is it supposed to be created ?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">simonjhall</span>, host_framerate is usually used to get a cheap &amp; easy slow-motion effect.
<br/>
<br/>
In the console, you can set host_framerate to a value below 0.05, and all the gameplay is slower...set it higher, and everything is faster. Setting it back to 0 (or 0.05 seems right) is normal speed.
<br/>
<br/>
A mod could alter it for things like the standard 'slow down time' element (set the game speed to 1/4th normal, but modify the Player's movement/firing/etc rate 400%, etc), or set it -really- low to have a pseudo-freezeframe to highlight an event, like a player getting gibbed/whatever. :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On another topic, there's no easy way to get the 'wireframe' setting (I'm guessing it's the DS' built-in cartoon outlining ability) to only affect models and -not- the actual level, right? :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[EDIT: Also, I noticed a limitation with the on-screen keyboard and quick touch buttons...you can't hold them down, they always get 'tapped'.  The physical DS buttons are fine, though.  For example, you can't really bind a +toggle alias to them, because they're released right after.  Add the following to an autoexec.cfg:
<br/>
<br/>
alias +testtest "echo Button down!"
<br/>
alias -testtest "echo Button up!"
<br/>
bind Z +testtest
<br/>
bind AUX4 +testtest
<br/>
bind "PAD B" +testtest
<br/>
<br/>
...and it shows how the touchscreen controls don't act the same as the buttons.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this the intended behavior? :)]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">@gorth, don't worry about the qdsopts file. This file allows you to simulate the PC Quake's command line. If it's not there then don't worry. Regarding your problem, tbh I have no idea! Did you try any of the previous versions?
<br/>
Here's a link to the previous version:

<br/>
Btw do you patch the binary or does your flash card do it automatically? I've heard that some of these dldi auto-patchers can give funny results...
<br/>
<br/>
@jlsoft, yeah, they just do taps. The OSK was originally designed for entering your network settings and choosing your unit in Team Fortress. Never seen a need for key hold/up/down events :-)
<br/>
<br/>
And no, I'm afraid there's no way to see alias models in wireframe mode - only brush models. It was just a bit of joke functionality that I dropped in and for some reason didn't get rid of it! Adding the wireframe option into the alias model renderer would probably slow down the game a bit too much.
<br/>
<br/>
@katch, you know you CAN play TF, right? That was the reason I added the keyboard into the game six months ago! It plays great, but the music doesn't play since it's wav audio, and there's a limit on the size of the files it can play.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

'Course it doesn't work, RenegadeC optimized it for DarkPlaces engine and it expends lots of polycount, texture size and such. Infact, it load till the "new game" screen, even plays the BGM. But away reloads this screen when i choose to start a game. If i try the "map" cvar, i can select maps.
<br/>
The castle.bsp map i did doesn't work, because "sky" is not a valid entity (RenegadeC did it). Dungeon.bsp loads, texturizes the world entity, but not the player and custom models. Locks saying texture size exceeds the cache limit.

Now, there's any way the console text does not overlay the keyboard? When the screen has many text, it cover the keyboard an gets hard to see.
<br/>
Maybe a <span style="font-weight: bold">_ds_console_coords "25 1 10 231"</span> variable, enclosing the console buffer in a box above the keyborad and betwen the AUX* keys.
<br/>
<br/>
And i issued the console command "screenshot" and took some quake**.pcx screenshots. But there's no PCX viewer on DS, and in computer i found the PCXs were all black. I have two thoughts, make it save JPEGs or PNGs (some engines do it already), if it doesn't require valious VRAM ou processing power (maybe the game could pause while savinng sshots).

<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I was playing through episode 3, and beat Satan's Dark Delight and moves on the the Air Tubes level. About half-way through I run into some serious lag, (1.5 fps) and end up blowing myself up since I had just gotten the Quad damage during the slow spree.
<br/>
<br/>
So I go back and try to do the level again. The slowdown occurs earlier now, but I found the new threshold for where it gets slow and save the level.
<br/>
<br/>
I turn my DS off and on again and load that save file. But it doesn't load. At the point where it says "loading models and lightmaps" or whatever, it's complaining about not having enough RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
So I'm guessing that the slowdown problem was Quake streaming data off the disk and into memory so frequently that massive slowdowns occurred.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>dualscreenman wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">What about Gaim DS?

I'm not quite sure what a non power of two texture is, but I do see some textures that and areas of color with black lines going through them. It's sorta garbled looking, and I'm guessing they aren't supposed to look like that.

Since the map sources of the full Quake1 game have been released what is the legality of modifying them to be more DS friendly and re-releasing them?

I noticed a few strange things... I use a M3Perfect SD, i've tested my ram using memtestArm as you sugest, i have no problem running it at 2.1, but with dsquake i can only use the middle ram setting, the highest one failed to load the pak files... is it really a memory issue?
<br/>
I can also confirm that using the save function on a slot2 device don't work with the exram build... that's annoying but already known and anounced, is it planed to correct that?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm...saving should work ok with the M3. I don't personally have an M3, but saving does work with the Supercard and I have done a bit of testing with the M3 (which I found was a lot harder to save with). I'll have a look again if you like. I would still recommend playing with a card in the top slot instead when using the exram build.
<br/>
Are you just playing regular Quake or a mod? If you're just playing regular Quake use the 'normal' build - the framerate will be a lot better and you'll also be able to save etc. There is no need to use the exram build if you're just playing normal Quake.
<br/>
<br/>
I dunno about the RAM timings. A few potential answers:
<br/>
- I may not be using the same timings that tepples uses. My 'top timing' may not be equivalent to his (although it probably is)
<br/>
- if you're using the EXRAM build and have no slot-1 file system then the card has to switch between RAM mode and disk mode hundreds (thousands?) of times and there's a chance that your card can't hack it at that speed. I do have doubts that these cards are designed to switch back and forth that many times...

- although memtestARM is designed to find these memory-breaking conditions, it is a synthetic test whereas Quake is a bit more real-world and detects problems pretty well ;-)

If you need any assistance, that is. I still believe that lightmapping and mipmapping should be possible (and potentially faster and require less memory than always loading mip 1). I haven't tried the latest release yet, but if the white polygons-while-loading-textures "issue" is still there, I also think it would be quite easy to hide that a bit (avarage all pixels in each texture while loading the level - thus giving an approximate polygon color and storing only this in memory).

tested again, and save function failed everytime at slow and medium ram speed alike... now i'm only using a M3Perfect and a passcard, so no file system on slot1. does that mean that to run quake exram I need either to flash my DS to allow boots in DS mode on the slot2 and find a slot1 rampack(Ds browser pack for example) or find a slot1 flash pack like a M3 simply R4 or product like that to be able to use exram and save?
<br/>
also when using the higher ram speed, quake is able to initialise memory, what fail is the access to the pak file it seems... is it related to the fact that i load the file and use ram of the slot2 device?
<br/>
<br/>
finally yes actually i'm only using regular quake files and i know that the regular version will perform better, but i'm looking forward to use mods...

If your behind a NAT, (which on wireless, you almost always are) then you won't be able to connect to any internet servers unless you do some tricky tunneling that's beyond my current knowledge. And if you were able to connect to one, then the latency would either bring you back to the old days, or make you understand the meaning behind the acronym "HPB".
<br/>
Most Quake servers online nowadays are QuakeWorld servers, QW being a multiplayer only release of Quake done about a year later that improved greatly on the network code by means of client-side prediction. Thus lag was reduced greatly. (Though it was still at least .2 seconds if you were on a modem :P) The old version is now referred to as "NetQuake" *shrugs*. And there's still a few running here and there...<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

<br/>
I am wondering, which parts of the code still needs to be optimized? Is there anything that needs to be handoptimized in ASM, maybe?
<br/>
It would be nice if you could make a list of functions and areas which are quickly ported, and which are sort of timing critical.
<br/>
I notice that the game update code takes a lot of time to excecute, is this because of QuakeC and all the floats the game loop? Or is this already handled? 
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, doing a specially tailored progs.dat with fixed point maths for the DS would be a massive speed increase. I used to be in the Quake modding scene "back in the days", so maybe I could look into that.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Maybe a progs.dat compiled with FrikQCC would be faster?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wotcha. Glad you're enjoying the game :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding "what's left to be optimised", do you mean what do I intend to optimise, or what actually needs something doing? I don't intend to improve the speed any more, since I spent many months doing this. The problem was that the tools I wrote to profile the program were too granular - I can get a list of all the functions in the program and how long each took to run (num calls, average time spent etc) but nothing finer than that. This made pinning down what the slow stuff was quite hard.
<br/>
Probably the slowest thing is the route finding / line of sight code. It's called an excessive amount of times per frame and although individual calls are quite quick, it really multiplies up! Since I couldn't figure out what the bottleneck in this function was (due to the lack of per-line profiling) I didn't want to re-write it in assembler.
<br/>
<br/>
Optimised progs would definately help, or modified progs which call the route finding stuff less would be good. I think the function's called 'traceline' or something in QuakeC. Oh and yes the whole VM is still in floating point, and that chews 10ms/frame on average :-)
<br/>
...that would'ha taken months to change to fixed point, and I just couldn't be arsed ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
So...would you wanna have a go with this? I'll help out if I can, but I don't really know too much about QuakeC!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm doing research now, I think there's a lot to gain from optimizing the QC interpreter speed-wise. And, there's some profiling code that could easely be removed too.
<br/>
<br/>
There's several ways of doing it. JIT would definetly be the fastest, but it would take a good bit of RAM (I guess). The bytecode format in QuakeC has some similarities to THUMB, so maybe it wouldn't be that hard to do a JIT interpretation of progs.dat at bootup, but it would still take some time for me to get it done.
<br/>
This could maybe even lead to EXRAM builds being the fastests, if JIT required more RAM than the DS has. I don't have any devkit with EXRAM to test it out with, though.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another way would be handoptimizing progs.dat for fixed point, write a special QC compiler, and a change the interpreter, but we wouldn't want to break the compatibility for network play. Would still be tempting for singleplayer stuff. There are also some optimizations to be made on how the QC interpreter loads and stores values.

<br/>
Either way you have no way of controlling the fov of the actual rendering, short of recompiling the game. The fov cvar will only control the bsp/model culling fov (again, assuming I've not disabled it)

<br/>
<br/>
I recently downloaded the engine's source code at <a href="http://quake.drunkencoders.com/downloads/quakeds_source_271007_r3.zip" target="_blank">http://quake.drunkencoders.com/downloads/quakeds_source_271007_r3.zip</a> . I would like to understand the edicts problem and, if it is what I think it is, apply 2 or 3 changes I've been keeping on my mind about it. Thing is, the sources do not look like they were arranged as a common NDS devkitARM project. 
<br/>
<br/>
Do you have some instructions handy for compiling and then getting an executable for this engine?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Edicts problem?
<br/>
Anyway, no I've never used any of the DKA project stuff. The makefile used with QDS is just a retrofitted svga linux makefile and I always regret never rolling my own! First thing I did with Q2 :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I use cygwin so if you don't then you may want to wiggle the paths and drop the /cygdrive stuff. It's also built with DKA r20 and won't compile with r21. To compile, type make build_debug at the prompt and it should eventually spit out your nds and copy it to disk! (drive L:)
<br/>
<br/>
There may be references to libraries that you don't have (eg my wireless debugger) so feel free to just pull 'em out...
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know how you get on.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah I remember!
<br/>
Fixing that problem is quite trivial. I just means increasing one define somewhere to increase the number of edicts. However there's no enough memory to just blindly increase it, which is why I didn't.
<br/>
<br/>
The fixing of this problem and the other problem where a couple of levels start to swap is related, since I didn't realise that when you define a piece of code to go itcm it also maintains a copy in main memory! So I'm gonna bug wintermute at some point to find out how to sort this ;-)
<br/>
Once that happens that'll free up a juicy 32k of memory stopping those levels swapping and allowing me to increase the number of edicts! (which well then make that level load)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The screen goes black just like it should and then nothing happens.

Every once in a while I have to format my card again then put everything back on before new programs/games work. It might be that, but I haven't had problems with the latest stuff I've put on, so I don' think it's that. And yeah, that's the link I found for the second release. I was just wondering if you could put it on your main site, like under previous releases. I've got mine now, and I'm going to make sure I keep a backup, I was just thinking just in case I couldn't find it again. But great work, I really appreciate it. I have the full version of Quake, and to play it on my DS, is great. I actually play it again.

If it takes substantially longer than that, something's definately up. Defrag the card? Reformatting with larger block sizes is really good too.
