<br/>
The game isn't yet feature-complete, so I'm not calling this a proper release. As a result, I don't want to get messages like "OMG, teh m0nsterz are p!nk" etc. I'd just like to know what everybody thinks of where's it's at.
<br/>
This would be a good time to discuss where it's also going - how do you find the controls? What would you like to see on the bottom screen? And again, I don't want to hear about the framerate - I'm still working on the VM and model rendering performance.
<br/>
<br/>
So, enough chat: <a class="postlink" href="http://quake.drunkencoders.com/" target="_blank">http://quake.drunkencoders.com/</a>

<br/>
And to reiterate: I haven't developed this game, I've just wiggled the code just enough to make it run on the Nintendo DS. I don't work for either id or Nintendo, and id owns all the IP etc.

I agree with Miika regarding jumping. The Metroid Prime Hunters jump mechanic was a double tap on the touch pad. I don't whether this is "do-able"?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wasn't expecting it to play that smoothly, very surprised.

What I noticed:

Gameplay seems faster than normal quake, like jumping for example.

DPAD does not strafe left and right.

    <h4>#118980 - Mr. Picklesworth - Sun Feb 18, 2007 8:54 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's better than I thought!
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't found any bugs so far (besides the obvious missing textures at the moment, but those aren't really bugs).
<br/>
It's running beautifully without any crashing whatsoever on my Supercard CF :)
<br/>
<br/>
The frame rate sometimes goes down noticeably when I first bump into a large cluster of enemies, but it goes back up later on. There was one chunk where the framerate did die to the point of unplayability, and I'm thinking it was because of piles of enemies; the actual level was running fine beforehand, but once the enemies were spawned (I'm assuming they were spawned after me entering the level) it never seemed to return because I couldn't kill them due to slaughtered frame rates.
<br/>
<br/>
I, for one, don't mind the lack of music, by the way. The game has enough sound as is, so unless you yourself really want it, may as well leave it until last.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I can get lefty controls by editing config.cfg. You could probably record a double stylus tap just like the other button presses to appeal to those Metroid players.
<br/>
<br/>
I've noticed that guns held by the player will poke through objects. Doesn't Quake have some kind of z-order stuff to deal with that?
<br/>
<br/>
One other thing: This is loading faster than DoomDS :b
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
Err... some weird castle place killed my frame rate as well.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Jumping by tapping shouldn't be too hard. I've just not coded it yet as the framerate isn't consistent, so tapping might be unresponsive.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and this was gonna be a demo-only release but Dood77 managed to convince me otherwise :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I also realise that some single levels or combinations of levels don't load (and you get something like MAX_MOD_KNOWN). Basically I've rarely played through more than a few levels per sitting so I hardly ever see these errors!

As you can see clipping gets completely messed when models are close to the camera - esp the weapon. It'll get fixed :-)
<br/>
You're also right about the spawning of the bad guys. They can really make it churn... If you pause the game when it gets to one of these really slow bits you'll see how much impact the VM has because the framerate will suddenly shoot right up!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Seems like the near clipping plane being to far away or something else causing parts of the geometry not getting rendered if you get your view too close (for example standing next to a wall looking sideway, or up/down). I experienced some problems walking up the slope from the water early in e1m2. Walking straightforward did nothing but if I wiggled around a little I could walk up. Also got some screeching noise in e1m2 byt the spike shooters along with some really weird texture behavior on the wall and fllor in the same area.
<br/>
<br/>
It's really great to see Quake on the DS in any case and I just hope you have a go at fixing most of the remaining problems before moving on to q2.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I forgot to mention that stuck-on-a-slope thing (thanks bear).
<br/>
That's a by-product of me moving large chunks of the physics code from slow floating-point to (32-bit) fixed-point arithmetic. As it happens quite infrequently I decided to take the occasional stickiness route (heh) over the going-to-64-bit route.
<br/>
Changing the size of one of many of the fundamental datatypes in the game is a bit of an issue, but I'll try and see what I can do about this problem (but still stay in 32-bits).
<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, if you get stuck when slowly walking up a slope, jump a bit!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I got this to work nicely with my ds-x, but I haven't yet checked on my m3. I'm sure it's fine. :)
<br/>
<br/>
so what about the extra RAM built into the m3? couldn't that be of any use for making the game run without the limitations of the DS's ram?
<br/>
<br/>
though it certainly dosn't seem to have hindered the project thus far.
<br/>
in fact, it almost seems as though it runs TOO fast. I find myself missing doorways and overstepping buttons and such.

I've been watching this project for a while now (especialy once the other project stopped being updated) and I'm looking greatly forward to a final build!

<br/>
<br/>
Love all the comments about too fast - ha! I think I can dig out a software-rendered build/slideshow if you like! But I know what you mean. As I've spent a good deal of time on the performance, repeatability is important. As a result, no time base is used by the game engine (it is used by the sound engine though). At the end of the frame the 'game time' is incremented by exactly the same value, meaning that if the framerate increases then so does the game speed.
<br/>
It is still a debug build :-p
<br/>
<br/>
And I don't think extra RAM would really help at this state. It only runs out of RAM a handful of times in the game, and that's when the framerate hits rock bottom. That extra RAM is also slower than regular RAM so it won't be 'free' to use it.
<br/>
<br/>
Partial conversions - they should work. Just not in this build (unless you wanna play with the source code).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
so the control is perfect in this game. I'm really happy with the response of the touch screen. I was hoping it WASN'T going to be anything like the goldeneye game for DS. (the touch screen suppord in that game sucked for days)

Is there any way to put in a crosshair? I know the crosshair 1 console command, but with no console I'm not sure what to do. perhaps in the .cgf file?
<br/>
<br/>
and that brings me to another curiosity: will there be a functional console in the final build? maybe with a keyboard for in-game key binding and impulse codes and stuff..?

oh, and I'm sure you're going to, so I feel like it's pointless to bring it up, but a reverse on the axis that looks up and down on the touch screen would be lovely.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">oi Simon, I have an idea to submit for your consideration:
<br/>
<br/>
I'm no programmer, so I'm not sure how difficult it would be to implicate, but what if certain areas of the touch screen were allocated as sort of "buttons" to be bound for any extra things one might want? sort of like the morph-ball mode in MP:H. it'd make for a nice way to change weapons, or to use for mods with wierd extra impulse command bindings.
<br/>
<br/>
for example, as I had mentioned the swinging grappling hook mod, which allows for you to shrink and lengthen your hook's chain with the key bindings +shrink and +grow. to have a button allocated on the touch screen for those two commands would be really great!!
<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait to play CTF all over the place.

It works great, but the control is rather stiff and the guns
<br/>
fire speed depends on how fast the game runs I think :P
<br/>
like in the level selecting map the shotgun fires like crazy :P
<br/>
When there is a lot of enemies and lag the gun shoots as fast as

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Impressive work, Simon, and much appreciated :) It was great to see Quake running on my DS!
<br/>
<br/>
The framerate seemed fine for me, though I didn't play very far. At first the game seemed a little fast, but I guess that's the friction issue you were having a while back?
<br/>
<br/>
DLDI patching didn't work for DS-Link, I really hope that can be sorted someday. It just gave me errors (unable to load gfx.wad etc....), presumably some kinda FAT issue?
<br/>
<br/>
It did however work on SCSD.
<br/>
<br/>
Great idea having buttons to cycle weapons *both ways* - the weapon selection system pretty much killed DSDoom for me. 
<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to future builds :)
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and D-Pad strafing worked fine for me. I vaguely remember some other homebrew title having d-pad issues on certain flashcarts, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#119034 - TheChuckster - Mon Feb 19, 2007 5:37 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, that's extremely impressive... my jaw dropped when I saw the 3-D world of Quake come to life on my DS! Go easy on your baby? That's just a little modest... :D I noticed the screenshot on your web page has textures working on the models, along with a first person weapon model and on-screen text rendering. Is that a Photoshop mock up or is it part of an unreleased version?
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with that texture coordinate bug. As far as lightmaps go, has multitexturing on the DS been reversed yet? I haven't done much 3D coding on DS...
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and by the way... How much luck are you having with the net code? Did you try compiling it in with the wifi library? Multiplayer Quake would be pretty NICE, especially if there's already a built-in server browser in Quakeworld.
<br/>
<br/>
I just hope it doesn't suffer from the spontaneous Guru Meditation crashes that I've had to deal with in DS Doom. It would definitely lag less, though, since there's lag prediction. In Doom, if one person has a bad ping, everybody notices so four player deathmatches aren't really playable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#119049 - simonjhall - Mon Feb 19, 2007 11:04 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks again for all the comments :-)
<br/>
Having seen the Necropolis demo hundreds (thousands?) of times now I think seeing the coolness of Quake on DS has gone out the window. So I'd forgotten that people might be impressed when they see it run for the first time!
<br/>
Y'know I blew TWO DS' getting it this far?!
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, networking - I've been running the game with wifi for ages (the debugger) so the game's already set up for wireless fun. I've already figured out what needs to be done for networking (as I did a prototype Q port) so that shouldn't be too hard to do.
<br/>
I'm still not too sure about doing it though, as adding networking means removing other features. So I'm thinking about doing several builds, each with different features. What do people think of this?
<br/>
<br/>
The crosshair: this isn't as trivial as you'd think. Yeah, I could knock up a cross in the middle of the screen easy enough, but I doubt it would then be compatible with total conversions which supplied their own crosshair.
<br/>
Basically the crosshair is (sort of) part of the <span style="font-style: italic">console</span>, but it doesn't get hidden when you hide the console. I've got the proper Quake console running on the subscreen (not in this build) and sure enough there it is being drawn! Except the graphics are on one screen an the crosshair's on the other! I'm still trying to decide what to do with the menu and console.
<br/>
<br/>
The picture with proper textures and the gun etc: this is not a mockup, this is the software renderer. It looks absolutely fantastic running on the DS, and due to the framerate you really get to appreciate who pretty it is :-)
<br/>
If you look in that picture (the top left one) you'll see the number '2.1'. That's the framerate! Now if you look two pictures down there's almost the same picture (I didn't intend to take a picture of the same scene!) and it's so much faster that four frames got captured by my camera! I could try and get the software renderer running again if enough people want to have a play.
<br/>
<br/>
DS-link and other cards which don't work - does DLDI fat homebrew normally work on these cards?
<br/>
<br/>
Getting stuck in that light on e1m1 - I can replicate that, but it only seems to happen on that light. At first I thought that the BSP generation could have gone a bit wrong there, but I don't get stuck in the light in GLQuake so it must be a fixed-point problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Touch buttons and control configuration - shouldn't be too hard to knock up. And yeah, I'll set them up as configurable buttons, so you'll be able to bind commands and actions to them.
<br/>
<br/>
So (can't believe I'm gonna ask this) - what do people want fixing first? :-D
<br/>
<br/>

texture alignment for environment.

it's awesome to hear that you're considering the touch screen buttons. :-) things like that can make the difference between a really good, and sub-par game-port.

<br/>
<br/>
Wifi: here's the memory breakdown. You obv wanna maximise the amount available to the game.
<br/>
The build you have uses a 3.1-3.2 meg game heap. It includes sound code (which costs 50k), sound files (150k), textures (which cost 50-200k), no lighting (100k) no MP3 playback (which would cost 50k), no networking (100-200k), file system support (50-60k).
<br/>
Mix and match them as you see fit :-)
<br/>
<br/>
The good thing however is in deathmatch games, the Quake progs are very small, leaving you more RAM for the actual levels and things like wifi, sound, lightmaps etc. But if you want to host a co-op game it'll take as much as a single player game but also will require the wifi code + net code, so something will need to be sacrificed. If you're playing a co-op game but aren't hosting it will be roughly equivalent to a regular single player game (as you won't need progs but you'll need wifi code).
<br/>
<br/>
Does any of the above make any sense? :-D
<br/>
<br/>
So I reckon I'll make a few builds, one configured for single player, one configured for deathmatch, one for co-op.
<br/>
Once I fix the textures and lighting that is!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Does any of the above make any sense? :-D
<br/>
<br/>
So I reckon I'll make a few builds, one configured for single player, one configured for deathmatch, one for co-op.
<br/>
Once I fix the textures and lighting that is!</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Different builds for single/multiplayer would be sweet. It makes sense to make best use of the DS's limited memory to suit the relevant game mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Duking it out on the abandoned base deathmatch map over wifi would be awesome.

aah the quakeworld memories come flooding back...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Noticed the gamma was set to 0.6. If like me you want a darker display just set it to 1.0
<br/>
<br/>
Also if you are sick of the Necropolis demo ( I bet simon is :)  ) you can edit the config.cfg to start quake with any map you want.
<br/>
<br/>
Simply add the following add the end of the .cfg
<br/>
<br/>
map e1m1
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a list of the maps from the retail version.
<br/>
<br/>
    start - Introduction

    e1m1 - Slipgate Complex
<br/>
    e1m2 - Castle of the Damned
<br/>
    e1m3 - The Necropolis
<br/>
    e1m4 - The Grisly Grotto
<br/>
    e1m5 - Gloom Keep
<br/>
    e1m6 - The Door To Chthon
<br/>
    e1m7 - The House of Chthon
<br/>
    e1m8 - Ziggurat Vertigo
<br/>
    e2m1 - The Installation
<br/>
    e2m2 - Ogre Citadel
<br/>

    e2m6 - The Dismal Oubliette
<br/>
    e2m7 - Underearth
<br/>
    e3m1 - Termination Central
<br/>
    e3m2 - The Vaults of Zin
<br/>
    e3m3 - The Tomb of Terror
<br/>
    e3m4 - Satan's Dark Delight
<br/>
    e3m5 - Wind Tunnels
<br/>
    e3m6 - Chambers of Torment

Having access to the console would be nice so that you can start custom maps and mess with settings from inside the game.
<br/>
<br/>
For a network build mp3 playback would be one easy throw-away, and I guess if there's not enough resources for everything you could sacrifice some graphics features for playability.
<br/>
<br/>
As for general fixes priority I think the game speed issues rather important so it would be really nice if that could be resolved. World texture coord problems and alias model texturing would also be nice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Seems kinda gimmicky to me, but interesting nonetheless. Lets work on that after Quake 2 is running ;)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: oh, and for anyone having trouble with the strafe keys, im 90% sure its because they didnt download/copy the config.cfg file
<br/>
<br/>
Also i went into the config.cfg to look for what keyboard key R was assigned to, so i could change that to jump, but i noticed its not bound to a key... i guess the L and R buttons just send the command straight to the console without a key?
<br/>
<br/>
Priority:
<br/>
Timing
<br/>
double-tap jump or R button jump
<br/>
Texture alignment
<br/>
working console and on-screen keyboard
<br/>
button customizablility (assign DS keys to keyboard keys, not ds keys to quake commands) keys could later be customized with a working menu
<br/>
Textured models
<br/>
fully working menu
<br/>
the rest of the sound (i had trouble hearing the double barrel shotgun sound sometimes, and i believe you said it was 80% done at an earlier post)
<br/>
the rest of the graphics bugs
<br/>
wifi
<br/>
music
<br/>
<br/>
What i see the game like in its completed state:
<br/>
of course at least 1 single player build and 1 multiplayer, maybe even 2 multiplayer, 1 for dm and the other coop
<br/>
The bottom screen should have a few buttons in the corners and sides and stuff, you could assign those to keyboard keys using the above, then assign commands using a working console:
<br/>
a button brings down the console on the top screen (solving the cross-hair issue, as well as the center-screen text messages im guessing) and also brings up an onscreen keyboard, and same button puts console up yadda yadda.
<br/>
maybe even using a small external editable .bmp file for the picture/text on the custom buttons.
<br/>
there could be options for which screen to use the ammo/health/armor for, but me personally would prefer the top screen. the unused space could still be used for console messages (chat, weapon/ammo pickup)
<br/>
<br/>
If i think of anything more i will post, although im sure this is enough for now ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Deltro, did you ever get your gbamp to work with the game?

Tapping to jump - I'm finding it surprisingly hard to get right. Can't you just press a button? :-p

Key config - yeah, you'll be able to bind every button to anything. I've just got to get round to coding it... And if you want a lefty build just shout as I've got one kicking around in my sent items.

I don't know if it will help you any, but to track down the 8bit gba slot writes in Mini vMac I modified desmume to write the address of an 8bit write and exit.

Then all that was needed was to look the address up using addr2line and make the changes.

It's fairly easy to modify desmume to do this, but I can send my modifications if needed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

what about the designated touch-screen "buttons"? is that seeming possible? likely just in the corners. perhaps a 1/2 inch of each corner as a touchable button, one of which could easily be bound to jump. they'd be perfect for grappling hooks, or any other wierd conversions or bindings anyone would like..

you can do math on floats yourself AFAIK. its possible to add to the exponent or subtract it to shift. the first bit is the sign, the next 8 bits is the exponent. the remaining 23 bits are the mantissa, but to extract it you have to add a one at the beginning (the one gets truncated because a binary floating point number always looks like 1.xxx * 2^exp).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Look at the floating-point number as an unsigned 1.23 fixed point number with a correctional shift. If you're going to convert a floating-point number to signed 19.13 fixedpoint, you can just do something like this:

- decode float into an exponent and a mantissa

One potential gotcha to keep in mind - IIRC if the shift amount is bigger than the datatype, the result is undefined (by the C standard). This should be OK for overflowing values, since it can't be represented in your format. But for the underflow it might be an issue, since very small values might turn very big.
<br/>
<br/>
A fix should be something like:

Edit: After checking the Architecture Reference Guide, it seems that ARM-cpus use the lower 8bits of the shift-register. Since the the un-biased shift count is in the 0-128 range (we already halved the range due to negative/positive exponents), and the bias not being outside the +/-127 range, this fix shouldn't be needed on ARMs. An ifdef might be in order, just to prevent yourself from adding the code back in by mistake when testing on x86 or something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I'm still not sure of whether I should do another pre-release or just wait a little bit longer and go for a proper feature-complete release. What I really want is to make a worthwhile version, rather than putting out something which just doesn't have any visible improvements.
<br/>
<br/>
Things which would be in a pre-release (April?)
<br/>
- better framerate
<br/>
- proper timebase
<br/>
- non-crackling sound
<br/>
- aligned *power of two* textures on brush models (eg the world)
<br/>
- every level should load
<br/>
- properly working menus
<br/>
- network gaming
<br/>
- game loading and saving
<br/>
- key configuration
<br/>
- maybe music...
<br/>
<br/>
Things which would only be in a May/June release:
<br/>
- both lightmap and dynamic lighting
<br/>
- non-power of two textures properly rendered
<br/>
- properly rendered models
<br/>
- buttons on the subscreen
<br/>
- proper support (within reason) for mods and total conversions

<br/>
Logically, non-power-of-two do not fit in that row. It's a hardware restriction anyway.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, that's a legit texture size.
<br/>
There are a few textures in the game which aren't power of two, eg 256x96, which I resize into the next size up (eg 256x128). That's why there are many mis-aligned textures in the game which have big black bars on them.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not too sure of how I'm gonna fix this as it's not just a case of scaling the texture co-ordiantes, as I dynamically generate the tex co-ords per poly at render time and this extra complication could slow it down...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I noticed I had pre1 on one of my SD cards last night and had a go with it - it plays so poorly compared to more recent builds! Those pink/non-transparent menus are pretty annoying, and you are all right - it does run far too fast!
<br/>
<br/>
Still can't decide whether to do a pre2 (in a few weeks or so) or just hang on for a further month or two until the final ver. Don't wanna oversaturate the market, y'know!

<br/>
be that as it may, it'll still be fun to have 2 different builds of the game.
<br/>
<br/>
the way things are going, it looks like your version will be more adaptable, and modifiable for conversions and so forth.
<br/>
<br/>
plus, it sounds like you have the jump on quake 2.. 
<br/>
any status report on that one?
<br/>
<br/>
keep up the awesome work!!!!<br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Q2:
<br/>
Quake2 isn't getting the time it really deserves, what with the massive drive to finish Q1! It's coming along though and I should really show some screenshots of the game running :-)
<br/>
It's pretty depressing though as (to me) it's a brand new source tree and none of the code is tuned towards running nicely on the DS. As the first game has stolen my soul I'm kinda worried about developing Q2. Plus people want QuakeWorld too...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm still not confident that Q2 can be made to run as well as Q1 does, due to the memory requirement and the much larger textures.
<br/>
<br/>
Q1:
<br/>
The total conversion and mod selection interface is coming along (and now pretty easy to use). At the very beginning of the game, if you hold down a key-combination it'll let you select how you want to start the game. I think I'll do something similar for the network setup...
<br/>
<br/>
I finished the new texture manager last night, so now I can properly texture the alias models (as they take lots of VRAM). This also means I can now comfortably fit in all the full-quality brush model textures, alias textures, lightmaps, hud textures, and gui textures that I need! No more mip level 1 :-D
<br/>
<br/>
Things left to do:
<br/>
- finish lightmapping
<br/>
- plug in dynamic lighting (via hardware lights)
<br/>
- fix the sound attentuation
<br/>
- optimise the model renderer
<br/>
- optimise the collision detection<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
