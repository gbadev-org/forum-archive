    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">The Story</span>
<br/>
Platdude found himself having to traverse some levels.  Within each level were a set of Xmas trees, and he found that if he turned all of the Xmas tree lights on, he could get out the door.  It's a rubbish story, but hey, what d'you expect!?
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Controls</span>
<br/>
DPad to move, A and Y to jump, B to grab.  Just like last year.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Levels</span>
<br/>
There are 9 Xmas themed levels to play through.
<br/>
Tap B on the title screen to play last year's 12 levels.

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The More</span>
<br/>
Having attempted 3 or 4 "Bigger/Bolder/Better" JNKPlat versions, I inevitably came to the conclusion that the old one was good enough.  Now that I've figured that out, I might as well keep building on it, and see where we get.
<br/>
Expect to see more JNKPlat levels in the future.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://AGameAWeek.com" target="_blank">A Game A Week.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
