This app looks excellent.  I installed v2.0, but am having a couple of problems.   My apologies if this is answered elsewhere, but my Google searches found nothing. 
<br/>
<br/>
1.  After configuring the address of my myth box, and saving the configuration, I receive an error indicating it can't find the config file.  I went so far as looking at the sourcecode and creating an empty file in the MythRemote directory, but had no success. 
<br/>
<br/>
2.  I have no idea how to configure the SSID and WEP key of my router.  Any tips?

Sorry.   I guess I should have been more exact.  I know how to configure my router.   I see no way of telling the DS what the SSID and WEP key are.   I have used MarioKart, and successfully done this in the past, but don't see how to set this same information when using the MythRemote application.   It seems I never have an opportunity to enter this information.  The DS boots immediately into the M3 cartrdige menu system, and once I am in MythRemote there is nowhere to enter this information.
<br/>
<br/>
If it helps at all, I have an older style DS, and I'm using the M3 DS Simply cartridge, with a 512M micro SD ram.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thinking that it might be a problem with DHCP, I popped back over to MK and set up static addressing.  I still can't get any connectivity using MythRemote.  
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I am not at all understanding the mechanism whereby MythRemote picks up the IP settings (DHCP, WEP, SSID), and establishes IP connectivitity.   Is it supposed to happen automatically when you try to connect to the myth backend machine?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am having a problem getting MythRemote to work.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried versions 0.1.0, 0.1.1, and 0.2.0 and all exhibit the same behavior.  It is unable to get an IP address via DHCP.  I've tested with Animal Crossing and Tony Hawk American Skateland, and both of those work.  Additionally, I have tested with DSOrganize, and it works fine as well.  I've been able to download homebrew applications from the homebrew database.
<br/>
<br/>
What I am seeing is that MythRemote associates with my access point, but that the DHCP request is not being forwarded to my router.  My guess is that the DHCP request being sent by MythRemote must not be liked by my wireless routers (SMC.)
<br/>
<br/>
When I look at the logs in my wireless access point, I see the DS associate, and I see the HDCP request come in from the client.  However, it seems like the request is not forwarded to my DHCP server.  I see no activity (nothing shows up in the logs) on that link.
<br/>
<br/>
I've spent a bit of time troubleshooting with Lynx, and he's even been able to control my Myth Frontend remotely through our VPN tunnel...
<br/>
<br/>
I have both a grey and a blue NDS, and both exhibit the same behavior.

<br/>
<br/>
Let me try to make things a bit more clear, as none of these suggestions are going to fix my issue.
<br/>
<br/>
Using a commercial ROM, or DSOrganize, this is what happens:
<br/>
<br/>
DS --&gt; WAP --&gt; Router (the DHCP Server) --&gt; Internet successfully
<br/>
<br/>
For MythRemote, the DS associates with the WAP.  The WAP logs show the DS associating and sending a DHCPRequest.  However, the Router logs do not show the DHCPRequest arriving.  This tells me that the WAP is NOT forwarding the DHCPRequest to the router.
<br/>
<br/>
My assumption at this point, which I can't confirm because I can't seem to find software that will monitor the DS &lt;--&gt; WAP communication, is that the DHCPRequest coming from MythRemote is malformed in such a way that my WAP is dropping the request rather than forwarding it properly.  This may be something where the SMC WAP is being "overly picky" but I half-way discount that since DSOrganize can perform the DHCPRequest and processes the DHCPOffer that my router sends as a response.
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, it's not a general case, because as I noted, in working with Lynx, his MythRemote can control my front end.  I know he is using a different type of access point, and I know that he is not using WDS whereas I am.  However, I am equally sure that WDS is not the issue in that I am connecting to the WAP that is actually connected to the CAT5 cable.
<br/>
<br/>
My next option is to try with a Linksys WAP and see if I can get that working.  I will try plugging that into my SMC WAP that is connected to my router in an effort to keep my traffic on my "blue" wireless network and see if it is indeed the SMC WAP.  But it would still tend to point to MythRemote using a version of libWifi that has a bug in it.
<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that source code is provided with the MythRemote downloads.  I may try that as well...  Just updating the libWifi to the latest one and see if that makes a difference.  And if not, attempt to contact the author of DSOrganize and synchronize with his version to see if that is the issue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Is this a joke, or are you serious? His network is simular to mine, and more complicated than you know.  The WAP is not running DHCP, the router is.  The router has 3 interfaces, red (internet), green (local LAN), and blue (local WiFi).
<br/>
<br/>
The DS is working fine with DSOrganize and commercial games, so it doesn't have anything to do with the hardware being used (directly).  But, the fact that he is running WDS or something else out of the "norm" could be the cause, as I'm assuming DSO is using the latest WiFiLib, and I'm not sure what MythRemote is using, as it is building its own ARM7.
<br/>
<br/>
So, it could be that MythRemotes WiFi can't handle his WDS setup or something, as I'm also running a very simular network minus the WDS and all is working fine.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

DS: DHCP Discover Tx ID: 0xDCCCBBD7
<br/>
Router: DHCP Offer: Tx ID: 0xDCCCBBD7 (IP 192.168.1.104, 1 Day Lease)
<br/>
DS: DHCP Request Tx ID: 0xDCCCBBD7 (IP 192.168.1.104, Seconds Elapsed = 0)
<br/>
DSL DHCP Request Tx ID: 0xDCCCBBD7 (IP 192.168.1.104, Seconds Elapsed = 768)
<br/>
Router: DHCP Tx ID: 0xDCCCBBD7 NAK
<br/>
<br/>
Between the two DHCP Requests from the DS approximately 3 seconds actually elapse.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any ideas at all?  I can provide more info or debugging if it will help at all.
<br/>

I have a blue DS and a DS lite, both will not connect to Mythfrontend whether I set the IP as static or not. Both work fine with DSorganize.

Getting this app to work would be awesome.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
