[/Update]
<br/>
<br/>
I've just launched the website for my brand new game I'm developing with a friend. It is still in the development process so we have no idea when it'll be out. Right now the site is just a teaser of what's to come, but any input about it is welcome. The site is: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.darknessrising-ds.co.nr" target="_blank">http://www.darknessrising-ds.co.nr</a>.

Thanks, I've been working on DS programming for about half a year now and I thought I'd try a little project. I have one question though...how did this game give inspiration of what the Revmote could do? I'm just curious (Oh and btw, thanks to your post, you've inspired me to include stylus swordplay to the game lol).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I had played your game before, and several others that are similar. I just played your game again, and with a bit of help, it could work great on the DS, and I'm not talking about using the bottom screen to select attacks. 
<br/>
<br/>
IMO, RPGs are getting boring by the second. Lunar now features an "auto attack" system, same with FFXII and others. The whole "hit and get hit" is getting pretty stale too. 
<br/>
<br/>
One of the games I played (the one I confused your's with) was in first person view, and required you to move the mouse in order to slay enemies or block attacks, it was featured on Newgrounds too. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm still interested in playing your game, but a bit of first person slaying wouldnt be bad ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's exactly what your post inspired me to start programming, a sort of first person swordplay that could happen during the course of fighting monsters and bosses. It could sort of end up like the Resident Evil first person knife-battles, but it will feature blocking and attacking. Now I just have to figure out how to do this :-D.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I know, but I don't exactly have all the skills needed to do a fully fledged game with what I know as of now. I was going to learn as I went along while writing the game :S.

<br/>
Tactics style RPGs (eg. Final Fantasy Tactics Advance) and even RPGs with battle systems like Tales of Symphonia are good as well...constant action means no bored button pressing
<br/>
<br/>
as far as the battle system goes, what if you dragged the stylus across the screen for a slash (slash follows direction of stylus) and just hold it in the one spot to block? you could then block left, right, above and below as well as centre then<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not too much, I haven't been able to work on anything at all since I've been away at a Robotics competition in Atlanta, Georgia (go team 1305!). I've been gone for about a week and I need to catch up on a bit of school work but the project should be back on track soon. We have decided we will have first person swordplay as well as a sort of Final Fantasy type battle engine incorporated into it and gameplay sort of like the Zelda series during the overworld walking around.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
