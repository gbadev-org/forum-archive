    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I started work on this just two days ago, and would like to see what all you guys think of it. It can zoom in 4096x total.

More info, screenshot, and download link is avaliable on my website:

If you download can you reply with some constructive critism please, I'd very much to develop this app more.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I've posted the source on my site but you have to register if you want source codez.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You application runs pretty slow, relatively.  You can look into <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrob.com/pub/muency/successiverefinement.html" target="_blank">successive refinement</a> for much faster rendering, for example.  It would perfectly apply here as much of what you are doing is zooming.
<br/>
<br/>
It'd be great to select a rectangular region (with a fixed ratio) on the touch screen and zoom to that view.
<br/>
<br/>
More colours, please!  It'd be awesome to see a rainbow of colours in there.  ;D
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, great job on the little app.  It seems you are <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=154142" target="_blank">relatively new</a> to DS programming; keep it up!
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'd like to mention sgstair is hosting a <a class="postlink" href="http://opti.akkit.org/competition.php?id=5" target="_blank">Mandelbrot optimization contest</a>.  It'd be great to have some (more) competition!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

More speed is definately my feature request
<br/>
a) successive refinement sounds a good way to go
<br/>
b) caching of previous parts of the image for, say, if you're tracking from side to side
<br/>
c) parallel processing is definately an option, and could be a good excuse to play around with the ARM7!

For successive refinement, see <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrob.com/pub/muency/successiverefinement.html" target="_blank">Successive Refinement, Mu-Ency at MROB</a> as I posted earlier.
<br/>
<br/>
By caching simonjhall means storing calculated values around the view port.  When the view port is moved, these cached values are read instead of recalculated.
<br/>
<br/>
Parallel processing would be a bit difficult for an inexperienced programmer.  It involves using the ARM7 to calculate some values while the ARM9 calculates the rest.  This would greatly speed up processing (by at least 130%).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I implemented successive refinement and from loading the entire thing (from start pos) at 18 seconds it went up to about 22 seconds? Isnt this supposed to be a faster method?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Sorry my bad I only implemented up to stage 2 of successive refinement, now that ive done stage 3 it loads at about 5 seconds (thanks!) :P.

Can you tell me how to do parrellel processing please? Or link me to a tutorial :) ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The "third stage" can produce inaccuracies, you ought to at least make it optional. Or, generate the skipped pixels as a final pass.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
