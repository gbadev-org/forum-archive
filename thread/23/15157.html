    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've started working on converting the original Football Manager to the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Paul Robson has ported, or reverse-engineered, or remade, the original Football Manager by Kevin Toms. He has provided his source code <a class="postlink" href="http://www.autismuk.freeserve.co.uk/" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
I took that, plus the DS port of the SDL, and started working on a port to the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
The current status is:
<br/>
<br/>
A pre-alpha version is running. You can see some of the menu screens, and once it comes to match day, you can actually see a match.
<br/>
<br/>
It is not really playable (other than advancing from match to match), in fact, I have taken out quite a bit of functionality.
<br/>
<br/>
So you should take a look at it only if you are very curious.
<br/>
<br/>
I will release the source code as well, of course (it's GPL), but I haven't found a permanent home for it yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Given that it is likely that I will not keep maintaining this for a long time (it is only a "finger exercise" to get acquainted with DS homebrew), it would be nice if someone would like to take over, provide webspace, etc. Putting it on sourceforge would be a bit of an overkill IMHO.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the current binary:

Well, the way it looks now, this particular port will be more of a sentimental thing. I'll finish porting it to make it half-way useable (mostly involves letting go of the assumption that you have numbers on your keyboard) and then perhaps start one from scratch that will be more suitable for the DS' capabilities. Plus the remake is severely limited in scope anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be at least one bug in the "matchday" in that your opponent will never shoot, just run with the ball, sometimes running into the goal (and scoring). It also seems that it is always just the opposition that scores, never your own team (currently always Arsenal, just to keep things simple).
<br/>
<br/>
Text output is horrendously slow, somehow plotting each pixel of the Spectrum font individually. The match graphics seem to be as quick (or slow) as I remember it from C64 days, though; "adequate".
<br/>
<br/>
Would you be willing to host this project and/or any DS-specific footie manager I may or may not get started on?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
