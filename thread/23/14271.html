Kloplop321 has been working hard on this Moonshell theme emulator for several months. Moonshell is a multimedia homebrew application for the Nintendo DS. His Moonshell theme emulator for PC/Windows, known as Phleon, has now been released today. Since this is a beta release... if you find any bugs or have suggestions, please let us know by replying in this thread. :)
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Phleon is a VB.NET program Made to emulate the themes for Moonshell. It is simple to use(in my idea), can go in reduced mode, meaning less processing for the less powerful computers. This program's source will not be released until a Major Version is created, the released source will also be commented heavily to provide examples for other coders.
<br/>
<br/>
This program does not emulate Moonshell entirely. It only shows the use and effects of what will happen with the files provided. It can open another theme and change settings, export it, etc. This makes a pure drag and drop Usable theme. It is not totally complete, but does help give an idea if it will work or not. It also has an Error Report window showing what hasn't or could not be loaded. 
<br/>
<br/>
I do not know what every Moonshell's optional variables are for the configurations, however if there are any, please post examples of them, a link to a theme that uses it, and so forth. I know I am missing a few.
<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions always help, thanks.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

may be of relevance. there is an ez5 skin previewer (for the old loader version). the old loader is modified moonshell so it half serves as a moonshell skin previewer. however it is not ideal and doesn't give the info/use as yours does (from what i see in screenshots). just thought it warranted a mention.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well this saves you time by not forcing you to actually load it on your DS while testing..(you have to stick in mem card, boot up, boot in moonshell, test all attributes, shut down, pull mem stick out, put in computer, continue editing, restart testing loop..) while on my program it is just(open/load, replace pictures look for about 20 secs, go back to editing, put in new picture, and so forth until you are finished)
<br/>
<br/>
although the saving procedure was the most annoying(boring!), however, quite usefull because it just dumps everything in a drag and drop format for Mooshell. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE post all optional settings that I do not know about!(just dump the existing default/ugly theme that is inside of it and check the settings file)<br/>_________________<br/>I am the creator of Phleon @ 1emulation.com

But could you tell me how to do alpha images to work in a moonshell skin with Phleon?
<br/>
Like, in Photoshop i did buttons, bars and so, and save it as PNG. Imported in Phleon and all was fine, i save and place in the /moonshl/skin folder.
<br/>
When i open Mooshell, only the originaly BMP images are working, no bars and buttons. Even DSOrganize can't open the images, it freezes trying.
<br/>
<br/>
See how it is on Phleon:

<br/>
But in DS nothing shows besides the BMPs.
<br/>
Any hint?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
