<br/>
It was reported to me a bug with the Flame Boots, after some testing I realised there was some buggy code with the attribute "Mana Drain".
<br/>
I've now actually changed how mana drain works, instead of being percentage based it will drain a specific amount.
<br/>
I did this to balance its effectiveness against lesser mana pools and weaken it against larger ones.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Some other changes include:</span>
<br/>
?	I smoothed out the fading, sometimes an image got stuck on the screen
<br/>
?	I changed recipes to 99 max stackable
<br/>
?	The DoT effects from "Bleeds/ElectrBurn/Poison" etc have been changed. I increased their damage slightly but they wont always apply each hit.
<br/>
?	You will now start with 2 recipes
<br/>
?	Increased the max stackable of the sets: Blue/Leaf/Light/Red/Yellow/Glass
<br/>
?	Added more default items to the assignable items
<br/>
?	The first 8 recipes start revealed in the recipebook (up from 4)
<br/>
?	Added 15 seconds to the 'Water Park' TimeAttack level (making it 1m15s)
<br/>
?	LifeLeech limited to draining once per second
<br/>
?	Starting weapon 'ElectroSword' has had its damage changed from -3 to -1
<br/>
?	Lowered the shop price of 'Apple' to 1000 (from 1500)
<br/>
?	Lowered the shop price of 'Orange' to 2250 (from 3000)
<br/>
?	Increased the shop price of 'Bannana' to 6000 (from 5500)
<br/>
?	Increased the shop price of 'Pear' to 9000 (from 8000)
<br/>
?	Increased the effect of a 'Bannana' from 25 to 30
<br/>
?	Increased the effect of a 'Pear' from 40 to 50
<br/>
?	Increased Max Stackable of 'Adrenline' from 25 to 30
<br/>
?	Increased Max Stackable of 'PhoenixGem' from 3 to 4
<br/>
?	Increased Max Stackable of 'PhoenixClaw' from 1 to 2
<br/>
?	Changed the main menu music so its random between 2 tracks
<br/>

// WARNING!!

// ====================</span>
<br/>
Unfortunately you will run into problems if you use your old save data. So you will have to delete the '.dat' (RedTemple.dat) from your cart before using the new version. Sorry! :(
<br/>
<br/>
If you dont delete the file it might appear to run fine, but will eventually crash. You need to delete the '.dat' file
<br/>
not just delete the file. You need it to create a whole new save. As said, sorry :(
<br/>
<br/>
Just mentioning twice so noone misses it!
<br/>
<br/>
I really should implement a way of updating the game and keep older savefiles!
