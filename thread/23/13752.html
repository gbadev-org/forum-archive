    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">spinal_cord, I just wanted to point out a little oversight that might affect a single person or two on the planet :P
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the Stuck Pixel Fixer, if someone has a stuck pixel in the bottom center of the screen, there might be a problem since DiagnoSe draws the text that shows the current time on top of the movable flashing box.  Maybe just disable the time for that screen/test? :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do you think you could make the touch screen select on 1 tap and not 2?  It's not like this is Microsoft Windows or something, where the first click actually does something :P
<br/>
<br/>
Also, may I ask if you have the music as an audio file?  It's awesome. :D  FLAC would be preferable (I know it's big &gt;_&gt;)... unless the original source is like MP3 or OGG.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: And can the DS REALLY tell what temperature it's running at? O_o</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The first click actually <span style="font-style: italic">does</span> do something. It 'selects' that item, you'll notice the cursor moves to the item you click on and its name appears above. I made the control system this way after adding the D-pad support for the menu, this was it isn't weirdly using two different control methods, with both systems you move to the item, then launch it.

If anyone wants to vote for it in the Dev-Fr compo, then I won't stop you...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, well, it does select it, but unlike Windows, you can't do actual actions to that selected menu choice.  I just think tapping twice is redundant, you only tap once in the DS's firmware menu!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
