    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I made this a couple of months ago but didn't release it because I was planning on adding some more features (bunkers and high scores) and gave up on it. Now that I've completely given up on it and moved on to other things, I've decided to release it without those features.
<br/>
<br/>
Other than having no bunkers, its graphics and gameplay are almost exactly the same as the original Space Invaders.

The DS is the only portable console I own. Also, when I first started this I wasn't sure how far it would go, but I had some ideas for what to use the bottom screen and stylus for. But first I wanted to get the original game coded before modifying it, and I haven't even got that finished. It's just an unfinished (but still playable) game.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://viewsourcecode.org/" target="_blank">viewsourcecode</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What is your problem?! The person makes something, and you roll in on the criticism train with one of the dumbest remarks a person could say on these forums. So he released it on the DS, and it doesn't use those things. So what! Unless you are paying the man to make it a certain way, then I suggest you back off and let him do his own thing. I'm also pretty sure you aren't making a "request" in your post, which is the only thing you can do pertaining to this project without funding it.

The least you could have done was given him some credit for his work. Sheesh...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
