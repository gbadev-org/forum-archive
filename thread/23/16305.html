    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a new version of my little score attack style shooter.. It's finished for now :)
<br/>
<br/>

It should be more difficult than the previous version, mainly because it throws a lot more enemies at you - especially in Zone 2. 
<br/>
Changes: New enemy type, more music, tweaked levels and enemy behaviours, prettified title screen.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Instructions:
<br/>
~~~
<br/>
"Get as many points as you can in one day and one night.
<br/>
<br/>
Touch your reindeer to jump.
<br/>
Touch anywhere else to shoot.
<br/>
<br/>
If an enemy touches your deer, you lose a life.
<br/>
<br/>
Shooting enemies increases the score multiplier.
<br/>
If you miss a shot, the multiplier will be reset.
<br/>
<br/>
Accuracy = more points!"
<br/>
~~~
<br/>
<br/>
Plans for eventual next version:
<br/>
<br/>
- Change the xmas theme to something more general.
<br/>
- Add more levels / environments.
<br/>
- Add more kinds of enemies.
<br/>
- Add multiple levels of terrain - so for example you can jump up onto a hill, or keep moving along at its base.
<br/>
- Maybe extend this so that there are branching levels with multiple exits.
<br/>
- Add endless mode, where terrain is randomly assembled and the goal is to get as far as possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Noted bugs:
<br/>
<br/>
- Sometimes the environmental sounds (ie, just waterfall sound fx at the moment) keep going forever once they've started.

Hi! Here's a little demo of the game I'm working on for the Drunkencoders winter coding competition. It's sort of a sleigh ridin' shooter type thing.
<br/>
<br/>
The compo doesn't end for another 3 weeks or so, but I thought it'd be a shame not to release this now since it's got santa in it. It's still a WIP though..
<br/>
<br/>
Touch your reindeer to jump. Touch anywhere else to shoot. Raise the score multiplier with accurate shooting for a chance to get a delicious invincibility pudding!
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I watched the video and that looks pretty cool.  Somehow I don't think I'm going to pull off one of the winning places again this year (I wrote Evil Santa Attacks last year).
<br/>
<br/>
I should have chose an idea like yours that's more like a platformer :S  Oh well...I may be able to pull something interesting off but I still have a long ways to go :S</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey.. re-edited the first post with the new version, since the update got lost in gbadev.org's hard drive crash.
<br/>
<br/>
Feedback is welcome, and I'd especially love to hear if anyone finds this game too hard or too easy.  It shouldn't be <span style="font-style: italic">too</span> difficult to reach the end - but hopefully challenging to get a good score. :) 
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
