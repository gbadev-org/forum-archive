    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone, its been a while since I released anything so here is a little touch screen puzzle based upon the picking demo found in the libnds examples.
<br/>
<br/>
press A to start, then touch groups of shapes as they whizz around the screen. Select three of the same type to make them go away. remove all shapes to move up a level. Game ends when time runs out.
<br/>
<br/>

Let me know what you think. I am trying to load more interesting models but for now simple shapes will have to do. Any help with that would be appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks,

The picking is a bit off, but that might not be your fault. Also, there's some quite annoying cases where two identical objects occupy more or less the same space, making it difficult to hit a specific one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've uploaded a new version with better spacing and a better view of the objects. The picking in this version seems more or less spot on. I've also added a really annoying sound for good measure. ;D<br/>_________________<br/>--------------
