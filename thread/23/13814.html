    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it's rather easy...just launch server app pick a port and max users then start up the server..
<br/>
<br/>
then launch dshobro enter in the ip of your pc 192.168.0.xxx
<br/>
<br/>
enter in the port you setup the server with and it should work
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
edit: i also have a question...
<br/>
<br/>
for example i go to <a href="http://www.fark.com" target="_blank">www.fark.com</a> i can click on lets say showbiz tab
<br/>
<br/>
but i can't click on individual links in the page...anyone got this to work or am i not doin this right...?

    <h4>#136310 - quinbd - Tue Jul 31, 2007 3:26 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK here is how to make it work.
<br/>
<br/>
1)Unzip the file
<br/>
2)double click the server and click "Start!" on the server window
<br/>
* Note server must be running while the app is running.
<br/>
3) Start-&gt;Run type "cmd"
<br/>
4) type "ipconfig" look at "IPv4 Address" that is your computers IP
<br/>
5) Start the app on the DS
<br/>
6) when it asks for the server, enter the IP of you computer
<br/>
7)Hit enter, then enter again unless you changed the port number on the server window
<br/>
8) type web address and surf!!
<br/>
<br/>
*Troubleshooting
<br/>
1) Unless you have a static IP your computers IP will change every time you restart the computer.
<br/>
2) You may need to port forward port 666 to the ip of you computer. To do this look <a class="postlink" href="http://www.portforward.com/english/applications/port_forwarding/Utor/Utorindex.htm" target="_blank">here.</a>
<br/>
3) And you might have to allow the program or port through a firewall. But it worked fine with the windows vista firewall.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And you know  that you can use your internal network ip (usually 192.168.*.* - just type ipconfig at a command prompt) and still connect, right? Just through <span style="font-style: italic">your</span> wireless router though.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

 I want the internet in mi DS to see the Live Timing of F1 xD while I'm watching Tv, so i think i need a browser with java in order to be able to open the live timing window of the f1 website. Do you know what can i do with the program to make it run? Do you know another browser program that can allow me to do that?
