    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ported this over the weekend, I think it's in a state now where some people will be able to use it. Initial reports are that it has issues running on CF-based carts, I only have a SuperCard SD to test with so I haven't been able to debug it on CF to see what's going on.

Built against SaTa's modified FAT libraries from REIN (SD users probably want this):

<br/>
<br/>
Copy it to your media, then copy over the Genesis ROMs you want to play (it should be able to play ROMs with .BIN, .GEN, and .SMD extensions). There's no sound, but since it uses the Cyclone 68k core which is optimized for ARM it runs well for the most part. Scaling is done in-software right now so the downscale isn't as fast or good as it could be. There's no double buffering yet so you might see tearing on some games. Y/B/A are A/B/C.

Genesis is definietly a good system to have an emulator for.

Regarding sound... does the emulator you are porting support sound? (I'm just wondering if there's any chance that would happen some day :) )<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

great, great, great stuff. the only game i've found to be really playable at this point is rocket knight adventures, but, still, i can't wait to see more.

if i may ask, why isn't the image scaled to the full resolution of the DS's screen? you're scaling in software, you said?

But is it me or the game screen isn't using the entire DS resolution ? There's some black borders, like with the GBA titles.

The speed is really good for a first version, and the compabitility too (the three games I tested worked without any graphicals glitches)
<br/>
<br/>
An "unscaled mode" with a way to scroll up/down the screen wouldn't be bad though one day, or maybe if the entire DS screen is used, the scaling would look a bit better (with some games, the text is a bit hard to read, like Ragnacenty (not sure of the name), "Soleil" for the french name.

Maybe you could benefit from looking at GENS sourcecode; And, if you could contact Steve Snake, author of the best DOS-era genesis emulator (KGEN98) and one of the best windows genesis emulators (Kega fusion), then your PicodriveDS could improve a lot, quickly...

Speed is already really good for a first version.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I didn't put it on the list cuz the speed isn't fixed yet, but some games are too fast lol ^^

<br/>
Maybe the sound, if implementend would make problems to have full speed, but at least, the emu can stay without sound, that's not a big deal on portable.

We're not talking about a little speed hit because of sound. It's a major hit. Probably the same for the DS at this point. Most important is to get the games up to speed, and then see about sound. After all, you're playing the games, not listening to them. Sound enhances gameplay, but it isn't gameplay :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sound is a HUGE part of the enjoyment of a game, but a game is often unplayable if the speed isnt high enough.

Its not an OR.

<br/>
As for this emu, its very early days.
<br/>
However, I dont think sound is impossible, its just going to take a little while.

(its not like say, the snes emu on the gba were it needs every last cycle)

Remember also, we have a near-perfect SMS emulator for the GBA with sound.

- The three scaled modes are nice, even the little one (the one of the old releases) is maybe a bit useless but if it don't bug or slowdown something, that's not a problem

An option to jump 10 roms after or before with the Left-Right D-PAD Arrow wouldn't be a bad idea though, but that's not hurry.

hmmm, personally, I prefer it stay to L (and the position to R) than have to use some things like "? + ?" or another "? + ?", but at least, a "redefinite key" menu is possible one day.

You can, anyway, play Street Fighter with 6 buttons, just use 4 buttons like all Snk Games (Low Punch / Low Kick / High Punch / High Kick).

In the olds days, I was playing it with a 3 buttons controllers for the 2nd player (High Punch / High Kick) and I don't think lot of people use the Low/Med/High, at least, just two of them).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Updateing the screen more often then the game sprites could possibly be moveing at is a bit pointless.

I think most megadrive games were about 25fps, but I could be wrong.

Any framerate above 20 I find my eyes can adjust too, as long as its "stable". (eg, a stable 20 is better then jumping between 30-60)

About the scaling problem with the game using the smaller resolution, I think, if you decide to fix it that a choice on a
<br/>
menu is the best way. They aren't a lot of games which are using it (5 of the 30 games I test, so an average of 1.6% right now).
<br/>
Another way would be to check the header of those roms and if they are in the database of the emu, the emu change the scaling of the rom, but I found that hard to update. If you decide to support all the version of all the roms, it'll cost you a lot of time to add them all.
<br/>
<br/>
I think a menu like "Fixed scaling for games using ???x??? resolution : Yes - No" is more than enough.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the SC SD seems to support only 60 files by folder, so an option in the rom list menu which bring you back on the [..] (to go out a directory fast, cuz if you are on the last rom, you need to make "up/up/up/etc..." and even with an option to jump "ten by ten", it wouldn't be perfect) by pushing "B" for example (DS "B", but the Genesis one on your emu is the same anyway ^^ Most of games I saw use this button to go back from a menu) would be cool ^^;

<br/>
In most platformers, when you get hit, your character starts blinking, by making the sprite disappear and reappear. The reason the character disappears in these games is the low frame rate of the emulator. The emulator skips frames to get the speed as close to 100% as possible, and ends up skipping the frames where your character is visible.
<br/>
<br/>
The only way I can imagine to fix it would be to improve the frame rate.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

also, not all six button controllers had a mode button. The mode button wasn't used in gameplay, so it could be a touch screen button, or ommited entirley.

Why use buttom combos? There's a fully functional touch screen on the system, settings could go there.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by M3d10n on Sun Jun 11, 2006 12:30 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

The SRAM feature is not the same thing as savestates. Basically it emulates a Genesis cart's internal Save RAM, and whenever the SRAM is written to it writes out (romname).srm. When you load a game, it looks to see if that SRAM file is there and loads it if so.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No. Because you can try Sonic 1 &amp; Knuckles, the game works (press A+B+C+START to get the "real game"), Sonic 2 &amp; Knucles also work if I remember right.
<br/>

Some games don't work, yeah, like Super Street Fighter 2 (the size of the rom is recognized to zero), but It can be fixed I think (or bad rom, but I don't think so)

That's not guaranteed. Hardware rendering needs scaling in order to fit 320x224 pixels on a 256x192 pixel screen.

Currently PicoDriveDS just tries to malloc however large the ROM is and fread it into memory, if that fails it's going to crash. The DS only has 4MB of RAM, and some of that is used by PicoDriveDS itself, so I would need to come up with something for large ROMs that can malloc as much as it can and then cache data from the cart using something like LRU to reduce cache misses.

OK, I never used a Megadrive so I don't know exactly how their save system worked.

Great, I'll try it tonight.

I'll take your word for it, but generally with the supercard you need to save sram to SD for it stay after poweroff.

<br/>
Also, if I play a different game sram will be overwritten.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Love this emulator, but i have some suggestions:
<br/>
<br/>
-Sound, please!!!
<br/>
<br/>
-When you hit Select to choose another game, and maybe you want to go back to keep playing that game, you cant...  Maybe make it so that if select is hit again, it resumes the game...
<br/>
<br/>
-And you can add alot more menus/settings by using the touchscreen to enable the menu for loads, saves, etc...
<br/>
<br/>
-and is there any way to improve the speed of the game, theres a bit of delay which can get annoying...

The logical behaviour would be to use the select button like a "pause" one: I play, press Select to change game, change my mind, press select one more time to go back when I first pressed it.
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, wait for another game being selected before stopping the emulation. that way if I press select by error, I can still go back to my game without crying to death for the lost game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
for M3, the easiest way to get it to work is to load Pepsiman's loader with my batch file. You can get that at <a class="postlink" href="http://myweb.cableone.net/takieda/bin/bootloader_v1.1.rar" target="_blank">http://myweb.cableone.net/takieda/bin/bootloader_v1.1.rar</a>
<br/>
(yeah, I know, it's just hosted on my isp - all other filehosts seem to think my files are somehow "illegal" and keep deleting my account)
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, just download the file and read the readme.txt file. It will append the loader onto your .nds file allowing you to press A instead of Start to start ANY homebrew that you have that problem with.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

and I think you could win with your new release. You just have give picodrive ez4 support. I switched over (sold my supercard), so I'm missing picodrive for now. Thinking about selling my ez4 and getting the supercard lite. Couldn't you give picodrive the ability to build roms into the emulator like the others that work for EZ4 (NESDS)? You might not have time to enter the EZ4 contest, but EZ4 support would still be really cool.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Either post the source for public (afaik PicoDrive is GPL) to allow people to rewrite the GPU core for dynamic recompilation, or either do it yourself.

All you've done is GUI fixes/addons and you keep calling it a 'new version' altho the emulation core still stays the same...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">PicoDrive is not GPL, although I wish it were because then I could host the SVN repo on Google Code without relicensing it, and TheLazy1 could use Cyclone in his vMac port. The only licensing terms are "free for non-commercial use", but anyone who has ever asked me for the source (including you) has gotten it. You've had the original source for 2 months now, I would expect that if I were going to get patches back from you for a new renderer it would have already happened, given that you're much more experienced with the DS video hardware than me and it wouldn't take you nearly as long. The reason the source isn't up for public download is because, since I don't have a good public SVN repo for it and the code is in flux, I'd prefer the source tarball to actually match a release version (and the restructures after 0.1.4 cleaned up the build process greatly). Due to a lot of backend changes, the scanline renderer (which was the renderer for all previous releases) is broken on the current code branch, so I don't think people would be too happy if I released it like that. I'd rather continue to focus my time on the NDS native frame renderer than refix the scanline renderer.
<br/>
<br/>
Those first few releases were iterative in order to fix bugs and make enhancements I felt needed to be made early on in order to get the "basic" functionality working, so that there would be less complaints when I can't focus as much time on the project. That is why the version numbers are what they are. I've never claimed that I've been doing any great thing here, most of the credit rightfully belongs to Dave/notaz/reesy.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Ryan FB on Mon Aug 07, 2006 6:31 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

It's read-only, and the cart insertion check always returns true, so I'd pretty much have to make a separate build just for EZ4 (which does work). One thing I've gotten working in the past few days though is appended ROM support, meaning you can just "cat" or "copy /b" a ROM on to the PicoDriveDS binary and it will load it (pretty much every flash cart can use this method, except maybe some of the bleeding edge Slot-1-only carts like the DS-Xtreme which might not emulate GBA ROM space).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">PicoDriveDS 0.1.5 is up! Changes:<ul><li>Added support for appended ROMs. This should allow users with carts not supported by gba_nds_fat to use PicoDriveDS. Simply append a ROM to the PicoDriveDS binary, and it will run it (on *nix systems this can be done with "cat romname.ext &gt;&gt; picodriveds.ext", on Windows with "copy /b picodriveds.ext+romname.ext picodriveds-withrom.ext", substituting the appropriate filenames of course). You can only append one ROM at a time. In this mode, Genesis SRAM will be saved to GBA SRAM. Some patchers may work correctly with this and save the SRAM to your removable media, I have only been able to test with the EZ4 Lite software.
<br/>
</li><li>Fixed M3 reset code, added M3SD Mini insertion detection code (untested, may not work)
<br/>
</li><li>Massive code restructure and cleanup (though some cleanup is still in progress)
<br/>
</li><li>Added save state support, accessed via the X button. Due to the current size of the save states, this is only supported for FAT devices and is disabled in appended ROM mode. Currently there is only one save state per ROM (saved to romname.pds). This is still a very experimental feature and save states may not be compatible with future versions of PicoDriveDS.</li></ul>Grab it <a class="postlink" href="http://cryptosystem.org/projects/nds/picodriveds-0.1.5/" target="_blank">here</a> or in the usual location.

The frame renderer, in particular the ASM frame renderer, is faster, but doesn't have nearly as much compatibility as the scanline renderer, so it's not in the default build. In the future I may make renderer choice a run-time option so people can have a good tradeoff between compatilibity and speed while the new renderers are still being developed. One of the other things I experimented with that isn't in this release is the new Cyclone core (0.00861), which worked fine for some ROMs but seemed to introduce major compatibility issues that I'll have to look into.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sounds like an HDMA problem. Like the Super NES, the Genesis has horizontal blanking DMA that can change the palette and scrolling for a given scanline. If you've been following SnezziDS development, this should sound familiar.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One other MiniSD user reported back to me and has said it's working for them with this latest change. The SMD check code goes through and looks for the sequence 0xaabb at intervals of 256bytes+0x08 in GBA ROM space, so if the card loads that in to GBA ROM space at just the right place somehow then it's going to think there's an SMD appended. That sequence is not in the PicoDriveDS binary itself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ryan FB,

I fired over an email to M3/G6 team to ask Danny for the source for FAT access.  Although I see that picodrive is *now* working with my M3 MiniSD (Using the tweaked copy of 1.5), I *did* get a response from him *and* the G6 M3 fat lib  If you like them, hit me a pm and I can e-mail them to you.

WOOT - it works - picodrive now starts and im able to browse my mini sd for roms - i tried a couple of games (Lost Vikings, Quackshot, Street Fighter 2 Turbo, Streets of Rage 2) and all except Wonderboy in Monsterworld worked..
<br/>
<br/>
Couple of question :
<br/>
<br/>
The x button and the top left button seems to be set for picordrive functions - would it be possible to use xyab and top left/right for a 6 button control pad ? you really need it for games like street fighter
<br/>
<br/>
Do you currently work on improving picodrive (i.e. the sound part?)
<br/>
<br/>

Ryan, I don't know the technicalities, but could you take a process that's going on in the arm 9, and have the other processor take care of it? Would that  speed things up? Maybe allow for less frame skips? Maybe there could be a version made for sound, and another made for speed? Or maybe you could toggle sound on and off?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, not really... it's like playing an N64 emulator on my P3 667MHz PC here with 256 MB of RAM, or my P3 700MHz PC with 128 MB of RAM.  It'd play faster on the laptop even though it's only 33MHz higher and has half the RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Besides, if he needed RAM, Supercards have 16 extra MB of it, and many more people have those than DS-slot flash cards; not to mention it's 16 extra MB instead of 4MB.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

on dreamcast, there was a md emulator that had only psg sounds, to not emulate the fm chip, i m sure it is not a heavy task for the cpu...

afaik, he's still not using the arm7 at all beyond handling the few registers the arm9 doesn't have access too, so in theory he could throw the fm chip on there.. however, getting the two to sync up properly will be a hellish task if snes emulation is any indicator, and picodrive still renders in software, so it'd probably be better to work on that first.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you mute the PSG, you lose the hi-hats and some of the instruments in a lot of games. Even in the infamous intro of <span style="font-style: italic">Zero Wing</span>, you can hear the loss of the ostinato. I believe <span style="font-style: italic">Pac-Attack</span> runs most of its sound effects off the PSG as well.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I believe you're right, but out of curiosity, do you know why the SNES's superior music and sound hardware can be emulated on the ARM 7, where as the ARM7 is too slow to emulate the YM2612? I know PocketSPC is written in asm, but I believe the GP2X's picodrive's YM2612 is as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm guessing it has something to do with an <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impedance_mismatch" target="_blank">impedance mismatch</a> between the architectures. Both the Super NES DSP and the Nintendo DS audio hardware are sample playback devices, while the Yamaha chip is an FM synthesizer.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The YM2612 is actually quite a powerful chip for an FM synthesizer.  Simulating it in software ends up being more complex (and slower) than the SPC700.  Plus the Z80 needs to be emulated as well, and that by itself is going to put the arm7 near it's processing limits.
<br/>
<br/>
FM synthesizers require a lot of calculation per sample, while the arm7 version of pocketspc cheats and skips sample filtering and a few other effects for speed purposes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">when i was talking about PSG, i meant to replace all fm voices by psg sounds as well, as it was on the emulator running on dreamcast
<br/>
of course, it sounds sucky, but, it s still a good way to hear all voices on a game, without using much cpu (better than nothing)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
