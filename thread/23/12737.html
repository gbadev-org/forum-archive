<br/>
<br/>
This is my first submission so go easy on me.  
<br/>
<br/>
It is a clone of a certain pocket pc game that I find pretty amusing on rainy days (I hope it hasn't already been made).
<br/>
<br/>
PALIB made things so easy and quick to code up.
<br/>
<br/>
Check it out and let me know what you think. The main music was done by a friend of mine named Grymmjack (not the music when you win though... not sure where I found that or else I'd give credit).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yep, one in the same.  Actually I didn't realize the game went back so far...  I thought it was introduced on the Pocket PC as jawbreaker.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice job!  Between this and DSameGame, I can be entertained for quite some time.  Personally I feel it's a bit too static, and that a very short animation showing the remaining blocks falling down would make it more lively, but it works well as it is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
