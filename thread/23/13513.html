    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Absolutely f**king awesome! I've been thinking of coding something like this myself!
<br/>
<br/>
The brush is beautiful. But as a photoshop-junkie, I have some features I would like to see: (don't kill me if some of them are already there)
<br/>
<br/>
- Pressure controlling brush-size as well as opacity
<br/>
- A control for how much it should affect opacity
<br/>
- A color-picker from the image. I draw a lot by plotting out an initial palette on the canvas, and picking colors from there.
<br/>
- Undo ;)
<br/>
<br/>
edit: okay, just found the eyedropper-tool. Awesome.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Something to change all the time, much like the size of the brush. Basicly I want the same thing as the "opacity"-selector in Photoshop. This is often you're going from sketching to painting details. Or when you want to slightly adjust a color or something.

No, seriously. When you already have that playback-feature, I guess undo would be quite easy to implement, no? And it IS handy. Especially, since the pen-code isn't 100% stable, so every now and then I get a stroke over the entire screen...
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and here's my first little droodle:

Well. You would have to sit through the whole playback thing each time you wanted to do an undo. I guess I could autosave from time to time, so I could just playback from there to speed things up, but it would be kind of a hazzle. I would like to get the stylus jumping thing even better though, and with that 100% perfect, undo wouldn't be needed that much.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm really happy to see that you've managed to paint something already. More of that! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">truly a neat start ! I was dreaming of a software like this one. I agree with keeping the simple but effective functions.
<br/>
An opacity slider could help you're right Kusma and an option to get rid of the pressure sensitivity would make my day.
<br/>
A pen who makes patterns like screentones (as in the Oekaki boards) would be cool aswell.
<br/>
My last request is for us the poor lefthanded human beings, just an option to flip the functions assigned (pleaz ^^)
<br/>
Thanks a lot Jesse ! (undos are baaaad)

The pressure-sensitivity amazes me (done with a coordinate sampling average or something?), but the cursors are the real bonus for me.  The combination lets me only make faint marks to determine where the cursor is at so I can make permanent marks almost exactly where I want.  A combination of this/Phidias would make my day.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">a quick bug-report: The initial brush-size is not stored when clearing the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
steps to reproduce:
<br/>
- Set brush to a big size
<br/>
- Clear screen
<br/>
- Draw a line
<br/>
- Set brush to a small size
<br/>
- Replay
<br/>
<br/>
The result is the line drawn with the thin brush, not the big one as it was drawn.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#132289 - kusma - Mon Jun 25, 2007 3:35 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just a quick fill-in on the bug above: The same thing applies to the color. It seems the entire brush-setting isn't stored. I need to go change it before I do anything if I want replay to work properly.
<br/>
<br/>
Some more quick feature-requests:
<br/>
- Clear to current color. I often use darker background-colors when I paint. This makes it easier to work with variations of colors without having to draw the entire screen.
<br/>
- PC-side replayer that dumps frames to disk. This would make speed-painting videos easy to create. :)
<br/>
- Brush hardness selection. This might make very small brushes more practical to use, as they currently alias quite ugly.
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, this app has quickly gone to the top of my favorite-list of homebrew apps. It's totally awesome!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Very good job on colors, finally something that really allows me do sketch freely and smoothly. The Pressure is just amazing and gives a very natural feel.
<br/>
<br/>
As for improvements I'm going to give another vote for the lefties, it's just too awkward for us lefties to work with the current keymap. maybe even make it customizable thru an xml or txt file, this would make it even more flexible. It would be nice to use Y or X for the palette too, especially if your  using it on a tabletop.
<br/>
<br/>
Setting for size/sensitivity.
<br/>
<br/>
Tune Sensitivity - It's easy to start trans and go to opaque, but the other way around is very hard to do.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to see a quick mixing panel so you could mix colors and then pick the ones u want to use. U can do this on the image, but it really isn't the same.
<br/>
<br/>
Remember last zoom position - saves from having to pan so much.
<br/>
<br/>
Show border in zoom - gives the ability to paint off the canvas, especially good for making borders and going off board with the brush.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a very quick doodle :)

Using the same forumla as many other as basis I just just tweaked the result of it until it felt right. Also, there is some averaging based on time in there that you can notice if try to make a new hard brush-stroke while moving very quickly. You will see that it fades in before going fully opaque.

I'm curious about what values the calibration tool reports on different DSs, so if you've been having problem with the pressure sensitivity, please select pressure calibration in the menu and let me know what value you end up using for "hard touch" along with the type of DS you have.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hard: <span style="font-weight: bold">100</span>
<br/>
Soft: <span style="font-weight: bold">125</span>

Actually I set Hard to 110 so I don't damage my screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using an old-style DS from Australia.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: The response to pressure at the left and right edges of the screen isn't as good. I guess it's a problem with the hardware. Maybe you could have a calibration matrix for the whole screen? I imagine that'd be a pain, though.

<br/>
It has a really nice 'feel', and the controls are totally intuitive.  It's smooth and there's no real 'lag' I can tell between using the stylus and the image actually being updated :P
<br/>
<br/>
I also like that the color selector has a non-used 'border' around it (some apps like Phidias have selectors that go all the way to a screen edge, which can be hard to register on some DSes)
<br/>
<br/>
Tried v1.02 on a recent Onyx Lite w/both a SuperCard CF &amp; R4DS here, and pressure sensitivity worked fine with default values...I need to play around with the configuration a little bit to get it perfect since I'm using a screen protector though :)  ...and the pressure sensitivity totally surprised me since I didn't even know the DS supported such a thing :D

<br/>
Touch pressure can be read from the touchscreen hardware. See the datasheet for the Texas Instruments TSC2046 touch screen controller.
<br/>
<br/>
My Euro DS lite gives:
<br/>
<br/>
hard 80
<br/>
lightly 110
<br/>
<br/>
I could not get a opaque line with version 1.01 but can in 1.02.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that use of the pressure measurement given in the datasheet is to detect stylus or finger touch. Using my finger I get:
<br/>
<br/>
hard 23
<br/>
light 70 to 194
<br/>
<br/>
The light finger touch is difficult to get to register and varies greatly.
<br/>
<br/>
I also get the fading at the left and right edges (this is fine on my DS Fat so probably a change in the construction).
<br/>
<br/>
On my old DS Fat:
<br/>
<br/>
hard 42
<br/>
light 71
<br/>
<br/>
finger hard 14
<br/>
finger light 74
<br/>
<br/>
Finger painting does not work very well on either DS unless I increase (reducing the pressure) the hard calibration value (eg 22 on the DS fat).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

After patching DLDI we can save, but we get corrupted png.

Png is corrupted and hangs up color when trying to load. It cant be displayed on PC neither.

<br/>
<br/>
I've got an Aussie DS Lite, and my stable calibration settings are as follows:
<br/>
Hard: between 30 and 50, erring towards 30
<br/>
Light: between 30 and 70
<br/>
<br/>
Like a previous poster, I typically need "Hard" to be around 40 in order for it to register a full-opacity stroke in practise.
<br/>
"Light" is basically ok around 60-70, though during calibration, if I tap <span style="font-style: italic">very</span> lightly, I can see the numbers jump from about 135 to 100 down to the above range, in milliseconds.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing of note, brush center never actually registers at the bottom edge of the screen (about 5mm or so), so past a certain threshold, it will still move left and right, but stay at a fixed y value.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It was working perfectly in comercial titles. I tried recalibrating anyway - still have the same effect.

That must be my console problem - i tried this on 4 other conosles and it works perfectly there.

So first my calibration values are a clear 60-65 for the hard, the light really jumps everywhere, but goes around 90-120, sometimes registers 70 80 150 200. since there's no visual feedback it's actually hard to tell if you really are pressing allthat lightly.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I hadn't reported earlier but with my DS-X firmware 1.1.2, I get some corruption on the top screen, a strip or randomly colored bright pixels fading in and out, on the 2nd fith of the screen, from bottom to top. It doesn't bother me, but no harm in letting know.

After closer examination of one of the DS i tested it on, it seems that the brush is offsyncing with stylus in lover areas of the screen, but to the right not to the the up.

I also tried version 1.01 - and it cant save proper png neither. It might be some problem where pnglib and DLDI meets on Supercard DS ONE.

It seems that you are not reading calibration data at all.

Another idea for improvement. Could you please make calibration data saved? It seems that we need to set it every time we start the program.

BTW. it seems that the pressure settings are dependent either on battery status or temperature.

If Jesse would implement contorl of the playback (pause/play/stop/move1strokeForward - i think no rewind &lt;- that would be too hard) we could revert to any moment in the painting history.

As for temperature/batery influence - it seems that temperature has some but minimal influence, and bateries start to influence when they are near discharge. I tested it within 20-30 celcius degrees range.

That plus forward one at a time strokes would work. The only problem is memory usage. One picture takes almost 400KB in memory, if layers are planned, that would up memory usage even more, so there wouldnt be much left for undos. And saving to the card  would be too slow.

There is another thing about the <span style="font-weight: bold">saves</span> that bothers me. It saves to the root directory, making it messed up. Since there is no way to know from where the rom has been launched we cannot save to the current dir. But we could use method that is used in Lemmings. We could have Colors in a directory, and store one config file in the root direcotry where name of the color directory is stored. That way we could save into Colors directory and have only one file in root. Of course this is the last important thing form sugestions presented here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Jesse &lt;&gt; As people start to post some pictures and feedback, I'm wondering if a thread dedicated to the everyday use of Colors could be nice (wether on this forum or not). I'm only asking this because I don't know if you want to keep this thread "Colors technical feedback wise" only or not.
<br/>
It can be practical to have all the drawings centralised, just to make it easy for the new user to see what could be made in Colors.(and how Colors brightens your everyday life as a digital sketchaddict)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alrighty. I'm traveling quite extensivly right now so I may not be very responsive.
<br/>
<br/>
First off: Thanks so much for all the feedback and images you are posting. That's the kind of stuff that makes me happy and it's really cool to see how helpful people are here. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Quick comments to the last batch of posts:
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;1. Are you sure check when clearing screen. 
<br/>
Agreed. I going to work do the basis for a neat UI in the next couple of versions and will try to take care of stuff like that.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;2. Skipping loading of the png if it is corrupt or missing. 
<br/>
Agreed. Will fix.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Clear to selected color
<br/>
Hmm. Actually I'm quite fond of not having that. I like picking a color and a big brush to wipe the screen. Let's see if more people request it.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;The Supercard problem
<br/>
This is a real bummer and I'm not sure how to proceed on this one. Is there another homebrew app that saves .pngs (or other large files) that you could try to see if they have the same problem?
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;It seems that you are not reading calibration data at all. 
<br/>
You may be right, I'll look into that.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Could you please make calibration data saved?
<br/>
Sure! I'll fix that along with the UI update.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;do you know if there's a way to set the luminosity to high level and keep it this way on reboot ? 
<br/>
I'll look into it.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Just one more question, is it possible to store more than eight drawings ? 
<br/>
Yes, but as you may have understood by now I have a slight fetish for limitations. :)
<br/>
But I understand the need, so I'll try to figure something out.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;One thing I would like to see is more brush configuration
<br/>
I've planned to do some additional brush options in future version, but still keeping it very simple.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;As for temperature/batery influence 
<br/>
That is very interesting. I'm also planning to work a bit more on the pressure calibration to take care of the problem where it's not as sensitive on the left/right sides of the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;There is another thing about the saves that bothers me. It saves to the root directory, making it messed up
<br/>
I totally agree. I know there is work going on with libnds and libfat so you can know where you lanched from, but I will probably do some quick fix as suggested before that.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;It can be practical to have all the drawings centralised
<br/>
Yes, I would like to do that on my website somehow but I'm not that used to working with websites, so it's probably going to take a while.
<br/>

After i think of that its cool the way it is. Its part of the fun to prepare your background color.

<br/>

<br/>
There is simple drawing program in DSOrganizer where you can draw pictures and save them as PNG, but they are only 256x192.
<br/>
It works ok there. AFAIK there is source code available (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.dragonminded.com/?loc=ndsdev/DSOrganize" target="_blank">http://www.dragonminded.com/?loc=ndsdev/DSOrganize</a>).
<br/>
I ll look for other applications that i could test the issue with.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;Could you please make calibration data saved?
<br/>
&gt; Sure! I'll fix that along with the UI update.
<br/>
That's the thing we can live with. It would be cool if it was fixed, but dont make it priority.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;As for temperature/batery influence 
<br/>
&gt; That is very interesting. I'm also planning to work a bit more on the 
<br/>
&gt; pressure calibration to take care of the problem where it's not as 
<br/>
&gt; sensitive on the left/right sides of the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
In the official SDK there is no pressure available, and Nintendo advises that you shouldnt put any UI elements near the border of the screen because it can make problems on some systems. (4 border pixels on each side) so it might be not so easy.
<br/>
<br/>
Also note that use of HORI protective foil makes screen a little less sensitive.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;It can be practical to have all the drawings centralised
<br/>
&gt; Yes, I would like to do that on my website somehow but I'm not that 
<br/>

<br/>
I used to work with websites a bit in the past so i can help. Also server with database/php/whatever we need should not be a problem.

In fact I like the idea of having some limits to play with. But as overdoing is very easy as such low scale, you can't go in crazy sketching mode. I've just realized that you are willing us to learn patience, understanding and true eye vision through Colors, let's get under chinese waterfalls with waterproof DS ;)
<br/>
In a way drawing on a DS is a big advantage : it fools everybody, because people think you are actually playing a game, and don't notice your presence because you're a nerd, you can draw them all!
<br/>
<br/>
JetBoy, the drawing from your mate seems very good (I like those dynamic shapes). I'm sure the gallery will grow quickly.
<br/>
<br/>
I've also found that (on the  M3lite) if you set the brightness in Moonshell in "extend" mode and reboot : the settings are kept in Colors.

I sent the email. I ll contact you that way since now, but i ll still post ideas here. Speaking of what:
<br/>
<br/>
We have caught ourselves many times in an event that we started painting in zoom mode being sure we paint on full screen. That happens pretty offten when we start drawing, so  a way to warn that we are in zoom mode would be pretty cool. Maybe some sprite ona another layer showing magnifying glass, or a frame in the upper screen showing which part of the screen is zoomed.
<br/>
Maybe sprite could move away from the stylus, so you could paint on the whole screem, or maybe its too disturbing.
<br/>
<br/>
Would smoodge tool be hard to implement? Isn't it against your plan to keep Colors simple?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Since the the left/right screen sensitive problem is not present on all hardware (DS lite only?) I would recommend not trying to compensate for it in software.
<br/>
One way to avoid the problem would be to allow the user to move the drawing area (similar as to how you can when zoomed) so that the edge of the drawing area is somewhere in the middle of the touchscreen. This would also remove the problem where people cannot draw right to the edge on their touchscreens.
<br/>
Maybe an idea to move the pressure calibration boxes into the middle of the screen though to provide the best response/values.
<br/>

As for the lack of undo, I like it as you are forced to draw over your mistakes or incorporate them some other way into the picture and then you get to see this process in the replay.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
It may not be necceary. The problem where people cannot reach the boreders is mainly because stylus position-calibration data is not read and set properly. However the problem with less sensivity near the borders persists. I would sugest fixing position-calibration first then obserwing how it behaves.

Only problem I had was drawing on my phat DS near the left/right edges of the screen in the centre. No matter how hard I pressed, it wouldn't draw a thing. No problem at the top/bottom of the screen or in the corners though. Anyone else had this happen? Hard registered as 95, soft as 102 FWIW.

I got a C at GCSE art and I can see why now ;-P so I won't make you suffer my rubbish plant and broom still life.

There is no point in doing this. Suitable pressure settings differ per individual system. I tested this on about 8 different machines. However feature to save the pressets is planed, so you wouldnt need to set it up on your system more than once.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As I posted earlier, your software ran OK on my R4DS but there?s is a small problem I noticed when using it in two DSs: when you draw on the bottom of the scren with a small brush it does not cover the area you are touch but a little upper. as you paint ao the bottom sides of the screen the circle mark goes upper, it gets mismatched to your pen by around 3 or four milimiters. do you know why that happens?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

May I reply to you.

The problem you are describing is most probably caused by not reading stylus position calibration (the one you set in nds-firmware).  Jesse knows about it and is going to work on it in one of the next versions. He said that some post earlier.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My i explain again. Normaly it works like this (highly simplified):
<br/>
<br/>
1. read calibration data from DS
<br/>
2. initialize stylus reader with the data read in point 1.
<br/>
3. the rest of the program
<br/>
<br/>
It seems like in colors part 1 is skipped or not working properly. 
<br/>
That means whatever way you calibrate your DS input, you will get the same result in colors. Or in other words - we cant do anything about it untill Jesse will fix that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

[edit]
<br/>
OMFG, that's very very strange, you know where the clocks come from ? from the Ninja DS menu (although the clocks in colors appear more 'oval' and with nothing to show the time) 
<br/>
<br/>
I've learned that the EZ4 has the same problem, although it just shows the ez4 logo..
<br/>
<br/>
That's very strange... I can't wait to know what is the source of the problem..
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PS: note that the clock is only on the bottom screen in the begining, when I enter the homebrew launcher, the clock isn't there anymore (the bottom screen being used to show the homebrews while the top screen is unused)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, well, it seems like someone had graphical glitches too when loading from DS organize.. he said you should clear VRAM, I guess that would be a good idea.. I still wonder why there are 2 'clocks' and why they are fading out, fading in though</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by mastertop101 on Fri Jun 29, 2007 9:13 pm; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

And also, it's good that you two aren't being hostile to each other!

Thanks Tassu and Jesse!
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I noticed small bugs. Although I suppose the error is based on the DS hardware.
<br/>
Both programs don't handle fast, repeated strokes very well. Although they do fine if I don't lift off the stylus, they can't seem to catch up with, say, a speedy crosshatching. I'm assuming it's the limitations of the DS hardware, though?
<br/>
<br/>
Tassu: Phidias also has a bug where if you Smudge the bottom of the screen, artifacts appear. (That is, using the smudge tool and dragging the stylus from bottom to top)It is as if there is a very thin black line on the bottom border. And yeah, the smudge always appears black, regardless of any color choices.(Note: only tested on 256x192.)

<br/>
It's interesting you say the "earlier" versions, because I too feel the same way. I noticed the pencil tool changed from the previous version. It will now show an opaque pencil stroke while the stylus is down, and darken it up once the stylus is lifted. This makes sketching very difficult, especially when creating shadows or thick lines. I found that to sketch as I did in previous builds, I had to create a new brush and then use the paintbrush instead of the pencil tool. The pencil tool adds a grain effect now, and I think that's what the problem is. With the right brush settings and opacity, I'm back to normal in Phideas again, so all is good.
<br/>
<br/>
After having a go with Colors, I found the difference between the two to be perfect. I now have to great outlets for whatever my creative mood is.
<br/>
<br/>
I quite enjoy the streamlined workflow of Colors, it's down right perfect IMHO. There's really not much I need to do or think about when I have to change things, and I value that because it lets me focus more on painting :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But i'm not writing for that - i wanted to thank those who are uploading pictures (awesome!), and say that until digg-it mechanism is in place, i ll make it so recent pictures show on top.  I want to add zip support so  you can download png, drw, tmb files at once.

Do you know you're placing your artwork into the public domain by posting them here? If you were to look at the terms and conditions here, you'd find that they are really vague, and protect no one without each party specifically implying their intentions/limitations/restrictions with each post. Who's got time for that?

Legally, this can go both ways if you guys wanted to push and shove about it, believe me, I've had court cases like this with my company already.

I think a simple "Images uploaded will be made available to the public" or something should suffice. The important part is to make it apparent that the pictures are put online. Perhaps you should state the intended use explicitly?

In any case, there are a couple of features that I think would be useful:
<br/>
<br/>
The first is the ability to name your images whatever you want when you save them. 
<br/>
<br/>
The second is more of a niggle of mine. I'd like the images and so forth to be saved to the colors directory, or maybe a subdirectory (or even more pedantic, different folders for each drawing's files withing a /imgs/ subdirectory). I mostly suggest this because I really dislike clutter in my DS's folders.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Please dont make any drama out of it. I put those pictures there when there was no way to upload them. Now there is and everyone who wants to put one's pictures can do so. I work on the site for fun, so if there are any chances for getting into troubles i would gladly avoid them.
<br/>
<br/>
Please note that those pictures will be manipulated. First they are made into 256x192 "thumbnail", then both small and normal versions are compressed as jpg (65 quality for thumbs, 90 quality for normal ones). You still can download original png both as a separate link and in zip archive. I do it to conserve bandwith. With recent changes it uses 1/4 of the previous version bandwith, while there is no easily visible picture degradation. The bandwith is not a concern at the moment, but it will be in the long run.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

Your picture is distorted because you apply additional image manipulation in some other software than colors and save picture of different proportions.
<br/>
<br/>
The Jesse's original  idea behind the webpage was so people can send their images via wifi straight from DS, and download other's pictures back to DS to watch how they were paint. That part is not ready yet and will take some time to complete. You have to upload files manualy, but we still want people to be able to get pictures copied to DS manualy and be able to read them on DS. If one does not want to put drw file, that's a pitty, but that is one's choice. We will rather take picture without drw file than not take picture at all, but we encourage you to upload them. 
<br/>
<br/>
Watching as those pictures were paint is both fun, and a learning experience. 
<br/>
<br/>
I havent got reply from Jesse on this topic as he travels alot recently and is away from his computer, but maybe there will be a way to set in DS which way the image should be viewed, so i could read it when you upload your file and I could display it properly on the website, while leaving proper png, so it can read properly on DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I understand your desire as an artist to be able to manipulate your picture as you like before you publish them, however we want untouched Colors! pictures in Colors! gallery if possible.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

The problem is i assumed that all pictures come straight from Colors! and didnt put the code to scale them with correct aspect ratio.

Anyway, i have a feeling i hijacked the thread. Its now more about gallery than it is about Colors! Sorry, about that.

-the png does not appear correctely (yes, I am using a supercard) . Maybe export to bmp can fix the prob?

-when the draw is a little more worked, the program, when saving, does not save. Instead, stay sayng "saving" ad eternium.

But the program itself is great. Nice application for ds. I did not knew that ds had touch sensitive input. I cant wait the next version, and sometimes I draw somethings just for fun. Its very good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Are you using DLDI patches from this page?

Please don't - they dont work for SuperCard so well.

Instead use patches from

If you are using slot 2 CuperCard - first try dldi patches fot you model (flash, sd or lite), and if it does not work, try patches for other models of SuperCard. Please report your results. Thank you.

AFAIK there is no real undo planned, but maybe there will be a way to stop the replay, and start painting from that point on. Annoying enough not to use it too often, but working right enough to fix problems in serious cases.

That is perfectly ok.

<br/>
Question for <span style="font-weight: bold">Jesse</span>. As for the drw files, how big can they be? The largest i have seen so far is 960KB (Sleeping Kayu by Shtroodle <a href="http://colors.brombra.net/details.php?i=40" target="_blank">http://colors.brombra.net/details.php?i=40</a> ). 
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some kind of compression would be appropriate? Something simple so it would load/save/send via WiFi fast. On the other hand it might be not worth the trouble. Btw. at the moment website can accept files as big as 1444000 bytes, but i can up the limit if needed. How big drw file can be fit into DS memory?<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

I am noticing a bug though. Sorry if this has been mentioned already but I occasionally get a stray line that draws from the right side of the screen to my current drawing position. I have actually seen this in other games where they let you doodle a logo. In Tony Hawk American sk8land (sp?) the logo editor has this problem much more than Colors seems to have. Has anyone else experienced this? I thought perhaps it was reading pressure on the ds as a screen press although I don't think I was touching the side of the screen.

I did a sketch lastnight (Sheer-Kahn on gallery site) to see if I could "deal" with the off-center brush when it's smaller than about 5 pixels, and it's not that bad. After about 10 minutes you start to get a "feel" for it, and if you can actually believe it, I prefer it this way..
<br/>
<br/>
Why? Well, this isn't exactly pencil to paper, and when doing stuff in tight places it's almost impossible to see beyond the stubby NDS Stylus tip, as opposed to my mechanical .05mm pencil tip. With the off-center, I can carve away pixels without having to wonder what's below my stylus.
<br/>
<br/>
One suggestion would be to allow for handle points on the brush, either the corners or the middle depending on the user's preference. Additionally, a checkbox to show or hide the outline of your brush would be very very helpful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Stylus jumping is a problem with the touch screen. You can see people coping with it in some of the drw files on the gallery (ragdoll by gibo for example). There are <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10925" target="_blank">threads</a> discussing it and how to over come it. As you say, it is present in some commercial games.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unreasonable request/suggestion:
<br/>
One thing I would like to see on the gallery website is a drw file viewer. Maybe a Java applet or something that can playback the drw file. Being Java it could easily be adapted into a PC app for producing high res pictures.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

first of all: Great tool! I love it.

If it just would work with my card:
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using an 2GB N-Card, but I've the same problems like the SuperCard-Users: I cannot save! I've patched the tool with the DLDI-File for my card, but the only result is that i now can load pictures, but still no saving. I also tried the SuperCard DLDIs, but that didn't work either.
<br/>
<br/>
I also updated the system of the card, but still no changes. 
<br/>
<br/>
At the DLDIWiki there's an info that says "Can be set Read-only", but I don't know what to to with that sentence. The DLDI-Tools (GUI and Command-Line) are not offering options to activate/deactivate a parameter like that.

Any suggestions?

That seems like a problem with DLDI driver. Not much that Jesse can do about it. That is a pain. All you can do is wait for updated drivers, or get new card - i would suggest R4 or SuperCard DS-ONE.
<br/>
<br/>
Or you can try drivers form the <a href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/</a>  page. They might be right unlike SC ones.
<br/>

I have a SCL (english), just upgraded to 1.81 english firmware (doesn't seems to change anything though, I did some tests before and after).

For other apps, I use SuperCard Lite (SD Card) DLDI by brisssou (2007-01-19), and it works well.

Sometimes I got a white screen when starting Colors, then the FS is corrupted. I don't really get the context... It seems it depends on other files around.

Though I format when there is a pb and checked for bad blocks once.

No point in trying random. They wont work, but if the version for your card on that page and on the viki was differen it was worth a try.
<br/>
For Supercard those versions are different. And there are multiple versions for multiple Supercards. In case of your card there is only one driver i suppose.

<br/>
I'm not quite sure, but i presume that this option is for writing files and setting Read only flag on them. That would prevent them from being overwritten but not from being created in first place.
<br/>
<br/>
I just bought 2MB card (Kingston it is supposed to be of japanese origin but i'm not sure if it isn't counterfied) and i cannot get png files to write properly with neither of the drivers versions for my card. What's strange drw saves properly, aswell as tmb.  So it looks like there is a problem only with png saving. It might be something about the way writing is implemented. It might be a difference if it writes whole blocks, or byte after byte. Those are just guesses, however at least its some idea Jesse will be able to investigate. I will probably also get my hands on slot-2 super card so i ll investigate that too.
<br/>
<br/>
edit: Phidias saves files with no problem on this 2MB card.
<br/>
edit2: strange - once it saves right on the 2MB card @_@, then not again... 
<br/>
<br/>
I will also sum this up and write about it in DLDI thread, so maybe we will get some answers there. But i'll do it tommorow.
<br/>
<br/>
oh. btw, can you 3x13 see if it writes drw files properly in any mode on your card? (you can do it by preparing proper 512x384 png and overwriting corrupted one on the card - it will load wrong picture, but you should be able to see original one when you use repaint option)<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

Doesn't matter, just a new update about the N-Card:
<br/>
<br/>
I found out there are many different versions of the N-Card and I managed to find an more actual firmware. Including an auto-DLDI-patcher. After upgrading I can save my pictures - but the PNG is corrupted. The thumb looks fine, the DRW I don't know, because I cannot load corrupted PNGs.
<br/>
<br/>
I can now save in ScummVMDS without problems and I also can save PNGs in DSOrganizers Scribble-Pad. 
<br/>
<br/>
The saving process is very slow, so maybe there's some kind of time-limit which causes the corruption?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Or you can sent those drw files to me (follow the link in the colors! gallery) and i ll check them. I can post them in gallery if they will be ok and if you agree.

Instead of using the top screen to replicate the bottom one, why not use it for some display info, like color, size, brush, and the remaining space for an active zoom, so you could use with the zoom function more easily.

Well, not really. At least in Colors! it's mostly a performance issue, where a lot of calculations are done when you release the stylus from the screen.

Hmm, that's strange. I've have a static allocation of 256KB for the drw-files. If you create something bigger than that (about 30000+ brush strokes), it stops recording.

I remember this being referred to as a "Brush Handle."

Therefore you can hold the brush in the middle, as is traditionally done, or by it's "handle" in the corner, which is what the current version of Colors appears to do when the brush is &lt; 5 pixels.

It does the drawing using the Java drawing functions and my guess at the brush size so the results are a little different :) and most of the features are not implemented, but demonstrates the idea.

NOTE: the first colour at the start of playback will not be picked up.

<br/>
Thanks for this wonderful ap: I got so anthousiast that I bought a DS just for it!
<br/>
<br/>
Despite the great job a few improvements would be tremendous:
<br/>
<br/>
1) The possibility to delete a saved picture, it's already fine to be able to overwrite an old one but:
<br/>
<br/>
2) Different GUI for 'load' and 'save' screens: they are very similar
<br/>
and if you didn't click that well you can overwrite a file instead of
<br/>
loading it. OK, the title at the top of the screen says it all, but
<br/>
sometime you don't pay enough attention and you screw up...
<br/>
Maybe take apart 'save' and 'load' and cast 'calibration' between them?
<br/>
<br/>
3) more slots in the save/load screens even if the thumbs get smaller.
<br/>
<br/>
4) The PAN fonction in zoom mode is not explained in the buttons configuration screen at launch nor is the 'pipette'.
<br/>
<br/>
5) to have a 'left-hand' and 'right-hand' set up would free some buttons instead of having them both at the same time.
<br/>
<br/>
6) daydreaming: 'undo' button...
<br/>

This version implements buffering of the playback sequence meaning that you can move about within the sequence smoothly. This does introduce a delay whilst the .drw file loads and generates this buffering.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1) About left-handed and right-handed configuration:
<br/>
Even if there is a will to avoid too many buttons (which is highly understable), it would prevent a small problem: (maybe I have heavy hands but) it occurs that while drawing I'm pressing the right buttons set with the edge of the hand, panning or 'eyedropping' unwillingly. Being able to switch off those buttons would let to rest the hand on the NDS while drawing...
<br/>
<br/>
2) I wouldn't be a pro-undo if this kind of 'interpolation line' didn't happen:
<br/>

But maybe I'm the only one to meet this kind of misadventure? Colors! rocks anyway.

The lines jumping across the screen in Colors! is the result of a stylus jumping problem caused by the way the software reads and uses the touchscreen.

There are <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10925" target="_blank">threads</a> discussing it and how to over come it. It is also present in some commercial games.

my feed back out be  switch the eye dropper  and pan tool around i find it easier to use y than a and i use the eye dropper way more
<br/>
<br/>
needs 1 or even 2 more zoom levels 
<br/>
<br/>
maybe also brush size build into the pressure sensitivity 
<br/>
<br/>
but if thats to hard, then how about a toggle button where u can just drag any where on the screen and it increases or decreases the brush size, similar to painter or opencanvas (when holding ctrl alt ) i find having the hit the triggers a bit 
<br/>
<br/>
you could make that the x button and switch the b to a zoom toggle instead of taking up 2 buttons with zoom in and out

( i am left handed btw)

also running the ds-x i had to patch with dldi and am seeing artifacts on the top screen

I'm left-handed and having great pleasure in the button setup you created!

Today I tried some Bob Ross and imagined it would be great if you're going to put more options to the brush engine..I like the randomness from the photoshop brush-palette : shape-dynamics and scattering. 
<br/>
I know you like to keep it simple, you could do a little button for imitating randomness of a pencil on paper and another little button for paint-brush randomness.. that way leaves and branches would not be the same all the time.
<br/>
I hope you are getting along fine with adding another brush with more faded edges (puffy clouds) in your next version, or maybe even an adjustable hardness to the brush.. 
<br/>
Also it would be great to see what you're going to do with layers, a simple sketch and then 'add a layer' would reduce mistakes.. I guess an eraser for active layer would then be nice.
<br/>
--- How about a open-GUI?
<br/>
----How about playing some mp3's from memory-card on the background?
<br/>
--- I don't even care for the playback option, am I weird saying this?? It sucks life out of the battery and takes much time to safe..!

Maybe I'll whip up something a little more complex when the skinning feature is up and running. For now I just though I'd try to help coax the viewers eyes to the picture a little more using Jetboy's streamlined layout.

I haven't read the entire thread, so forgive me if it has been asked, but is there any chance of adding the ability to upload images you have created, or download images others have created into the app itself?

Also I have pretty lousy accuracy on my touch screen it seems. In the  bottom right hand corner it's out by about 5mm no matter how I calibrate it. Is there any chance you could add pointer calibration into the app as well as pressure calibration?

Some feedback would be, I'm not sure if this problem has been brought up before but a lot of the times I get a random stroke across the screen.

<br/>
Maybe there could also be like a shortcut eraser tool because switching from little black brush to giant white brush to erase is a bit inconvenient.

I know layers has been mentioned before but would it be possible to just have set 2 layers like in paintchat? 2 layers is usually all ppl need.

manbitesdog &lt;&gt; yup I show Colors to some drawing mates at a comic convention and most of them were amazed (I think the pressure was the most praised function). They all find a real nice feeling drawing with it. Most of them planned to buy a DS.

I ain't the creator of the soft, but I think this kind of close relationship between the coder and the users is the key. With publishers you get the marketing in it and from my little experience it's not always a good thing.

I'm not saying I wouldn't pay for colors, but I'd rather pay the coder himself.

The Wii could provide a means of getting data on and off of a DS, using the Wii and DS wireless hardware. It could also be the means of delivering the applications to the DS (DS Download Play) removing the cost of the cartridge (would remove the portability of the DS too). This would require Nintendo to be involved too (signing code and providing the delivery infrastructure).

The thought has occurred to me. As people here have said, some things would be hard to do using official carts and some things would need to change, but it wouldn't be unsolvable.

Now I know this would be hard to implement, but is there any chance of adding location dependent pressure sensitivity calibration? That is, my screen (and I presume others) doesn't have a uniform sensitivity, but if one was to add pressure calibration that sampled the screen at maybe ~9 different points on the screen and then interpolated between those points you should be able to get a much more linear pressure profile.

Actually I'm almost certain the calibration has a little bug. The horizontal offsets at least have their magnitude interpreted correctly, but the sign is wrong.

I'm using the libnds pipeline for this now, so things could be different even though I haven't noticed any change in this myself. So here is the status:
<br/>
<br/>
Stylus jumping (where the DS reports an incorrect stylus touch) in Colors! can cause long lines to be drawn over your painting. This normally only appears about once every 5 minutes, but can differ from DS to DS. Also, having pressure on different parts of plastics close to screen (resting your hand for example) can make this more common. Stylus jumping is also present in official titles, which indicate it is not a completely solvable problem and the current state of libnds seems to work as well as Nintendo's official libraries. As for Colors!, it may be possible to make some special predictions of what should be allowed which could reduce this problem, but it will probably never completely go away.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I use PocketArtist on PocketPC quite a bit (it has layers and open psd files!), and even using Micro$oft's libs on $600 dollar PDA doesn't make a lick of difference.
<br/>
<br/>
Plain and simple, 99% of the skipping is from two points being depressed at the same time. The line is usually an approximation between the two end points, which unfortunately is always down the middle of whatever it is you're working on.
<br/>
<br/>
In PocketArtist I have an Undo state for this, in Colors! it's more of what you'd have to do in real life and correctively paint over your errors. I have no complaints, I still think Colors! an incredible piece of software and this new version continues to polish the rough edges.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The only reason tere is no ranking system is because i'm a lazy bum. 
<br/>
However Jens and I want to be the gallery as positive as it can be, so we were thinking about ranking system where you only can give good positive feedback. There will be a button you could click if you really like the given picture. That would give points to the pictures, so they can be ranked.
<br/>
I guess we will be experimenting a lot, before we come up with the final ranking system.
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. I would like to rearange the page too, but before i do that i want to have all the elements working so i would know what i need and have to put where.  There is still a lot of work to be done, and i'm being distracted by real life a lot recently (plus i'm lazy on top of that)<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

Yes if you get you picture rated with lets say +5 -5 range, or even 0-10, it would be discouraging if you get bad marks. We do not plan this.
<br/>
<br/>
We want to implement "digg it" system when you only give your "digg it" to pictures you like. You cannot give bad notes or something. There is no way to downvote pictures you dont like (unless you put extremly huge amounts of time and effort).
<br/>
<br/>
When the system will be in place for some time, pictures will get different amounts of "digg it" from different people, and we will be able to sort them  that way, hence creating ranking. I do believe that it would be more positive than the rankings where you give marks.

The problem with comments is you will eventually get things like that:
<br/>
"What a crap, my shit looks better than your cheap imitation of painting"

Been there, seen that. That is exactly what we are trying to avoid.

That's why pressure is not in official DS specs. Nintendo knew there would be problem with presure sensing, so they dont mention that DS is capable of it. Those areas depend on the specyfic machine you get. On some they are less or more pronounced and placed in diferent sides. For example i can draw there no problem, but i cannot draw on the lower border.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well it's not that those areas simply can't detect pressure, just the sensitivity of the screen varies from one point of the screen to another. If one was to take the nonlinear nature of the screen's pressure sensitivity into account (say by calibrating the screen pressure at multiple points), then, cpu power permitting, it should be possible to interpolate the screen sensitivity between calibration points, and so get back an almost linear pressure measurement.
<br/>

Ha! I cant go that far. When i'm testing it on SC Lite Micro (no rumble version) it just hangs up and does not save anything. Tried this with 0,5 1 and 2 MB cards, and all family of SC slot 2 drivers).
<br/>
<br/>
As far as .drw  file is saved correctly you are saved. Thats the only part that's really needed. You can still load your paintings, if you replace corrupted .png with any other png of the same size (512x384). That way you will see the other png when you load, but when you play the image you will get back to your painting.
<br/>
<br/>
Also if you dont mind sharing your pictures in the gallery, please send me .drw files along with what title and comment you would like to add, and i will gladly fix them and put them on the gallery for you. If you dont want to put them into gallery i can still fix them for you, and send them back to you.

AFAIK Jens spend a lot of time recently trying to fix SuperCard problem. For now the battle is lost, but its not the end of the war :)<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

Wait! You do not rename your drw file. 
<br/>
The png switch is just temporary workaround so you can load your painting.
<br/>
<br/>
You cannot add only drw file to gallery yet. It needs Png + drw + tmb at the moment. And if you upload switched png, it will be that png displayed in gallery.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

If you had colors_slot0.drw and colors_slot0.tmb saved aswell it should work.
<br/>
<br/>
Ususaly if there are problems with saving on SuperCard there are 2 cathegories.
<br/>
1. Program hangs up and does not save anything (usually because of wrong dldi driver)
<br/>
2. Saves all 3 files but png is corrupted. I assumed you have this case, but really rarely it can corrupt other saved files aswell. If the later is the case you cannot do much, sorry.

I actually like the new interface, but some of the icons are confusing at first with the names hidden until touching. I love the new soft brush though!

<br/>
One question though, I've noticed that when shutting the lid the screens shut off, but other than that is there any power saving functions in colors?
<br/>
I have a habit of just closing my DS rather then saving and powering off, and sometimes I forget that I've left it on.
<br/>
I haven't tried to run out the battery on it but I know it's happened with other homebrew that didn't have any power saving...

Anyway, I'm not sure how hard it would be to implement, but I would imagine it would be useful to people working on long drawing projects?

I'm sorry but there are problems with Super Cards.
<br/>
<br/>
It only works on Super Card DS ONE (cards 1MB and under), and Super Card SD Mini. There are prepatched files in the gallery for both of those models. Result may differ depending on your SD card.
<br/>
<br/>
For other models of Super Card - there is not much you can do until it gets fixed.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

When I loaded it up I was expecting some horrible menus and confusing layout, but was pleasantly surprised. It's not often that you find someone who can code and also has creativity and design skills. Good work! Colors gets on my essential homebrew list - it's up there with Moonshell and SCUMMvm

I was just pondering the same thing. I think you should automatically delete anything that clearly hasn't had any effort put into it. It'd be fine to leave them if there weren't many others pieces on the site - but they're sitting next to some really amazing artwork.
<br/>
<br/>
I say leave the cocks that look like they've had some effort put into them, but delete the ones that have just been done in 5 seconds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I like this idea.
<br/>
Here is what it will work like, at least until Jens asks otherwise.
<br/>
<br/>
Picture gets uploaded and is being displayed at once. First time i see it i give it aproved status. 
<br/>
<br/>
If picture does not have approved status it will have "Report this Image" button. 3 reports from different IPs and it gets flagged as hidden, so its not displayed but i still can make it approved.
<br/>
<br/>
This way it will be removed as soon as possible if its offensive, but it will be safe against people deleting pictures for fun.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your ideas. The user system will be implemented, but this is rather matter of weeks than days.

If test was made in more sensitive area - it would work ok there, but it wouldnt work ok on the rest of the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
It could be solved if presure calibration was made in multiple places on the screen, but due to the diferences in the screen sensivity by model to model it would require different test points from model to model.

<br/>
<br/>
Test 1:- (v1.04) Patched with sc moonlight dldi,tested on Supercard Micro SD (For GBA/Phat DS).
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Loading</span> Works fine.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Saving</span>
<br/>
To an empty slot: Produces only a png file of 0 bytes in size. (Windows) would not let me open the file, I also attempted to open it with a hex editor, which would not let me open the file...
<br/>
Over an existing image: The file remains the same size as before saving, however the file cannot be opened (even with hex editor).
<br/>
<br/>
Also note the app just freezes on the saving screen for both cases.
<br/>
<br/>
Looks to me like the error is somewhere within modifying the FAT because windows is throwing up filesystem errors when trying to delete the file.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this can be some use to you with fixing, would love to see saving working on my DS. If theres anything else you want me to test let me know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The Supercard patcher is not to be used with homebrew.  What you need is a DLDI patcher program.  The recommended method is to download and install DLDIrc, choosing the device you have at the end of the installation.  Then right-click Colors.nds and choose the new patching option that appears (it will patch the actual file, not create a copy like the Supercard patcher will).  Copy the patched binary to your card.  If it fails, try installing DLDIrc again, choosing the SCSD_moon option when it asks for the device.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Some suggestions/feedback:
<br/>
<br/>
The old problem with parts of the cursor getting stuck in the image doesn't seem to be entirely gone, at least not at the bottom border of the image. I also noticed another weird behavior with the brush drawing - if you start painting a shape on a white canvas, switch color, paint with the new color along the contour of the previously painted shape and you'll notice the contour shifting around in (at least seemingly) unmotivated ways close to the edges of the brush.
<br/>
<br/>
More image slots would be nice. I like the current thumbnail size but maybe you can but arrows/text to allow navigation between multiple pages of slots/thumbnails on the sides of the "load image"/"save image" text?
<br/>
<br/>
Toggling opacity and (what's hopefully coming soon) size pressure controls on/off through small icons on the color/brush selection screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I think this was already covered but being able to stop .drw playback and start painting from where you halt it could be nice to branch off a painting and try different directions in it as long as provide some kind of undo (although too slow to be used frequently).

<br/>
<br/>
1) Zoom ability is great! Sadly it only centers on the middle of the picture...... if only you can move around it when you zoom...... probably replace the dpad with camera movement while Y X A B be the primary zoom/pan/unzoom and eyedrop tool
<br/>
<br/>
2) Undo.... ? yeah i know this has been mentioned....
<br/>
<br/>
3) Text insertion with fonts and stuff..... yeah i know this will take tons of scripting and frustration but Wordart will be nice =)
<br/>
<br/>
4)Blending/smurdging tool will be great..... 
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah i know i'm asking for a lot but these are ideas you can input into the next version..... Keep up the good work!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not sure how this behavior is for you, but I would guess that this just is a side effect of the precision of the DS screen. Colors! is running a 15-bit screen-mode where each component only has 5-bits -&gt; 32 steps. Internally on the other hand I'm running 8 bits per component so there is more information in your picture than the DS can show. This could possibly be the reason for the behavior you are seeing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh, and something I have noticed is that the new background behind the color wheel makes it difficult to see the Brush selector/slider when there are colors that don't contrast well against it. This is especially problembatic with the new "Soft" brush which has a very small centerpoint to grab and slide. Some shades just seem to make the brush slider disappear into the background.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It would be great to be able to see the playback on the upper screen (Which looks better, at least on my DS) and to have controls (play, pause, fast forward, watch in both screens, exit playback) on the bottom screen. 
<br/>
<br/>
It is really really difficult to know where the brush will paint with the smallest brush size, so something could also be done about that.

Finally, the pressure sensor is not regular throughout the touch screen in my fat grey DS.

I've read this thread last night and find how to zoom on other places of the screen, which helps a lot (I was wondering "why we can just zoom on the center of the screen", silly me...). I think it's a good option to zoom and then "move to other place of the screen" with the stylet (pen?).

Even if I'm not good at drawing, I like to draw and I must say that this application is great for me. When I went to bed yesterday, I was thinking "I can't wait for tomorrow morning and try drawing again" ^__^.

Thanks for it :)

I'll upload my drawing to the gallery too. As someone said here "art is subjective". I think so, and I'm really happy to see a lot of people posting their drawing on the gallery website.

About a rating system... I'd be for something like a "I like it!" button rather than "one star to five stars" system or something like that ^^.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks again, by the way, for the updates.  I'm loving the soft brush.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as the color-selection background goes, it's always gonna be a pain to see some color against a similar background.  With the soft-brush it's worse.  Why not have the selection size/color circle outlined with black? Then you could see it even with a soft gray brush on a gray background.
<br/>
<br/>
For the temp-buffer for practice strokes, it wouldn't take any real estate if it wiped as soon as color selection was done.  If it's not doable there, maybe work it into the calibration setup (making a calibration instead of "Test here []", having you make a long soft stroke and a long hard stroke?  (no euphemisms, please =]).

I'd also like to second the donation-suggestion guy.  I've dropped a few bucks to Tassu, Dragonminded, and Davr.

-Maybe this could work:

<br/>
<br/>
-Will this app have an undo option? 
<br/>
  I dont know much about programming nor how you have done the playback option(wich is a nice feature), but couldnt you make the undo button like a "reversed" playback.. like "load: current frame -1"
<br/>
-A simple paintbucket tool?.. 
<br/>
  because like lots of people I would like to work on more natural backgrounds.. (brown/gray/etc.)
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and please dont change anything to the brushes :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I for one agree with you on the undo. I like the fact that you just paint over wherever the mistake was. If there was an undo I would never have figured out that you can get great shading and textures just by painting over stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I LOVE the program.  I'm a sucker for a slick interface and lots of polish, and Colors has it in spades. Thank You.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would it be possible to have the L/R buttons control the playback speed?
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when I'm trying to learn how someone performed a specific technique, I find it difficult to truly grasp it the first time around because it plays back so quickly.
<br/>
<br/>
I think one thing we can all agree on here, is that Colors! can also be a tremendous teaching aid, not just an incredible paint program. How about giving that side of this application a little attention?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, I look forward to 1.05

Or use a DS motion sensor and tilt in the desired direction - that would give pretty much full analog control :)

<br/>

Yeah that would be fun indeed .. As a show off function it would add incredible value!
<br/>
I still prefer Jesse spending time on the line-thickness by pressure control above all other suggestions :)   For me that would make it complete.
<br/>
But the more functions are created the more new options come to mind, like for instance a bigger screen/playground :) .. 600x800?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
* New user-interface by Ernst (madwurmz.com) 
<br/>
* Full opacity brush option
