    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">UPDATE: 1.6.0 (final) released! (2008) Moved to new domain. (2013)
<br/>
<br/>
Hello everybody!
<br/>
<br/>
I have updated the Volumetric Shadow (Tech)Demo (formerly know as the "Stencil Shadow Demo" and later "Volume Shadow Demo".)
<br/>
<br/>
For now, this will be the final version, although I might release some updates when needed.
<br/>
A more advanced project (VSD 2.0), which will take VSD's place in the future, is already being developed.
<br/>
<br/>
Back on topic: VSD is compatible with most, if not all DLDI devices. 
<br/>
Emulators (as far as they emulate used features) and older SLOT2 GBA NOR (without any SD or CF card storage) cartridges are supported via FCSR (build available on the site.)
<br/>
<br/>
The demo shows how to use a bunch of NDS features and some otherwise handy lines of source code, like:
<br/>
<br/>
- Hardware accelerated volumetric shadowing - mini-tutorial included!
<br/>
- Motion blur with video capture, using only one VRAM bank, at 60 FPS
<br/>
- Hardware lighting, texturing, fogging, antialiasing etc.
<br/>
- Display brightness control
<br/>
- Viewport scissoring (thanks to gabebear)
<br/>
- Loading binary and text files from disk
<br/>
- Converting 24/32bit .tga image data to 16bit NDS textures
<br/>
- Displaying a custom font and a text area over a background image, all loaded from disk
<br/>
- Smooth touch input
<br/>
- Simple frame rate counting and renderer status display
<br/>
<br/>
Please, make sure you read the contents of the included readme file!
<br/>
<br/>
A mini-tutorial on volumetric shadows comes with the source release (as well as at <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=143065#143065" target="_blank">here</a> in the forum) and some additional information (e.g. on the .tga format) is "hidden" in the source files. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
Since the initial release, I have reworked the sources a lot! There have been quite some rewrites and a lot of renaming and rearranging!
<br/>
<br/>
Now all data should be put into ROOT/data/vsd_data, then the demo can be run from any folder!
<br/>
<br/>
It was developed and build with devkitARM R23b, libnds 20071023 and libfat 20070127.
<br/>
<br/>
It's quite readable, stable (I guess) and relatively easy to understand!
<br/>
<br/>
Download it from: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.code-basement.net" target="_blank">www.code-basement.net</a>
<br/>
<br/>
As always, I released the sources along with binary builds. I only supply a DLDI .nds and an FCSR .nds, as I don't think anybody needs a .gba any more (I don't) and the few people who do need it, can easily convert it themselves... But in case that assumption is wrong, please let me know and I'll upload a .gba to the web site.
<br/>
<br/>
Note, that there are some implementations and data structures I don't recommend using in "serious" programs, but for the sake of simplicity, I used them in this demo (e.g. the triangle structure.)
<br/>
This "issue" will be addressed in the next major release - VSD 2.0, which is already being worked on.
<br/>
<br/>
The shadow in the demo is static, that means it's not deforming (but could be moved around freely) - it's up to you to implement dynamic shadows.
<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to comment - just make sure you read the readme first! ;^)
<br/>
(Keep in mind, that the demo is my first publicly released open source software. :^) )
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I hope this demo will be useful to at least some of you. Don't hesitate to tell me about it! :^D
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I want to thank everybody in this forum who's helped me making the jump from GBA to NDS!
<br/>
<br/>
Very special thanks go out to Brandon M. and Larry E. for helping me out with the hardware and gabebear for sharing his viewport scissoring implementation.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for reading and have a nice day! :^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

<br/>
see, it's just that there are far too many devices that i would need to compile it for to satisfy everyone.
<br/>
<br/>
i'm sorry to have upset you. there's a slightly improved new revision and i'll release a binary with it, as soon as i get to it (release planned for wednesday).
<br/>
<br/>
a major problem is also, that i only have a neoflash mk4mini and a slot2 card to test my code with (and i'm already thankful for that). that's why it isn't a problem for me to use gbfs ;^p (if i get it done on time, i'll replace it with libfat in the upcoming release).
<br/>
<br/>
finally i'd like to tell you a wish of mine: it was nice if anyone voting would at least give me *some* feedback. (i especially mean you option-3-voters! ;^p )
<br/>
<br/>
anyway, thanks for looking!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions for features to be added, e.g. translutient textures (any need for demoing that)?
<br/>
<br/>
Something I'll be experimenting with is "correct" shadows, that is shadow geometry you can penetrate ("walk into") without causing artifacts.
<br/>
Z-Fail (? la Monsieur Carmack &amp; Creative Labs...) is, to my knowledge, not doable, because the hardware only supports a "hardwired" Z-Pass test. What a pitty... <span style="font-weight: bold">Software patents suck and make our lives hard! Software patents are not there to the benefit of developers and technical advancement, but to make some lawyers and managers rich!</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Back on topic: I won't include animation, yet. That has been left out for another time and another demo.
<br/>
<br/>
Antialiasing is in and working, so please don't list it. ;^p
<br/>
Although I should probably include some en-/disable option for it. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
The demo runs in no$gba, but some essential features, e.g. shadowing don't work, yet.
<br/>
I hope this demo helps to improve emulation a little bit. (Someone give Martin a hint - I read he's hard to contact!)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

Really, it's just because you haven't released a compiled version. Case in point: I haven't built it yet, but I've still been reading the new posts to the thread ;)
<br/>
<br/>
And supporting different devices shouldn't be an issue with a small demo. Just build whatever data it needs into the .nds.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What you can do to make it work on all devices is move the filesystem.gbfs file into arm9/data, rename it to filesystem.gbfs.bin (you can also add a rule for .gbfs in the makefile). This will make devkitARM compile this file into your binary. Next, in main.cpp, #include "filesystem_gbfs_bin.h" or something similar. Now, instead of using the gbfs find first file command, you can simply set gbfs_file to filesystem_gbfs_bin, which will be declared in a header automatically generated by devkitARM.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have access to a DS at the moment, so I havn't tested it, but I looked through the source and read the readme file. What I'd really like is some more explanation of wtf is going on. The comments in draw.cpp didn't make things any clearer for me. Maybe I'm just stupid. Perhaps you could link to nice explanations of shadow volumes and stencil shadows, and explain how that applies to the DS hardware?<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yay, I just won the Inconsiderate Bastard Award!

<br/>
Sorry about that. For some reason the .nds doesn't work, but the .ds.gba does. Looks good.
<br/>
<br/>
For sausage boy, basically what you do is set poly ID to 0, render back faces, set poly ID to non-zero, and render front faces. Alpha has to be &gt;0 and &lt;=30, and poly mode set to shadow.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

well, as i've been to GB for a while and my dev pc is being serviced, i couldn't do much nds stuff. but you can understand that as a promise that i'll release a libfat version, if nobody else does it sooner than me.
<br/>
<br/>
well about the comments: there isn't really much you have to do to enable shadows, but i admit that searching somebody else's sources isn't really the best way of learning something new. because of my so called "vacations" (they really weren't) and now uni, i haven't been on the forum very often and definitely had no time to put up any kind of snippet/mini tutorial so far. though i aim for this friday to do so - stay tuned.
<br/>
<br/>
last time i checked no$gba screwed the rendering big time, but it ran. i really haven't tested it in any other emus because most lack a consistent matrix implementation (ok, that also isn't the case with no$, but at least it does *something* right about matrices). so seeing the iDeaS pic is sort of cool for me :) the lower screen's colors are corrupt, but surprisingly the shadow looks right! textures also look correct (as opposed to no$ - which is still a great emu, though!).
<br/>
thanks for the image. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
my only problem with porting from gbfs to libfat is that when i try to build a fat12 image, it always says it can't find the first file and then it stops, producing a 10kb image file with no content. that was sort of disappointing, as you might remember, i only have a slot 2 kit (with mk4 mini). so i'd need to append the image to the rom, but not being able to build the image, i couldn't even start coding. that was like the last day i had my pc at hand.
<br/>
<br/>
can anybody help me? what do i need to do in order to build a fat12 image? i guess i have all the tools and i read the readmes and stuff... i'm working with xp (home - yes!) sp2. any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
again, thanks for the interest!
<br/>
<br/>
ps: gru? nach deutschland :^D

Cleaner sources, better file handling, texture loading and all new error detection and handling! I've de-hacked this release quite a bit. :^)

    <h4>#159292 - silent_code - Sat Jun 28, 2008 8:34 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Bumpy, bumpy... here goes another update: It's time for version 1.5.0! :^)
<br/>
<br/>
This one mainly fixes some bugs, replaces the "almighty declare, define and include everything main.hpp" programming style by only including and declaring what is needed by each compilation unit, along with some more commenting and some cleaning things up.
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the project was changed from using a "custom" ARM7, to using devkitARM's default ARM7. That removed some unneccessary stuff from the source release.
<br/>
Now it also uses an unmodified Makefile.
<br/>
<br/>
The mini-tutorial was separated from the readme. From now on it will be included in the source release and can also be downloaded separately from the web site.
<br/>
<br/>
Check it out. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">And <span style="font-style: italic">please</span>: Read the readme, at least the disclaimer section! Thank you!</span>
<br/>
<br/>
@ News-posters: All old releases are removed whenever a new one becomes available, so please don't link directly to the files, but to my web site.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okays, it looks like this is the final update for the demo.
<br/>
If I had some more feedback on this, I might have added or improved some other stuff, too. Well, there's nothing I can do about missing feedback, but at least I know my smooth touch implementation has been put to good use in cquake. :^D
<br/>
<br/>
Ah, yes. This time, I've reworked some minor parts of the sources and (re)added some status displays, like the number of vertex / primitive entries, that are in the RAM lists.
<br/>
<br/>
I've also modified the file paths, so I had to rename some files. That's why this version is not compatible with older ones. No big deal though. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
Well, there's not much more to say about this.
<br/>
<br/>
Until I decide to make another update for version 1.x, I say "Bye, bye doll!"
<br/>
<br/>
Version 2.0 will contain some higher quality graphics, as well as a little bit of sound, animation and some sweet bits of FPS gameplay. :^D
<br/>
Big plans. We'll see how far I get with that. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
The dataset is being prepared and some design and layout work has already been made. As I'm doing this all on my own (except for the sounds), there won't be much news to post about in the next few weeks.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I want to get this done before I start my new job, but I really can't tell how long it will take... and I don't suspect a lot of people are interested in that anyways. ;^)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice demo. But your tutorial is a bit misleading. It says:
<br/>
<br/>
- *ALLWAYS* follow the three steps for *EACH* shadow geometry seperately!
<br/>
<br/>
But that's not true. You only need to do step 1 once. And then always follow steps 2 and 3 for each shadow geometry seperately. Or just for fun, algorithmically:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
// Step 1
<br/>
DrawShadowCastingGeometryIfAnyPresent();
<br/>
DrawReceivingGeometry();
<br/>
for (int i = 0; i &lt; NumberOfShadowVolumes; i++) {
<br/>
     // Step 2
<br/>
     glPolyFmt(POLY_ALPHA(1) | POLY_CULL_FRONT | POLY_ID(0) | POLY_SHADOW);
<br/>
     DrawShadowVolume(i);
<br/>
     // Step 3
<br/>
     glPolyFmt(POLY_ALPHA(20) | POLY_CULL_BACK | POLY_ID(63) | POLY_SHADOW | POLY_FOG);
<br/>
     DrawShadowVolume(i);
<br/>
}</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Also, when I do glFlush(GL_TRANS_MANUALSORT | GL_WBUFFERING); the fog on mygeometry gets switched off. But if I do glFlush(GL_TRANS_MANUALSORT); it comes out ok. What is the GL_WBUFFERING necessary for since the volumes seem to work without it for me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks! :^)
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you are absolutely right, I will have to fix that statement. (EDIT: FIXED! An updated version is available on my web site.) Thanks for the feedback! :^)
<br/>
<br/>
I found, that without w-sorting, the shadow volumes don't work propperly (especially more complex ones) and start to flicker, much like z-fighting, at any distance.
<br/>
Using w-sorting, I don't have any problems in my demo. Did you enable the fog master bit? How are you testing? Are you using the latest libnds?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: If I remove w-sorting in my demo, I get *nothing* on screen on hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
PS: Do you enable fog for the shadow geometry? (It's explained in my mini-tutorial.)
<br/>
<br/>
