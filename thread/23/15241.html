DS-DOS is a first filebrowser of it's kind. This text-based application will allow
<br/>
you to view/copy/move/delete/rename files on your memory card or built-in memory.
<br/>
It also allows you to boot other .nds binaries (users of certain cards may have
<br/>
trouble with this). Don't forget to DLDI patch it.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently Implemented Commands (case-sensitive)
<br/>
date     displays the date
<br/>
time     displays the time
<br/>
cls        clears the screen
<br/>
help     displays help
<br/>
ver      displays DS-DOS version
<br/>
del      allows deleting of files
<br/>
copy    allows copying of files
<br/>
move   allows moving of files
<br/>
ren     allows renaming of files
<br/>
dir      displays a list of files and directories in current directory
<br/>
cd      change the current directory "\music"
<br/>
lock    locks the filesystem, preventing use of del/copy/move/ren
<br/>
ulok    unlocks the filesystem allowing use of del/copy/move/ren
<br/>
<br/>
To boot any .nds file, just type the filename (myndsfile.nds). If it is currently
<br/>
in a folder, you will have to type the full path unless the folder it resides in
<br/>
is the current working directory (folder\myndsfile.nds).
<br/>
<br/>
To use the extra device, you must have a dldi file called "fat3.dldi", which is a
<br/>
renamed dldi file of the other device you want to use. To boot an .nds file on the
<br/>
other device, you would type "fat3:\myndsfile.nds". Copying, renaming, moving, and
<br/>
deleting all work this same way.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to: TeenDev for bootlib; Chishm for libfat; cornaljoe for character fix:
<br/>
Everyone involved with devkitPro and PAlib; And to all Nintendo DS homebrewers.

<br/>
OP: i guess that was a viable programming exercise, so, could you post a bit more about you program? your site is also a bit "minimalistc", adding a few immages of your hb would help others to see your work better!
<br/>
<br/>
hope that helps!

you are getting disappointed pretty fast, a bit sad... just because no one gives proper feedback, it does not mean there is no one interested in your work.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Kojote</span>

<br/>
It's quite "normal" that feedback is low, people usually only get in touch with someone if there is something wrong with the program (if at all).
<br/>
<br/>
As I am a game developer myself, I can assure you out of 5000-10000 downloads you are getting one feedback.
<br/>
<br/>
Only the fact you made it onto "large homebrew newspages" should be honor enough, some people even don't manage this.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a sad fact, that people don't feedback enough. I believe many projects could be much bigger and better than ever, but were stalled to due low or not available feedback.
<br/>
<br/>
Just don't let you demotivate from "no feedback".<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Kojote</span>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well... you wont get much response for a porgram like that. 
<br/>
1. there are other programs that have similar functionality but with visual interaface which is much easier to use.
<br/>
2. not many people have an urge to manipulate files on their DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
So the niche you went for is pretty slim, add to that not many people respond at all, and so it is...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway you got much more replies than some potetntialy wider targeted homebrews.
<br/>

Don't give up because of that, I released some stuff that got nowhere near the amount of feedback I expected.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there
<br/>
<br/>
I have a M3 Perfect microSD. I DLDI patch it and it runs and the keyboard is responsive and everything, but I can't make it assume the "cd" command.
<br/>
<br/>
First I tried:
<br/>
<br/>
cd 0 ---- zero, which is the directory where I have everything not root.
<br/>
<br/>
and it didn't enter the directory
<br/>
<br/>
Then I tried:
<br/>
<br/>
cd DATA ---- which appears with all capital letters.
<br/>
<br/>
time, date, ver and help works tho.
<br/>
<br/>
Please continue to develop this, but only if YOU're interested :)
<br/>
<br/>
Request/suggestion: change the color of the keyboard key while pressing it, it's easy to write this way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#153136 - wolped - Tue Mar 25, 2008 2:06 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry if cd isn't explained, I was kinda in a rush to post it. To use cd, first you type "cd" to initialize, then if you want to change to a folder called DATA, you would type "\DATA", you cannot forget the slash.
<br/>
<br/>
The keyboard might be a bit more difficult. Some people may notice it isn't the default PAlib keyboard.  The "/" and "\" are switched; I did this in the font too.  libfat uses Unix style "/", whereas DOS uses "\", so I had to change the keyboard and font.  This broke the highlighting when typing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh ok, got it!
<br/>
<br/>
It works fine then!
<br/>
<br/>
Oh another thing, for what I see it tries to run anything that is typed that isn't a command. I mistyped "dir" and it went blank screened! :)
<br/>
<br/>
If possible why not try to check if there is a file with that name before running it, or the file needing to end in .nds.
<br/>
<br/>
I think this may be very powerful if you implement .bat BATCH files, but you'll need to add a lot more "tools" to it.
<br/>
<br/>
Good work, I like it:)
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, haven't tried it, but does it use wildcards? Like "del *.mp3" ?
<br/>
<br/>
It's things like these that still make me run "cmd" in Windows :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so.. it works fine so far on the M3 Real
<br/>
The "cd" command logic reminds me of VMS - bit odd for dos.
<br/>
Is the font shaded towards the bottom ?
<br/>
<br/>
Some possible improvements:
<br/>
<br/>
Adding the cwd path to the command prompt would be useful (like %path)
<br/>
A soft scroll when the bottom of the page is reached, instead of screen clear.
<br/>
Adding "type"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to access the GBA slot, but being new to this I didn't understand where exactly I could get the required .dldi file and where I had to store it to make it work.

But hey - it worked fine.. I wish I could write something like that !<br/>_________________<br/>Andy..
