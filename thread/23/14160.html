    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My latest project for the Nintendo DS, RTS4DS.
<br/>
It's an RTS engine which reads out RTSes created for it from your media card.
<br/>
<br/>
A news post describing it in more detail, along with links to a preview movie, can be found at the following site.

Besides, Dune 2 is a terrific choice and like matriculated I do hope you will be able to offer it with your finished program somehow.

Don't expect any answers from <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westwood_studios" target="_blank">Westwood Studios</a> though, they have been closed down by E.A. in 2003. What a great loss, they made such terrific games : Dune 2, Lands of Lore (I want a port of this one too ;) ), Kyrandia.... ah they don't make them like this anymore...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so basically all images can be used to create the game running from your engine. If that will work i will put a lot of effert in getting all the C&amp;C gold, red alert 1 and red alert 2 sprites and sound for my own game-pack.
<br/>
<br/>
This project is amazing, and will bring a lot of new options to other homebrew too.
<br/>
Any release date yet ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I meant the current copyright holder to the game (series), being Electronic Arts probably.

To a certain extent. I don't think the C&amp;C series itself would make a good game on the DS due to the (relatively) large sized structures and units... making your view of the battlefield annoyingly small. Plus, my RTS engine needs all structures and units graphics to be stored in VRAM, which certainly can't be pulled off with Starcraft and the C&amp;C series.
<br/>

Anyway, there are a couple of RTSes now under development for the RTS4DS engine which are suited for it, so no need to be dissapointed.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://amplituds.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">AmplituDS website</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ever thought about joining up with the CNCDS programmer, at the moment his project is abandoned i think, but he posted his complete source, so maybe u can use something of it ?
<br/>
<br/>
adress is: <a href="http://cncds.worldoffokkers.nl" target="_blank">http://cncds.worldoffokkers.nl</a>
<br/>
<br/>
maybe you can put it to a good use, as he has a nice engine running but without the sprites and stuff, but he has also created a sprite ripper to rip the sprites from the C&amp;C games.
<br/>
<br/>
If i can help you with something, just call :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#142128 - Dark Knight ez - Thu Oct 04, 2007 9:37 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I sort of suggested working together when our projects both started (around the same time). He didn't want to join forces on a single RTS project.
<br/>
He chose to take a completely different approach to coding an RTS engine, using software rendering. I chose to rely on the DS 2D engine myself, using actual tiles and sprites.
<br/>
Combining the two engines is not an option for me due to how different they are, and I'd consider it pretty much pointless seeing as how my own engine is far more complete than the C&amp;C-DS engine.
<br/>
<br/>
However, my engine isn't really suited for something like C&amp;C as it is. The diversity in environment and in structures probably means it won't all fit in VRAM at once, meaning it'll have to be streamed in when needed. That's not something my engine supports. Not sure if I'll ever look into adding that feature myself. We'll see. First I want to finish the engine as it is and release new RTSes alongside of it.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://amplituds.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">AmplituDS website</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As a matter of fact, there is. I guess most people overlooked the news.
<br/>
The RTS engine has been improved significantly, and together with LDAsh from Violation Entertainment, used for creating the game named Ulterior Warzone.
<br/>
You might want to check out <a class="postlink" href="http://www.violationentertainment.com" target="_blank">Violation Entertainment's site</a>, because it has some more information and a wallpaper of the game containing screenshots of what it's currently like. Might be worth a look.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://amplituds.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">AmplituDS website</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
