I better get around to putting it on my card now!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow!  This is really amazing.  It was a fun toy to play around with before, but now, with the ability to have two turntables going simultaneously.  It's really possible to make some great sounding stuff.  In fact, it's pretty easy.  DSample is going to make it even better.
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I'd really like to see is the ability to switch between the two turntables more easily.  Having to press select and then the dpad is too hard to do quickly.  There needs to be button for it or maybe an icon on the touchscreen.  Same for samples loaded through DSample; it should be possible to play them by just pressing a button without having to switching over to a different module.
<br/>
<br/>
Really cool stuff.  I can't wait to put some custom samples and loops into it and play around some more.  Amazing to have this and GlitchDS come out within days of each other.  I've never been great at making music, but with tools as fun and easy to use as these, my paltry efforts really seem multiplied.
