    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://2-2-dihexanol.net/worldofsand.nds" target="_blank">World of Sand (beta 1)</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I hacked this up over the last couple of days and the folks on #dsdev seemed to enjoy it, so I thought I'd link it here for your pleasure.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that the idea for the game isn't original; the code is mostly from a clone I made of the game by <a class="postlink" href="http://ishi.blog2.fc2.com/blog-entry-158.html" target="_blank">Dofi</a> (written in Java, eugh).
<br/>
<br/>
The performance isn't great yet, but it's acceptable. The code will be released when I get around to dropping it on a version control system, under the GPL. There are a bunch more features I plan to add, including:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>a title screen
<br/>
</li><li>more materials/combinations (steam, ash, snow, ideas welcome)
<br/>
</li><li>portrait view
<br/>
</li><li>a hideable toolbox instead of the arrow-key-selected icons
<br/>
</li><li>a way to stop/start the flow of individual sources
<br/>
</li><li>different brush sizes
<br/>
</li><li>timer and particle count on the top screen
<br/>
</li><li>save/load to png
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
Thanks to: sgstair for answering my annoying questions, WinterMute and co. for libnds and devKitPro, the rest of the #dsdev guys for providing feedback :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Very very cool. Just tested this.
<br/>
<br/>
Some things I think would be cool to see:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>Dual-screen flow, L/R to pan/flip screens :-)
<br/>
</li><li>Rotation so you can play with fountains, etc
<br/>
</li><li>Gravity control. Ties in with the rotation...
<br/>
</li><li>More materials types :-)
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment it has a pretty cool "elementary" angle. You could also add "para-elementary" stuff for funky mixes :-)
<br/>
<br/>
World of Sand could be very cool...
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder...
<br/>
<br/>
It might also be possible to use the 3d hardware to help on this. I take it it's currently a framebuffer-style affair?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'll keep an eye on this :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

@OOPMan: dual-screen flow would be rather unwieldy and would also deprive me of a place to put my miscellaneous gui elements :)
<br/>
<br/>
By 'rotation' do you mean a portrait view? Brain Training-style? If so, already in the todo ;)
<br/>
No idea what you mean by gravity control.
<br/>
More materials are definitely on the way!
<br/>
<br/>
Para-elements -- like how?
<br/>
<br/>
It uses a backbuffer array and blits it to an exrot bg every frame. I can't really see a way to bring the 3D into it... unless, say, you wanted to have multiple gardens -- you could flip between them with L/R and have a pretty 3D box effect or something, and pause the ones that aren't in view.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
What I really meant by dual-screen flow was a kind of viewport system. In other words, the "world" is larger than the viewports (The DS' two screens). I would imagine it would be easiest if the "world" were longer vertically than the length of the two screens. This way you could pan up and down within the limits of the world, allowing for even more funky structures to be set up. Also, you could overlay the GUI on separate BG layer. The bottomost layer would be the viewport, while the top-most would be the GUI palette.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Not quite. I was thinking of free scale rotation. Let's say that the game's current view is rotated 0 degrees. Press D-Pad L or D-Pad R would allow you to increase or decrease the rotation in 1 degree increments. However, the rotation would not actually be of the view, but of the game world. The game's center of gravity would remain the same, though. Meaning that if you rotated the view 180 degrees the sand would be fountaining upwards and, if you've got a gravity system, eventually falling back down...
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>nornagon wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">No idea what you mean by gravity control.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's basically a particle system you've got here, right? A lot of particle systems use basic physical laws to handle the particle motion. Particles have x,y and z velocity and also x,y and z acceleration. The world itself has gravity that applies a constant acceleration to some of the values. For example, let's say the x-axis is the up/down vertical axis. Positive x is up, negative x is down. Your particle is moving upwards with a positive x velocity with no x acceleration. Your game world applies a constant negative x acceleration would. This causes the particle to slow down the longer it moves and eventually start moving in the opposite direction at increasing speed. So, basically, are you running a physics system of any kind? Do you plan to?

Just silly role-playing jargon. For example, if Water + Earth = Mud. Therefore, Mud is the para-element of Water &amp; Earth :-)

Well, you could use very small triangles or something with a particle texture applied. But you might end up over-running the hardware's limits...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">@OOPMan: No, there is no particle system as such. Each pixel is just that; a pixel. A calculation is run over every pixel such that it can react to the pixels in its immediate vicinity. No forces, no speeds, no accelerations, no gravity. Just sneaky use of rand() that makes it look like that.
<br/>
<br/>
The viewport idea I don't think would really work (though it's totally possible). One of the nice things about WoS is being able to see everything happening at once -- it's quite amazing how you can miss something happening only 20 pixels away. Bits that you actually *can't* see would make it a lot harder to manage, as the player.
<br/>
<br/>
With the para-elements, try mixing (say) salt and water. ;) I do my best to come up with as many combinations as possible, suggestions are welcome.
<br/>
<br/>
It's pretty much impossible to display that many particles in 3D, let alone do collision, combination, etc. It'd be a struggle even on a modern PC.
<br/>
<br/>
@xtoc: Interesting idea... I think having a progression kinda ruins the main point of the game, but there could always be a separate mode for playing the progression vs. 'sandbox' mode. Heh, sandbox.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

PS: A nice new material would be Lava. Being fluid but flaming up everything in its way. Metal which doesn't burn by itself but can be heated up so bad that its other end incirnates wood.

<br/>
The trouble with being able to load arbitrary physics stuff dynamically is that it would be <span style="font-style: italic">very slow</span> without enormous amounts of trickery (dynamic recompilation, basically). It *might* be possible to write a compiler from the crazy wxSand physics files, and maybe some sort of plugin system could be worked out. AFAIK, though, position independent (i.e, plugin) code tends to be slower than normal code (correct me if I'm wrong), and I also need the plugin code to run on both the arm7 and the arm9. Oh, and it has to fit into itcm, too (though that shouldn't be an issue for all but the most complicated physics sets).
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about creating some kind of abstract syntax for representing physics models, but I think that's probably quite a way down the line. In the mean time, there looks to be a fair few good ideas here that I could appropriate :) Thanks for linking me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">@HyperHacker: There's also the problem that drawing circles breaks cache lines, and would be REALLY slow. Oh yeah, and it also would break the way I currently have the processing split across the ARM9/ARM7. So it's kind of important that it doesn't change.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, I think 'cheating' like that (drawing circles, thus breaking simplicity) also makes the game less fun -- more interesting effects are created without it, imo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

One tiny bug report... when I try and draw up and down the left side of the screen, I get streaks straight from the left side to the right side... this is probably a calibration issue, but I'm probably not the only person with a slightly-miscalibrated DS (and in fact, the calibration seemed spot-on to me)....

Odd... it's been yonks since I used that version (and it doesn't happen in my development version.) I guess that's what happens with betas!
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I've a smallish list of things I want to get done before I release beta 2. I'm not going to make promises on a release date, because I'm in the throes of my last year of school and there's no small amount of work, but I'll try to bring it out as soon as I can. Thanks to everyone for all the positive feedback!

My friend had the exact same idea yesterday! How weird. Anyway, I'd love to see what I could do with a motion sensor card, but I don't have one. If anyone *really* wants to see motion stuff happening.... ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There are a number of things I'd like to have rounded off a little better before the next release.

Boiling water certainly has been in many.
<br/>
<br/>
eg. Water + Lava =  Steam.
<br/>
<br/>
After awhile , the steam condense's and drips back down.
<br/>
Makes many interesting possibilitys.
<br/>
<br/>
Steam could be done with a reverseing of gravity, doing it with bouncey might get too complex.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --
