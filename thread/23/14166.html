Hi guys,
<br/>
<br/>
I have not posted this here before but a few of you may have played <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ds-scene.net/?s=viewtopic&amp;nid=3809" target="_blank">version 1.0a of Shooting Watch DS</a> about a month ago. I am posting here because yesterday I completed v2.0 of the game which is now available for download from the new homepage for <a class="postlink" href="http://files-ds-scene.net/shooting_watch/?" target="_blank">Shooting Watch DS</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
This new version has a vamped up slots mode which now costs coins to play and you can win coins. Coins are initially earnt by playing the Shooting Mode where you need to press the A button (or touch the screen) as fast as you can within 10 seconds.
<br/>
<br/>
Also new to this version is a shop where you can buy new icons and skins. The skins are just a little visual enhancement whilst you play the game but the icons have a bit more to them. You can transfer your scores over WiFi to the <a class="postlink" href="http://files-ds-scene.net/shooting_watch/?s=scores" target="_blank">Shooting Watch Ranking</a> table where your best score will be displayed along with the icon you purchased from the shop.
<br/>
<br/>
There appears to be some small issues with transfering data over WiFi and the game has a tendancy to lock up during this process. If this happens to you, reboot your DS and try to transfer again, this should fix the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
You can download the game from the official website download page which can be found <a class="postlink" href="http://files-ds-scene.net/shooting_watch/?s=download" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any questions, please feel free to ask. For those that played the first version, here is a quick list of what is new in this version.
