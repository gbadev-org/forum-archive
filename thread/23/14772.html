    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A while back there was <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=144466" target="_blank">this</a> discussion on doing essentially handwriting recognition. I've since rigged up a test demo though it didnt work. Had a look at it today and found the bug (forgot to add a 1). Works now, so <a class="postlink" href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=MF0GHZO0" target="_blank">here</a> it is. Sorry about the crappy link, dont have anywhere else to put it.

It'll try to recognise all the english lowercase single stroke characters. It'll also do f (without the horizontal dash) and j (without the dot). Accuracy is alright. Some letters will work really well (like m), while others will almost always get confused as another (d will either be recognised as a or q). The system is trained with my handwriting only, so some of you might have trouble getting it working properly. It uses angles, so keep your writing neat and upright.

I plan on releasing the recognition library and the training tools once i clean it all up, though I'll be quite busy throughout the next few months so dont expect anything soon :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
