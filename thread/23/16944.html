    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everyone... I'm new to 3D on the DS so there's a lot of tweaking to do, but I'm very pleased with the results so far and wanted to see if I could draw a little feedback if at all possible. This is... I guess about 3-4 weeks starting with no knowledge of OpenGL nor modeling.
<br/>
<br/>
This is just an untextured/uncolored mech (with a few lights on her) walking. The mech was modeled in Blender and converted using the PLY export and a plytods conversion utility found with a google search.
<br/>
<br/>
DPad rotates the head and guns. I've got some bleed (not sure if it happens on hardware, my new Acekard comes on Monday) on the gun barrel but should be able to work that out. I need to test on hardware to get the poly count and might have to simplify it more and rely on textures to get it looking nicer... but time will tell.

This guy is trying to create a 3D city with a drivable car. You can try it, the latest version just has a city without collisions, and a car.

I was wondering if anyone would comment on that... lol. Like cars are usually referred to that way, I thought I'd kind of keep that line of thinking here.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately... racing games (or games involving driving, like GTA) aren't really my thing. After the game with the mech I've got a lot of fantasy oriented ideas in my head...
<br/>
<br/>
Not to say I wouldn't consider it a challenge and give it a try perhaps... but I'd have feel a bit more drawn to it.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the comment so far, I'm working on actually lowering the poly count... trying not to ruin it and keep it looking decent. We'll see how it goes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So maybe you can make a battle game, were you select your mech, configure it (weapons...) and fight with it on a maps with other mechs :)<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.mariokartsource.com" target="_blank">www.mariokartsource.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The one I used to play you gained money by winning matches, which you could spend on upgrading armor/weapons/mines/engine upgrades etc.  One cool thing was that you could buy a 'drone' that you could launch.  It operated as a remote camera so you could find and track your opponent.

Can't seem to find it on google, I know it wasn't affliated with the mechwarrior series.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well... I don't want to get anyone's hopes up necessarily. This is already for an almost completely designed game concept and I'm not quite ready to give too much of it away.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll say this much... it's nothing like you're thinking if you're thinking a traditional mech on mech battle system, but I'm hoping very much that the game will come out well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
