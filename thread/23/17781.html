<br/>
You certainly know my Sprite editor "SEDS", which has been around for a while and <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=17532" target="_blank">updated lately</a>. Well, here's some good news if you had drawn some game art with it: I have at least a first release for its companion Level Editor on DS -- aka LEDS.
<br/>
<br/>
The software is still quite rough on the angles, and is more an internal tool released to the public, so expect some learning to be needed. But if you love doing some level design here and there and if you have empty time to fill in the bus or during step-family evenings, LEDS is the tool you'll love.
