Ok, I got it downloaded, it works fine, but I still hope that you will include a function that automatically copies the previous frame to the new frame if "&gt;" or "]+" is pressed. (this button could look like this: "o&gt;n"

You can playback at 12 or 6 frames per second. The AVI exporter can also generate 12 or 6 frames per second AVIs (the half speed checkbox).

The size of the animation is only limited by the size of your flash cart/memory card.

The AVI exporter can currently only handle about 21000 FlickBook frames. Which is about a 30 minute film at 12 frames per second.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
a games developer and have been demoing it for the guys at work and everyone was totally 
<br/>
impressed, the sylus jogging is sooo sweet :)
<br/>
<br/>
As eric3dee mentioned a tighter GUI would really help things along, I am also up for 
<br/>
giving ideas/critic/features of what I think would be nice to have.
<br/>
<br/>
A few functional additions that would help me out for v0.3:
<br/>
<br/>
- To be able to play back as a loop.
<br/>
- A possibility to insert frames between 2 frames.
<br/>
- A background layer that is static and locked.
<br/>
- A roughing layer/or laying for animations.
<br/>
- To be able to rotate/scale the paste buffers before pasting.
<br/>
- Pressure sensitive for line thickness.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks to all who have posted/emailed suggestions, keep them coming. I am listening and taking note.
<br/>
<br/>
Before I add new features there will be at least one maintenance release to tidy up the texture handling (the frames are drawn using the 3D hardware). This will allow me to remove the flicker when playing back and provide a platform for adding new features.
<br/>
The first new feature will probably be adding some form of layers support.
<br/>
<br/>
Can people be more specific about the GUI issues/improvements?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">nozzy, eric3dee, or anybody else, mock up of interface ideas/concepts would be useful.
<br/>
Some details:
<br/>
The tools windows are 16 colour only, three of which are the base colour and button high and low light colour. This can change but there are limits on the amount of memory available (what this limit is depends on where FlickBook goes).
<br/>
They must be rectangular in shape.
<br/>
The DS screen is only 256 by 192.
<br/>
Tools windows can easily be made to pop up (reaction to button press for example).
<br/>
<br/>
eric3dee:
<br/>
Higher res, beyond 256x128, may not be possible. This comes down to the amount of available texture memory on the DS (I am using the 3D hardware of the DS to display the drawing screen). With onion sinking and the future addition of layers this can be in short supply (there is at most 384KiBs available for the drawing screen).
<br/>
<br/>
When it come to colours (not the excellent homebrew app) where Flickbook goes with them I have not decided yet. The only reason for the red and blue colour is technical (the DS does not support 2 colour textures). I may split the app so you ink and colour an animation separately. Or it may stay as black and white (+red and blue) only. Again this is mainly technical due to the amount of memory.
<br/>
<br/>
Do people want colours or would they prefer layers?
<br/>
<br/>
There is a "center/reset view" button that returns the frame draw and tools windows back to there default positions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright- sounds good.  I'll try to find some time in the next week to mess around with interface design.  As far as color/layers goes, I think I'd prefer layers over color.. specifically one layer for roughing animation, then one layer for cleanup... but cleanup (ink/paint) in a separate app could be a neat idea too.  How about antialiasing?  Is that still a possibilty?  You've got a great little app here... ever since the DS was announced I've dreamed about Mario Paint for the DS (animation, painting, and music fun :D )... maybe that could serve as a good inspiration for the gui...

<a class="postlink" href="http://www.thehive.se/images/mockup.jpg" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold">Flickbook mockup</span></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Here's my cut at the kind of look and layout I was thinking of, all credit going to the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.plasticanimationpaper.dk/" target="_blank">PAP</a> guys for the Icons, etc I have used . 
<br/>
I have kept things roughly where you have them now. Things like adding frames is enough with one insert you can always 
<br/>
move in the sequence to add a frame where you like, the 2 delete buttons could be replaced by the delete button going red 
<br/>
first then deleting on the second press? 
<br/>
A nuke button to re-start.
<br/>
<br/>
A time-line instead of just writing the frame on the upper screen, maybe not as advanced as this.
<br/>
<br/>
A loop button :) 
<br/>
<br/>
A slider for line thickness (or if you up  looking at pressure for line thickness like "colors"?).
<br/>
<br/>
A blue for roughing, and of course B/W. 
<br/>
<br/>
The mask buttons, whole, partial and rotate mask. As for turning on and off and multiple pastes, is it possible as I mentioned 
<br/>
with the frame delete to have a lock out with the buttons? e.g, press the mask button, it changes a shade of red and stays 
<br/>
down, you drag your mask and then press the mask button again and it pops up and the mask gets stored.
<br/>
<br/>
The "onion-skins", I think is enough with one button, I always have both before and after on 
<br/>
anyway? And one loop though the stored masks button.
<br/>
<br/>
Upper screen pretty much the same. 
<br/>
<br/>
As for filling I really think this should be just an outline app. And really concentrate on nailing 
<br/>
down some useful tools for outline functionality. 
<br/>
<br/>
I vote for layers if we have to choose, at least 2 if possible, but the more the merrier :)
<br/>
<br/>
I also think some kind of options window that can be popped up might save even more valuable screen space.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:I just noticed I missed the reset button, but it should be there.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope it gives you some ideas :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
  I really like Flash's handling of the timeline, so I did something similar where you can choose frames in more of a nonlinear fashion... it also lets you see which frames are empty and which have drawings in them (note the black dots and empty dots).
<br/>
  I also added a quick layer picker (assuming you could add in some layering functionality) with 3 layers.
<br/>
  One other thing- I removed the Save/Load functions, as I think they would make more sense as an options screen (a la Colors), mapped to the Start button or something.  I also eliminated the white and opted for an eraser instead since I added the layering functionality in the mockup.  Lets see.. what else... I agree w/ nozzy's comment about maybe double-clcking the delete or something instead of 2 buttons.  I also figured the play button could be a toggle on/off thing (same with the loop button).  I will post a mockup option/title screen too if I get some time.  I can't say it enough... killer app- can't wait to see what ya do with it.  I hope this stuff helps!
<br/>
<br/>
--Oh yeah!  One more thing.  The idea would be if the timeline got more frames than could be displayed at the bottom, you could hold down the same button you use to pan, and pan across the timeline to see more of the frames.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Exactly, how are things going masscat? I took "Animanatee" for a spin, I think the title screen with the load/save option 
<br/>
is the way to go, but not to sure about the holding down of the shoulder button for the tools, i think my left index finger 
<br/>
would cramp up after about 10 minutes. Maybe a flip screens like "Nitro tacker".
<br/>
<br/>
Its nice to have all the tools grouped like that and have a clean area to work in?
<br/>
<br/>
Nice work madwurmz.com and eric3dee, the mario paint theme would be a nice way to go.
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I am not to sure about with "Animanatee" is the way the layers are 
<br/>
working at the moment, being forced to have a copy with the BG layer.
<br/>
I think a "BG" layer should be just that a static "BG" through the whole
<br/>
animation, and then have the possibility to have more layers, for roughing, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I quote from The thread:
<br/>
" BG gets copied over when you create a new frame, so you can have a persistent background, or modify it as you go".
<br/>
<br/>
It copies the previous frame, so every frame is a copy of the previous frame
<br/>
on the BG layer. A static BG layer for me would mean 1 frame that i draw out 
<br/>
roughly where my key frame are going to be, or just a reference of where a character will go. 
<br/>
<br/>
In "Animanatee" at the moment, if I would want to change the BG for a whole animation 
<br/>
I would have to do it on every frame in the BG layer. Where as if there was 1 static layer it would be just one drawing/frame.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am not abandoning FlickBook (although I have not had time to work on it since 0.2).
<br/>
FlickBook and Animanatee can happily live together and since they are developed separately they will follow their own path. But I am happy to share ideas and other things with DekuTree64 (for example the Java AVI exporter).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Finally been able to give Flickbook a bit of time, resulting in <a class="postlink" href="http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/FlickBook/bins/Flickbook_0_2_1.nds" target="_blank">Flickbook_0_2_1.nds</a>
<br/>
<br/>
From a feature point of view, it is the same as 0.2, with the only addition being that you can move between frames using left and right on the d-pad (and Y and A for the lefties) - why I did not do that originally I do not know.
<br/>
<br/>
What has changed is the user interface - it is no longer green. The title screen was created by eric3dee, taken from earlier in this thread (many thanks). Most of the buttons/icons are taken from the icon library from the <a class="postlink" href="http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project" target="_blank">Tango Project</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
It is also skinable, so you can change the look of the interface should you wish. A skin comprises a number of BMP file with particular names located in the <span style="font-style: italic">Flickbook/skin</span> directory. These files must be 256x192 size and 256 or 16 colours BMP files.
<br/>
<br/>
You can find an example skin (the default skin compiled into Flickbook) <a class="postlink" href="http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/FlickBook/bins/default_skin.tar.bz2" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
If you want to play with a skin you will need an application that allows you to control the palette (The Gimp was used to make the default skin).
<br/>
<br/>
The title screen is a simple BMP file called <span style="font-style: italic">title.bmp</span>.
<br/>
The buttons for other screens are described using three file, for example <span style="font-style: italic">newload_normal.bmp</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">newload_pressed.bmp</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">newload_mask.bmp</span>.
<br/>
The <span style="font-style: italic">_normal.bmp</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">_pressed.bmp</span> give the normal and pressed image data for the buttons. These files should share the same palette otherwise strange colour changes will happen.
<br/>
The <span style="font-style: italic">_mask.bmp</span> file defines the shape and active area (the bit that will react to a stylus touch) of the buttons. The colour index of each pixel is used to do this. Colour 0 does not form part of any button. The shape of first button is given by colour 1 and 2. The active area of the first button is given by colour 2. Colour 3 and 4 define the second button in a similar manner and so on for all the buttons.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
A preview of release 0.3 is what.
<br/>
<br/>
You can get it <a class="postlink" href="http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/FlickBook/bins/Flickbook_0_3_preview.nds" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Changes:
<br/>
<ul><li>256 by 192 sized frames
<br/>
</li><li>256 colours
<br/>
</li><li>saves to /data/Flickbook
<br/>
</li><li>get to name films (no more film_a, film_b)
<br/>
</li><li>a palette editor
<br/>
</li><li>selectable past and future onion skinning of 1 to 3 frames
<br/>
</li><li>get a nice warning when exiting without saving
<br/>
</li><li>change to the flickbook.xml format
<br/>
</li><li>lots of internal changes to the way Flickbook works
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
You cannot load films from earlier version into this version. I may put a film converter into the Java export app.
<br/>
<br/>
Why the preview?
<br/>
There is a little bluish button on the right of the screen that does not do anything yet.
<br/>
There have been lots of changes to the way Flickbook works and I would like any feed back on problems. You may want to backup the contents of your flash card before using (just in case).
<br/>
The Java exporter application needs updating to support the new flickbook.xml format and I need a working DS app to provide me with some test material.
<br/>
<br/>
How to use?
<br/>
Changes to control from version 0.2.1:
<br/>
You will be prompted for a film name if you select the new film button. Enter a name and press the on screen return key.
<br/>
Onion skinning is now setup using eight buttons near the top left of the screen. The two middle blue buttons clear any past/future onion skinning. The buttons to the left and right of these setup 1,2 or 3 frame onion skinning.
<br/>
To delete the current frame touch and hold the delete button (minus sign next to the playback/frame control buttons). A second delete button will appear just above this. To confirm the delete slide up to touch this second delete button and release the stylus from the screen. Releasing the stylus any where other than the second delete button will cancel the delete.
<br/>
There are four colour select buttons. The one that looks like an eraser always selects the background colour. You can assign any of the 256 colours from the film's palette to the other three. Touch and hold any of the colour select buttons to be taken to the palette editor. The lower portion of the palette editor shows and allow you to select colours from the film's palette. You can edit the colours using HSV H, S, V and RGB R, G, B sliders. Select a colour select button and then select the palette colour to assign it that colour.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I will probably use the <a class="postlink" href="http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/FlickBook/flickbook.php" target="_blank">flickbook web page</a> for instructions for the time being. Although I have not updated it to include the features in the 0.3 preview and will not until I release the full 0.3 version.
<br/>
<br/>
I did mean to put looping playback in but forgot about it (it is easily implemented). Something like doing a 'hold' on the play button to start doing looping playback.
<br/>
<br/>
How are people getting on with the 'hold' a button to do a second function thing?
<br/>
The reason for it is to try and reduce the number of buttons needed by providing two functions through one button. I do plan to provide three methods of button input, a single tap, a double tap and a hold.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I agree whole-heartedly with eric3dee on this one. When animating pose-to-pose you need to be able to flip between just your keys even if they're on frames 1, 8 &amp; 12. Usually I would just take those three pieces of paper and put them together on my pegboard without any extra pages in between. In Maya I can either start with those poses on frames 1,2,3 and then re-time them once I'm happy with the poses or I can drag them around on the timeline to adjust the timing while still being able to flip between them with the "," and "." keys. If it's too hard to implement a timeline with moveable keyframes than maybe you could make it possible to flip between only the frames with drawings on them using the d-pad. In that case, it would also be useful to have two modes for onion skinning: on based on frames - and the other based on drawings, regardless of what frames they are on.
<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the more general things like an intuitive interface, and control over the drawing tools (both of which are looking good in Flickbook right now) my list of top features needed in a serious animation app are (in order of priority):
<br/>
<br/>
1) the above mentioned ability to re-time my keys
<br/>
2) ability to "flip" through my keys
<br/>
2) layers (persistent background, and animated foreground)
<br/>
3) onion skinning
<br/>
4) undo
<br/>
<br/>
That's my wishlist, and it's great to see that it's already partially there.

I am getting an understanding of what you are after with the timeline thing. Reordering frames would not be difficult to implement in Flickbook so I will definitely look at putting the feature into a future release (not 0.3 though).
<br/>
<br/>
Originally I wrote Flickbook so I could make simple little stick men animations to entertain myself. But I am no animator so suggestions for features that aid the animation process are very welcome.

<br/>
Not many people were. I did not even like it as it was not much fun to change or implement new buttons and screens - one of the reasons Flickbook sat idle at version 0.2 for so long. The move to the skinnable interface in version 0.2.1 means I can spend less time on the interface and more on the functionality and the interface looks much nicer too.
<br/>
<br/>
And just a quick test film showing layers working in version 0.3 (coming soon).

I have added a feature to my development version of the Java avi exporter that, given a 256x192 256 colour image file, makes a Flickbook film using the image as a fixed background layer. Once created, copy the film directory over to your DS flash card and then happily animate over the top. This version of the Java avi exporter will get released along with version 0.3 of Flickbook.
<br/>
<br/>
I will probably add a "play key frame to key frame" feature when I look into the whole key frame/timeline/frame reordering thing.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit:</span> in a change of mind, you can get version 0.4 of the Java avi exporter (creates fixed background films) from the <a class="postlink" href="http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/FlickBook/flickbook.php" target="_blank">Flickbook page</a>. And to take advantage, I have updated the <a class="postlink" href="http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/FlickBook/bins/Flickbook_0_3_preview.nds" target="_blank">0.3 preview</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Changes to the preview:
<br/>
Can select the layer you will draw to using tabs down right of screen (no layer creation in the preview).
<br/>
Fix to the paste/mark region not appearing.
<br/>
Onion skinning works as described a couple of posts back. There is now a limit of a total of 4 onion skinning frames available, this can be spread between past or future frames.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit2:</span> there is a bug in the preview where if you open a film with a fixed background and then close it and open a film without a fixed background, the first background is still displayed (using the new film's palette). Workaround is to power off your DS after closing the fixed background film. Teach me to release updates to the preview willy-nilly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVaqKQst8AU" target="_blank">Man on an island</a> gives an example of the layers. The order of the layers is as follows (topmost layer first):
<br/>
Normal layer
<br/>
Fixed layer containing the tree.
<br/>
Normal layer
<br/>
Fixed layer containing the island and sea.
<br/>
<br/>
By drawing on the second normal layer it allows the man to go behind the tree.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have updated the <a class="postlink" href="http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/FlickBook/flickbook.php#exporter_releases" target="_blank">Java Flickbook exporter</a> (now version 0.5) to allow it to convert old Flickbook films (made with Flickbook version 0.1 or 0.2) to the new format used in Flickbook 0.3.
<br/>
<br/>
If you load an old format film there will be a "convert to latest format" item in the export menu.
<br/>
<br/>
So anybody who has created some epic film in an earlier release can now continue it using Flickbook 0.3.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Good to hear you are enjoying Flickbook.
<br/>
<br/>
As for hiding the on screen buttons, not at the moment.
<br/>
<br/>
I have not been working on Flickbook for a while (I go through phases of doing development on it). But when I do I will think about putting something like this in.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My fault, My fault~ i know some of the button is 'holdingable'...I should try the play button...
<br/>
<br/>
by the way...Believe it or not, 80% of the the reason i buy a NDSL is the Animation App...and at that time, i only know there is a APP called flipbook...
<br/>
so i wish this app is keeping growing. i will support it and i wish i can do something helpful</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would anyone have a few of their flickbook film files to share with me?  I wanted to know if anyone could send me a few of their raw files to load onto my DS.  I have a long trip to do with a few kids and wanted them see what others have been able to create.  I am happy to share few as well.  If you need the steps to copy the film files, each animation has its own directory (named after itself). Within these there is a Flickbook.xml file that gives the palette, layers description and frame order of the animation. There is a directory for each layer that actually contains the frame images.  To copy animation onto and off of the DS copy the entire directory for the animation. That is, should you have an animation "HelloWorld" on your DS there will be a directory /data/flickbook/HelloWorld. To copy this off copy the HelloWorld directory and all its content. Thank you in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
