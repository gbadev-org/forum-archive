<br/>
* Saving and loading
<br/>
* Scrambling
<br/>
* Palette editing
<br/>
* Painting
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Still to do:</span>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, this is a very nice game!  I like to play with Rubik's cube, and with this app it's easier to do it anywhere.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Features that are awesome:
<br/>
<br/>
- Colouring the labels of the cube. This is a very nice touch.
<br/>
- Three save slots.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately the saved cubes disappear for me when I reset the DS. I'm using an M3 Perfect SD (Slot-2). DLDI patching didn't solve the issue.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Features I'd like to see:
<br/>
<br/>
- Full free spin of the cube <a class="postlink" href="http://www.freegames.ws/games/javagames/rubik/gamecube.htm" target="_blank">(example)</a>. The orientation of the cube as of now can't be changed, 'up' side is always upwards and 'down' side is always downwards.
<br/>
- The other features you mention, step-through solving and background decoration (colours, wallpapers).
<br/>
- Undo move / redo move.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
