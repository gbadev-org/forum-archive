    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've made a trivia game for the DS, which is supposed to work a lot like IRC Triviabots but with only one player. It gives you a hint by showing the answer with all the letters replaced by dots, and starts revealing more dots every time you get the question wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
The game comes with a questions file to put on the root of your card. It contains 10 000 questions from an IRC Triviabot.
<br/>
<br/>
The controls are explained when you start up the game, and installation is explained in the readme file.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Jeremysr,
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for this homebrew, but there's something wrong in it....questions must be in data/trivia and not in the root ;)
<br/>
<br/>
// Path to directory that contains the question file(s)
<br/>
#define PATH_TO_QUESTIONS "/data/trivia/"
<br/>
<br/>
ps : little problem with very long answers :

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">works great!  this will be a great time killer on a plane!
<br/>
<br/>
only suggestion, if possible, new questions downloadable via wifi would be awesome...not that i'll get through 10,000 questions anytime soon...
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the great app!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
