    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everybody! I am developping a new cartographic engine for DS Weather Report that will allow you to see the weather for the whole world, and not only Europe. Now, I release a first version of this engine in my new project, <span style="font-weight: bold">Treasures of Gaia</span>, <a class="postlink" href="http://stravingo.over-blog.fr" target="_blank">available on my devblog</a>.

<br/>
Treasures of Gaia allows you to browse on your DS an extremely detailed map of the entire world thanks to Google Maps (a Wifi connection is mandatory). The whole world is now in your DS! :)  You can scroll the map with the pad or the stylus. Use the L/R buttons for zooming in and out. Up to twenty zoom levels are available, depending on the area.

<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of Treasures of Gaia is to let you appreciate the beauty of our world :)  You can freely travel where you want, but special locations are also provided: the 851 places inscribed by the UNESCO on the <a class="postlink" href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list" target="_blank">World Heritage List</a> for their outstanding universal value to humanity. These places are indicated on the map, but are only shown at zoom levels greater than 5 for legibility. To obtain information about a place, you only have to touch its location with the stylus. The information are displayed on the upper screen, where you can switch between a picture of the place, a description, or its location on a global map.

<br/>
<br/>
You can also browse the whole list sorted by countries by pressing the Y button. When you click on a place in the list, the same information are displayed on the upper screen, and you can directly go to this location by touching the "Go!" button.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">aye! this is a FINE brew, I must say.
<br/>
<br/>
any input as to what to expect from future updates?
<br/>
<br/>
it'd be REAL slick to see an address look up kind of thing. find an actual street address, and maybe a second one you could find directions..?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
even just looking up an adress, or city, would be a very nice feature.
<br/>
<br/>
I was able to find my own neighborhood after messing around with this app for about 5 or so minutes.

<br/>
well done sir!<br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks to all of you! This is an ongoing project with still a lot of ideas to implement :)
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, Treasures of Gaia v0.2 is now available <a class="postlink" href="http://stravingo.over-blog.fr" target="_blank">on my blog</a>. Some people said that it was difficult in v0.1 to find a precise location because it lacks of reference points such as city locations. Well, <span style="font-weight: bold">the biggest improvement in this new version is that you can now switch between a satellite view and a map view by pressing button A!</span>

<br/>
<br/>
Other improvements are the following:
<br/>
- You can zoom on a site by clicking a second time on its location on the map.
<br/>
- Partially translated in French (about 80%).
<br/>
- Better looking map on the upper screen (less JPEG compression).
<br/>
- Bugfix: the zoom was not centered properly.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://stravingo.over-blog.fr/" target="_blank">My games (<span style="font-weight: bold">Ka-BoOm</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Setsuzoku no Puzzle</span>) and apps (<span style="font-weight: bold">DS Weather Report</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Treasures of Gaia</span>) on DS are available on my blog!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great update already!
<br/>
<br/>
However, I was searching around for my house on the street address mode, and somehow I had errors where some of the "blocks" of snapshots weren't stuck together right, if that makes sense.  Basically, it seemed like part of the map was shifted over.  When this happened, I went back to terrain viewing mode, and then it wouldn't go back to map mode even though it was selected.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This occurs in google earth too, unless I'm misunderstanding you. Different satellites take different pictures, they're not all gonna match up like a jigsaw puzzle.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

No, this was something else.  This was a HUGE shift, even parts of the text like city names were shifted or moved or something.  I don't know what exactly happened but the display obviously wasn't right.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, you're right. Someone else reported me the same bug. It is due to my memory cache management: there is one condition that I don't handle correctly. It will be corrected in the next release, sorry about that.
