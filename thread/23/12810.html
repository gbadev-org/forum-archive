    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm proud to present the first little app using my DS GUI lib: ReadMore. It's in alpha, but it's enough to look at.
<br/>
<br/>
ReadMore is an Ebook Reader with no frills, bells or whistles. It currently has the following features:
<br/>
<br/>
o Book-style format; the DS is held on end like a pocket book.
<br/>
o Only .txt files supported.
<br/>
o Anti-aliased fonts, changeable per document.
<br/>
o Three bookmarks per document.
<br/>
o Last visited document is re-opened on program start.
<br/>
<br/>
You can get it at <a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/downloads/readmore/ReadMoreAlpha.zip" target="_blank">http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/downloads/readmore/ReadMoreAlpha.zip</a>. There's a ReadMe file in the ZIP which you should read before installing.
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!
<br/>
<br/>
Regards,
<br/>
Bj?rn<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">DSFTP homepage</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All I can say is ....WOW!
<br/>
<br/>
This is <span style="font-style: italic">very</span> professional looking, on par with Brain Age's readers.  I like it better than DSO and moonshell's text readers.
<br/>
<br/>
The interface is really simple and easy on the eyes.
<br/>
<br/>
When you first boot up the nds file, there is a help tutorial on how to use this app.  The tutorial is easily understandable.
<br/>
<br/>
Everything works flawlessly so far.
<br/>
<br/>
Some really cool points:
<br/>
<br/>
-When you touch the right side of the touch screen, you move a page forward.
<br/>
-When you touch the left side of the touch screen, you move a page back
<br/>
-you can change the font size (size 10,12,14) and style (bold or italic)
<br/>
autosaves last page you were at
<br/>
<br/>
Some suggestions:
<br/>
-include a function with the L and R buttons that allows you to skip 10 pages forward and back respectively
<br/>
-Music?  :)
<br/>
<br/>
Excellent work!  I commend you!
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
Problems I have:
<br/>
<br/>
How do you use the multiple fonts?
<br/>
<br/>
I followed your instructions and made a folder in my microSD's root directory called 'data'.  In the data folder, I then made a folder called 'fonts'.  I put all the .bfont files i into my fonts folder.
<br/>
<br/>
However, when I loaded ReadMore.nds, I only had the 3 default fonts.
<br/>
<br/>
The autosave function worked, so the 'states' folder I made in the fonts folder was working correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I totally ignored the following 3 files and did not put them in my fonts folder:
<br/>
<br/>
ReadFont.cpp
<br/>
mkbfont.py
<br/>
fontformat.txt</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Good one. I've planned making a "goto page" dialog which lets you jump to any page directly; but shortcuts are always good. Only problem: The ergonomy of the L button is bad when you hold the DS on end. Would holding the R button (with the other hand) as a modifier for the Next and Previous buttons be a solution?

That's strange, works flawlessly here. Can't be a flash cart issue either since you can open text files. Could you please double-check that the fonts are indeed in /data/fonts/*.bfont? Maybe I'll build a debug version that will do a bit of output when the font manager tries to load the fonts.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">DSFTP homepage</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Instead of making R and L skip pages, why not 'X' and 'B"?  This way the back of the hand won't accidentally make any mistakes.

Both very good points -- at least the backlight and clock features will come.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In addition to backlight control, screen brightness control might be a nice addition. You simply adjust a register and everything gets darker or brighter automatically.
<br/>
If it's not too difficult, I'm sure an option to invert colours would be appreciated by many. Maybe a background image (just load a bitmap behind the text layer, let the user worry about choosing an image that doesn't make it unreadable). I don't know just how simple you have in mind. I certainly wouldn't expect you to add MP3 playing, because then you'd have to add OGG and FLAC and SPC and blah blah and fix a bunch of bugs and hack around the DS's low-quality sound hardware... Moonlight already made a program for this if you must listen to music while reading.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I don't know how many people would agree with me, but there's two things I like to see in every DS app: On-screen clock and temperature (at least on a pause menu or similar), and support for rebootlib/libcartreset/etc. Again, not much effort required for either.
<br/>
<br/>
As for controls, the touch screen idea is nice, but if I may make a suggestion: Up=previous page, Down=next page.  Right and Left could be next/previous line, change font size, skip multiple pages, etc. X=previous chapter, B=next chapter, Start opens a touch-screen menu to select, add, or remove a bookmark. Then you still have Select, A, Y and R for whatever else. L would be best unused so you don't accidentally press it. Of course, these can be swapped if you want to have it held the other way. Heh, maybe use the DS Motion Card to detect how the user is holding the DS, and rotate the text to match. ;-)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Hmm. I think that just about any background structure (that is representable on the low color depth of the DS) makes the text less readable. I.e., a texture that looks like hand-made paper would look very precious, but that's very hard to get right if you only have 15bpp. Since readability is paramount for this program, don't count on this.

Clock's already in. Temperature? Why the heck would I like a book to tell me how hot it is, especially if I'm holding it in my hand? Rebootlib etc.: Good point, will see about that.

The controls will stay much like they are now, with a few careful additions. Left hand/right hand stuff is easy with my GUI lib; I just don't know if left-handers will gain anything from holding the DS differently in an app like this.

I seem to recall there being another one, perhaps this was it and I'm just not remembering it right, but anyway you set bits 14-15 to choose whether to go brighter or darker, and 0-4 for how much so.
<br/>
<br/>
Inversion: Reading a backlit screen is different from reading a book. Books are black on white because white on black would use terrible amounts of ink. ;-) Some people find it more comfortable to have inverted colours on a screen, mainly because it's not as bright that way while still being perfectly readable. (Also, I noticed a window with bright text on a black background is readable at up to 35% translucency while one with dark text on white is readable up to only 20% over the same background, but that's off topic.)
<br/>
<br/>
Backgrounds: Like I said, leave it up to the user to come up with an image that maintains readability. (I find taking an image and putting a 30% translucent solid white layer overtop works nicely; you can do this in most photo editors.) Do you mean to say there's no way you could even support backgrounds without killing readability? Seems if you just made all white pixels transparent (or doing it on a single layer, draw your background first and then text as normal), it should be fine assuming the background isn't too bad.
<br/>
<br/>
Controls: I find having the Dpad at the top is most comfortable when using the right hand, and vice-versa for the left, as this allows my fingers to easily reach the buttons.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, no problem at all -- my GUI lib supports alpha backgrounds up to full translucency. The problem is more of a UI/SW one: Integrate a JPEG lib, make an image selection dialog with a preview, etc. We'll see.

Oh, OK -- I figured as a right hander you'd hold the DS in your left hand (to be able to use stylus and touch screen with your right), but I get your point. Maybe I'll put in handedness-switching.

<br/>
<br/>
I had assumed that since you were going for a sideways setup with the screens you were going to let the text continue across from one screen to the other (with touch/D-Pad input scrolling the text up or down), finally creating a text reader for the DS that would display a respectable amount of characters per line. I was, for lack of a better word, dismayed that you had used each screen as it's own "page", which results in even less characters per line than the other readers available.
<br/>
<br/>
I am sure in today's world I am in the considerable minority; but all documents, articles, source code, notes, etc that I write are formatted to 80 characters per line so that it will display properly in both web browsers and standard terminal emulators. Unfortunately these are rendered nearly unreadable (at least to me) on every DS text reader available.
<br/>
<br/>
As for some more constructive criticism, I think that if the goal is to make it as book-like as possible, there should be at least a papery page turning noise to give the user a little feedback and make it feel more natural.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sounds like a good idea, unwrapping ...

Don't know why, but the e-books I downloaded (Lewis Caroll &amp; Edgar A. Poe) are all wrapped at pos. 41.

So I wanted to break them at another position, but unwrapping and having the e-reader wrap them is probably a better idea!!

I feel your pain. The thing is that the documents you are referring to are word-wrapped to be read in a fixed-width font (otherwise, wrapping at n characters per line doesn't make any sense). 
<br/>
<br/>
The DS's screen resolution, 256 pixels wide, would mean 3.2 pixels per character at 80 characters per line. Your suggestion, using 2*192 pixels by holding the DS upright and making one virtual screen from the two screens, would leave 4.8 pixels per character. Subtract one pixel for inter-char spacing, and you end up with 2.2 or 3.8 pixels. That is not a readable size.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid displaying standard 80cpl text is just not feasible with the DS. The best thing we can do is re-wrap the text to fit the DS's screens.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I also agree that 192 pixels doesn't make for very long lines, but I think the 2*192 pixel layout with the large bar in the middle isn't very readable either.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">DSFTP homepage</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
- "Go to page" dialog box.
<br/>
- Display page number in the way "actual / total".
<br/>
- Semi-transparent onscreen clock.
<br/>
- Show only readible files in open file dialog.
<br/>
- Multiple formats reader: TXT, HTML, RTF...
<br/>
- Image rendering in HTML and RTF.
<br/>
- Sonore feedback when page changes / click on things.
<br/>
- "Select background" dialog, wich lists various tiles kept on \data\tiles\ (JPG or  PNG). So we could have the "organic paper" discussed before.

Pfft. Bitmaps would be fine, a 256x384 16-bit bitmap would be a mere 192K. Just allow your file selector to select .bmp files as well, and make them the background. You could then later add JPEG, preview etc once the more important things are done.

I attempted to follow the instructions, but I ended up getting lost about halfway through.  I decided that the best way would be to convert it from a .ttf file, but I was unable to figure out how to create one of those with a font that small.  I found a similar font that's already in .ttf format at <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/341201/" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/341201/</a> but when I attempt to convert it I get the following:

<a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v41/danthemanms/convert_log.png" target="_blank">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v41/danthemanms/convert_log.png</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm at a loss as to how I should proceed.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  alright, after some Googling I found that I had to install PIL, so I did so and now it compiles.  The .bfont file is at <a href="http://danthemanms.googlepages.com/Quark_Normal_6.bfont" target="_blank">http://danthemanms.googlepages.com/Quark_Normal_6.bfont</a> but I haven't tested it myself yet.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 2:  I wonder why it isn't coming out as good as the preview image of the font itself showed.  On the DS, the "B" looks like a "C" and other letters have blank areas.  How odd.  At least it's small enough to fit about 50 characters per line per screen, which should be more than enough for the 80 characters per line in dual screen mode, as long as the line doesn't consist entirely of Ws and Ms and Qs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey bjorn, nice app, to start.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm not sure if anyone else has posted about this, but here goes.
<br/>
<br/>
While using ReadMore I noticed that there is a delay, about 1 second, between page turn and page render. It's not a killer problem, but it is mildly irritating.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing that the app renders each page as it turns to it, correct?
<br/>
<br/>
Well, anyway, I think it would be useful if you could implement the following method.
<br/>
<br/>
Once a page has been loaded, wait for a short period to determine if the user is rapidly paging through opened text file. If the user does not hit page forward or page back, then you can assume that he/she is going to read the page. This gives you a period of time in which you can do stuff. Of course, said period is variable, but there is probably a minimum amount of time in which you can expect a reader to make their way through the text available.
<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest rendering the next set of pages in this time period available.
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, next is a relative term in this context, as the user may, for some inane reason, be reading from back to front.
<br/>
<br/>
So, what you could do is as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
After rendering page 1, wait a short period to see if the user is paging immediately. If not, start rendering page 2.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, the user hits next page and goes to 2. You bring 2 from the buffer and display it immediately, while storing the previous page (page 1) in another buffer. You wait the requisite time, and the start rendering page 3.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, for something more complex.
<br/>
<br/>
Your user has turned to page 3, read some, and decided to go back to page 2.
<br/>
<br/>
You turn back, bring page 2 from the backup buffer, and store page 3 (The previous page) in a new backup buffer. You wait the requisite amount of time, then start rendering page 1 in a buffer.
<br/>
<br/>
It could be a useful thing to implement, as it would allow for faster traversal...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

<br/>
I can see that it would be -- 1s is a lot. Since I don't have that here, though (here it's about 1/4s), I suppose the flash cart is at fault, since ReadMore reads each page on page turn to be able to access documents that are too large for the DS' memory. That may change in the future, though -- I'm still trying to figure out how to fseek() to the right spot in a file if the file's contents are not what is actually displayed on screen, such as with RTF or HTML files.
<br/>
<br/>
As to your scheme: I don't think it's really that helpful. If I'm paging through the text slowly (i.e. to read it), I don't mind the delay that much. And if I'm paging quickly (i.e. to find a specific spot in the text), the scheme doesn't help. I'd rather get page access and rendering optimized without resorting to background hacks...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">DSFTP homepage</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I messed with making the S look like that earlier today, but I concluded that it took away too many pixels and looked lopsided.  The N I was also thinking about, as that's the way the Quark font does it, and it seems readable enough that I can deal with the change.  I've modified the K and R to match the Quark one as well to increase readability, though I'm keeping my blocky O and 0 and my skinny M and W.
<br/>
<br/>
I've also reduced the space to 2 pixels in width instead of 4, and I've changed all punctuation and symbols to use the smallest width as well.  The end result is that I'm able to get at least 50 letters and numbers per line, more if punctuation is used.

<br/>
<br/>
I can see that it would be -- 1s is a lot. Since I don't have that here, though (here it's about 1/4s), I suppose the flash cart is at fault, since ReadMore reads each page on page turn to be able to access documents that are too large for the DS' memory. That may change in the future, though -- I'm still trying to figure out how to fseek() to the right spot in a file if the file's contents are not what is actually displayed on screen, such as with RTF or HTML files.
<br/>
<br/>
As to your scheme: I don't think it's really that helpful. If I'm paging through the text slowly (i.e. to read it), I don't mind the delay that much. And if I'm paging quickly (i.e. to find a specific spot in the text), the scheme doesn't help. I'd rather get page access and rendering optimized without resorting to background hacks...</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Nothing hackish about taking advantage of the fact that people take time to read. Anyway, if you can optimise the render times such that there is no delay, that's fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Are you streaming text off the media as you changes pages? That would be kind of wasteful, if it means that you only ever store two pages worth of text in the memory at a time. It would be better to pre-buffer more than just the current/upcoming page. Maybe allocate 64kb of fast memory as a text buffer and use some clever memory managment to minimise individual reads.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, whatever the case may be, I don't think pre-rendering future pages is hackish, it just makes sense. After all, what else are you planning to do with the CPU in the 5s, maybe less, it takes me to read both pages?<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

I'm revamping the file concept. The current version only loads the displayed part of a file. That causes problems with some memory cards (too slow), and it's hard to paginate non-txt file formats that way.
<br/>
<br/>
Therefore I'd like to know if it's possible to load the entire Ebook into memory at once. So, what's the largest Ebook file you folks have? Would ~3MB be enough?

<br/>
<br/>
This is IMHO one of the best homebrew apps out there for the DS and i'm looking forward for it growing bigger and better in the future.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll report suggestions and bugs as soon as i spot them to help out a little bit.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!
<br/>
<br/>
UPDATE:
<br/>
Alright, after i've tested the app a little bit I've found:
<br/>
<br/>
1)Tapping the file name doesn't open the file selection menu, it opens some sort of on screen keyboard.
<br/>
<br/>
2)Creating a directory called data/states/ doesn't do anything, the app doesn't resume your last opened file if you launch it again.
<br/>
<br/>
3)The menu button doesn't have a shutdown function for the DS 
<br/>
<br/>
4)Bookmarks aren't saved after shutting down the DS and reopening the App.
<br/>
<br/>
5)After loading a file, sometimes it refuses to load any other one after it and a msg comes up saying "can't load file."
<br/>
<br/>
6)The bookmarks do not appear on the progress line.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using a R4 slotcart and the nds file was patched with the dldi correctly (i can open txt files just fine). I'm guessing bug 2 and 4 has something to do with write access on the R4.

I've formatted the R4 fat16 (as recommended by a users on R4 forums)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#126191 - argus - Fri Apr 20, 2007 8:32 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I love this app.  Here is my constructive criticism:
<br/>
<br/>
-- A page turning sound would be nice.
<br/>
-- Please, please do not create so many files in my text file directory!  Why not put those files in the data/whatever folder so I don't have to look at them?  Maybe you could even put all of that data into -one- master file somewhere in the /data directory.
<br/>
-- If you must create all of the files in my text folder, how about this:  make the Readmore load menu only show .txt files.  Those are the only files that can be opened, right?  Basically, I just don't want to see all of that clutter if it has to be there.  If you could make those .bkmk and .pagin files "hidden" (so most file browsers don't have to see them), then that would be even better.
<br/>
-- I can understand the pagination thing, but I haven't used any bookmarks yet and I'm buried in .bkmk files.  Could you just create them when a bookmark gets created?
<br/>
-- The readme says I can tap the file name to bring up the "open" menu, but I haven't been able to get that to work.
<br/>
-- The progress bar should be a little thicker and easier to see.  Maybe it could be 4 pixels tall with more contrast?
<br/>
-- I would love to set my default font size to 12 (instead of 10) so I wouldn't have to change it every time I open a new file.
<br/>
-- I'd just love some options overall.  Maybe I'm not the typical user, but I don't want it to automatically go back to where I last was in a file (I'm using it for reference reading - not novels).  You could do options in an .ini file (easier than programming an options menu), and casual users wouldn't have to mess with anything if they don't want to.
<br/>
-- The load menu scroll bar seems unresponsive or awkward sometimes.  It's hard to explain.  Is it just me?
<br/>
-- I like advancing pages with the d-pad.  Could you map some of the other functions (like opening the menu) to buttons as well?  That way I wouldn't have to use the stylus at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I'm using Readmore to look at reference material, short articles, FAQs, etc.  It does an excellent job so far, and I love the "book" style.  Hey, how about automatically showing a graphic book cover with the file name on it?  That would be clever.
<br/>
<br/>
Aside from these requests, Readmore runs great and is very useful.  I'm using a Supercard Lite with a Sandisk Ultra II microSD card.  I haven't noticed the page delay that other people have mentioned, so I think having a fast card helps.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
BTW, where exactly should i create this Data directory, because wherever i make one it doesn't make any difference. It doesn't resume my book progress when i load it again or read any more than 3 font styles.
<br/>
<br/>
right now, readmore is in a directory inside my R4 that looks like this:
<br/>
<br/>
X:\Homebrew\Readmore\
<br/>
<br/>
if I create DATA\ directory in the root of the drive like this:
<br/>
<br/>
X:\DATA\Fonts\ and X:\DATA\States\ 
<br/>
<br/>
all that happens is that readmore lists just two more fonts in the font list (eventhough the font directory has like a ton) and nothing else. it doesn't resume or create any .ini files anywhere.

<br/>
if i create DATA\ directory in the root of the application folder like this:

<br/>
I used gba bookreader  <a href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a> for a long time before I lost my gameboy.  
<br/>
But now I'm happy with the "Readmore reader". 
<br/>
All is great and usable but personally I did not like the anti-aliased fonts, the look dirty to me. I 
<br/>
made my own pixel fonts (they are Cyrillic to). 
<br/>
<a href="http://v.foto.radikal.ru/0704/c5/c1be72bba84b.gif">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I had only one problem: In the bookmarks menu the local fonts are not shown correctly, I used Cyrillic. 
<br/>
Here are some suggestions and thoughts. The main needed option in my opinion is the sleep mode when you close the DS
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">SUGGESTIONS</span>
<br/>
1. sleep mode when u close the DS
<br/>
2. please make the right file listing how it must be for example:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">    diskroot\Readmore                       
<br/>
    diskroot\Readmore\DATA\Fonts     &lt;------ place for the font files
<br/>
    diskroot\Readmore\DATA\States    &lt;------ place for the temporary files
<br/>
    diskroot\Readmore\Books             &lt;------ place for the text files
<br/>
    diskroot\Readmore\Books\Bmarks &lt;------ place for the text bookmarks</span>
<br/>
<br/>
3. Make the ability to change buttons for different functions like in games. The most needed option for me is using the "R" button for forward paging when u have the DS in your left hand. 
<br/>
4. The ability to use only upper screen in horizontal mode in case the DS lies on the table
<br/>
5. The dialog or the option in the down menu to see with the percentage of reading
<br/>
6. Better opening files menu 
<br/>
7. More bookmarks than three
<br/>
8. Full screen mode: the option to see only text without the down menu
<br/>
9. There is no need in the file name in the down panel. It would be more logical to see there the page number
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Things that should be optional I really don't like them</span>
<br/>
1. clock - the screen is already to small to have it (may be like the part of the dialog)
<br/>
2. background image - not functional 
<br/>
3. Page flip animation - not functional at all
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
OK, thx all for the positive and great feedback! A new version will be out soon, probably next week, which will be much better than the alpha. And expect even more exciting news in the future!
<br/>
<br/>
That said, let me try to address your points. I like some suggestions, don't like others.
<br/>
<br/>
o there will be a page turning animation (can be disabled), but no sound. That'd get on my nerves real quick.
<br/>
<br/>
o The bkmk and pagin files are necessary, and I'd much rather put them with the files they belong to than collect them in a separate dir. I'll prefix them with a dot, so they don't show up in file browsers.
<br/>
<br/>
o The introduction says a lot of things, many of them incorrect. :-) I've changed that. Right now, tapping the filename opens the file browser, tapping the (new) right-hand page label opens a "goto page" dialog, tapping the menu button opens the menu, and tapping the screen elsewhere goes one page back/forward. There is no shutdown menu entry.
<br/>
<br/>
o The buttons will stay as they are; I'm not planning on configurable buttons. Holding R while pressing next/previous goes 10 pages forward/back.
<br/>
<br/>
o Fonts are changeable.
<br/>
<br/>
o Progress bar is a bit bigger.
<br/>
<br/>
o Bookmarks will stay limited to three.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

Configurable buttons is pretty easy to do, really. E.g. in your code where you check for KEY_R, check for NextKey or something like that instead. Read the value of NextKey from a file and default it to KEY_R. Voila.

    <h4>#127588 - Mr.Peanut - Thu May 03, 2007 1:17 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have not yet tested your book reader but I look forward to doing so and have been waiting for one for the DS for a year now. I still use my GBASP as a book reader because it is more portable and has the best book reader made for a gaming device ever.  The other reason I still prefer my old GBASP to read books is that the display is less sharp; I can not stand reading text where I can see each individual pixel.
<br/>
<br/>
You might want to check the GBA book reader out to see what features it offers. You can find the web site <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mqp.com/fun/" target="_blank">here</a>. (Just download his preformatted Sherlock Holmes book and try it on your ds.) It comes with a many featured PC text formatting program(that also fixes EOL issues). Its best feature is that it uses a simple markup that you can use to mark chapters, sections, etc, and link to them through a table of contents. The R button switches between book/chapter/page/line modes. The L button turns the menus on and off to give more room for text . It also displays jpegs and plays midis.
<br/>
<br/>
My wishlist for a bookreader does not include any sound features although jpg viewing is sometimes useful.
<br/>
<br/>
My wish list:
<br/>
1) Simple markup to allow marking chapters and inserting links into text.(This editing would be done on a PC not the DS)
<br/>
<br/>
2)Colors fully adjustable for font and background. 
<br/>
<br/>
3)Controls similar to the GBA book reader.
<br/>
<br/>
4)Flip view for book and non-book style reading. Not everyone likes holding the ds sideways. You also get more words per line holding the ds normally which makes for better reading IMO than just getting 4-5 words per line.
<br/>
<br/>
5)Users can install their own DS fonts.
<br/>
<br/>
6)At least 10 bookmarks per text.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow that is my two cents on what makes a good reader. I look forward to trying yours soon!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is IMHO one of the best homebrew apps out there for the DS and i'm looking forward for it growing bigger and better in the future.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll report suggestions and bugs as soon as i spot them to help out a little bit.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!
<br/>
<br/>
UPDATE:
<br/>
Alright, after i've tested the app a little bit I've found:
<br/>
<br/>
1)Tapping the file name doesn't open the file selection menu, it opens some sort of on screen keyboard.
<br/>
<br/>
2)Creating a directory called data/states/ doesn't do anything, the app doesn't resume your last opened file if you launch it again.
<br/>
<br/>
3)The menu button doesn't have a shutdown function for the DS 
<br/>
<br/>
4)Bookmarks aren't saved after shutting down the DS and reopening the App.
<br/>
<br/>
5)After loading a file, sometimes it refuses to load any other one after it and a msg comes up saying "can't load file."
<br/>
<br/>
6)The bookmarks do not appear on the progress line.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using a R4 slotcart and the nds file was patched with the dldi correctly (i can open txt files just fine). I'm guessing bug 2 and 4 has something to do with write access on the R4.
<br/>
<br/>
I've formatted the R4 fat16 (as recommended by a users on R4 forums)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also having these exact problems and I am also using an R4 with an R4 DLDI patched Readmore.nds file,
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried putting the states folders in various locations on my microSD card and have copied the BKMK &amp; pagin files that were generated by the program into the States folder with DSOrganise but to no avail,
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
It's killing me that this great program is just beyond my reach :-)

<br/>
<br/>
OK, thx all for the positive and great feedback! A new version will be out soon, probably next week, which will be much better than the alpha. And expect even more exciting news in the future!
<br/>
<br/>
That said, let me try to address your points. I like some suggestions, don't like others.
<br/>
<br/>
o there will be a page turning animation (can be disabled), but no sound. That'd get on my nerves real quick.
<br/>
<br/>
o The bkmk and pagin files are necessary, and I'd much rather put them with the files they belong to than collect them in a separate dir. I'll prefix them with a dot, so they don't show up in file browsers.
<br/>
<br/>
o The introduction says a lot of things, many of them incorrect. :-) I've changed that. Right now, tapping the filename opens the file browser, tapping the (new) right-hand page label opens a "goto page" dialog, tapping the menu button opens the menu, and tapping the screen elsewhere goes one page back/forward. There is no shutdown menu entry.
<br/>
<br/>
o The buttons will stay as they are; I'm not planning on configurable buttons. Holding R while pressing next/previous goes 10 pages forward/back.
<br/>
<br/>
o Fonts are changeable.
<br/>
<br/>
o Progress bar is a bit bigger.
<br/>
<br/>
o Bookmarks will stay limited to three.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
<br/>
I've been using the latest version for a while now, I have an R4 card. It all works fine, then after a little while, the file selection dialog automatically pops up (the one with the keyboard). Then you can click the close (little 'X' icon) and it dissapears, but after 10 - 20 seconds, it comes back, and you have to click on the close button a couple times.
<br/>
<br/>
Then it comes back again and again more frequently until in the end, it just appears on boot up and you can't close it down, and it freezes.
<br/>
<br/>
Deleting ALL the save and bookmark files does nothing, I actually have to delete the .nds file and replace it with the one on my harddrive before it works again...
<br/>
<br/>
This is really wierd! Anyone else get this problem?
<br/>
<br/>
Apart from that, it works beautifully, but i get about 35 pages into my book and this happens... then i can't read any more!
<br/>

just read the help file, it quite easy, everything is going automatic and powered by python u only need to install the runtime.

Well, there is a Python script (which runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux, at least) that will take a TTF font and convert it into a .bfont. This script and documentation should be included with the ReadMore distribution (can't check now, I'm on vacation), but it <span style="font-style: italic">definitely</span> is in the DSGUI distribution at <a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/downloads/dsgui/DSGUI-0.2.zip" target="_blank">http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/downloads/dsgui/DSGUI-0.2.zip</a>.

Further developments for ReadMore will come when I'm back in December.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">DSFTP homepage</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
read more is a very nice program with a very nice look.
<br/>
unfortunitly when i was trying to acces anything having to do with the touch screen it locked up on me *froze*
<br/>
you might want to take a look at this 
<br/>
as also when i went to patch it i notcied it was originaly compiled for an R4
<br/>
i do not know if that could have been the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Errors
<br/>
Freezing when trying to use touch screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Tried to switch page
<br/>
Tried to open menu|
<br/>
both times the same error arose.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
sorry i wrote it like this but i test games and normally write reviews about them in the same style.
<br/>
<br/>
but yeah thats all for GnM im going to get a new card soon.  and ill re download it when i get it but for now DSReader is the easiest to use on the GnM that ive found so ill just stick with that.<br/>_________________<br/>The wind blows, The moon howels, But atlas we must turn to the GOD BOX!

Now that there are positive indications that the next version will come soon, I'm taking a serious second look at this application. It works well on my R4DS but there are a few quirks with mine which I have not seen mentioned here:
<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody else see little dots under every i in the serif font? Does anybody else have incomplete words appearing at the end of lines?
<br/>
<br/>
This and DS Reader are the front runners for text readers for the DS IMO. Both have nice looking anti alias fonts and both handle good old plain text files with no modification (except maybe unwrapping hard wrapped text in the case of Read More). I really like the vertical book orientation, so I'm keeping my eye on this one as it develops. UTF capability could definitely tip the scales for international readers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yup, that's a font bug (actually one that is either in my ttf-&gt;bfont converter script or in the Python Imaging Library that the script uses). Haven't gotten around to that one yet.

Yes, known bug that is already fixed for the new version.

I apologize again for the delay.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi all!
<br/>
<br/>
just letting you guys know, i'm running <b style="color:#FFA34F">readmore</b> on an <span style="font-weight: bold">r4</span> and an <span style="font-weight: bold">m3</span> and i've found the following things the hard way (but i figured how to get it to run perfectly):
<br/>
<br/>
- <b style="color:#FFA34F">readmore</b> is <span style="font-weight: bold">very</span> sensitive to touch screens. I had a screen protecter on the bottom screen and it was <span style="font-weight: bold">constantly</span> triggering the <span style="font-style: italic">'keyboard screen and file name'</span> screen. I thought it was a bug in the software, but after i removed the screen protecter, it never happened again. Ran perfectly.
<br/>
<br/>
- your directory structure for the data folders should be like this or you might get errors (assuming your flash drive is f:):
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
f:\data\fonts
<br/>
f:\data\states</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
the executable (<b style="color:#FFA34F">readmore</b>.nds) can go anywhere it seems.
<br/>
<br/>
- under the <span style="font-weight: bold">fonts</span> directory, there must ONLY be the *.bfont files, NOTHING else (no readmes, nothing). If there are any other files in this directory, bookmarking and save states won't work. There must be nothing under the <span style="font-weight: bold">states</span> directory as well.
<br/>
<br/>
- i use wordpad to convert my files to the most basic .txt type, these read without corruptions.
<br/>
<br/>
- so far, storing the txt files anywhere seems to work. i put them in the \data\ folder to keep them out of the way, no probs so far.
<br/>
<br/>
if you still can't get it to work, here's a fully patched version, ready to unzip to your root directory.

there was a chinese ebook reader (dolphin reader) which is very similar to <b style="color:#FFA34F">readmore</b>, only it sucks ass because you need to compile the nds with the book embedded, it had no dldi file system accessing. but the nice thing was you could set the colour of the background and text, and reading books was a *lot* easier on the eyes when it was night-time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The problem is that the ASCII character used for some quotation marks is not supported by <b style="color:#FFA34F">Readmore</b>. They tend to be the left and right versions of the " mark. Instead, open the .txt, do a 'find and replace all' on them with the standard " (from your keyboard) and they should work after.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

   Try making your .txt files filenames only 5 characters in length. (ie. Lord of the Rings.txt --&gt; lotr.txt) and put them in the root.  It worked for me...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have an odd, reoccurring bug in ReadMore...
<br/>
The first character on a line of text is sometimes missing.  This occurs most frequently on a new page, but has happened a few times in on a mid-sentence line break.  It doesn't happen every time, but about every 4-5 page-turns or so.  Certainly not a show-stopper.
<br/>
<br/>
I have checked the original text file and it is fine.  No odd characters or anything.  I am using a CycloDS with firmware 1.41 final.
<br/>
<br/>
I sure hope development of this fantastic app continues.  This is hands-down the best thing to ever come to the DS in my opinion!  People look at me funny when I tell them I am reading books on my DS - what a concept! 
<br/>
<br/>
Wish list for the next version:
<br/>
1) The new version releases soon! (at least least development continues)
<br/>
2) Inverted screen display (especially for night-reading)
<br/>
3) Brightness control from within ReadMore
<br/>
4) Sleep mode (rather than have to reboot and rerun the app)
<br/>
5) Fix to little bug mentioned above

In one of my onw dev's I hand imported an extended bmp font, meaning I could probably add a sembalance of unicode support if I was up to the challenge (however my toolkit doesn't seem to like wchar_t (it reports the code as something way out of bounds), so then again, maybe not).
<br/>

Perhaps if I was 'really' deticated (I'm really not) I could make it respect the formating in rtf documents. Mind you only because its problematic when in some books, italic text is used as a type of thought speech.

i love using readmore. it needs more tweaking. but all in all its wonderful. but i dont know why when i upgraded my EDGE to its latest patch my readmore is stuck in the opening screen.

<br/>
because of tht. i was forced to look into other ebook reader. i have installed ds reader. it works okey. but i doesnt feel right. i like the feel of holding my ds as if its like a book.

I tried Dslibris. but i cant seem to make it work. you have to do some patch i think. but all the site ive been through doesnt seem to explain it properly.

<br/>
i think dslibris is the one closest to read more. if the you tube ive seen of it is true.

i hope some one could help me out on how to install dslibris in my ds with edge adapter. since readmore, seems to be dead and nobody is willing to pick up the pieces.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
