Nutki has released a new update:
<br/>
Lameboy DS 0.8
<br/>
June 12th, 2007
<br/>
<br/>
To celebrate Lameboy Devlog grand opening here comes new release featuring initial sound emulation. You cannot turn it off yet, but it always possible to turn it down by hardware volume control. Also you can forget about X button annoyance, just return to rom menu for autosave.
<br/>
<br/>

B/W games work nearly perfect, in GBC games I noticed some performance trouble that results in minor music glitches or a slower framerate. I tried Zelda - Oracle of seasons, that I own but never played through because my GBC's speaker broke. And I'm very spoiled by my DS's backlight now. So I give it a new shot now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I spent a good amount of time yesterday playing Oracle of Ages, and it works almost perfectly. There's slowdown in places with lots of enemies, some of the boss battles, and in the underwater parts with the wave effect, but it's tolerable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

my requested features for future versions:

* select color shades for monochrome GB games like on real GBC/GBA/SGB
<br/>
* correct detection and timing of RTC based games (currently Pokemon Gold, Silver and Crystal; make it possible to use the RTC of the DS to set Date/Time in games correctly; currently they speed up (example: currently Monday 11:45 PM, in next second it is Tuesday 6:23 AM))
<br/>
* a little bit better sound
<br/>
* correct upscaling when using Zoom feature<br/>_________________<br/>Equipment:

I had previously mentioned this idea for Goomba Color, thinking that the color information was stored in each game and could therefore be read by the emulator, but as it turns out, such coloring information is stored directly on the GBC BIOS, with each game having its own entry.  As no one has dumped the GBC BIOS as far as I am aware, there would be no easy way to do this other than making our own database of coloring info for each individual game.
<br/>
<br/>
As the standard Super Gameboy palettes are fixed, those could be implemented in theory.  The updated Goomba Color WIP build currently does only the first SGB palette, and I don't think this includes games with special SGB palettes, but I could be wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
Dwedit was the one who answered my question in the first place, so he would know more about this than I.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, the scaling is definitely better.  Here's a mirror for v0.9 from Dev-Scene (you don't need to log in):

The full screen filtering is WAY better than 0.8, and emulation is very good, except the only game I've had problems with is Pokemon Pinball, it lags for some reason...Pokemon Pinball was a rumble cartridge for GBC, it had a built in rumble motor, any possibility rumble (using DS rumble pack) could be emulated?  Probably not, since it's only one or two games that use it, but it'd be nice.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

<br/>
I have some odd Problems:
<br/>
<br/>
- Sound is very slow, sounds metallic, and sometimes the music even sounds wrong (the acchords and so on, i know it as i play instruments and have a good ear)
<br/>
- Harvest Moon2: after 2 days of playing lameboy broken down. i restarted the ds, yet the game doesnt load the savegame anymore, which, according to a filebrowser, still exists?
<br/>
-Still a bit laggy, but mostly playable! Excellent work.

The sound issues are probably due to the fact that it's emulating the sound in software, unlike Goomba Color that simply passed all audio commands to the GBC sound chip for hardware emulation (which can't be done with Lameboy since the GBC sound chip is only available in GBA mode).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
