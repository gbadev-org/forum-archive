There's no Focus round yet, but that's planned.
<br/>
I've not added all the pickups in.
<br/>
I've yet to add additional niceness, too.  Like... The titlescreen's really really basic!

<br/>
[edit]
<br/>
Glitchy... managed to get the ball (square?) bouncing almost horizontally, and it ended up going off the bottom of the screen.. went on to finish the level with bouncing centipede segments, and I think the ball looped round vertically on the bottom screen, appearing at the top (still bouncing almost horizontally).. Next level started, ball still bouncing side to side near the top of the screen..  as soon as I hit a button to launch, BAM, game over. :)
<br/>
<br/>
So basically, the ball wasn't reset when the level ended. And it kept looping around after going off the bottom of the screen, because I didn't die.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Tweaked.

The Dpad/Buttons/Trigger combo control thing's in, and I think (!) that I solved the hovering ball issue..  Although, that seemed to be oddly random, so it might just be that my 10 mins of testing hasn't yet made it appear again!!   But, I think it's gone!

OK. Both things are fixed! Thanks. It is a good game it seems.

Doesn't absolutely every ds product (cart case, case, screen protectors, stickers etc.) come with a hand full of stylus's? I must have 10 spare at least. You could always use a blunt pencil or sharpened stick or whatever.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

My brother lost his also, but he has a orange stylus that came from a sudoku game, and he uses it on Nintendo DS now. It doesn't fall out of the hole as easily, but it doesn't go all the way in either.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have some suggestion for make Centipong game better:<ul>
<br/>
<li>Allow UP or X also to launch the ball (as well as allowing START), so if you use the stylus you can launch the ball with your left hand.
<br/>
</li><li>Start 3 lives instead of just 1 life, but that's all, you can never get any extra lives.
<br/>
</li><li>Make the pallet size revert to normal at the beginning of each level. (This way you won't get extra large pallets in each level too much!)
<br/>
</li><li>Make some more ways of scoring:<ul>
<br/>
<li>If the ball hits the pallet: -1 points (or +5 if fast-forwarding, or +0 if it says "YOU HAVE TO DROP THE PODS") (and if your score is already zero, it won't make it negative) (This will make it so that if you are not very accurate then you will lose more points)
<br/>
</li><li>Collecting fast-forward icon: +50 points (and double all points earned if everything is fast)
<br/>
</li><li>Collecting extra ball icon: +10 points per ball on the screen (including the one just created)
<br/>
</li><li>Collecting large pallet icon: +5 points (or +20 if it is already maximum)
<br/>
</li><li>Collecting small pallet icon: +5 points (or +20 if it is already minimum)
<br/>
</li><li>Scores for pods hitting pallet should be doubled if it says "YOU HAVE TO DROP THE PODS"
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"UP or X also to launch the ball"
<br/>
Already does..
<br/>
<br/>
"Start 3 lives instead of just 1 life"
<br/>
You're already getting an extra ball at the start of a round, if you'd already lost it.. So, there's really no need for extra lives..
<br/>
<br/>
"Make the pallet size revert to normal at the beginning"
<br/>
It only seems "Easy with a big paddle" because there's nothing to dodge yet!  If you play the PC version, and make it to level 4, you'll notice that some of the pods are red flashing death pods!!    Hit one of those, and your little paddle takes a beating.  Hit it 4 times, your paddle explodes, game over..
<br/>
So, once those are in, the longer paddle's become less useful, and it's more of a challenge to get a paddle at just the right size.
<br/>
<br/>
Scoring
<br/>
1 hit of a Pod = 5 points, then 10, then 25, and last 50..  If you get to the "Drop the Pods" part, keep 'em all bouncing and you can collect plenty more points..
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't scored the pickups yet..  Mostly because I've a few more of them to add, first!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not keen on having negative scores for the balls, since if you've a load of balls flying around, it could get really annoying having to then additionally avoid the things!  They're just balls, and should stay that way.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://AGameAWeek.com" target="_blank">A Game A Week.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

  Will the spider make an appearance? The accompaning sound effect was one of the Centipede hallmarks (I recognised it in the title music right away).I really like the sound effect of the segments breaking up and slapping around, BTW.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Finally got around to playing on hardware.. fun. Having lots of segments flying around the screen is pleasing.
<br/>
<br/>
Love the way the ball flies back and hovers over the paddle at the end of a level.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd kind of like a gap between the screens, so the ball doesn't appear on a screen immediately after leaving the other.. might not be nice with the centipedes though - if they manage to make it off the top screen they'd be invisible for awhile..
