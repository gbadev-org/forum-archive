    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I never played it, so I don't know if there's good stuff in there, but Microsoft released the source to MechCommander 2 if anybody is interested. It looks like it includes all the art assets if anybody was working on a mech game or RTS.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What the hell has this got to do with the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
Erm?
<br/>
<br/>
Nothing?
<br/>
<br/>
Porting MC2 to the DS is not an option...
<br/>
<br/>
Also, given that the assets are designed for a PC game running on PC 3D HW they're probably not appropriate for use on the DS anyway...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The screenshot I looked at seemed low polygon enough to have useful DS art in it, but like I said I've certainly never played it.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your valuable feedback though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Microsoft <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">Released</span></span>
<br/>
...<span style="font-style: italic">SOURCE CODE</span>?!
<br/>
<br/>
Two surprises at once -- you almost gave me a heart attack!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much; this looks pretty nice to learn off of. It's not that old, either :)
<br/>
It is always good to see how the professionals make these games, and it's not often that I get to look at RTSs. This will be quite handy, since I'm working on a TBS (no, not DS; sorry if I let anyone's hopes up for half a second) at this very moment!<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just so you all know, the source and assets for this were released about 2 years ago, so this is not new news...
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I have played MC2 (Still have a copy lying about somewhere) and I can most assuredly tell you that it would never ever be able to run on the DS...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI
