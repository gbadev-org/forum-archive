    <h4>#114502 - TheYak - Mon Jan 08, 2007 2:16 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DragonMinded has posted a new version.  This time around there's only one binary.  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dragonminded.com/?loc=ndsdev/DSOrganize" target="_blank">Linkage</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Up to Version 2.5.  2.45-2.5 changelist:
<br/>
<br/>
Fixes found in 2.5
<br/>
<br/>
    * Worked on making DSOrganize take up less memory on its own for more plugin memory.
<br/>
    * Switched to more dynamic approach for plugins. Things should work better now.
<br/>
    * Changed home screen to display current and next two day planner events instead of past ones.
<br/>
    * Changed plugin vblank handling to give dedicated vblank access to plugins/exes when run.
<br/>

    * Changed arm7 upsampling code to sound better for amplified mp3's.
<br/>
    * Changed calculator memory usage to allow for larger numbers.
<br/>
    * Added in newest ogg vorbis memory leak fix.
<br/>
    * Added echo, cls, wait commands to homebrew database script.
<br/>
    * Added ability to swap buffers on only the top or bottom screen in plugins.
<br/>
    * Added ability for plugins to query which screen DSO is on (for those that hook to the draw function).
<br/>
    * Added simple battery saver function and debug write to disc function to plugin API.
<br/>
    * Added repeat to all keys in the keyboard and fixed a glitch where char 255 couldn't be typed.
<br/>
    * Added .dss shortcut type. Shortcuts can point to any file or directory except for another shortcut.
<br/>
    * Added access to the PSG on the arm9 for plugins.
<br/>
    * Added the missing commands for dswifi to the plugin API.
<br/>
    * Fixed erasor glitch in scribble.
<br/>
    * Fixed weird wrapping glitches introduced after the text fix.
<br/>
    * Fixed glitch in syntax highlighting for html files introduced after text fix.
<br/>
    * Fixed glitch where if resource0.bin is missing, DSO does not jump to your preferred start page.
<br/>
    * Fixed error with ID3 tags containing a carriage return/line feed.
<br/>
    * Fixed crash on loading iconsets from directories longer than 29 characters.
<br/>
    * Fixed two irc crash bugs relating to bad server replies (ie on irc.enterthegame.com).
<br/>
    * Removed mikmod loaders for all types but xm, it, s3m, mod due to low popularity.
<br/>
<br/>
*NOTE: Since the plugin architecture has been updated, please download the latest version of your favorite plugins to continue using them.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yay, streaming oggs! I've wanted that, too.
<br/>
There are actually so many additions here I have yet to try all of them :)
<br/>
<br/>
It seems that streaming has really been improved. Buffers now go way above 100%, so for example I have a stream which the last version couldn't play for more than 2 minutes which can now run forever with a buffer of 150%.
<br/>
m3u is good... I'll have to find all the streams I turned from m3u to dpg and put them back, but it shall be nice :)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm really liking the welcome screen. I think DSO could use some more stylish artwork, but that doesn't really matter and I still like the program just the same...<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">spastik, thank you for the warning.  It reminded me to backup my miniSD card before trying this new version.  However, I was able to get it to work fine on my 1.63b SC miniSD without any patching.  I followed darkgilson's suggestion and deleted the old DSOrganize folder before adding the new one, and although it takes a few seconds longer to boot, it works fine.  I'm loving ogg streaming, as the only radio station I really even listen to (ormgas, streams OCRemix tracks) only outputs an ogg radio stream.  Now it even goes up to 150% buffer on the highest quality stream, which is awesome.  Shame the microphone code couldn't be improved though.
<br/>
<br/>
And on a completely unrelated note, I just now realized that Ormgas can be rearranged into a completely different word...
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, it's great that he came back to release this new version, especially considering all the additions and changes he made.  Glad to see he hasn't quit the community for good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hallelujia, or however you spell that! If this AAC streaming really works I'm going to head out to the car dealership, wish I could afford to buy DM a new car, and instead just donate something I <span style="font-style: italic">can</span> afford when I get the chance. I probably should have done that ages ago, really.
<br/>
<br/>
Heh, I about did a double-take when I saw this thread. "DSOrganize 2.4, hah bump... wait, isn't the latest 2.3... omg!"
<br/>
<br/>
I can think of only two more features I wish DSO had now: hex calculator and IRC logging. That's all I'd even consider asking for, and I'd feel rude asking even that without giving something big back because this program just owns. DragonMinded, do you have any need for a 1GB SD card?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I love how everything is polished up nice and professional (IE works great and easy to use) but isn't mechanical and boring (IE comments in the help file like "that'd just be stupid"). :-p
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I'm crazy but even the L button seems to be working much better; it's been unresponsive lately. O_o
<br/>
<br/>
I did find one minor bug though. There appears to be descriptions for the text fields (IRC username, default homebrew path etc) in the options, but they're immediately covered by the keyboard.
<br/>
<br/>
One last note, I notice Japanese usernames still show up wrong. But hey, who cares? I know who I am. ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
[edit] AAC streaming works great but the music is still playing slightly faster than it can keep up, resulting in the buffer slowly dwindling away... lasts at least 2 minutes though, which is nice considering the hardware (and beats the heck out of MP3 streaming). Though it doesn't show the song name? A bit odd... I like to write down the names of nice songs so I can look for the discs later. Well, I suppose I'll write down the times they played instead and have my computer log the name of each song from the website when I'm away. :-p
<br/>
<br/>
[edit 2] Streaming works even better with a closer server. Buffer is at 212% and rising! Yay! Finally I can listen to my favourite online station at work. (That is, if their connection is fast enough... heh) It started throwing errors after the buffer ran out (error attempting to connect), so maybe the first server just pooped out, or I got knocked out and someone else took the last spot; it only supports a few people listening at a time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once again freaking great work.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[whee more editing] I think the ARM7 just crashed while streaming. It continued to repeat the last second or so of sound even when I closed the player, opened the file browser, and played an MP3. (The progress bar moved as normal but the sound didn't change.) The buffer was slowly draining, re-opening the playlist file got stuck at "associating", and the touch screen didn't respond, which all point to ARM7 not responding.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I mean, most people look and get attracted to the whole homebrew scene due to something like DSO. It has so much features and alot more "noob/windows-user" friendly stuff. I'd rather use it it then Linux in most cases of "OS" usage ... copy/move/rename etc

When you're used to Linux, I'd bet it's faster, but DSo offers so much more. I really can't comprehend why DS Weather (orso) gets a sticky while the most known homebrew doesn't.

I'd look into writing an app that grabs the updated plugin over wifi, writes it to disk, and starts DSO automatically. Then have your plugin reset (via libcartreset) to this program when done.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone else have trouble using the libcartreset function of some programs in DSO? I mentioned this in the DSLiveWeather "Vesper" topic, but thought I'd mention it here too. For reference, I'm using an old SCSD with firmware v1.70 as my signature states.
<br/>
<br/>
In DSO 1.45 (patched with Chishm's SCSD patch) both DSLiveWeather "Vesper" and LoveLite 1.4 will launch and then freeze using the "DSOrganize" launching method. Using "Mighty Max's" launching method, both will launch and work, but pressing the reset buttons will cause the DS to freeze. So far, it just seems to be DSO that has the problem with them as I can launch from the SuperCard menu and MoonShell (both old v1.41 and new v1.6 DLDI versions) without incident. Someone mentioned that MoonShell used gba_nds_fat instead of libfat, so I don't know if that makes a difference. I also tried using the SCSD_MOON DLDI patch with DSO, but that only seemed to make it unstable and didn't improve anything.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, you probably have a cheap/incompatible card. DS apps don't seem fond of the cheaper brands.
<br/>
<br/>
Also when the sound gets "stuck like a CD", that's likely the ARM7 crashing. You'll notice the sound continues after closing the program (even if opening another sound file, which simply won't do anything), the touch screen won't respond, and wifi will never initialize (and if you're streaming, the buffer will slowly drop to zero). This happens occasionally to me; was it happening especially often for you? If so, it could indicate some connection between filesystem errors and the crashes, though I'm almost always streaming when I play music in DSO so I suspect this may not be the case.
<br/>
On the other hand, if touch/wifi/etc is still working, then it's probably just having trouble reading the file. The sound skips like a broken CD because it's the same problem as a broken CD - the CPU can't read the next piece of sound data, so it keeps repeating the last piece it played.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The whole "sound stuck" thing happened while playing the only song that worked back then.After that, Dsorganize didn't initialize for a while, and after a few retries then it worked.

Maybe you mean daninski but just in case, do you mean launch an app from DSOrganize with the Y button? Pressing Y over a ds.gba file in DSO doesn't appear to do much of anything. Or did you mean launching DSO from my G6 with Y? That just puts the G6 in GBA mode, from which DSO obviously can not run.

<br/>
I've tried both the 0.15 and 0.16 G6 DLDI patches.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, it's very unstable for me when streaming on a GBAMP. It's weird because the problems are different every time. Sometimes it won't buffer fast enough, sometimes the ARM7 will crash, sometimes it'll just disconnect. In any case it results in having to power off and on again pretty much every 4 minutes at best. :-( If I had the time I'd take a look at the code myself and see if I could figure out why, but I doubt I'd get anywhere. Writing my own code is one thing, debugging someone else's is another story entirely.
<br/>
<br/>
It seems to play MP3s OK (haven't tried streaming one), the problem seems to lie in wifi. Often it just won't connect at all, or will disconnect during play; when this happens, sometimes just reopening the file gets it to connect, but usually I have to hard reboot. I can always access the homebrew database just fine though.
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if it's some sort of power problem, as it seems to get worse the more I use it, and the batteries die fairly quick too (the speakers are quite hard on them). Could be something silly like not being able to power both the wifi and sound system reliably with a low battery.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

(This was the only wifi function at the time.) Today when I tried to play an online radio station, it went through Associating, Connecting, then completely froze up. IRC would do the same. I then tried the homebrew database... froze at Getting MOTD just like the old versions! This was unusual as the database has always worked in the latest versions, so I tried to connect with Mario Kart DS: "Connected to hotspot but unable to connect to server." (I didn't catch the error ID though.)

Apparently something was buggered up; the access point was on, but there was no Internet connection.

There is a way to create a .pkg file on your DS that downloads from any web location.  Check on my forums.  With this, you may be able to download DSFTP from a local server, then run it and grab the files.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

I'm assuming you installed DLDIrc which adds the right-click menu option.  To patch files that don't end in .nds, you'll need to use a different method of patching.  Either use the command-line patcher or use the Windows GUI for it.  To use the command-line program, put dlditool.exe and exec_stub.bin and r4tf.dldi in the same folder.

Nice job khan, although if Dragonminded is going to change the GUI I believe he could improve some other little tidbits, gaining both space and legibility.
<br/>
I have rather extensive study of the DSO UI for a project I proposed to DM, and although I know he doesn't want to make drastic changes, there are several small improvements that can be done to the UI, streamlining and facilitating interaction. 
<br/>
Ex: Putting buttons glued to bottom, maybe even a quick action list instead of using shoulder buttons to chnage action. _This confuses users because they can't see all actions at once and are never sure exactly what actions there are. The same mechanic applies to seetings wich are rather cumbersome to navigate because you either use L/R wich skips files one by one, or select last field with stylus and then skip to next with L. There are several of these inconsistencies where interaction varies a good deal.
<br/>
If Dragonminded would consider changing graphics, I was hoping he would consider improving some UI elements aswell, and we could perhaps work together. I really don't care much about how it looks graphically as long as it is well thought and consistent, both graphically as well as interactively!
<br/>
<br/>
... Hmm.. Sorry Dragonminded if I am talking about you in the third person but this is mostly directed to you naturally! I'd really like to catch you in a quick IM or Skype chat, so I could easily illustrate some points so you'd consider them. It really isn't the same talking withouth feedback :P.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
