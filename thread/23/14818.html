The gist of the project was to see how platformers (such as MetalSlug) would do if they were played sideways on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I also want to say thanks to everyone who helped me here at this forum, especially tepples and wintermute because they know everything.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXAtOYcAcbs" target="_blank">Plasticshell demo</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looks nice. Good job. Seems to work properly, and I especially like the blood splatters. ;p
<br/>
I'm not sure if I would really like playing such games sideways like that with larger levels though. Like this it's fine to just dodge bullets and shoot back, but if it would actually scroll?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://amplituds.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">AmplituDS website</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Don't hold your breath for a release because there's still a lot of things to polish up and I've been tied up with other projects.  There are some sprite performance issues and I haven't gotten a handle on the audio stuff yet.  Also I should probably replace the Metal Slug graphics if there was going to be a release.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXAtOYcAcbs" target="_blank">Plasticshell demo</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
