    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">AmplituDS v3 reached the 10,000 downloads milestone on my site!
<br/>
When I first started creating the game, I never imagined this could ever happen.
<br/>
To celebrate, I present to you, AmplituDS v3.1. The release of a private build I've been working on a small bit which has a couple of (minor) improvements.
<br/>
<br/>
For those who are not yet familiar with AmplituDS; it's a homebrew game created in the style of Amplitude for the PS2. Amplitude is a rhythm game created by the same team which started the Guitar Hero franchise and now Rock Band. Lots of fun to play. A couple of youtube movies to show off AmplituDS: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6DBHRxbFAs" target="_blank">SMB Remix on brutal</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok9Nv1HCh98" target="_blank">Lady Lucifer on insane</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Improvements since v3</span>:
<br/>
<ul><li>Approximately twice as fast start up time. 
<br/>
</li><li>Anti-aliasing used for 3D graphics. 
<br/>
</li><li>The targets are not missing sections anymore. 
<br/>
</li><li>The 'amplituds' folder does not need to be placed in the root of your media card anymore, it is searched for. Meaning you can have it as a subfolder of a "data" folder on your card for example. 
<br/>
</li><li>Max-Media Dock users should not have to set their clock to 00:00 anymore (untested). 
<br/>
</li><li>You can create and insert your own stage now! &lt;blatant lie, as this feature has always been there, but I wanted to get it to people's attention. :p&gt;</li></ul>
<br/>
A tutorial for the creation and insertion of your own stage has been created by DevilSpawn and can be found <a class="postlink" href="http://amplituds.drunkencoders.com/?s=forum&amp;loc=http://z11.invisionfree.com/amplituds/index.php?showtopic=202&amp;st=0" target="_blank">here</a>.

<br/>
For the faster start up time, for example, I have made all the 2D graphics compressed using LZSS compression... so they're not the same as their old .bin counterparts.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://amplituds.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">AmplituDS website</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
