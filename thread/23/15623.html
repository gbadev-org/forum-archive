Try using your ICQ number and password on an AIM program. It works for me in Pidgin for Windows XP and Puppy Linux.

Yeah... you may be right, but:
<br/>
<br/>
a) the Aim Client for DS wasn't THAT stable last time I used it
<br/>
b) it wasn't specifically made for ICQ, therefore it lacks many basic features like adding a not known contact and viewing profiles
<br/>
c) what if Aim decides to part ICQ/Aim servers ? Wouldn't I be screwed then ?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.petitiononline.com/blizzds/petition.html" target="_blank">Starcraft DS ?</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
