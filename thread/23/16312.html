    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Mankind's oldest enemy, the decimal numbers 1 to 5 have launched another audacious attack and it's up to you to stop them. They have one weakness - they self destruct when they are combined to make the number ten. Select numbers with the stylus and make tens to save the world.
<br/>
<br/>
As you will gather after playing this game, it is the result of a couple of hours coding. It is also an 'homage' to a game I recently saw some video footage from. :) 
<br/>
<br/>
- Numbers have to be on the same horizontal line and add up to 10.
<br/>
- All hope is lost when the numbers break through the top of the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
To do:
<br/>
<br/>
- Scoring.
<br/>
- Sounds.
<br/>
- Difficulty levels / objectives.
<br/>
- Power ups.
<br/>
- Make pretty.
<br/>
- Fix bugs.
<br/>
<br/>
Tested on an R4 and No$GBA.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Very nice game, it is very addictive. :P
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a suggestion: Give feedback to the user when they touch the blocks with the stylus. A red box is already shown after you drag the stylus and lift it up, so just show that red box while the user is dragging the stylus on blocks. Because the instructions weren't very clear, I didn't think the stylus did anything in the game for the first couple minutes because nothing was happening when I was touching the blocks with the stylus.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://viewsourcecode.org/" target="_blank">viewsourcecode</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This should now highlight the numbers as you select them with the stylus so it should be clearer to see what is happening.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus I've added an exciting in-game screen-shot:

What's new
<br/>
-------------
<br/>
<br/>
- Added some new graphics.
<br/>
- Pressing 'up' in game advances the numbers by a line.
<br/>
- Fixed situation where tiles could get 'stuck' after a drop.
<br/>
<br/>
Any feedback appreciated - e.g. ideas for power ups or special tiles to help in your fight against the numbers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#165836 - Kojote - Fri Jan 09, 2009 12:27 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">* well you could add "hidden numbers". sort of empty fields which flash their value once in a while... this might be an idea for "higher" stages to make the gameplay more difficult and keeping ppl still at the game
<br/>
* or you could add a "bomb" which destroys some of the fields around, to make new combinations possible etc...
<br/>
* "-" deducts -1 to all numbers which are vertical and horizontal. if value is 1 and would go to 0, the "1" could explode without giving scoring.
<br/>
* "+" adds +1 to all values vertical and horiziontal. if value goes above 5, the number could explode without giving scoring.
<br/>
* value randomizer
<br/>
* skull fields, which can't be chosen and limit the possibilities (for higher stages)
<br/>
<br/>
game ends when top is reached, difficulty should increase each minute by adding new fields, such as the ones suggested above
<br/>
<br/>
i'd have lots of ideas ;) and probably i should redraw some of the gfx for you ;)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Kojote</span>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, looking very nice!  The ability to select a skill level would be awesome. Maybe give the ability to set it "low" enough so that it goes slower, and makes sure there are some 10's to add up.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
