<br/>
<br/>
It's been a long time since I've done anything related to the DS, but now I'm back to 'brewing!
<br/>
<br/>
Here's my current project: a <a class="postlink" href="http://fincs.drunkencoders.com/2011/06/26/homebrew-sseq-player/" target="_blank">homebrew player</a> for Nintendo's official music sequence format: SSEQ. It's still a very incomplete proof of concept, but it already plays Pok?mon music pretty well :)
<br/>
<br/>
Any help and advice from sound people is very much appreciated.
<br/>

I've tried, countless times, to convert MIDIs to tracked formats and I always got the same mess as an output. I've even tried alternate programs (MID2XM) and they still didn't get it right. <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuplet" target="_blank">Tuplets</a>? Wrong rhythm. Non-standard time signatures (even 3/4)? Messed up pattern divisions.
<br/>
It's not really these programs' fault, it's just that tracked music formats aren't designed to cope with all those things (instead you have to do ugly things such as changing the tick value (wtf) or change the pattern size). Similarly enough, module to MIDI conversion is also messy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yet countless musicians have created some really impressive compositions with the protracker spawned formats and, better yet, they mostly sound like they're supposed to on the final target. Sadly MIDI never really achieved that on low power/resource devices.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not convinced by the programmer vs musician viewpoint tbh, many of the musicians I worked with in the games industry loved protracker and it's kin.  The ones who didn't tended to be rather awkward to work with - especially when they started complaining about how their compositions didn't sound right on a GBA :/ (hold on a sec while I phone Nintendo and see if they're up for adding $20K worth of studio quality audio electronics to their handhelds :p )
<br/>
<br/>
Most MIDI to MOD converters I've seen end up with huge mods which kind of defeats the object of the exercise.
<br/>
<br/>
What are the chances of being able to provide support for something more MIDI like within Maxmod? Ultimately there's going to be a lot more traction for something that's built in to the default arm7 core we supply, especially if there are composition tools that musicians like (hint, hint)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

I don't know about that, but finally the only difference between a sample based replay driven by a tracker format or one driven by a MIDI is that in the former you control the polyphony directly (each track is one voice) while in the latter you don't do that. But MaxMod, if I remember correctly, anyway had a kind of 'assign the first free voice when needed' system, which might be suitable for MIDI replay too... (but MaxMod internal tracked format unfortunately hasn't been done for MIDI, and that would require an additional format with different scheme...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The Midi-based system I'm using takes up 2404 bytes of memory (no mixing buffers, no reverb, no mixing code. 1344 bytes are for the 24 software channels so sequence only = 1060 bytes), so provided that it uses the MaxMod interface, it should fit fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No. I don't plan on adding support for parsing the SDAT archive format, let alone NDS files; just SSEQ, SBNK and SWAR. However, you can extract those files from the commercial NDS game and feed them to the player.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The way to avoid all of these problems in tracker music is to have all of your songs in a single mod. Each subsong starts in a new block, so choosing the subsong is just a question of starting at the correct block number. It's a shame that, compared with what I used to have available on the Amiga, Maxmod is so limited. No way to start at a specific block, no way to get the currently playing samples/notes, no way to get the current block number...
<br/>
<br/>
Having written music with SoundTracker, OctaMED (MIDI and MOD), Skale Tracker, Renoise, Garageband and Logic, I don't think that writing either MIDI or MOD is easier than the other. Historically, MIDI sucked for videogame music because none of the machines had built-in soundbanks. The average MOD was 100K; MIDI soundbanks were a few MB. When your disks only contain 880K of data and mixing MIDI polyphony in software takes all of your CPU time, there's no way you'd consider using MIDI.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by ant512 on Tue Jul 05, 2011 8:35 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

It really depends on what software you use. Personally, I use Noteworthy Composer - you can literally type in the notes on a stave and they follow a sequential order rather than having overlapping notes all over the place as with most other composition software.

<br/>
The solution to that is to only include what's needed for your Midi file and load dynamically from ROM/FS (the game I'm working on right now has banks that are ~256kB when in ADPCM mode).

As for mixing in software, yeah, it's not exactly pretty, but I liked the idea of a challenge (my old Midi players used the hardware channels). Besides, I can't think of any other way of supporting filter-based reverberation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Each subsong starts in a new block, so choosing the subsong is just a question of starting at the correct block number. It's a shame that, compared with what I used to have available on the Amiga, Maxmod is so limited. No way to start at a specific block, no way to get the currently playing samples/notes, no way to get the current block number...</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I tend to agree, but anyway patterns are quite scarce and if you need to put a lot of songs in your game you wouldn't fit all that in a single module... for instance in <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner in the Lost Levels</a> there are 36 separate XMs, to save space each one is gzipped (I mean in the single-file version, which is 3.5MB)... on the other hand in <a class="postlink" href="http://disjointedstudio.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Waimanu DS</a> instead we've been using only 9 XMs, one of them keeps all the short 'jingles' of the game, many of them keep 2 songs in a single file. Both of these games uses <a class="postlink" href="http://wcms.teleion.it/users/cgq/nds/libxm7/" target="_blank">libXM7</a> anyway (...shameless promotion ;) ) which supports starting a MOD/XM from the block you prefer. <span style="font-size: 7px; line-height: normal">(and you can even access the replay data while it's playing...)</span>
<br/>

edit: I guess anyway it should be possible also for MaxMod to start a module from a different point, put up a feature request and wait :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
