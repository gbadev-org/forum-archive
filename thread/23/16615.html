    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
<br/>
Can i run homebrew on DSi with full support of features, with WiFi?
<br/>
<br/>
This review <a class="postlink" href="http://www.iso420.org/dsi/acekard_2i/" target="_blank">http://www.iso420.org/dsi/acekard_2i/</a> tells : 
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">** = It seems Wifi in Homebrew Applications is broken - none will init the Wifi connection.
<br/>
<br/>
As you can see most homebrew worked just fine with two exceptions that crashed. However, there is a major problem present with the Wifi library as no homebrew that uses the DSi's Wifi connection can load the settings. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
But people cant confirm or reject it.
<br/>
<br/>
Can somebody with DSi and kart help with testing?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can confirm that the WiFi features of the test applications that come with dekkitPro do work on a DSi when using the EzFlash Vi card.
<br/>
<br/>
Even the old wifi test lib from 2007 works fine...
<br/>
<br/>
I've a feeling that this is an issue with the acekard 2i and not the DSi itself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the ak2i works fine with wifi. use the akaio firmware and make sure your router is set for wep. the ak2i runs in ds mode and can only use wep encryption as with a normal nds. also the broadcasting of the ssid needs to be on, this is required of homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
i've started an irc chan where i idle with the akaio devs. /server irc2.gbatemp.net:5190 /join #acekard. you can always ask them if you don't want to take my word for it.
