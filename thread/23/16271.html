    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello there,
<br/>
<br/>
StarquakeDS is a DS version of the classic Spectrum game by Stephen Crow (and other machines!)
<br/>
<br/>
You can download it on the following link:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.retroremakes.com/wordpress/the-retro-remakes-competition-2008-entries/" target="_blank">http://www.retroremakes.com/wordpress/the-retro-remakes-competition-2008-entries/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
You need to go to page 2 of the entries and scroll down a bit...
<br/>
<br/>
It's really my first DS project - hope you enjoy it.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tested it on an R4 card, but hopefully it should work with others.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice. I haven't played the original, but I love games like this.. exploring massive cavernous environments filled with alien flora, fauna and tech. :)  Works fine on my M3DS Real.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Fantastic game. Made me relive my misspent youth. :)
<br/>
Plays just like the original, sans the colour clash of ye olde Spectrum. The updated graphics are superb and in keeping with the original design.
<br/>
Will you be ported/updating any more Steve Crow games?
<br/>
Wizard's Lair would be awesome.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the great work and thanks for bringing a classic game to the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've got a few ideas for my next project - most of them Spectrum remakes to be honest. Was thinking maybe Batman (isometric) or 3d Ant Attack...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Blimey..any of those two would be ace.
<br/>
<br/>
I remember playing ant attack, it was revolutionary at the time with its 3D graphics. Took me a while to get used to the numerous keys to control your chap/girl. I think a DS remake would be awesome. Especially if you can add a map to the bottom screen ala StarquakeDS, I get lost very easily in these huge games.
<br/>
<br/>
As for batman, well any ritman/drummond game would be cool. I guess if you do batman, then head over heals/monster max could utilize the same game engine. heh, I'm getting ahead of myself now :)
<br/>
<br/>
I still play Spectrum games on my DS using Patrik's ZXDS emulator. Good gameplay never dies.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
