  Ok, so I've been sitting on a one-level game demo I developed (with the help of a very talented programmer, Tim Sorrels) in 2005, and I figured since the DSi was about to delete which did away with the GBA slot, I better go ahead and release it to the homebrew public while the format is still fairly relevant. ;)  Admittedly there are a few bugs and the difficulty is substantial for this level and the gameplay could use some work, so forgive me- this was my first attempt at game development!  But hey, I'm proud of the end result ;)

<span style="font-weight: bold">Numchuck and the Conquest of Color</span> is a platformer with a dynamic color palette.  You play a magical, colorful forest creature, Numchuck, who awakens one day to find his entire world has been drained of color by the cold-hearted creatures of the north.  Numchuck is tasked with color-changing his enemies by painting them with one swipe of his magical paintbrush tail, and eventually restoring color to his land.  With each enemy you paint, and each fruit you collect, color is gradually restored do the monochrome world.
<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay is as follows:
<br/>
A to jump
<br/>
B to paint swipe
<br/>
Hold B to run, jump while running to spin attack
<br/>
Holding B while in midair to bounce off the top of an enemy and paint them.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you will enjoy this and share it if you like it!  I'd love to hear what you think.  A copyright for the game is held by my company Steelehouse Productions ( <a class="postlink" href="http://www.steelehouse.com" target="_blank">www.steelehouse.com</a> ).  While I'm at it, I should stick in a plug for my weekly webcomic Boodachitaville at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.boodachitaville.com" target="_blank">www.boodachitaville.com</a> ;)

Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks guys :)  I'd love to put more time into it and had always thought about adapting for DS, but the truth is, I would need a really good excuse to do so, because all the freetime I had spent working on this demo has nowadays been reallocated and is no longer there :)  It was a blast making the demo though- I learned a lot.  I'm still proud of the whole dynamically changing BG palette- but truth is, while I did a bunch of the initial programming, most of my work was in the art/animation/music, and it was my buddy Tim that really brought the whole thing together in the end.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
