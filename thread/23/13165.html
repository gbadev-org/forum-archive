<br/>
<br/>
DSiP is a Softphone for the Nintendo DS (Voice-over-IP software). It's based on the standardised SIP protocol which is most commonly used in open VoIP networks.
<br/>
<br/>
You need a SIP account, which is generally offered by your ISP, in order to use the softphone. With it the softphone can be used to call friends on any type of line, such as a landline, over WiFi.
<br/>
<br/>
This softphone was written from scratch. It's designed as a lightweight softphone, and is fast enough to run on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  _ n o t e s _______________________________________________________________
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The softphone is currently in beta stage. The first stable build will be released publically in June.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd be grateful for any donations, as a lot of effort was put into this softphone.
<br/>
You can donate over PayPal to my PayPal account: jsr(_)star(@)hotmail(.)com  
<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to wait for the stable build before donating, it's all up to you. Thanks a lot!

What codecs will you include?

Will it include STUN?

I did a lot of reading about SIP, RTP, RTCP, codecs etc. I would love to beta test this.

I would recommend SIP provider voipuser.org to everyone. Free calls from SIP to landlines!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDSh" target="_blank">Nintendo DS homebrew on Wikipedia</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm currently beta tesing _JSR_ voip homebrew and well it's quite impressve.

For what I tested, the homebrew phoned me (to my real phone, in my house) and when I answered I could listend to my voice on the DS. The other part (talking on the ds and listening on the phone didn't worked for me :/
<br/>
<br/>
Well just to tell everyone that this homebrew is true and will be something really great.

" c. Unauthorized Usage

<br/>
 Customer may not program the Number into any equipment or 
<br/>
 infrastructure in or on which the number is intended or used as the 
<br/>
 origination or destination of a communication other than the Device 
<br/>
 that was provided by Vonage." 
<br/>
<br/>
However Vonage does sell an addon service called Vonage Softphone: for an extra $10/mo you get assigned a second DID with 500 outgoing minutes, and you get the SIP credentials as well as a copy of XTen's X-Pro softphone. To get this you must also be a normal Vonage subscriber, with at least one line going through the ATA. This will work with Asterisk, but it is more expensive. 
<br/>
<br/>
By far the most elegant way to connect an Asterisk server to Vonage is through a Vonage Business Plus account. The Vonage Business Plus program is designed to allow business customers to connect SIP gateways and IP PBX directly to the Vonage network. Plans range from 4 DIDs with 5K minutes for $149/mo. to 24 DIDs with 50K minutes for $999/mo. Incoming calls are free and DIDs can support multiple channels. As with all Vonage accounts, calls within the Vonage network are free.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"><br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.scenenews.info/dsip/" target="_blank">DSiP - VoIP for Nintendo DS Blog</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hi _JSR_,
<br/>
<br/>
cool work, I just tested it with my NDS Lite and my regular (paid) VoIP
<br/>
Provider (sip-gmx.net, should be same as 1und1 or 1and1),
<br/>
and I successfully called a number,
<br/>
that means the last line was "Calling", but no talking with each other,
<br/>
but I think this is not yet implemented?

Can't wait to see this finished :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
I was coding today a tool on Nintendo DS that act as a file sender from Computer to Nintendo using TCP. It was not working correctly and i was really pissed because i didn't find why. I tried a stupid thing, add a sleep time on pc side to lower the sending speed.
<br/>
And then everything was working good. No packet dropped, no half packet, no hangs... So i think that the same problem occurs with DSiP on Nintendo DS. So I would like to know if some Nintendo DS programmer had this issue and what was their solution.
<br/>
By the way, maybe it's 100% the fault of the Wifi Access Point but most people have problems with the DS version so i think it's almost general. (My AP : Linksys WRT54GS).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot :) and Cya !

Hey _JSR_,

Would this tool possibly replace buggy DSFTP...?
