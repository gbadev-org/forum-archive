    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You cannot rename stuffit files (.SIT) into disk images, they need to be extracted within Mini vMac on to your hard disk image.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the fun part, stuffit expander comes in a stuffit archive...
<br/>
Macintosh users will have no problem extracting this and installing it onto their hd image.
<br/>
<br/>
Windows users must look for a self extracting version of stuffit (.SEA extension) and uploaded as a binhex archive (.HQX).
<br/>
<br/>
Once you find this you can install it by copying the file to your mac hd image with HFV Explorer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was wondering if you think it's possible to emulate a LAN network, using the wireless capabilities of the DS? I converted Bolo, and got to thinking it would be awesome to link up with someone else via Ad-Hoc or Infrastructure. Do you think it's even possible?<br/>_________________<br/>Games n Music Homebrew:

That would be awesome. Besides Bolo, there would be tons of doors opened if this was emulated. 
<br/>
Now I'm wondering to what extent it would go. I don't know how limited the DS is so I don't know what it could do. But just thinking about it is cool.<br/>_________________<br/>Games n Music Homebrew:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey love to hear about the new version but one question,
<br/>
what about the screen scaling? In a previous blog post you had the scaled-to-fit-screen view on the bottom and the regular view on the top. What ever happened to that</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#149309 - Lazy1 - Fri Jan 18, 2008 4:56 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, I'm not seeing anything like what you are describing.
<br/>
What I might do is add more view modes in the next version, that should make everybody happy.
<br/>
<br/>
Another problem with the scaled mode was that it's slow and knocks off 10FPS since it's done in software.
<br/>
I have seen a few examples on scaling the screen using hardware but it always created a weird crawling pattern on the desktop.
<br/>
<br/>
If someone could figure out how to fix that it would definitely be included in the future, free scaling would be very nice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<div class="post">
    <h4>#149326 - tepples - Fri Jan 18, 2008 2:01 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's possible to scale a 512x384 screen down to 256x192 in hardware, but because the DS hardware uses point sampling, the background pattern will get screwed up. But using a combination of techniques seen in nesDS (flicker scaling and alpha-blending two slightly offset layers), it should be possible to fix this. I haven't tried it yet, but here's one way to do it:
<br/>
<ul><li>Mode 5 on main </li><li>Point BG2 and BG3 at the same 512x512 pixel bitmap </li><li>Alpha blend the layers </li><li>Shrink in both directions by a factor of 2 (pa = pd = 0x0200, pb = pc = 0) </li><li>On even frames, set BG2 origin to (0x0000, 0x0000) and BG3 origin to (0x0100, 0x0100)
<br/>
On odd frames, set BG2 origin to (0x0000, 0x0100) and BG3 origin to (0x0100, 0x0000) </li></ul>
<br/>
Should I make a quick demo outlining a couple procedures for doing this?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Another thing I wondered about while I was messing around with this stuff was if blending acted different in 8BPP mode vs 16BPP.
<br/>
<br/>
8BPP Is ideal since I just generate a 1BPP-&gt;8BPP conversion table at runtime which doesn't take up too much space and would be a lot faster than drawing each bit manually on every video update.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
