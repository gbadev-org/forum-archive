<br/>
 I've relocated (physically) and have therefore taken a break from the project.
<br/>
 I've recently found time to get back to my work, and re-invent it in the process to better conform to the limitations of the DS port.
<br/>
 I've also found a number of bugs that were a fault of the FreeDOOM iWAD, but have since been in touch with the author and other DOOM developers to hopefully quicken it's process so that I may in turn work out some of the bugs within my project.
<br/>
<br/>
 Anyhow, enjoy the screen shots. I should have a video or two up before long.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
