A little suggestion: provide a GAMMA control or just increase saturation (?!?)
<br/>
<br/>
See the linux port, much more vivid colors: <a href="http://opentyrian.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/opentyrian_torm.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I've seen them from the DS (opera ds), so it's not the quality of the screen, just they are actually more vivid.
<br/>
<br/>
A question: which is the difference between detail levels?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Cimi on Mon Mar 24, 2008 1:41 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice, I was wondering how that OpenTyrian thing was coming along.
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be possible to move the complete GUI to the lower screen and leave the upper screen for just the playing field? As it is now, there are scaling problems which make the sprites look not so good, and the fonts extremely difficult to read. Since the playing field without the GUI is awfully close in size to the DS 256x192 resolution, it would be a great improvement.
<br/>
<br/>
On a tangent, I'll never understand why the DS doesn't have two 320x200 screens. Seems like a no-brainer design decision, considering all the direct DOS ports it could've had without the need for additional graphics hackery.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm still undecided about networking.  I may work on adding that later; for now I'm concentrating on more important issues.
<br/>
<br/>
The detail levels adjust how much of the fancy graphical effects are rendered.  The easiest way to explain it is to just fiddle with the setting while playing a complicated level (some examples:  Tyrian from Ep1, Gyges from Ep2, Lava Run from Ep4).

That's nice to hear. I can also confirm the problem with loading that Markzilla mentioned, a Guru Meditation error happens when I try to load a saved game. Anyway, here's a quick mockup to illustrate what I meant when I mentioned moving the GUI to the other screen. This way, only 8 pixels would be lost from each axis without any scaling of the playing area.

Yeah, I hadn't noticed it before, but now that you mention it, I see what you're talking about.  The game has a gamma control built-in, but there's currently no easy way to change the value.  I'll try bumping up the default a bit and see if that improves the colors; otherwise I guess I'll have to add a UI (probably similar to the volume controls).

I've implemented something very similar to this for the actual gameplay.  For the upgrade ship menus and so forth, I'm thinking of just leaving it unscaled and letting you scroll left or right (if necessary).  I'm also putting in an option to keep everything scaled, as it currently is, in case anyone prefers that.

I'm attempting to track down and fix the Guru Meditation errors as best I can.  I personally am not having issues with loading or saving, however.  For you guys that are experiencing crashes, what homebrew devices are you using?  Also, it would help if you could send me your TYRIAN.SAV file (assuming it always crashes when you try to load)--my email address is on my website.<br/>_________________<br/>#include &lt;sig.h&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've got a question though: why is it that when the ship moves from one side of the screen to another, its shadow changes sides?
<br/>
Also when someone shoots at me if I move, the invisible plane that the bullets that they fire is on is different to the plane that the original bad guy was on. So if I move, the bullets don't move the same way as the bad guy moves.

<br/>
The shadow moves more than the ship because the lightsource is in the middle of the playing field and pretty far down (close to the ship, so not a sun/star), and since it doesn't move at all in the y-axis it has to either be far up or moving along with you, and since it can't be far up (due to the x-axis movement) it has to be static in the x-axis, moving with you in the y-axis (although a bit further along the path) and i guess the distance between you and the light source in the z-axis seems to be about 5 times the distance between you and the ground.
<br/>
And since the shadow is quite a bit larger than the ship (they are drawn as the same size but since the shadow is further away it's larger) that means the light source has to be smaller than the ship.
<br/>
When the camera moves the bullets seems to move slightly more than the enemies, that means they are higher up, which is logical because they are drawn above the ships.

- Can't assign B to anything, it cancels input.

- I've accidentally exited the game 3 times, I think because B on the in-game screen will prompt to exit to title. The prompt is a bit quirky, hence actually exiting.

I have an idea for a control configuration for use with the touch screen steering where you could standard fire with L, fire left weapon with dpad left, right weapon with dpad right, and right and left weapons with dpad up. Just a thought.  Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Indeed; there's also a similar issue with L and R, unless you're using the scaled video mode).  This is a simple fix.

This should be mostly doable already.  The only catch is dpad-up:  Tyrian does not let you fire both sidekicks with a single key (however it does let you do so with a single mouse or joystick button; go figure).  I'll consider adding this capability however, as it is a useful feature (the other alternative is to enable the "Joystick", but then I have to make sure a single button press doesn't register as both a joystick button and a keyboard key, or else weird things will happen).

Now that I seem to have covered all the major issues, I can spend some time on interface improvements.  The mockup looks good, maybe I'll shoot for something like that and see what I come up with.

The crash happens toward the end of the level, after the announcer says "Large enemy approaching" but before the boss shows up, and it happens every time.

<br/>
Great work, though. Really impressive, especially for version 0.2. I never played Tyrian back in the day, but it reminds me a lot of Raptor.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, the loading seems to work now, which is great, and the playing field looks much better without the scaling. I'm pretty sure you can get rid of the quit option from the main menu, since it doesn't do much on the DS except make you exit the game by accident.

If you need someone to cobble together a workable UI that's resolution-appropriate, let me know. I'm not sure what format the UI elements are supposed to be, all I have are Danc's publicly released sprite rips. With a reworked background and repositioning of the active elements (menus, text, weapon/ship graphics etc), the shop screen, as well as the map and everything outside the main game should be able to fit on the DS screen with no scrolling.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This has become one of my favorite homebrew apps. It let's me play a classic game I missed out on and plays quite well. In fact, the only problem I've had is a crash with a Guru Meditation Error when I try to quit the game. I'm not sure whether it tries to shut down, restart, or something else, but it seems to crash each time I select it. I'm using a CycloDS Evolution if that makes a difference.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
Okay, maybe not the only problem. Has anyone else had an issue with the music skipping or not looping properly? I'm not entirely sure how to describe it, just that it sounds a bit off. I did save over my old files with the newer versions from v0.3.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'm not sure how the original game was, but does anyone notice what looks like layering issues where some objects appear behind or in front of other objects that seem out of place? I've seen a few stages where objects that seem like they'd be in the background appear in front of enemies or your own ship. I don't know if that was normal or not. It just seems like there are some cases where it looks out of place and obscures gameplay. I'm just wondering if that's normal.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL
