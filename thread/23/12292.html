    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
I've spent some hours developing a little and useful (at least for me, and I hope for someone else too :) ) tool to apply a DLDI patch on homebrew roms. It is for Windows (XP/2k/NT), is different from the patchers already available because uses Chishm's dlditool to patch via right clicking the rom. No GUI, no command prompt. Two clicks, that's all. :)
<br/>
<br/>
If you use more than one flashcard, you can install more than one DLDI driver, and you'll have every single choice available in the context menu.
<br/>
<br/>
It can be downloaded from <a class="postlink" href="http://psychowood.altervista.org/getDLDIrc.html" target="_blank">here</a> (it is a direct download link, I'm just using that link to count the clicks :) ), if someone wants to try it and give me an opinion... well, I'm here. :)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by psychowood on Wed Oct 17, 2007 2:28 pm; edited 23 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It doesn't work for me, using Windows XP.

According to the log file that is created when it is installed or uninstalled, it appears that all it does is extract the files to the location I specify and create shortcuts.  Shouldn't it be writing to the registry or something, to modify the right-click menu of .ds.gba and .nds files?  Or do registry edits not appear in this log?

Hi dantheman, thanks for taking some time trying DLDIrc. :)
<br/>

It should work out-of-the-box, no reboot required.

<br/>
Exactly, the setup simply copies files in the destination directory and creates (tries to..) some shorcuts and registry keys. Specifically: 
<br/>
-HKLM\Software\DLDIrc to store the install path
<br/>
-HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\DLDIrc to add the uninstall option in the Add/Remove Software Control Panel page
<br/>
-HKCR\.nds\shell\DLDI.....\Command (one key for every selected DLDI driver), which is the heart of the tool and is the context menu item
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that comes up in my mind is the fact that I forgot about testing it in a non-administrator environment, and it is possible that writing a registry key in HKLM and in HKCR requires a high privileged user: did you install it using a standard user or a poweruser/administrator?

What DLDI driver did you tried? I've already tested them all (even installing all together) and the only issue I noticed is that if you install both the M3 SD drivers, only one of them shows up in the context menu (but it isn't really a issue, I'd say).
<br/>
<br/>
Can you try making a whole new key, something like
<br/>
<br/>
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.nds\shell\MYKEY\command\
<br/>
<br/>
with nothing in it, and seeing if it shows up when you right-click a .nds file?
<br/>
And, could you export and send me the subkeys of the .nds class, too (in regedit, right click on ".nds" in HKCR, and then select "export", it will save a .reg text file)? You can find my email address at the end of the readme.txt file.

I did get your email, but I am a little slow in answering I suppose. I was looking at ways that you could get the latest dlditool when installing, which isn't easy using SourceForge. Perhaps just grab the one included with DKA r20.

Sorry, I'm almost sure that the problem lies in your PC :(
<br/>
I added the key without a problem and it shows up correctly.. I really don't know what could be the problem, because if even the one you created isn't visible.... :|

Do you have some kind of strange system extension installed?

Well, after only two or three days you aren't on the slow side yet :) I asked just because I did not got the return receipt (not that I expected it, after all you didn't know my address) and recently I've been "antispammed" more than once. :)
<br/>
Actually I've put in the package the one you have in your site, v1.21, together with every working driver available, for now I'll manually update when needed, if I come up with a decent idea (I was thinking about a DLDI repositloty with pre-patched roms..)

Now that I added "nds_auto_file" back in, it runs by default in No$GBA again, but I now have an option in the "Open With..." menu for "Windows Command Processor" which patches with your script.

I haven't tested it much, but it appears to work.  The best part is that you can easily update the DLDI patches or the dlditool since they're standalone files in the installation directory.

    <h4>#116942 - HyperHacker - Wed Jan 31, 2007 4:55 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">FYI, Windows looks at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT like so:
<br/>
<br/>
-Check for the file extension (.nds). Read its default value.
<br/>
-Check for a key with this name. If it exists, use that key. Otherwise, continue using this key.
<br/>
-The default value is the file type description.
<br/>
<br/>
So for example if you have .nds in your HKCR, and its default value is "ndsfile", then Windows will look for HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ndsfile. If that exists, then it's used for all .nds file information, and its default value specifies the file type description. Otherwise, the .nds key is used and the description is "ndsfile".<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Real life example:  the WinDS distro only comes in .nds format, and the Supercard Magic Homebrew Patcher doesn't recognize it as a valid DS binary.  Loading the .nds file from the Supercard menu doesn't work, though loading from Moonshell does.  I haven't tried manually appending the loader though, so perhaps I should try that...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

SuperCard in SLOT-2 expects DS programs to be in PassMe format (ds.gba) but expects their names to end in .nds.

Could you make sure you change the icon back to the default when uninstalling the program?  I ticked the box by accident (didn't want your icon, sorry), and even after uninstalling DLDIrc and telling Windows to always open .nds files with No$GBA, your icon persisted.  I had to use regedit to find the default icon key and delete it before my No$GBA icon showed up again.

Just a minor gripe, so no worries.

Regarding the icon thing, I'll investigate further into it, because when you uninstall DLDIrc it actually also removes the icon file, so if it still stays, probably depends on the icon cache Windows has..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I didn't know what FCSR was till I found <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=125419#125419" target="_blank">this post of yours</a>. I was considering to integrate the whole FS image creating batch for FCSR, but I need some more accurate infos ("a couple of random files"... how many KB? It's a size problem or a file number problem?). Isn't there an official page/thread for FCSR?

I don't think it's a problem of your machine, it's just the way Windows behaves (perhaps some reboots are needed to clear the cache, who knows). How did you fix it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I tried to automate the process with a batch file, but I think it got hung up on the build.bat part.  Of course, just now I remembered that you have to use the CALL command to call a batch file from within another batch file, so now that I use that, it works fine.  I used the following batch script, which would obviously have to be modified to work with any given filename:
<br/>
<br/>
call build.bat image.img fcsr
<br/>
copy /Y /B ndsmall.bin + SNEmulDSv0.4-final.nds SNEmulDS.ds.gba
<br/>
padbin 512 SNEmulDS.ds.gba
<br/>
copy /Y /B SNEmulDS.ds.gba + image.img final.nds
<br/>
dlditool.exe fcsr.dldi final.nds
<br/>
<br/>
I think my confusion about the "random files" was cleared up in another post, where someone said that the image needs to be 1 MB in size before it will work correctly.  ...and now that I test that theory, I find that it works fine now all of a sudden.  Man, dunno what the problem was before.  At first I thought that it required at least one file in the "root" of the virtual filesystem, but it works fine now without one, and at the moment I've got an image here that's 700 KB and still works fine.  Alright, you can ignore that whole thing about needing a few random files, as I'm really not sure what the truth is anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and to "fix" the icon thing, I went into the registry and went into the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, and there was some icon entry under "nds_auto_file" that I deleted.  I then again told windows to open all .nds files with no$GBA always, which restore the no$GBA icon to them.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  well, here's a modified batch script that <span style="font-style: italic">might</span> be helpful, but it requires that you put the .nds file in a subfolder called "ndsfile" (done so that only the .nds file you want to use is used):
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">for %%F in (ndsfile\*.nds) do call build.bat image.img fcsr &amp;&amp; copy /Y /b ndsmall.bin + "%%F" "%%~nF.ds.gba"  &amp;&amp; for %%F in (*.ds.gba) do padbin 512 "%%F" &amp;&amp; copy /Y /b "%%F" + image.img final.nds &amp;&amp; dlditool.exe fcsr.dldi final.nds</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Not the best code ever, but it functions at least.  Only works if only one .nds file is being used though, as it relies on a single image.img file being written.  I'm trying to make it so that each *.nds file creates its own *.img and *-final.nds files, but I can't get it to work correctly at the moment.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 2:  alright, got it working, but for some reason it patches each output file about 8 times, and I'm not sure why.  Here's the code:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">for %%F in (ndsfile\*.nds) do call build.bat "%%~nF.img" fcsr &amp;&amp; copy /Y /b ndsmall.bin + "%%F" "%%~nF.ds.gba" &amp;&amp; for %%F in (*.ds.gba) do padbin 512 "%%F" &amp;&amp; for %%F in (*.img) do copy /Y /b "%%~nF.ds.gba" + "%%F" "%%~nF-final.nds" &amp;&amp; for %%F in (*-final.nds) do dlditool.exe fcsr.dldi "%%F"</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ehr, actually there was a bug in that part of the uninstaller, I've just found it  :|

Now the icon section of the registry is cleared correctly, BUT it seems that the Windows cache keeps the icon anyway, at least as long as you reboot (I haven't rebooted yet).

-Corrected a bug which sometimes prevented the correct removal

the next update, of course)
<br/>
-Added FCSR FS image creation:
<br/>
Please remember that for this to work correctly, you must create 
<br/>
a folder with the same name (without extension) as your .nds/.ds.gba 
<br/>
file to act as the root of your virtual filesystem. For instance, 
<br/>
if you have 'game.nds' that requires 'wordlist.dat' to be on the 
<br/>
root of your media card, create a folder called 'game' (if you have 
<br/>
'game.ds.gba' the folder name must be 'game.ds') and add 'wordlist.dat' 
<br/>
to it. If this folder does not exist, unpredictable results may occur.

replace:

I'd prefer not to go out of scope with DLDIrc, I mean, if I should start noticing users about firmware updates and similar things, the app would bloat too much (R4 too has auto-patching now, and I'm sure that other cards will have it too). Perhaps I'm wrong, but I think that a flashcard user should at least keep its firmware updated ;)

Okay, here are the details:

1. The installation directory is the default "C:\Program Files\DLDIrc"
<br/>
2. In the installation, I checked all installation check boxes <span style="font-style: italic">except</span> for "Associate with .bin files" and installed the DLDI drivers for the Max Media Dock, GBA Movie Player (CF), Supercard SD, and Supercard SD Moon (I own all three carts, but primarily use the SCSD and my GBAMP is on loan along with my only CF card).
<br/>
3. The location of the nesDS.nds file is "C:\Documents and Settings\TODD.ENCO\My Documents\Games\NDS\nesDS", but I have also tried patching it directly on the root of the SD card, which is mounted as the H: drive. Both get the same results.
<br/>
4. I have tried both the regular Supercard SD driver and the Moon driver, both get the same results.

That is strange. Okay, here is exactly what I do and what happens:
<br/>
1. I right click on the nesDS.nds file located in "C:\Documents and Settings\TODD.ENCO\My Documents\Games\NDS\nesDS" and select the "DLDIrc SuperCard (SD Card) Patch".
<br/>
2. The command prompt opens and closes too quickly for me to see what it says.
<br/>
3. I copy the file to the root of my SD card and run the Windows dialog to disconnect it from the computer.
<br/>
4. I insert the card into the Supercard and power it on.
<br/>
5. I launch nesDS from the Supercard menu (or DSOrganize or Moonshell) and it prompts me with the error that the DLDI driver is missing.
<br/>
<br/>
As I stated before, if I do steps 1 and 2 with bob_fossil's DLDI Win32 GUI app, it patches successfully and displays the results within the program.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, there was something that I just noticed that interested me. Even though I chose the install option it to put information into the Path, I did not see anything when I just checked it. So I uninstalled and reinstalled DLDIrc and now it shows up in the Path Environment Variable. Although the Command Prompt window still opens and closes too quickly. I'm running Windows 2000 on this PC, could this have anything to do with it?<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

Win2k could be the problem. 
<br/>
<br/>
Two are the things that came up in my mind:
<br/>
-NSIS (the installation script) doesn't correctly work with the Win2k registry (this could explain also why you had some problems adding dldirc to the path)
<br/>
-AFAIK the Win2k batch syntax should be the same of WinXP but there could be something different. I haven't tried it directly but you are the 1st one reporting this issue (and with more than 5000 downloads I suppose that you aren't the only Win2k DLDIrc user ;) )
<br/>
<br/>
Try this to read the patching output:
<br/>
-Open a command prompt (run "cmd")
<br/>
-Inside the prompt, run (with quotes)

So that succeeded. But I just tried patching it from the right-click menu again (even after it's been added to Path), and it still doesn't seem to patch it. I've checked by then patching it again with the DLDI Win32 GUI and it says that no DLDI driver was previously patched.
<br/>
<br/>
And so far, I've only noticed that nesDS does it. However, I'm now wondering whether it's patching anything else. DSOrganize has SC support from the start and Moonshell has several versions pre-patched from the installer. DSLiveWeather reads fine, but won't save (although I'm hearing that saving is problematic now anyway?). DScent runs and loads and saves data, but crashes after a while (not sure if it's related, but I would think it wouldn't run at all). Those are the main programs I've been running, but nesDS is the first to flat out refuse to run. It makes me wonder just how many have generic card support built-in (which would probably include the SCSD as it has been around for so long)?
<br/>
<br/>
It looks like I need to try this out some more on my XP machine at home. I've been using my 2000 machine at work without problems for a while. This is the first I've seen it give me trouble. Thanks for looking into this. I wonder if anyone else has had any issues?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
And I just checked DSAIM 0.03e and it doesn't seem to patch with DLDIrc, either. And my DSOrganize 2.7 Final, even though I patched it with DLDIrc and it works, turns out that it wasn't patched and was probably using its native SCSD support. I even tried changing DSLiveWeather's (ver 2007/06/27) with the GBAMP DLDI driver through DLDIrc and when I ran the Win32 GUI app, it still said it was patched for SCSD. So it looks like DLDIrc v0.73 isn't working at all on this computer. Oddly enough, I do recall an older version working fine. Back then, when you right clicked on a file, it just said "DLDI SuperCard (SD Card)" instead of "DLDI<span style="font-weight: bold">rc</span> SuperCard (SD Card)". At least, I seem to remember it working correctly.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since you get the "press any key" thing, probably the problem lies in the registry itself: with regedit, give a look in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ndsfile\shell to see if there are all the correct DLDIrc calls. It is also possible that Win2k handles those calls differently than WinXP, and then they do not work even if they're there...
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, the "Add to path" option isn't related to the context menu, it just gives you the ability to run, in a command prompt, "dldirc <span style="font-style: italic">driver</span> <span style="font-style: italic">romfile</span>" without having to specify the full path of DLDIrc and of the driver (without that option, you'd have to run <span style="font-weight: bold">"C:\program files\dldirc\dldirc" "C:\program files\dldirc\drivers\driver" romfile</span>). Moreover if you run "dldirc" without arguments, you get a complete list of the available drivers.

This is <span style="font-weight: bold">very</span> strange! If you run the patching command twice, do you get "Old driver:          No DLDI driver" or "Old driver:          SuperCard (SD Card)"?

The Win32 GUI tells me that my nesDS rom has the right driver inside, after DLDIrc patching...

Which are exactly the same results of DLDIrc :(

<br/>
Sorry if I bother you, but to be sure I'm not misunderstanding anything I need you to do more annoying tests :| because I really can't keep up with what is happening :(
<br/>
<br/>
If you check the driver of nesds.nds with the Win32 GUI after you patched it via dlditool, what does the GUI say?
<br/>
<br/>
If, when you get a "Patched succesfully" message, the file isn't really patched, the problem isn't DLDIrc related.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm sure that when the command prompt opens and closes too quickly, the file is <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> patched, so don't expect it to work on your SC (and on any other card either). It is probably not fully compatible with Win2k (old versions had a different integration method, but I can't use it anymore because it was too much limited), and now I need to check if I can "repair" it in some way or if I have to drop Win2k support :(
<br/>
<br/>
Next weekend if I have enough time I'll install Win2k again :)

Yes, the enabler/disabler simply changes the DLDI header in the ROM so that it is no longer (at least as long as you don't change it again) seen as a DLDI app.

If you buy a Games n' Music adapter for SLOT-1 and use it without inserting a microSD card, then it will act as a NoPass. If you buy an Action Replay DS accessory and hold Select while you turn on the DS power, it will also act as a NoPass. A lot of SLOT-1 accessories have this feature in some form.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I still haven't found much reason to FlashMe the Lite, aside from the inconvenience of needing a NoPass for my SCSD. I did FlashMe my original DS, which a friend has been borrowing indefinitely with my old GBAMP, so it's worked out for him. It's just not something I think I necessary anymore. So unless some kind of homebrew WMB method absolutely takes off and requires me to FlashMe it, I'll just stick with a NoPass solution.
<br/>
<br/>
Although I am in the market for a Slot-1 card to replace my SCSD (which has been acting up lately and sticks out too much for my tastes). So I've been looking at the R4/M3DSS and CycloDS Evo the most and a little bit at the EZ-Flash V. I bought a EZ 3-in-1 pack (even bought a R4, but was refunded due to it being out of stock too long), so I'm definitely getting a Slot-1 card to make use of it. The question is which one to get? I'm almost decided on the CycloDS Evo, but the unreleased DLDI driver is holding me back (even if it does do autopatching). I'll probably still get it when the new batch is available (the casing has been slightly retooled to fit better and it's available in black and white).
<br/>
<br/>
As for the others, they all seem to have flaws I don't like. The GnM is slow and of cheap construction. I have little interest in the Action Replay DS and would probably use NitroHax instead. The SCDS1 is picky about what cards it works with and I've been weary about SC products as of late. Even the EZ-V has the need for extra patching to get any apps to work. I'm not sure if any others are worth looking at.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
assuming that this is the official thread for DLDIrc, I have a usability suggestion:
<br/>
<br/>
Rename the registry keys, maybe to
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ndsfile\shell\toggle
<br/>
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ndsfile\shell\multipatch
<br/>
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ndsfile\shell\patch</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Then assign the names for the items as the default value for these keys instead of using them as key names.
<br/>
<br/>
That has two advantages: key names are more flexible (as they don't differ for which driver is used). As long as only one driver is used, for patching always HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ndsfile\shell\patch\command will be read. For multiple drivers you might use something like HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ndsfile\shell\patch2 and so on.
<br/>
<br/>
But the main advantage is that it will allow you to select a default option (which will occur on double click): After I've updated to 0.9 from... 0.3 or so xD, I wanted to patch my NDS file, double-clicked - and what did it? turn DLDI off. I wasn't quite amused :)
<br/>
<br/>
So you can just assign "patch" as the default value for HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ndsfile\shell, and it will be used on double-click. I tried to use the key name the installer created there, but it didn't work; obviously no spaces are allowed.
<br/>
<br/>
Er. I don't think you got too much of what I posted, so let pix do the talking :&gt; :

I understood what you meant ;) and it is a good suggestion, but that would require a major rewrite of DLDIrc, so I think I'll postpone it. By now I have reordered the menu voices though, now Multipatch and Lock/Unlock are after the DLDI patches, do you think this could be a workaround?

Sure, if that works. I think Windows sorts the items alphabetically, and the first one is usually the default (which will apply on double click) if not defined differently.

Yep, that's why the patches are named "DLDIrc......." and the other two options now are "Multi DLDI Patch" and "Lock/Unlock DLDI", because D comes first than L and M ;)
<br/>
The only "bad" thing is that if you use more than one driver, they will be always sortered alphabetically, so the default one will still be the one that comes first.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll work on it, but actually giving the user the option to order the menu itself (or simply the option to choose a default driver) will be rather tough to do.

Download it <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cyclopsds.com/downloads/CycloEvoDLDI_v1.1.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. There have been quite a few changes from the last file released, most notably:
<br/>
<br/>
    * Now contains full SD init code. This means it will work with both standard and SDHC MicroSD cards, and it should work with homebrew executed via WMB (untested) or other alternative loading methods, allowing you to completely bypass loading through the CycloDS Evolution GUI if you wish. We've personally tested the driver by loading homebrew from slot2 CycloDS, which works fine.
<br/>
    * Various workarounds are included to enable support for the various ways in which 3rd party loaders use the DLDI driver. Its been tested to work with DSOrganise (Chishm loading method only), DSChannels and Chishm's standalone loader.
<br/>
<br/>
This is the same DLDI driver which is included in the new v1.2 BETA #3 firmware. Unless you're not using CycloDS Evolution to actually load your homebrew (which would be the case if you're executing code via WMB) then you dont actually need to manually patch anything, even in the case of 3rd party loaders.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I've tested it with Chishm's NDS_loader, DSOrganize 2.9, and DSChannels Beta 5. NDS_loader and DSO launch and run without issue, but apps launched from DSChannels can't read from the memory card unless they are manually DLDI patched. Considering that DSO seems to permanently patch what it launches, all that needs to be done is launch them from DSO once and they'll work. I'd say this is a pretty substantial update!<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL
