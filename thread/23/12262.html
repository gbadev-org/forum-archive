    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been working on a plugin for DSOrganize for the last while, just a simple text reader basically.  It will read in a file and create an index for it to get around faster.
<br/>
<br/>
It's pretty messy right now, lots of optimizing I need to do as well as just cleaning up the code.  It's probably the closest to finishing a DS project I've been so far :), so with that in mind don't be too surprised if you're underwhelmed, heh.

I divided each book of the Bible into one folder.  With the bookmark function, it works great!

<br/>
<br/>
Also, what's KJV1_4?  As in the first book, 4th chapter or something?  The idea is that this parses the entire KJV text file so you can browse it quickly.  I'm not sure it will even work with just a chunk (actually, it did when I was testing way early on).  But as I mentioned on my blog, the BBE version isn't working when it probably should be, so I may have recently broken something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Very interesting.  Gave it a whirl, and have a few comments.  First, you should get rid of that Do Nothing button, unless you are going to add functionality later ;P  Simply put NULL instead of a string there.  Second, the mini-icon and large icon should probably be changed to reflect your plugin.  Generic icons shouldn't be used over and over.  Also, may I suggest a little animation while it's loading?  I thought it had crashed after ~2 minutes of caching and almost turned it off.  Otherwise, good work and contrats on the first 3rd party plugin.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

maybe something like you did with the bible, but instead of different books or verses something along the lines of different chapters. or, i could put all the books from a specific author in one file, and seperate them internally using the plugin.<br/>_________________<br/>Brandon

With the loading screen in the last version, it takes a few seconds to open the Bible. In this version, it is instantaneous, which is much better.

You don't have to be religious to read the Bible.

<br/>
It's like saying you have to be British to read Shakespeare or you have to be a scientist to read A Brief History Of Time.
<br/>
<br/>
The Bible is a book full of great wisdom poetry and storytelling.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps more importantly, though, it has been and remains the most influential text ever written--certainly in the West, but probably in all of world history.  For better as well as worse.  A good understanding of the Bible is necessary to understand the courses history has taken as well as the present condition of our society.

Actualy pretty wise words, you seldom hear.

Normaly its a case that either
<br/>
a) The bible is the define word of God you can not question in any way. 
<br/>
or
<br/>
b) Its a load of old rubbish with no worth whatsoever.

<br/>
<br/>
* Controls have been redesigned.  The touch screen is now used extensively for navigation, with the D-pad and shoulders doing verse-by-verse scrolling in various forms.
<br/>
* More bookmarks!  Should now be able to store 50 bookmarks.  The only reason there is a limit is to watch out for memory usage, I'm not sure it's really an issue though.
<br/>
<br/>
Coming up (hopefully):
<br/>
<br/>
* Navigating by specific books and chapters (as opposed to scrolling through)
<br/>
* Less file mess (parse file and bookmarks combined)
<br/>
* Uh, maybe other stuff I've talked about before
