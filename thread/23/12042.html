*Sigh* That flow! His poetry is beautiful. I wish I could write like that.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I wonder if that poetry is intentional? If so, that takes some real ingenuity to get a translation program doing it properly.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
Aha, I see now!
<br/>
He wrote Japanese on top and English on the bottom :)
<br/>
Interesting effect...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, some very nice adjustments here as always. I think I'll wait a bit to see what else he has up his sleeve, though. Having skin.ini selectable sounds cool, and it would be even more cool if that also loaded the skin graphics from whatever folder the selected skin.ini is placed in. (That way I could change skins within Moonshell!)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

DPGenc has no more "support" for non english characters. Older versions use to work.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, this version is great! :D But I found some bugs.
<br/>
<br/>
-The backlight timeout caps at 60 seconds, and adjusting any in the options resets them to this. I like to have mine at 300 (5 minutes) for image and text viewing.
<br/>
-Is skin.ini and desktop.bmp not used anymore? My settings aren't being applied. The skin it is using is neat though.
<br/>
-Software image interpolation doesn't seem to be working.
<br/>
-In the options, it's difficult to tell that you can drag the tabs, because the Close button covers them perfectly.
<br/>
-In the binary viewer (which is cool!), at 32 bytes per line, text gets cut off the side of the box.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I need to find time to make skins for this. :-p<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I told him about the text getting cut off, but he doesn't seem to be interested in reducing the amount displayed (it's 16 bytes, by the way). I suggested adding a horizontal scrollbar.
<br/>
<br/>
Are you using dual-screen or single-screen mode for the image plugin? Only the single-screen mode can use software interpolation.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the skin format has been changed. There seems to be a lot of new images and stuff.
<br/>

I could suggest adding a &lt; &gt; arrow to the Customize section so people know you can drag.

I think that I exterminated the bookmark bug.
<br/>
'TopScreenFlip' and the NDSROMPlugin section were deleted from moonshl_simple.ini.
<br/>
'NDSLiteDefaultBrightness', the BacklightTimeout section, and the ImagePlugin section were added to moonshl_simple.ini.
<br/>
Enabled interpolation processing ratio is '31%, 37%, 43%, 62%, 75%, 87%, 125% and over'. Ignored '25%, 50%, 100%'.
<br/>
The maximum value at 'BacklightTimeout' was changed at 999 seconds.
<br/>
The same name as DPG file. '.bmp/.jpg/.png' file was found. CreateThumbnail.exe makes the thumbnail.
<br/>
'Change backlight bright' was added to the system menu.
<br/>
The DLDI driver for SCLT was testing added.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice. I was probably too impatient with the interpolation since older versions did it immediately. It never did work at &lt;50%.
<br/>
<br/>
The new version is nice but has some small bugs. I can't open bitmap files in my root directory ("bg.bmp" and "Xbg.bmp") - it says "not support ext.?" and "not support ext.?[some Japanese letters here]" respectively. There's no other .bmp files on the card to try. .nds files work fine though, and I can open the bitmaps in binary mode. Also, if you view an image, zoom out to &lt;50%, close the viewer, open the settings menu, and then close it, as it fades out you can see corrupted pieces of the image you were looking at.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OMG the system menu is great!
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, all those skins with stupid buttons that don't do anything... can have buttons that do something!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm surprised Moonlight snuck it in so quietly, because it really is a good feature :)
<br/>
(Though is it possible to apply skins to it?)
<br/>
I notice that the System menu will not let me apply a negative value to "Vertical padding" in the "Image plugin", although Moonshell supports this quite well.
<br/>
<br/>
A lot of work to get these old skins working, but as always: It's progress!
<br/>
<br/>
I also really like that the GUI can be completely turned off with image view, and the word-wrapped dual screen text viewer.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

That's because there's stuff left over in VRAM. You can see it whenever you soft reset.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, I can think of a few little things:
<br/>
<br/>
-Now that moonshl.sav is being used for other things (besides just session save), I think it should be possible to configure what information is saved to that file. On that note, what became of the StartPath configuration?
<br/>
<br/>
-sysicon.bmp cannot be made transparent! If I give it a green background, it just appears black :(
<br/>
<br/>
-Also with the sysicon button: There does not seem to be a way to set its position with skin.ini.
<br/>
<br/>
-Now that the skin can be changed by loading skin.ini, it would be really cool if I could set the default theme via moonshl.ini. Or, perhaps the last used skin could be remembered in moonshl.sav.
<br/>
<br/>
-Why isn't startup.mp3 searched for in the skin folder?
<br/>
<br/>
No need for a finalfinalfinalfinalfinalfinalbeta2, but that sort of stuff would certainly give Moonshell even more polish :)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ooh, I didn't notice the word wrap until now.
<br/>
With 2 screen text reading, the text reader has become quite good! :)
<br/>
<br/>
I know I'm way too easily amused, but it is very nice that the window on the touch screen can still be pulled away when viewing a text file in dual screen mode, and that causes the top screen to display the file browser again :)
<br/>
That doesn't seem to happen with images, though?
<br/>
<br/>
It's too bad to lose the StartPath option. I guess my using it to get Moonshell starting in a particular directory was not its actual intended purpose?
<br/>
(I have a directory called Main, where I put all my software so stuff that writes to the root directory doesn't get in my way. To make it nicer and cleaner, I had Moonshell always starting in Main).
<br/>
<br/>
What became of the file info box? It seems to not be showing up at all, because even if I open a Moonshell plugin or an unrecognized file, I am given absolutely no information.
<br/>
Is this just me (maybe I forgot to copy over Plugins), or is it happening for  you as well?
<br/>
<br/>
Also a completely random question: I know there are tons of great skins, but has anyone created nice screen savers?
<br/>
Judging by the analog dots plugin, there is a lot of potential for some pretty cool stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Also completely random, here is my slightly altered version of the excellent Moonshell Duotone skin. This version works nicely in Moonshell 1.6:
<br/>
-I have added a button for the System menu (using a texture swiped from the bar at the bottom).
<br/>
-There has been a close button added (though I didn't do it... I think).
<br/>
-The play mode menu is positioned nicely.
<br/>
-c_text now has the same background as client, because the old background didn't sit well with displaying text files on both screens. This one is much more readable, anyway.
<br/>

Basically, I can't boot moonshell. Any version - none works. I tried deleting everything and reformatting, but for some reason there's a file stuck in my saver that can't be moved - but I'm assuming that has nothing to do with it since when I first got it going, that file was already there.
