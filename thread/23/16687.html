<br/>
Remote Touch DS gives you the opportunity to remote-control your computers mouse, keyboard and other things from your Nintendo DS hand-held console. This solution is not like remote desktop, but more like an advanced remote control.
<br/>
<br/>
The solution is client-server based, obviously, and requires you to have a server running. It is not plugged with synergy, it is my own solution. The server receives commands from the Nintendo DS and acts according to them.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 20px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Current release (out now; <span style="text-decoration: underline">0.6</span>):</span></span>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">(Released December 20th)</span>
<br/>
This is a major release and contains lots of bugfixes and new improved features. This release features a completely rewritten server-backend in Java. This means the server <span style="font-weight: bold">will work cross-platform (Windows, OS X, Linux and other *unix variants)</span>.  I would be glad if people running Linux or other *unix variants would give me some feedback.

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">0.6 (major)
<br/>
* Up on D-pad in "cursor"-mode for middle mouse click.
<br/>
* Complete revamped server-backend rewritten in Java with full GUI (will work cross-platform; Windows and OS X/*unix etc.).
<br/>
* Add support for custom key-mapping (gamepad-like feature) - configure this with the new server-backend GUI.
<br/>
* Custom adjustment of mouse acceleration.
<br/>
<br/>
0.3 (major)
<br/>
* Y button in "cursor"-mode for ALT.
<br/>
* A button in "cursor"-mode for TAB.
<br/>
* X and B in "cursor"-mode for scroll.
<br/>
* Adding left/right shoulder buttons to also mimic mouse clicks.
<br/>
* Accelerated cursor movements; much like a real touchpad.
<br/>
* Fixing problems when reconnecting to the server. You are now able to reconnect to the server without having to restart the server!
<br/>
* Implementing a battery-saver feature - when the DS lid is closed.
<br/>
* Upgraded to dswifi to 0.3.10. The wifi connection is much more stable now.
<br/>
* Corrected X and Y on keyboard and fixed some of the currently missing keys. I have a problem locating all the keys.
<br/>
* Added onscreen cursor to the client making it easier to see last cursor position.
<br/>
* Removed manual input of server IP and port. You now need to put a "rtds_config.txt" in the root of your cartridge with this data.
<br/>
* Server partially rewritten - fixed problem with reconnect.
<br/>
* Client GUI features/eyecandy implemented. Also better netcode.
<br/>
<br/>
0.2.2 (hotfix)
<br/>
* Minor changes on the server backend - possible problem with shutdown/restart on XP (maybe) fixed.
<br/>
<br/>
0.2.1 (hotfix)
<br/>
* Not able to connect properly when manually inputting connection data now fixed.
<br/>
<br/>
0.2
<br/>
* Media Control Extended (MEX) - good for Media Center or similar.
<br/>
* Keyboard fully calibrated and working with key press sound for comfort.
<br/>
* Remote restart or shutdown of your computer - good for those late night movie sessions where you just want to shutdown your computer directly from the comfort of your bed.
<br/>
* Added support for a "rtds_settings.txt" config-file on your cartridge with connection data - look in README.txt for more info.
<br/>
<br/>
0.1 (first public release)
<br/>
* Mouse and keyboard support + media play controls. Keyboard needs serious calibration, will be done later.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Feel free to redistribute this .zip, will save me bandwidth.
<br/>
<span style="color: darkred">If you will like to supply me with my dose of coffee for my late night coding sessions, then you can donate some money on the download page ;)</span>
<br/>
<br/>
(Read 'README' in .zip before you ask any questions please :))
<br/>
<br/>
The server will run on all systems that is able to run Java applications - this means just about every system possible (Windows, OS X, Linux and other *unix variants) - the only problems that could emerge would be with media key key-mappings or shutdown/restart commands.

is the ds pressure sensitive? colors seems to just add "more" color the longer you hold the stylus in place. as though it emulates what a pressure sensitive pad would do. when you slow down to draw a thicker line, you have just stayed in one place for longer... so the line is thicker.
<br/>
<br/>
at least thats how it seems to me.

Start up Colors and go to the touchscreen calibration and you will see that it's really pressure sensitive.

fantastic idea but can't figure how start it.

Do all step in dummy guide without luck.
<br/>
<br/>
I remove all protection from my router (firewall, wep)
<br/>
and something moves...
<br/>
<br/>
I configure DS with a game, slot A of my DS is correctly configured
<br/>
and working with game. So my DS is reacheable with ping from
<br/>
any LAN computer.
<br/>
<br/>
When I start your application PING from PC doesn't detect anymore DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I tryed with file rtds_settings.txt and without, insert port mannualy (it ask twice, why?) but not find where insert PC ip anywhere...
<br/>
<br/>
Think miss something in dummy guide and pray you to post some
<br/>
step-by-step guide with detail on your home connection, to help

us understand environment where application can work.

Remote Touch DS will use your WTC data -- therefore it will try and use the default connections you have configured in WFC. It will start with the first config, and if that connection is down, then the next and so fourth. So I suggest you configure WFC on your Nintendo DS to use the same access point your PC is using.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by BlazerRazor on Wed Jun 24, 2009 11:57 am; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

Do all step in dummy guide without luck.
<br/>
<br/>
I remove all protection from my router (firewall, wep)
<br/>
and something moves...
<br/>
<br/>
I configure DS with a game, slot A of my DS is correctly configured
<br/>
and working with game. So my DS is reacheable with ping from
<br/>
any LAN computer.
<br/>
<br/>
When I start your application PING from PC doesn't detect anymore DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I tryed with file rtds_settings.txt and without, insert port mannualy (it ask twice, why?) but not find where insert PC ip anywhere...
<br/>
<br/>
Think miss something in dummy guide and pray you to post some
<br/>
step-by-step guide with detail on your home connection, to help
<br/>
us understand environment where application can work.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you can help us to enjoy your work,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thank you both for reply.
<br/>
<br/>
think problem is DLDI support.
<br/>
<br/>
I've 'SLOT-2 M3 Series' so i must patch .nds file before run (?)
<br/>
<br/>
I did, and now 'Remote Touch DS' ask me correctly IP and
<br/>
AFTER (as second question) the port
<br/>
<br/>
Video on youtube doen't explain nothing new than readme.txt,
<br/>
a part a phrase. 
<br/>
<br/>
Put video on 1:32 sec and read this:
<br/>
"Type in your IP address on your DS and add 235 at the end.
<br/>
there is a space between your IP address and 235"
<br/>
<br/>
This in disaccord with README.txt:
<br/>
You will first enter IP/hostname and thereafter the port number.
<br/>
<br/>
But program ask before server IP and THEN port.
<br/>
<br/>
Try both case [ip port] and [IP] after [port] but doesn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
Miss something, but what ?
<br/>
<br/>
Please can tell us which cartridge/memory you use ?

thank you for reading,

I have already answered your question. The connection in the first WFC slot will be the first one which RTDS tries. If this first connection fails then it will try the next connection slot and so fourth. Configure your WFC settings with a game which uses Nintendo WFC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As many of you may know, I am currently participating the the 'Top 10 R4 DS Homebrew' contest. I would be VERY happy if gave my Remote Touch DS a vote. A random selected voter in the contest will also have the chance of getting a $20 price - so you may also win something by just giving your vote!
<br/>
<br/>
As of the 0.3 release, it is still in the works, I will only release when I feel I have a ready version in hands :)

For other developers a devkit will also be released. This will give others the opportunity to implement their own backend and possibly more backends for other systems (OSX and Linux).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The problem with pressure sensitivity is that this is not supported by default on any operating system. Think about how a mouse works and what features it has... no pressure sensitivity.
<br/>
<br/>
But I will still try and see if I can incorporate this feature somehow -- maybe by writing my own driver.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is a major release and contains lots of bugfixes and new improved features. This release features a completely rewritten server-backend in Java.

That's possibly because no homebrew runs in DSi mode, which is what you need to do in order to access the Advanced WiFi settings on the DSi.  IIRC no old DS game can use the WPA connections due to the way the DSi stores the details in banks 4-6, old style DS games only have access to WiFi info banks 1-3...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
