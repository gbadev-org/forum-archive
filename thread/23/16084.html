I bought an x360 the other week, and I can't TELL you how much I wished it had a Wii-pointer instead of desperately trying to find letters with a horribly misshapen ill conceived attempt at a Dpad.

Always touch, if not point, last resort is Dpad!

If, however, you have to type a full name of something to get it to run, rather then merely selecting it, it will always be slower.

Indeed, works quite well too once you get used to it.
<br/>
(allthough the 10 or so it costs to get a wireless keyboard is probably a better investment if you want to use your wii to send emails, it supports keyboards just fine).
<br/>
<br/>
Still, tab completion is a good idea for something like this.
<br/>
In fact, I often thought a tab-completion based OS for home computers would be a lot faster then the icon-based system of windows.

A google-esq window where you type your search OR the name of the program you want to run and then hit enter.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

I also think using the touch screen as a keyboard is a bad idea. I think someone should make a graffiti type input method (like the method used in the palm os). Something that could be shared among all other ds homebrew titles. I would work on this myself if I had enough time. Any one interested?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
