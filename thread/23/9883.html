<br/>
Its not working here though  (M3 CF). I maybe saying something very obvious, but the most frequent problem with homebrew on the M3 is missing a line at the start of the code saying something like POWER_ON(ALL) or something like that.
<br/>
<br/>
edit:
<br/>
<br/>
powerON( POWER_ALL );

Seeing as no other Snes emu's are active, its nice to see another person take up the challange.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Short answer, it will not work as an NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
Long answer, the new version uses a custom loader, not dsbuild on an NDS.  There is no NDS in there to work on.  Even if there was, the way the builder works is not compatible with an NDS version right now.
<br/>

As far as I know, you only need to add the one line of code I mentioned to make it work. Adding the M3 Loader by PepsiMan doesn't work. Its just cos the M3 turns off the 2D parts of the DS, for some reason. Silly.

Ok I decided to do it my self. And can't. I am quite good at coding so thats not the problem. The problem is the devkit refuses to build it, throwing a lot of errors. I should note that all my other apps compile fine. I'll take another look at the make file, but didn't see much wrong.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you tried make.bat in the arm9 directory?
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I'm not sure why the 2D screens aren't visible, I actually do explicitly turn them on right off the bat.  Line 220 of coderom.s has the video initialization stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm wondering, does the "Only flashcarts are supported currently" mean that other devices (like Supercard and M3) are only partially working, unstable, or just plain unkown to work or not? Or does it mean they are not expected to work at all? I'm suspecting the first due to some people sort of running games on SC and M3 so far. Would there be any guidelines to follow to try and test anything on a SCSD, for instance? And is onboard RAM a necessity, or could the GBAMP possibly be used to test? And is there a ROM size limit (like under 3MB or so)? Thanks.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

<br/>
The M3 boot-menu seems to leave traces in the VRAM and Sprites-VRAM.
<br/>
Setting the complete VRAM to 0 seems to eliminate the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Include following code right after setting the VRAM-Banks:
<br/>
<br/>
for (i = 0; i &lt; (131072); i++)
<br/>
{
<br/>
BG_GFX[i] = 0;

As for Super Mario World, it runs at full speed with sound as well, but there are some more errors in layering and sprites. Of course, text and water have issues in both games, but who really cares? The progress made in such a recent emulator that has JUST been ported to DS is nothing short of incredible - it's already rivaling SNES DS in my mind.

you're confusing loopy with flubba, although i guess that's an easy mistake to make as the two of them have contributed more than anybody else has to the GBA/DS scene.
<br/>
<br/>
loopy was responsible for pocketnes and snesadvance in their first iterations, nesds, and snesds (excluding sound, which was done by gladius, author of pocketSPC and more recently the man responsible for porting snezziboy to DS). he is also responsible for flashme, which is sort of a big one, and that, notably, is the only thing he has updated since apparently "abandoning" the emulators.
<br/>
<br/>
flubba was responsible for continuing work on both pocketnes and snesadvance, and has since written a number of emulators from scratch by himself, using the familiar pocketnes menu system. these include goomba (which was further developed into goomba color by dwedit), sms advance, blacktiger, pceadvance, and several others. he has yet to move onto the DS scene, but remains extremely prolific on the GBA side of things.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have an M3 and use a MiniSD.

I been looking all over for a tutorial on what I'm supposed to do and I have no luck.

In the <span style="font-weight: bold">sound</span> folder, there are 2 files... "snezzi.exe" and "snezzi.nds" . Then in the <span style="font-weight: bold">no sound</span> folder is 3 files...
