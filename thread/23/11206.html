With that said, the only feature that has become "required" is the seperation of rooms and moderators.  The ability to create your own room (like IRC) would be nice, so the music players could play their music to themselves all day long and not bother the people that want to actually talk.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
1) When someone asks you nicely not to write in there box or write on their sutff can you please do what they ask?

<br/>
2) Also for those that come in, at least say hello instead of just sitting there.  ENG and JPN people I'm talking to you.
<br/>
<br/>
3) If you have a noise going on the background please turn it down so that it does not interefere with others on  the program.

4) Last but not least...don't write in people's tic tac toe/connect 4 box, and make me a frickin biscuit.

(Now, back to struggling with getting this screen cover off so that I can enjoy it... any tips? It's not adhesive - just big and attached during a moment of complete buffoonery. I'm banking on the theory that what goes in can come out, but so far with little luck. Theoretically I could cut it with a knife and remove it that way, but I can't stand the risk of cutting into my touch screen).
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: OK, you can all relax now!
<br/>
In desperation I managed to aim an exacto-knife sidewaysish while pulling at the screen "protector" with strong adhesive. Somehow I managed to dig just deep enough and my touch screen came out completely unscathed. (It perhaps looks even better than ever!)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

I used it a bit the other night, but found my screen protector to make writing extremely difficult.  Removing the screen protector helped the situation somewhat (I needed to replace it anyway), but it was still somewhat difficult to write without having random lines appear.  Chatting appears to work but oftentimes you get pauses in between what you hear.  I've been meaning to test it with a friend of mine, but he's not too interested.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1.  I'm pretty sure it isn't, as this was made a long time ago, before the Lites started having Wifi issues with homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
2.  Dunno, you'd probably want to contact Moonlight directly, as I doubt he visits this thread.  Keep in mind that he's Japanese.
<br/>
<br/>
3.  The ad-hoc protocol has not been figured out yet, so there's no way to do DS-to-DS communication with any homebrew.  The closest we've got is a demo app that sends a "test.nds" file on the root of your card to a flashed DS system through Download Play, but it only works on some devices.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
