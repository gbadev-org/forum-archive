    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, so I guess we are overflowing with new games released since the DrunkenCoders compo and the PAlib compo but - I wanted to post my new game here for those of you who hadn't seen it elsewhere. 
<br/>
Details and download <a class="postlink" href="http://sumiguchi.googlepages.com/playdismusic" target="_blank">here.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a music game so play with the rythm to make the best music and get the highest score. This game has 4 songs and you can play the lead or rythm/bass on each of the songs. Instructions on how to play can be found by clicking on the "?" in the main menu. Press start while playing to return to the menus.
<br/>
<br/>
This game has a bit of a learning curve but once you get used to the layout - you will be rocking in no time.
<br/>
<br/>
The JAM MODE is more of toy - I preprogrammed a few "riffs" for you to try out, or just make your own melody with the option of a few different beats.
<br/>
<br/>
There is only one bug that I have found. It is in JAM MODE when switching between riffs you occasionaly get sprite corruption. Just press start to return to the main menu and re-enter JAM MODE to clear the problem. 
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know how you like the game or if there are any bugs that I missed! (Tested OK on SuperCard and Max Media Launcher)
<br/>
<br/>
And if you like this one, well, next christmas - try out <a class="postlink" href="http://sumiguchi.googlepages.com/thesoundsoftheseason" target="_blank">The Sounds of the Season</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice work! I love music games where you actually play the music yourself rather than just giving you random buttons to press along with the song.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't really play any of the built in songs properly, but it's fun to just jam along with them. Maybe add a practice mode where it lights up the keys when they should be pressed? That way you could see what the right note was when you make a mistake, or just flat out memorize the sequences.
<br/>
<br/>
Also potentially helpful would be labelling the keys with their letter names. That way you could keep better track of where sharps and flats are, and have one more type of memory key for learning the songs too.
<br/>
<br/>
It's already lots of fun though. Keep it up!<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great game! This is one of the better homebrew music games. The record tonearm animation is cool.:) I have a few suggestions:
<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to look at the grey bar, the touch pad and the awesome/great/ok/miss at the same time. Would it be a better idea to put the scoring part on the top screen and the grey bar at the bottom?
<br/>
<br/>
In the menu, it isn't obvious at first that clicking on the left and on the right has different effects.
<br/>
<br/>
Sleep mode and libfat support would be good.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDSh" target="_blank">Nintendo DS homebrew on Wikipedia</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is a nice idea!  I'll play around with this.

I did try it out with the awesome...ok showing on the top screen, but found it too distracting.  I never thought of moving the gray bar to the bottom screen..
<br/>
<br/>
My work on this particular game is over...I may make some minor changes and provide a new build (as I understand there are some M3/R4 compatibility problems).  
<br/>
<br/>
I am planning to make another game with the same engine that is more story based with some progression ... so I'll be experimenting. Thanks for the suggestions!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
