    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is the first alpha release of my latest homebrew project.  It's a remake/re-imagining of Super Foul Egg, a freeware Commodore Amiga version of Puyo Puyo.
<br/>
<br/>
There's still a lot of work to do on the presentation side of things, but the game itself is mostly complete.  The only issue that you might run into is the number of block colours.  Although the menu system suggests that you can choose to have 4, 5 or 6 block colours in a game, only the first 4 have been implemented.  Choosing 5 or 6 colours will crash the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
You can download the game here:

<br/>
Regarding the presentation, if you're a graphics person and interested in contributing, I need:
<br/>
<br/>
 - A title screen to replace the current plain text when the game starts up;
<br/>
 - A background image for the menu system (though I could just re-use the title screen, probably blurred and greyscaled);
<br/>
 - A background image for the high score table (not coded yet);
<br/>
 - A graphic for the bottom screen when a game is being played with areas to put the current level, number of chains, score and incoming garbage count.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested in helping out, and are willing to have your work distributed under the MIT/X11 licence, let me know!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by ant512 on Sun Sep 18, 2011 9:18 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>
