<br/>
<br/>
The software itself is okay-ish...
<br/>
<br/>
I mean, it's cool and all, but the whole GBFS thing is just kinda irritating. It takes ages to load the rom and also limits just how large a comic you can use.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, I tried to do a straight (Ie. Default settings) conversion of Ghost Rider: The Road to Damnation[Director's Cut] issue 1/6 and the rom ended up being about 10mb too large to load. Not cool...
<br/>
<br/>
With the use of a FAT library this program will hit the sweet spot. The GBFS usage, though, is a pain...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To the average user (myself), the library issue is not of concern.  It does it's job very well.  
<br/>
<br/>
I've only tried it with a few comics (about 5) so far and I am EXTREMELY surprised at the quality and simplicity of this application.
<br/>
<br/>
I have yet to encounter any major problems except I have a few things that could be improved on
<br/>
<br/>
 - Needs an ability to zoom in (even further) because for double page comic scans I am unable to read it due to the low resolution that the PC program converts it to 
<br/>
<br/>
 - When making .nds files, have an option to just choose which format you'd like and not create all of them (.sc.nds, .nds, .nds.gba)

<br/>
That's a kinda funny stance. I mean, most people I know prefer applications that load quickly and don't have peculiar artificial limitations on usage...
<br/>
<br/>
The application is nice, yes, but it really *needs* FAT support. As it is, for all it's crazy charm, it's a one trick/comic pony...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

I agree!

Thing is i don't find that it's 'slow' loading and have yet to be affected by these 'limitations'</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm reading Watchmen series right now using this great app. All 12 of the comics .cbr's come in uder the 32meg limit. Works perfectly well. Its no great shakes to reboot after each issue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It's also possible to split up the .cbr archives, so when I do get around to reading it, i'll just do that.  Hey it's a tad annoying but it can't be 100% perfect on first release.
<br/>
<br/>
And I havn't test this myself but the .nds archive is halved if you extract the images from the .cbr/z archives into a folder and use the 'folder' option not '.nds.' option.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am making a index of comics.
<br/>
<br/>
We have 2 things up now, and they are .nds files only. If you want to convert them, do it yourself. It saves bandwidth and time uploading. Please email .nds files to <a href="mailto:nds@homebrewcast.com">nds@homebrewcast.com</a> so we can add some more! Lets make it filled with comics!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1) I think the maximum size of 1 nds size for this comicDS is around 32 MBytes.
<br/>
2) I think there is a limit of number of images. I'm not sure how many is the maximum images, but I try around 100 pictures and the created nds file just give 2 black screens.
<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, can we have a comic reader just like this? all functions of comicDS are very cool. But the new homebrew can read the images directly from the flash card, plus it also can zoom in and out.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry because my English is not very good. I hope someone can understand it and explain to everybody. Thank a lots.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
