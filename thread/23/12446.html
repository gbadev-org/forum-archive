    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://deadketchup.kyuran.be/2007/02/12/styxds-v01a/" target="_blank">STYXDS</a>  is Atari ST emulator programmed by Kyuran, the author of Croco DS and PenkoDS.
<br/>
<br/>
The very first release 0.1a is able to run most games at 60% speed allowing you to enjoy Xenon 2, Rick Dangerous, David Braben's Virus and many more...
<br/>
<br/>
some impressive pics (made by Lord Raptor) :

<br/>
<br/>
01a features (rough translation from author's website)
<br/>
<br/>
- .ST files support
<br/>
- sound
<br/>
- DLDI support
<br/>
<br/>
How to :
<br/>
<br/>
copy Atari ST TOS and .ST files in the root or /roms/st directories of your card, patch the .nds with DLDI and... that's it! :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Tos 1.xx and 2.xx should run ok, but note that I used v1.02. Make sure to rename the file to tos.bin
<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget this is an early alpha release. There are many bugs, I'm quite aware of that.
<br/>
<br/>
Please don't ask for roms and games. Google is your best friend. You should be able to find all Automation releases just three mouse clicks away from the Steem Engine website, hint hint ! ;)

<br/>
I'm having plenty of trouble getting anything to work on my GBAMP.
<br/>
Some games end up on the green OS screen, but I can't control anything (changing the controls to 'Mouse Emulation' doesn't seem to help - although the keyboard moves to the top screen, pressing the touchscreen still seems to push buttons on the keyboard).
<br/>
<br/>
Still, at least a lot of the games seem to load, or make an attempt. Looking forward to future releases!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Veg on Tue Feb 13, 2007 3:50 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
Some of them bring you to the green desktop. From there, double click on the disc volume (on the top left corner) with the touchpad.<ul>Sometimes, you have files inside. Double click on the starting file.
<br/>
Sometimes you have nothing, and I suspect bad rom, emulator bug or compatibility problem between the TOS version and the rom. Try another rom then.

I've checked it.
<br/>
It's a mouse emulation using the DS Pad, with 'A' and 'B' buttons for left and right mouse buttons. Dunno why the screens are exchanged, because obviously the stylus only affects the keyboard...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Using a SupercardSD, patched with the scsd_moon.dldi, but I just get a scrambled screen on the roms I try to load (Dungeon Keeper and Barbarian) - it would actually load without patching but wouldn't let me select my roms.  With the patch, I could select my roms but neither work.  
<br/>
<br/>
I had to use the UK 1.02 TOS found here: <a href="http://steem.atari.st/tos_uk.zip" target="_blank">http://steem.atari.st/tos_uk.zip</a> because I couldn't find the french one (both of the sites that Steem links to are down).

I'll be keeping tabs on this project, I never had an Amiga but played a heck of a lot of the games on other platforms, so this'd be amazing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
What happens when you don't select any rom at the emulator start ?
<br/>
Do you have scrambled top screen ? If your top screen is messed up, you may have TOS rom problem (bad rom or tos not renamed to tos.bin)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, just realised when I renamed the tos.bin it was still being called tos.bin.img - now I've got Dungeon Master to load, Barbarian starts but just goes to the desktop.  
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I say Dungeon loads, but it's just the intro screen - I have no idea how to bypass it XD  
<br/>
<br/>
Will try it with some others.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:  Got it working with Treasure Island Dizzy - it ran at about 60%, however I added some more roms to the cart and now the select menu for the dizzy rom won't work.  It doesn't seem to be recognizing when I press the keyboard keys or something...
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:  Weird, replaced it with a new download and removed the other roms and it works.  I didn't need to patch it either.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Posted a video of Treasure Island Dizzy - I apologise for the frankly awful picture quality/camera technique but I just wanted to show this off!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It seems to vary on the game. Pressing 'Start' sometimes does it, sometimes space, sometimes the left or right mouse button (on the touchpad screen).
<br/>
<br/>
Games I've got running include Populus 2, Turrican 2, Buggy Boy, Defender of the Crown, Emlyn Hughes International Soccer, Robin Hood... most of my favourites from my Amiga days! Even Frontier runs, although it's too slow to actually be playable.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure the way the touchscreen is currently used for mouse control is the best idea. I think it'd be better if, when using a mouse, the bottom screen was used for the display, and you had direct control over the pointer, like ScummVM DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
