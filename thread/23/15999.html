    <h4>#162381 - Jayenkai - Mon Sep 01, 2008 2:45 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was initially going to release the super-quick "Just the editor, and a few levels" version, but as I sorted a few bugs, more and more of the game got fixed as well, and then I added the whole main menu, and things started to take a more "proper" form.. so..  
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">JNKPlat DS 08</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Download</span>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://socoder.net/uploads/1/jnkplat08ds.zip" target="_blank">JNKPlat DS 08</a> : Complete with dldi version and non-dldi version. (.sc.nds/.ds.gba/.nds for each)
<br/>
Shove it in the root, DLDI it if necessary, and add the JNKPlat folder for your saves.
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy, complain, rant and rave.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Game</span>
<br/>
A simple puzzle platform game.  Get to the exit to complete each level.
<br/>
Be aware, though.. This game is more a Puzzle game than it is a Platformer.  There are many weird grid-based things that are leftovers from that style.  Most noticable is Platdude's very specific Jump.  One up, Three across.
<br/>
The Blue Circles (Super Precious Gems!!) are collectable.  You don't need them, but there's a total on the main menu.  Get 'em all, and you get to say "I got 'em all!"
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Controls</span>
<br/>
There's two jump buttons, and a hold button.
<br/>
The hold button, B, can be used to dangle from hooks, vines and red floors.  It can also be used to drag red boxes.
<br/>
The two jump buttons, Y and A, jump left and right respectively.  It's easy once you try.  If you really dislike it, you can switch to single button jump on the main menu, but I wouldn't recommend it!  Some things happen too quickly to stop and turn around!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Level Packs</span>
<br/>
Level packs can contain many many levels, but each level must be played in the order layed out in the pack.
<br/>
No saves!  If you die 3 times, you're right back at the start.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Editor</span>
<br/>
Tap the middle icon on the titlescreen to enter the editor.
<br/>
Draw a level.
<br/>
Hold a trigger, and a Wipe/Quit and Test button appear at the bottom.  If you test a level, and subsequently complete it, and you can then also Save it from this same Trigger-based menu. <span style="font-weight: bold">Note : You can only save a level if you've managed to complete it!</span>  You don't need all the gems, but you do need to get to the exit.
<br/>
<br/>
The level will be added as a simple line of ascii text, to the bottom of the JNKPlat/MyLevs.lev file on your card (assuming you're using the DLDI version, and have added the JNKPlat folder to the root.)
<br/>
Each line is it's own level.  Feel free to copy+paste these lines to build up your own little level packs.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Request</span>
<br/>
If you make any levels, send 'em my way!  The next release should be ready in a couple of weeks time.  (or maybe before, if I get plenty of levels!)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://AGameAWeek.com" target="_blank">A Game A Week.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Haha, tops. :)
<br/>
<br/>
I like how fast platdude's little legs run.
<br/>
Some nice puzzles in there.. I especially like the toggling-solidity-of-different-sets-of-blocks mechanic.
<br/>
<br/>
Something weird happened though.. When I lost all my lives for the first time, upon restarting it began at a different level, not the first one. Every time I died and restarted it would start from that level. I went on and did a few more levels after that, including one with a zigzag pattern of rings embedded in walls, where you have to jump right/grab a ring, jump left/grab a ring, jump right/etcetc...
<br/>
<br/>
Next time I played, after turning the DS off and back on again, every time I die it starts at the first level again. I went through all 10 levels and didn't see any of the levels I got to on the first run through at all. Completely different set of levels. Am I missing something or are there secret hidden levels? :)
<br/>
<br/>
I was going to say that my only gripe was this: on the bit where you had to zigzag jump and grab rings, on some of them i could just hold down B, hit jump, and he'd grab the ring. But on some of them I had to jump, <span style="font-style: italic">then</span> hit B, or he'd miss the ring.   It was when I went back to make sure that I got to the different set of levels...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also, the problem I had with <span style="font-style: italic">holding down B while jumping to grab rings</span> not working isn't happening anymore. Works fine. I blame my sleepy thumb.  o_O</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've noticed the scores aren't saving.

 1 minor thing I noticed, when you create a level and save it, you can't access it until you restart your DS. This may have been adressed already though, as I haven't tried your most recent build.
<br/>
 Thanks, and I look forward to submitting a few levels once I make enough good ones.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I must've been trying so hard to think of All-New features that, inexplicably, I've completely forgotton some of the old ones!

I used to have conveyor belts...  Not sure where they went!

I'll have a play!

Thanks for the level pack.  I'll have a play through them once I've bothered to add the belts ;)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Jayenkai, I know that Up/X+Down/B scroll the screen up and down, but would you consider adding a toggle (maybe on Start/Select...moving 'Test' to Start) that would allow the editing cursor to be moved around with the D-Pad/buttons-for-lefties?  This would allow for more precise editing, and less 'whoops, just touched the wrong tile!' re-dos needed.
<br/>
<br/>
...although now that I think about it, I can't think of a good button to use to 'plot' at the current selected area :/
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, is there not a way to Load/re-edit a created level, or am I totally missing it? :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#162510 - another world - Thu Sep 04, 2008 3:28 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">some ideas:
<br/>
<br/>
light and dark levels with glow-in-the-dark elements to interact with.
<br/>
elements like ice, water, air, flame, earth, etc to interact with. (freezing water, slide a block, thawing water, dropping through...)
<br/>
custom plat-man editor, clothing color, female/male, hair styles
<br/>
<br/>
the ideas really for things to interact with are endless, depending on how much work you want to do while coding. 
<br/>
<br/>
a wifi method to download levels much like what is included with stillaliveds. but i must admit i like the ability to add levels to a folder manually a bit more. its nice to know you can do that.
<br/>
<br/>
anyways, i've been playing the hell out of it. even tho i can get past everything on 1 try its still so much fun!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Keep at it, you'll get to both level 10s eventually :D   And, just be glad that I bothered to strip those into two packs!  Level packs can go on for as long as you can make levels..  Well, there's probably a limit eventually, but I didn't hard code one.. so.. wootsocks!
<br/>
And no saves..  Bloody savegames, ruined the toughness of games!  Bah, humbug!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Tweaks</span>
<br/>
PlatDUDE is very very tiny!  But even so, he's already taking up most of his little 8x8 frame.  And I'm too damn lazy to animate hair.. So Hairdo's are out!  I could add a color palette tweaker to change his color, but.. then it's not him!!!   I may as well revert back to the CPC's little stickman character!  (Who's an imposter, and anyone who says he isn't is lying!)
<br/>
If he were a larger version of platdude, you could probably stick <a class="postlink" href="http://jnk.homedns.org/abandonedgame.jpg" target="_blank">a whole pile of costumes on him</a>.  As he's only 8x8 pixels here, there's not really much point.
<br/>
<br/>
To load a level you've already saved, head to the MyLevs pack, use the little arrow (tap the screen) to select the level, play as normal, and then hold L and tap Select...  Brings up the editor.  Note that when you re-save, it'll save at the end of the pack, and you'll have to head into the text file manually, and delete the old one!  (Also, I've noticed the files don't show up properly in standard windows Notepad.  If you want to tweak, try using <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pnotepad.org/" target="_blank">Programmers Notepad</a> or otherwise!)
<br/>
<br/>
DPad based editing.. could be switched with a menu toggle, maybe?.. It's been bugging me a few times, too, so I suppose I should do that.
<br/>
<br/>
As for online level upload/downloads, I'd rather that people go through the hastle of uploading things themselves..  It might not be perfect, but at least it weasles out those silly "Here is my level..  You run right, and then jump!  yeay! wowie!!!" type worthless levels!  Folk who bother, bother properly ;)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Blocks</span>
<br/>
As I said on my own site, (or, am currently in the middle of saying.. two posts on the go at once, here!) I generally only add a block if it's got a unique function.
<br/>
So long as the point of the block is to actually do something new, it'll go in.  If it's "Brick, but another color! OMG!!!" then..  well, the game's hard enough without having to second guess what everything's supposed to do!
<br/>
<br/>
Water-&gt;Ice
<br/>
I do like the Freeze-water -&gt; Block -&gt; Water idea.  It's interesting..  BUT.. I can't imagine how you'd freeze it.  I can't imagine you gathering up a puddle of water and carrying it to a freezer! I could see you carrying a Freezeeeeeegun into the water to freeze a block.. But then how would you get the block out?  If the water's in a pool, he ain't getting a big heavy block of ice out of a pool!
<br/>
It's a fun idea, it's just that my head really can't work out how that'd happen!
<br/>
And even then, he can't climb the ice, if the ice is slippery!
<br/>
<br/>
Fire's being dealt with. Little wall/floor mounted flamethrowers that you can time jumps around.  And, maybe little "Mario-fireball" style blobs of fire that come shooting out of walls.  (If I can get them to bob about the levels ok!)
<br/>
<br/>
Earth = What?  A rock?  I used to have a little ball that platdude would push, and it'd roll about and hit switches and things, but now that the plunger takes care of the timing element of the game, the ball's timing's not really needed.  If I can think of a reason to pop it back in, it'll be in.  (On a related note : <a class="postlink" href="http://jnk.homedns.org/unused.png" target="_blank">Unused Sprites</a>)
<br/>
<br/>
Ice = He could skid on ice, but once the conveyor belts are in place, (*note, I'm adding those back in, they've been missing since about JNKPlat 3!) I'm not sure if skiddy ice would be needed.
<br/>
<br/>
Light + Dark..  I'll play with, and see what can be done.. Simplistically it could be achieved, but how you'd light up the level I'm not sure...
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK folks, here's a level editor edition!
<br/>
Or, rather..
<br/>
Here's a version I've been building up, but haven't yet built any more levels for, yet!
<br/>
<br/>
vvvvvvvvvvvvvv--Download--vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://socoder.net/uploads/1/jnkplat08ds.zip" target="_blank">Slightly Better - Level Editor Edition</a> (only 016-JNKPlat08.nds is included!)
<br/>
<br/>
^^^^^^^^^^^--Download--^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Updates</span>
<br/>
1. Ice on floors.  Platdude skids across, rather than stops, wherever there's ice.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Faster darts.  There's 2 dart blocks in the editor.  The left hand ones will shoot every 180 frames, right will shoot every 90..!
<br/>
<br/>
3. Faster Plungers.  There's 2 plungers.. Red = slow, Green = faster.
<br/>
<br/>
4. Blocks on Plungers.  If you drop a block on a plunger, it'll remove the plunger, but also make the switch, making for permanent switches.
<br/>
<br/>
5. Conveyor Belts.  They make you move!!!
<br/>
<br/>
6. Blocks on Belts.  Blocks shift along on belts.  Note.. Moving blocks aren't considered solid objects.. So you can usually run through blocks on belts!  Bizarre.. But f'k it!  They will smush you if you're between a wall and one, though!
<br/>
<br/>
7. Blinky Blinky Blobs!..!  Stick down a blinky blinky blob, and it occasionally blinks between being a floor and not being a floor!
<br/>
Timing's very very hard.
<br/>
BUT.
<br/>
Draw a line of blinky blinky blobs, and you'll notice a pattern.  Draw a full line of them, and a stream of floor will appear to move side to side.. Draw about 5 or 6 in a row, and you get a nice, challenging, occasional bridge to cross at the right time..
<br/>
Blinky Blinky Blob Bridges move at the same pace Platdude runs.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Flamethrowers.
<br/>
<br/>
...
<br/>
<br/>
So, make levels, submit them, and just like nyarla ("Magnetic Robot Shavings") you can have a batch of levels right there in the compiled edition of the game!   Wootsocks!  <span style="font-style: italic">Jay makes a note that he should insert author names into packs!</span>
<br/>
Just include a nice enough pack, and a decent title for it...  And/or a couple of random levels for the random pack.
<br/>
Sorted!
<br/>
<br/>
You've got 1 week to do it.
<br/>
I'll release the next proper edition next week..
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Homebrew News Sites..</span>
<br/>
If you're posting this at all, make sure that it's pointed out that this isn't a "fancy new edition" and that it's actually just a quick "Level Building Edition".
<br/>
Make sure you include my email address, (Jayenkai@Gmail.com) and/or a link to this topic, so folk can submit levels.
<br/>
Also ensure that there's a strict instruction that everyone who plays should really at least bother to upload a single level for the Random submitted Levels pack.  By Monday!  So I can bundle everything, and release it..
<br/>
<br/>
Folk who don't submit levels will make me a very sad panda.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i messed with this build for more than an hour lastnight and found it very frustrating. There is no way to undo/delete aside from 'wipe' from what i was able to find out. it is very hard to create a level without first drawing it out on graph paper this way. each experiment or mess up has no way to delete blocks you added. the stylus is over sensitive at times jumping and adding a second block next to one already placed. i'm assuming this is because i'm clicking between positions. again without the ability to delete i'm forced to wipe and start over. i've tried to use the dpad for building but it just doesn't feel as intuitive as the stylus.
<br/>
<br/>
i do realize that undo requires you to store the position of the last (set amount) of blocks, which could be hard to implement depending on how you coded this. but what about a 'black' background block or an eraser symbol which do one in the same?
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers for the additional environmental items, i already see the potential of this version. also thanks for adding the animated background on/off button.
<br/>
<br/>
saving: how about adding the ability to save every 10 levels or so for those of us who want to build really long levels (mega levels).
<br/>
<br/>
light/dark: some type of pulsating or glow-in-the-dark switch which you have to get to. blacked out obsticles in the way, put falls, flame, etc. ohh flame could light up the few blocks around it maybe? it would be cool if the switch only lights up a part of the level so i have to make it to the next level. now you have fully dark levels, partially lit levels, etc. 
<br/>
<br/>
earth: i was thinking more like rocks that grow up out of the ground to kill you or block your path. but rolling a block to set off a trigger could also be fun. 
<br/>
<br/>
ice/water/melt: just threw it in there, you're right implementing takes some thinking... i'll ponder it more.
<br/>
<br/>
enemies: any chance of simple enemies along the lines of say pitfall II for atari? bats that swoop, or some frogs that jump, lizards that chase or something? i'd love to have a bat chase me right into a flame thrower and watch it explode!
<br/>
<br/>
any rate, thanks for replying back point by point, i appreciate it. it is good to when developers (like yourself) get involved with their fans.... yes you have fans!

You can delete blocks by holding L or R and erasing with the stylus - though this isn't indicated in-game.. At least you could in previous versions (still haven't had a proper play with this version, sorry jayenkai!!!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can't see any point in an undo, since.. a) that'd mean keeping track of things ;) and b)  it's not exactly huge.. undo = put stuff back!  That's not too hard!

i have the mylevs.lev in the root jnkplat folder, but when i load up this new build i still get the defult levels. how do i access levels i am making? i double checked to make sure the 1 level i made is the only line if ascii in the file.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for letting me know about delete, by the way, it makes all the difference. if while level building i come up with any great ideas i'll let you know. i'm so happy you are willing to listen to people and implement changes into your game.

I should point out that, although I've made about 5 or 6 levels, I have infact been working on a completely different game, this week.. (.. when your website's AGameAWeek.com, it kinda works out that way!)
<br/>
<br/>
So, as of yet, there's nothing new to JNKPlat.
<br/>
However, I am trying to wrap my head around the light possibility..
<br/>
I might be able to achieve something vaguely resembling non-light, but... I'm not sure if I can keep it up to speed.  We'll have to wait and see!
<br/>
<br/>
Still aiming for another Tuesday release, though!  And I still have 3 days to work on it!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sounds good.
<br/>
<br/>
so far i find that the level editor should really have a way to load up old creations so we can tweak them later on. i don't mind the save on complete, it forces the user to build a playable level (which is important). but some way to dynamically load from the save file would be grand!
<br/>
<br/>
i've built 6 very fun levels so far. i'm going to hit 13 and post them up for you by sunday night. hopefully some get included in the next release =P.
<br/>
<br/>
i've been making good use of the blocks that fade in-and-out and the blocks that work on switches, but i kept thinking that a pit-fall block would be fun. something that disappears or falls apart, or has a hole in it if you stand on it for to long. this would allow for not only fun traps, but require the user to spend time trying to figure out which block lets them drop to the next area of the level. afterall a bit of quick frustration makes a short game memorable.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you know i skipped that block all together, didn't realize thats what it was! i should have spent more time reading up and less time with trial-by-error. but i was thinking of a block that isn't an obvious bomb. a block that looks like all the rest but if you walk on it, or perhaps stand on it for a set time it disappears, melts, blows up, etc. i just had an idea for a level full of secret traps and doors, but 'hidden' doors don't exist.
<br/>
<br/>
so far i found 2 small bugs.
<br/>
1) if you place a colored door above a ladder you can't enter it. you can however drop down onto a door (pressing down) and open them as well as push right/left, just not up.
<br/>
2) if you are on a spring plunger and you hit select and choose to end the level, the editor keeps springing you up and never ends.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">whatever that picture is of the windows game your working on, it looks fun as hell. i wish i had the time to sit and code these days. i was into flash games during my graduate degree, but now its all business....
<br/>
<br/>
i hope to get into C again and make something useful for the nds this winter. i picked up a new ak rpg for the occasion!
<br/>
<br/>
if i recall the xmas special edition of jnk had different style switches? they actually sort of looked like the handle on a toilet =P. any chance of bringing those back at all as another option to turn something on/off? i rather got use to them but now i find i miss them. 
<br/>
<br/>
i can't wait to mess with the update! most of the levels i have made are experimental at best, only a few are actually thought out... i'll post up something late tonight as an edit to this comment.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;edit&gt;</span>
<br/>
here are 16 levels (and 1 dupe-see below), some thought out, some really hard, some easy, some fun, some very weird and creative. i can assure you that anything that seems impossible, isn't. well aside from the stars on the ship level, those blinking platforms are not designed to be reached. anyways, a lot just depends on when you move in relation to the timing of objects around you.
<br/>
<br/>
most of the levels have an easy way to get to the end, but require work to collect all the blue dots. i did that on purpose so people who don't collect the dots will have a feeling like they missed out on something due to the fact that it won't take that long to get through all 16. yes, interactive levels which leave you feeling cheated if you just run for the door! haha
<br/>
<br/>
some levels look overwhelming but actually follow a semi-straight path from point A to Z.
<br/>
<br/>
i tried to remove level 6 after fixing it and resaving, but all the levels are jumbled up in notepad. i do not see 17 lines (1 for each level), and i double checked to make sure word wrap is turned off. so level 6 should be ignored =)
<br/>
<br/>
let me know what you think, i'm going to try to *plan* some more involved levels in the next week.

<br/>
i like those ideas.
<br/>
<br/>
i still like the idea of treasure pitfall II style. gold bars, huge giant diamonds, etc. but i don't know if those really belong in an inventory. i remember on the unused sprite image you had a treasure chest. i like the idea of #/# for the blue orbs, so collecting money, gems, etc the same way seems like a good idea. trying to get it all instead of beat your high score...
<br/>
<br/>
what about a plunger missing its top, the top goes in the inventory like a key for a door? 
<br/>
<br/>
how about ice cubes (yes random ice cubes are always on the ground) that can be dropped on certain blocks (by pushing in the blocks direction) and those frozen blocks can then be slid around, jumped on a few times to break (or jumped at if they are left/right of platman). Hm or when going with elemental things, how about seeds that can be planted to form vines platman can climb up, which eventually grow old and crumble. or a torch platman can carry in the inventory to light up dark levels.
<br/>
<br/>
perhaps if enemies become more advanced some weapons would be nice for the inventory such as a whip, gun, knife, or rope. even indy style jumping from peg to peg using a whip sounds fun!
<br/>
<br/>
what about pieces of a symbol, like an amulet, when you have all 4 they build a full circle and then you can save? so the user could put 4 different parts throughout 8 different levels....
<br/>
<br/>
the "X" button isn't being used, so that work work for the active inventory objects. you just need a way to scroll through the inventory. i think items such as keys should remain automatic, including any new tools. its just nice if the game engine knows what to do if the item is in the inventory and the 'key hole' presents itself infront of the user. also this keeps the game flowing quickly which is the nature of the engine since the beginning builds.
<br/>
<br/>
hm what about two parts that form 1 key which open a door?
<br/>
<br/>
i'm sure i have more ideas somewhere, this was just a quick rant. if i come up with anything while level building today i'll post back.

    <h4>#162901 - Jayenkai - Mon Sep 15, 2008 10:54 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Work = good for thinking time!
<br/>
<br/>
At work, today, I thought about the dynamite.
<br/>
As much as I like it, I can see it working one of the following two ways.
<br/>
(Yup, I thought about that X button, too!)
<br/>
<br/>
1. Player can plant dynamite anywhere they want, thus making you have to second guess every possible place they could plant it.  You'd have to start making doubley secured levels, so the player doesn't just grab the nearest dynamite, and blow a hole through a wall, cutting the level in half!
<br/>
It'd be very easy to do for the player, but really tricky for the editor.
<br/>
That's kinda backwards!
<br/>
<br/>
So, #1's thrown out.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Only certain blocks can be destroyed.  You pick up the dynamite, take it to a predetermined location, drop it, set it off, run..  and the predetermined block explodes.
<br/>
<br/>
..
<br/>
Then I realised..
<br/>
Isn't that what the mine block already does?
<br/>
<br/>
?
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;shrugs&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
Similarly all of the "Pick up X object to complete Y object" seems kind of superfluous.  Rather than have "Collect top of plunger, take to plunger", why not just have a door next to the plunger, and have to take the key over.
<br/>
<br/>
Again, these are petty arguments, but it goes back to my wanting each block to have a distinct purpose.  There are 2 speeds of darts because when I went back to play the older JNKPlatDS, the darts were flying at me 100 miles an hour!   So I shoved the 2nd speed back in.  Other than that, pretty much everything is it's own unique block.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now Shields.. I like shields!! That's a nice idea..
<br/>
I'll try and add those without having to redraw all the sprites to show a shield ;)
<br/>
<br/>
"collecting money, gems, etc the same way seems like a good idea"
<br/>
Collectables that have no point other than to go onto the scoreboard have one serious flaw.
<br/>
It'd mean I'd have to fit them onto the scoreboard!
<br/>
Not to sound lazy, but..  It's a bit cramped, and I can't be arsed redoing it ;)
<br/>
Otherwise, they'd just be a case of same object, different sprite.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, your little "4 corners of the amulet" idea.  That's sparked a little thought, but I'm not entirely sure what it is yet!!!
<br/>
I might take that idea, run with it, but sit it aside for later.
<br/>
Assuming we're now doing a weekly update (which...   ... looks like it!) I'll use that idea next week.
<br/>
<br/>
Seed + ground = vine.. nice enough idea, but like the dynamite idea, it could end up anywhere on the level, and you'd have to be wary of where it ends up lest the player cheat your level!
<br/>
..
<br/>
BUT..
<br/>
Little sprouted speed, stuck in the ground + Watering can = vine ... that'd be more managable.
<br/>
I'm not sure it'd look right inside Platdude's little world, though.  I'll have a play with some sprites, and see what comes up.. (out of the ground!)
<br/>
<br/>
Dark + Torch... well...   Platdude's already lit up.  He doesn't carry anything, it just seemed like a good idea to not leave him completely stranded!  <a class="postlink" href="http://jnk.homedns.org/light.png" target="_blank">See here</a>
<br/>
He can see enough, but.. not enough!
<br/>
<br/>
Whip/Gun/Yada yada.. The grid like base of JNKPlat means that weapons aren't really all that useful!  Sorry.. You might've noticed that darts can be tricky to jump over!  That'll be the underlying grid!
<br/>
<br/>
Same goes for ropeswings.  As nice as they'd look, they'd be a preset swing, on a preset path, and slightly dodgy due to the grid thing.. 
<br/>
I'll try my best to get a decent ropeswing going, but..  couple the grid with the fact that it'd need a fair few sprites to look good...  might not work out!  (The lighting system, as unconvincing as it is, still managed to leave a mark on the game!)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For the record, the "Treasure chest" idea initially was..
<br/>
You'd get to one, it'd open, occasionally it'd have a sphere, but randomly it'd have a bomb.
<br/>
I decided to remove that idea, though.. if the chests were random, how would the "Gems collected" thing count them?!
<br/>
If they weren't random.. ..  Kinda kills the point of 'em!  May as well be a gem!
<br/>
<br/>
Bah, humbug..
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is that everything?
<br/>
:blink:  I'm half asleep!
<br/>
<br/>
OK, plenty more to do, things to play with, more to come.
<br/>
woot!

unless there are blocks which can never be destroyed, like metal blocks... the user could line walls out of metal they didn't want destroyed and the rest the dynamite could blow up. this leaves for multiple ways to complete a level or ways to reach areas depending on what the radius of the explosion is. on the other hand there could be blocks that are partially crumbling, and dynamite finishes the job. so not *all* blocks could be blown up. but then that does make the bomb do things which some would say the dynamite should also do - blow up all blocks around it.

depending on how you want to do this, you could simply change the score board to read "items" or "collectables" an then allow the user an area of the editor that just has things to collect. be it gold, money, gems etc. however, this are just flash and really not needed, the blue orb seems to be a middle ground which does work very well. it provides a goal for each level without going crazy with all the possibilities of things to collect.

Little sprouted speed, stuck in the ground + Watering can = vine ... that'd be more managable.

I'm not sure it'd look right inside Platdude's little world, though.  I'll have a play with some sprites, and see what comes up.. (out of the ground!)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
again going with the metal block idea here, a special block with dirt on it where you can plant a seed. this way the user can't just plant seeds anywhere they like, or on the other hand a block with a seedling in it already, and the user has to water it some how. this might be a way to implement water into the game. not just a watering can but what about a room of water trapped behind a door. flip a switch and water comes out, flows through channels of blocks and lets certain plants grow allowing the user to reach areas they could not before. however, this might be WAY to much work for something that would lose its "coolness" effect after a few levels.

ok that looks really really sweet! it reminds of this one game i use to play on the apple IIe, the lantern made that same effect. does the light go out at times though? if it doesn't, then right now it is just something sweet to look at. but if you walk through the levels without charging ahead you will always be able to see what is coming. that wasn't my initial thought when i suggested light/dark scenarios. i was thinking of a way where you had to turn on the light to get past certain areas, if you didn't the area was dark and you would hit a pit fall, and some lights worked on timers causing you to be dexterous in your methods. anyway to work a concept like that into the mix, if it isn?t already?

say no more, i complete understand. a zelda clone i worked on with someone in college was on a 1" grid. it limited some things and we had to learn to work around them in Flash 7pro. This makes me wonder how you accomplished the bat movements and i can't wait to see it.

You'd get to one, it'd open, occasionally it'd have a sphere, but randomly it'd have a bomb.

<br/>
<br/>
well you would need some type of dynamic global variable that you can constantly update so the score box knows how many blue orbs appeared on that level (taking into account random encounters). however, this messes with the ability to let the user know how many blue orbs they can get total before even starting the levels, which in the end means you would need to take the number off of the score box until all levels were beat... hmm not sure i like that.
<br/>
<br/>
Bah, humbug.. indeed!!
<br/>
<br/>
i hope all my banter and ideas aren't causing you to not work on other projects. if we just discussed for the next 3 months and we had a new release for xmas i wouldn't mind. also i'm willing to beta test anything along the way if you didn't want to publicly release it. we can talk privately about that if it is something you are interested in pursuing.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Dy-no-mite!</span>
<br/>
One of the tricks of the game is to allow each block to operate, more or less independently of the others.  That way, any objects can be placed anywhere in the level, and can still work.
<br/>
The idea of having TNT Crate + Plunger might seem a good idea, but.. as far as the editor's concerned, I'd have to find some way to tie those two objects together.
<br/>
You might have 3 crates, 3 plungers.
<br/>
How would it know which plunger works with which crate?
<br/>
So.. That probably wouldn't work.. Or, at least, not without adding a whole extra layer of data onto the levels, and extra fix-ups to the editor..
<br/>
<br/>
Now, if the crate had a plunger on top, that'd work.
<br/>
But you couldn't push the plunger yourself.  obviously.. or you'd get blown to bits!
<br/>
You could drop a block onto the thing, but then you're always having to make levels with blocks on walls right above "just the right spot", and you're kind of limiting things again.
<br/>
<br/>
If I had a timer on the plunger..
<br/>
..
<br/>
Move create, hit the top of it, run..
<br/>
That could work.
<br/>
But drawing that in 8x8 pixels?   eek!
<br/>
<br/>
I'll see what I can do!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Sprouts!</span>
<br/>
Still not sure on the sprouted seed thing. Except to say that plants look really weird in platdude's wonderfully cubic world! 
<br/>
Your water-rushing through the level idea is probably a bit chaotic..  In a grid!
<br/>
I'm currently considering a ladder that shoots out of the ground when a (another!) plunger is hit.. Perhaps even one that flies up, hits a brick above, then slowly starts to decend back where it came from...?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Flaming Torches!</span>
<br/>
So far, the light's permanently there..   Another plunger?!?!  Blimey!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Bat's movement</span>
<br/>
You've be pleasantly surprised by the bats simplicity!  They go right, then down, then left, then up!  Nice and easy!  Nothing magical.. Just moving about!
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This link is ALWAYS the latest version.  .. Even if I bother to update it without telling folk ;)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Updates</span>
<br/>
Extra stuff, menu tweak, editor fixes, yada yada.
<br/>
And, I think (!) I finally got rid of that random "&lt;-- start" that kept popping up on the menu!!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Levels</span>
<br/>
6 packs included, 67 levels total!
<br/>
I've placed Another World's levels in as Another World.. Seemed to fit!
<br/>
Sir Voe's are in as Sir Voe's Simple Set, even though they aren't that simple!!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Midway</span>
<br/>
If you get halfway through a level pack (and the middle's at least 5 levels in!) you'll be able to restart from the Midway by hitting B on the menu, instead of A.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">DLDI vs Non-DLDI</span>
<br/>
Folk who don't have DLDI will be able to play.. Woot!  But they won't be able to save.  Awww..  
<br/>
Those with DLDI should stick the JNKPLAT/ directory into their root so they can save.
<br/>
<br/>
Blocks are listed in the Level Editor Readme file that's now included.

The crate/stuck for no reason bug appeared some time yesterday, (or at least, that's the first I noticed them, anyway!) maybe as a result of me hacking in those new TNT crates..  I noticed the bug, wondered why it was happening, and inevitably decided that it'd do in the meantime!!  Very odd bug.. 
<br/>
Seems to happen when you're between a crate and a wall.  <a class="postlink" href="http://jnk.homedns.org/whereorwhat.png" target="_blank">Not sure why!</a>

<br/>
<br/>
You're loading it into the editor, aren't you?
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.. The switch to editor grabs the level as-is.. So in a level with instantly moving object, it would indeed grab them moved.  I hadn't noticed before..  Most of my levels don't need tweaking, since they get over-tested (By which I mean over-and-over-and-over, hence the lack of my own made levels!!) in the editor first ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I think I'll get it to reload the level data when you switch to the editor in future.  Should stop that..
<br/>
<br/>
I might also create a nice neat little .exe that'll load in your mylevs file and let you view/shuffle/delete the levels... (since the notepad thing doesn't seem to be workng too well!)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Those little one-use Shields should be added.  They sound useful.
<br/>
Maybe the old Jetpack that got left behind a while ago.. Lets you hold an extra button (X!) and move left/right.
<br/>
<br/>
Gotta think of more inventory stuff, and also.. as always.. gotta add more blocks :D

the red sliding block can not be dropped on the ladder plunger and have it set it off like with the invisible block plunger. --should't it work the same way?
<br/>
<br/>
if you click on an editor item on an area with more options, then switch to a section with less options the blue 4-corner outline stays in the blank space where an item was on the previous screen.
<br/>
<br/>
finally, when you hold "L" to erase you get a green bar across the screen, (bug?) which gets in the way of the view of blocks/items on that same line.
<br/>
<br/>
i'm still toying with new levels, i'm loving the dark/light feature! on the next release can you remove level 6 from my levels?

Now, the ladder plunger thing's a little tricky..  I'm not entirely sure that I could ever drop the ladders back again, once the plunger's been removed...  If that's ok, then I could do that.. but.. Seems weird given that the door plungers reverse, rather than ... just stop working completely!
<br/>
<br/>
I'll fiddle..
<br/>
<br/>
The editor blue-4 thing has been annoying me for a while, but whenever I head into the code I tend to forget about it!   Now it's written down, I should manage to remember to fix it ;)
<br/>
<br/>
The Trigger green bar's there to remind you where the top of the bottom screen is, so you can get things lined up without annoying the player with the middle of the two-screens!   I'll do something about it.. Maybe have a "If cursor's there, go away!" thing.

i never tried to remove a block from the plunger, i had always assumed the plunger would be permanently forced down. however, that is because i always had it set up to drop the block and not drag it. last night i made a quick level and dropped a block from half way up the screen onto the ladder plunger. i naturally would have assumed that it would break the plunger and leave the ladder sticking up. if you can get it working the other way that would be nice. i wanted to do some levels where you have to get the block to the right place, then drag it and drop it onto the ladder plunger to reach high ground. .... well that?s the basic idea anyways =)
<br/>
<br/>
are you going to update the bat for animation at all? it seems to just glide around like a remote control bat. i was curious if you had plans to add moving wings/1 or 2 frames of animation to it. it isn?t really required, i just thought it would polish it all off very nicely.

This is only useful to folk who like to make levels, so homebrew sites needn't bother posting it... because I've got sod all from them thus far..
<br/>
<br/>
It's a nice simple windows .exe that's pretty much made for myself, and Another World.. he really really wants to delete level 6!!
<br/>
<br/>
Shove the files into the directory where you currently have your mylevs.lev, run it, move the levels about, hit delete (the one on your keyboard!!) to delete the levels you don't want, and then tap save  (the one on the screen....  with your mouse!) to save..
<br/>
<br/>
Saving also keeps a timestamped backup, so if you suddenly want to resurrect a level, it'll be in them....  somewhere!!

However 
<br/>
(sad face)
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Due to a couple of annoying weekend factors + me trying desperately to get a GameAWeek done in the time I had, (And it's really not all that good, either!!) I've not really gotten a release ready version of JNKPlat done.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Booo!
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry folks..
<br/>
<br/>
1) XP Drive died on it's ass, leading me to... nnngh.. have to use Vista (ARGH!) 
<br/>
Everything important's still safe, but.. I do now have to use Vista (ARGH!) 
<br/>
But don't worry, I can use the PC downstairs to do the DS Compiling, since that's still XP and not Vista (ARGH!)
<br/>
So everything's fine.  Once I get back to JNKPlat, it'll run just fine..
<br/>
<br/>
2) And then I bought an Xbox 360.  Seems that ?129 was the clincher for me!
<br/>
Played PacMan CE a LOT...
<br/>
Played a couple of other games.. 
<br/>
And then played PacMan CE a lot more..
<br/>
(And will undoubtedly play more whilst waiting for some games to turn up!!)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, whilst I'm sorting out my whole system, and playing about with the Xbox, you'll all have to sit patiently and wait for the next release.
<br/>
I <span style="font-style: italic">could</span> release what I've tweaked this week, but...  It's not much so far!
<br/>
For the record, though, Sir Voe..  The Bat thing was in the loader, only.  If they worked fine before saving, they'll work fine when loaded into the newer one.  They just don't load ok in the last one!!  (They load fine in the Level Shuffler, though!)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK.  Time to get back to stuff!

News/devwise, I've pushed myself into making a rather larger than normal project, this week..  Mostly because if I decide to make it a 2 week project, I'll have nothing new for the site this week, and so I'll have to actually make TWO games this week!  So.. forget that!  I'll work on the larger project instead!
<br/>
<br/>
So, again, might have to be a quick "end of the week, whatever I can" type of update, this week..
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, suggestions are welcome.  Keep 'em coming.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, a request, or rather, a trial!!

<br/>
It's a picture of a level.
<br/>
(It's not a real level!  I just randomly made it in the past couple of minutes)
<br/>
<br/>
Take piccy, load into paintshop/photoshop/paint/gimp/whatever, and ...
<br/>
Just give it a play with.
<br/>
See if you can come up with a nice new theme for the game.
<br/>
It might be nice to have a few different graphical packs in the game, and..  well.. I just love how it looks, and can't really come up with anything!!  So.  If you're bored, load it up, play away.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think that's probably because of the small filesize..  It seems to pop up randomly depending on which files I'm trying to get.
<br/>
<br/>
GameaWeek news, I significantly reduced the amount of work needed on the project, via the method of replacing lots and lots of required animation with a single object that moves across the screen ;)
<br/>
<br/>
So, with that reduction working a treat, I should be able to get some nice JNKPlat work done.
<br/>
I'll take SirVoe's image, work that into the system, and then play with my own other styles, and.. if other folk want to try.. theirs, too.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure, though, exactly how I'll work them into the game... 
<br/>
I could make it so that.. Level 1 = pack 1, 2=2, 3=3 and so on.
<br/>
I could make it so that it randomly picks a pack whilst loading a level.
<br/>
I could make each adventure have a pack.
<br/>
Or I could start adding extra info into the adventure files, so you can pick a gfx pack to use on each level..
<br/>
..
<br/>
Dunno.

Great to hear it was of some use to you. 
<br/>
Here's an Aztec Jungle type look I was messing with: <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/148749407/platlooknature.zip.html" target="_blank">http://rapidshare.com/files/148749407/platlooknature.zip.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It has a couple of different wall/ground tiles, because I wasn't sure which I preffered. Hope you can use something from it. 
<br/>
For skin selection, I think a menu that allows you to either choose a permanent skin, or set it to shuffle through them from level to level would work well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think I prefer the "Land/Grass" floor tile as opposed to the .. um.. swirly goop..?  The swirly goop makes the screen look a little messy, whereas generic sonic-y greenhill floor looks quite a lot cleaner.
<br/>
I'll have to sort out some method of differentiating tops, though, to add nice green tops to things..  Shouldn't be too hard.. I've done that plenty of times before!
<br/>
<br/>
And, yeah.. I think I've pretty much settled on just shoving it into a menu, too.  It'd be nice to have specific levels look a little different, but..  What's the point in doing all this if it's only going to affect one or two!?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
@MarkZilla.  So far, all the levels are being bundled up as we go, and packaged into the next release.  Not only does this save you having to go "Pickup the levels", but it also means that those without DLDI can still play 'em all.  (Because I had a Games'n'Music for ages, and I know how annoying that is!!  90% of my games give a monkey..  Arcade Slots is a bit of a pain...)
<br/>
<br/>
Once I've stopped doing these frequent releases, I might have to go about setting up a website to collect them, but in the meantime we're quite safe here!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://AGameAWeek.com" target="_blank">A Game A Week.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">New version will be posted tomorrow, but other than SirVoe's new gfx, there really isn't much else new.
<br/>
Thanks to Sir Voe again for the gfx.. Your name's on the titlescreen!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've tweaked the blocks..
<br/>
I've tried not to break anything, but a few things might've accidentally borked.
<br/>
<br/>
Previously..
<br/>
If you pushed a block over ladders, it would stop at the ladders. (or other such objects that you can pass through)
<br/>
If you <span style="font-weight: bold">pulled</span> a block over ladders, you could pull it right through, leaving nothing where the ladders were.
<br/>
Odd 2-way nonsense = baffling.
<br/>
<br/>
Now..
<br/>
I decided that making it push/pullable through the ladders would be the better method, since.. well, I've actually assumed that the whole time, so.  That's what I went for!
<br/>
If you've assumed ladders/others will BLOCK the blocks, you might have to go back into your levels and do a bit of tweaking..
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've also made moving blocks a little more solid.
<br/>
Or, rather, I've made it so that a moving block doesn't instantly erase it's previous location, and instead does it at the end of it's move..
<br/>
<br/>
Previously..
<br/>
Map becomes 0, sprite moves, new location becomes Block
<br/>
<br/>
Now..
<br/>
Map becomes invisible wall, sprite moves, invisible wall removed, new location becomes block.
<br/>
<br/>
It basically makes them a little more solid than they were.  The "block on a conveyor belt, Platdude wanders through" bug is gone, as is the "drag block, dart still hits you!" bug..
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Um.. 
<br/>
I'm trying to remember what else I did..?
<br/>
uuum...
<br/>
I still have to add stuff to the inventory!  That's just as unused as it was!
<br/>
And, I haven't really built any new levels, so I've that to do, too.
<br/>

It's Platdude's theme, and it's been banging around for quite a while, as well as peeking it's way into some of my other games.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a good old Amiga .mod format track, and loops incessantly until you shut it up ;)  (And uses a heck of a lot less space than a rubbish MP3 does.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">jay: i'm working on an article for a major site which can't be named at this forum. i have a few quick questions that i hope you could help me with.
<br/>
<br/>
1) jnkplat was originally coded for the drunken coders compo (x-mas edition) and not entered, then 9 months later you recoded it and released it as jnkplat 08?
<br/>
<br/>
2) can you talk a little about the mechanics behind the scene. how the engine works, what its based on, is it a 1"x1" grid system, etc?
<br/>
<br/>
3) can you provide me with a main menu screen shot for the latest build both top and bottom screens? it doesn't appear to load correctly for me in no$gba 2.5c. the middle button and "B" option are missing.
<br/>
<br/>
off topic a bit from my questions, what are the chances of adding the x-mas trees back into the level editor? also i noticed you never did fix the misplaced blue selection icon (if you select then move to a new set of options, the blue icon is in the wrong place at times, where items aren't), and you were going to add back in the old switches from the x-mas build but never did, just decided they weren't needed?
<br/>
<br/>
i really appreciate any information and help you can give me for the 1-3 questions above. 
<br/>
<br/>
cheers!

<br/>
<br/>
No!
<br/>
JNKPlat's been recoded over and over and over since about 1997, when I went to college.
<br/>
Before the DS, Platdude had no animation, at all.  He moved 1 block for every keypress.  I liked it that way, because whenever a bat's chasing you, you could quicky-tappity-tap to run like the clappers!
<br/>
When it came time to do the DS edition, I realised without any kind of file access for my cart (way, way back before chishm's DLDI wonderfulness) I'd have to put something BIG, NEW and FRESH into the game, if I was going to leave out any way to make new levels..
<br/>
<br/>
I wondered about it for ages before thinking "I suppose I could animate him...."  and so the animation was thrown in..
<br/>
<br/>
That edition was made for the fun of it..  The Xmas Drunken Coders release used the same engine with the trees and snow thrown in, and a new set of levels.  Wasn't too much work, and I didn't expect to win.. at all..   What I certainly didn't expect was to be cast down because the game was too hard.   ...
<br/>
..  
<br/>
Seriously!?!
<br/>
<br/>
This version is a complete rewrite, because, not only did I want things to run a little smoother (there were issues in the last one that would appear once folk could play with the editor!), but I wanted to be 100% sure I'd bother to put an editor in there!  This edition started with the editor, and worked it's way up...
<br/>
<br/>
A lengthier/picturesque/download-full history of JNKPlat is <a class="postlink" href="http://jayenkai.socoder.net/?page_id=2" target="_blank">here</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">2) can you talk a little about the mechanics behind the scene. how the engine works, what its based on, is it a 1"x1" grid system, etc? </span>
<br/>
<br/>
Very very simply, it's a grid. Each block is a number, 0 = nothing, 1 = bar, 2 = wall, 3 = gem, etc.. 
<br/>
Each block is static, and so is platdude.
<br/>
I make little functions which ask if things are certain objects.. Like IsWall(x,y) would ask if the object is a wall/blocking item.
<br/>
Then if the player hits left, and IsWall(playerX-1,playerY) then Platdude can't go left.
<br/>
Similarly, if there's no floor beneath, he can fall... But if he's under a bar, and holding B, then he can't fall..
<br/>
Simple simple checks like that.
<br/>
<br/>
If he IS moving, there's a little movement animation thrown in between him being <span style="font-style: italic">here</span> and being <span style="font-style: italic">there</span>, but otherwise without the animations the game would still be nice and super-chunky.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">3) can you provide me with a main menu screen shot for the latest build both top and bottom screens? it doesn't appear to load correctly for me in no$gba 2.5c. the middle button and "B" option are missing.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
That's not a No$GBA fault.. It's because it can't use DLDI, so there's no point in having the editor there..    I bothered to do that!!  And, again the "B" option's missing because it hasn't saved beyond the midway point.
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://jnk.homedns.org/jnkplatmenu.png" target="_blank">Why no images allowed!?  Bah, Humbug..</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Xmas Trees, and Switches</span>
<br/>
Yeah, I never did those, did I.
<br/>
..  Actually, the trees and switches are both (still) in the gfx sheets, I just haven't bothered to stick them in the engine..   Also, that "switch gfx mode" thing still flickers like crazy when you tap it, and I don't really know wtf that silly blue marker's still there.. I was sure I'd removed it!
<br/>
I have stated that this is the last one, though.. So, I'm not sure if "Bug fixes" really warrant "NEW EDITION!!".. Um....
<br/>
...
<br/>
*shrugs*
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to ask more questions!  Always happy to help!
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
if you add back the trees, switches, and bug fixes i would release it as perhaps a v.2 or something.
