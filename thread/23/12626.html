    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Whenever MoonShell starts up I am presented with a message "an error was detected while trying to access the disc or a file." MoonShell continues to load and I can do everything in MoonShell. Is it normal to always get an error message when starting up MoonShell?
<br/>
<br/>
This is my hardware setup:
<br/>
<ul>Nintendo DS with firmware version 1
<br/>
GBA Movie Player v2 (Chishm's firmware v2.11)
<br/>
FlashMe v7 stealth
<br/>
SanDisk ultra II 256MB CF card (Also tried with Lexar card)</ul>
<br/>
Some homebrew boots to white screens, while if I boot them directly (using 0xtob's DevLauncher) they works fine. A few have some graphic corruption (discolored or missing) when they are launched from MoonShell. An example of this is LOCKJAW where the bottom screen has many colored pixels instead of a black screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

...Oooh, I just realized the dream fix to the sound sync issues in DPG playback: A sound offsetting interface. Perhaps pressing a button could pause only the audio (and another button could do the opposite) so that one could get the audio properly aligned with the video on the fly. Would be quite handy, methinks...<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

You don't have to explicitly tell Moonshell to shutdown for resume to work, you can just power off, as it saves its location every 5 seconds or so.  It's really handy as I use my DS as my car stereo, and was getting fed up off winding my way through hour long mixes just to find where I was listening to last.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Found a bug: When an image thumbnail is on the bottom screen, if you press B to return to the previous directory, the thumbnail stays on the screen but the clock appears overtop of it. Touching the clock restores the background image, but sometimes this makes the clock disappear.

<br/>
Also, it looks like the screens are still on when the lid is closed.

[edit] Just tried the MIDI plugin for the first time and I get an interesting message:
<br/>
This sound font is very compact. Install full sound font from website ????????????DL?????
<br/>
<a href="http://mdxonline.dyndns.org" target="_blank">http://mdxonline.dyndns.org</a>
<br/>
<br/>
What's interesting about it is when I touch the window, "lume:x50" appears next to the question marks; it's copying the "Volume" text from the progress window below. Even changes as the volume is adjusted. Seems like some sort of corruption bug. It then froze when I tried to play an SPC, but after turning it off and on again it played fine.
<br/>
<br/>
I got the mspv20_midrcp_sf16bit_sc88promap.7z file and now it displays fine and sounds better, but still sounds quite a bit different from how Winamp plays them. It's also very quiet. I can post some files for comparison... does Moonlight still post here?
<br/>
<br/>
[edit again] It froze twice more when opening an SPC while an MP3 was playing (as opposed to opening an SPC while playing an MP3 the first time), and again opening an SPC right after turning it on. These files usually play fine, so there's either a bug in loading plugins, or my GBAMP is acting up again in a very coincidental manner (still managing to open other files and start up fine).
<br/>
<br/>
I also notice ? (accented e) shows up correctly in the directory listing, but shows up as a question mark in the title bar. That is, a directory named "Pok?mon RBY" appears as "POK?1" in the title of the file browser (not even "POK?~1"). This is with Windows Unicode (second character set option in setup.exe).
<br/>
Other directories show up wrong too: Super Mario Bros 2 -&gt; SUAFF2~1, Super Mario Bros 3 -&gt; SUBFF2~1, Super Mario Kart -&gt; SU907A~1, Super Mario Land -&gt; SU973A~1, Super Mario World -&gt; SU48AB~1. Super Mario Bros and Super Mario RPG (probably because it was one of the first created) show correctly as SUPERM~4 and SUPERM~1.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using a SuperCard SD adapter (the rumble one, which appears to have been a bit of an evil buy) and I cannot get Moonshell to run at all, I simply get white screens. I have a FlashCart that I can try it on, but the real purpose of me buying the SD adapter in the first place was to get MoonShell or something similar working happily.
<br/>
<br/>
I am using a non-flashed DS lite, and am using a PassCard3 to do the loading thing. I am actually using an SDmicro card, but in an SD (standard) adapter, which appears to be working fine. (I can boot regular homebrew.)
<br/>
<br/>
I first tried using the "SCSD" images, neither of which worked. I then proceeded to copy every image on the thing to try my luck, and still not a one worked. Has anyone else had this sort of issue? I may be doing something drastically wrong of course, this is my first time trying to do anything like this... ^_^
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you can offer aid. By the way, I am using the latest (stable) version of moonshell which took me 2 hours to download over dial-up, thank you very much.

Tell me about it. The way I do it is to use WINE (http://www.winehq.com) in order to run setup.exe and pray that it works.

DLDI is a wonderfull thing that means developers dont have to worry about what device they are making their thing for.
<br/>
<br/>

The image viewer won't open 32-bit BMP files, even though /MOONSHL/SKIN/FBARCUR.BMP and FBARPLAY.BMP are 32-bit. If there is already code to read them, why can't I view them?

When I encoded a DPG file, at certain points in the movie, the video becomes very pixellated and may freeze for several seconds. It's similar to the mosaic effect seen on SNES games. There doesn't seem to be a pattern to when it will occurr, but it will happen at the same place every time if I watch the movie multiple times. Other movies do not have this problem, but the video does occasionally freeze for a few seconds.

<br/>
<br/>
I found a bug in SPC playing, and possibly other sound code. When I drag windows around while playing music, the sound pops and skips a lot. This is normal since both operations are using a lot of CPU power. However, if I drag too much, the sound hardware actually gets turned off (it pops just like when you turn the system off, and doesn't when you actually do turn it off) and the system freezes.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I've been working on a skin and I was just thinking how great it would be if each window's client area could have its own background image. For that matter, what is client.bmp used for? I put an image there and I don't see it used anywhere.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I noticed if sysicon.bmp is 16-bit, the image will be garbled. I'm not sure if it's supposed to support 16-bit images, but since this is the DS's native format, it would make sense to do so.
<br/>
<br/>
[edit] I also noticed fbarcur.bmp and fbarplay.bmp are alpha-blended against the background. However, it looks like the alpha channel is hardcoded; I can save my own images, but it's still using the same alpha as the old ones (opaque at the left, fading to translucent around the right and then back to opaque). Is it possible to have it use the alpha channels within the image files? This is even worse with fbarplay.bmp where the opacity forms a pattern that isn't there in my replacement image.
<br/>
<br/>
[another edit] I figured out the translucency, you have to save as PNG and convert them using an included program. However, I can't seem to find a good way to take a screenshot. The included screenshot tool is broken; it always makes a shot of the old default theme. My camera seems to hate the DS screen (comes out really blurry), and my scanner either produces a black-and-white image (with backlight on) or a really dark one (with backlight off). I might have to try an emulator, but I know nothing of getting FAT to work in those. :-/<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also, the volume control is not very responsive when playing DPG movies. If I press X it may not do anything or it may decrease the volume by up to 50%. Y does the same.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I thought of two nice feature ideas:
<br/>
1) For music and movies, pause/next/previous/etc buttons on the touch screen. Apparently faulty L buttons are a common problem, and when you're trying to pause and it just won't respond, it gets quite annoying. Also, it would look more like other popular media players.
<br/>
2) On-screen display during DPG files, using a text-mode layer above the video layer. Use the A button or D-pad to cycle displays of things like current/remaining time, length, volume, file name, maybe even subtitles. This would save having to swap screens to see the volume level.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I posted this one in another thread but I'll copy it here too:
<br/>
3) Allow each window to have its own background image, rather than one image for all windows.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, I'm sure you can already convert them with no extra effort..depends on the Directshow filters you have installed (Nero uses Directshow in it's player, so I presume it would convert just fine as DPGenc uses them as well).  This is perhaps not quite what you meant, but if you can choose a default audio and a default sub as you can with a video container format like Matroska, it should work just fine for you and use whatever you set it to.<br/>_________________<br/>----

Have you tried using the DPG2 format? There is no difference between DPG2 and 3 other than the possibility to encode the audio in an ogg vorbis stream, which currently does not work good during playback. Could you try an older dpgenc or try batchDPG to produce an DPG2 file and try again?

When a hex number is printed without spaces between the byte, it's probably a single int. In GBA and DS, a single int will be printed with its bytes backwards because Nintendo has configured its ARM7 and ARM9 processors little-endian.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

That would only really be useful if your LED lights died or something.  The DS hardware is only capable of reporting two states, "battery is good" and "battery is low" and it can't report a percentage like the PSP can.  For a demonstration of the only real way to report the battery state, try LMP-ng and look at the battery indicator when your DS LEDs are green and red.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It seems a problem how the GBAMPSD initializes itself. So it was never solved, only by (as you noted) an intermediate application (e.g. moonshell 1.6), see <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=13043&amp;highlight=" target="_blank">this old thread</a>

No. SSEQ Files are like MIDI Files, they contain only the tracks, notes and instrument references. This is similar to MIDI Files, so you need a Sound Bank (.SBNK) and .SWAV (SWave Files) or .SWAR (ARC compressed SWave Files) for each SSEQ File (of course, SBNKs and SWAVs/SWARs can be shared between different SSEQ Files).<br/>_________________<br/>Equipment:

<br/>
I don't see the link between "No" for an answer and "you need sound banks and instrument wave files". I don't see the problem at all, cause you can just create three files on the flash filesystem:
<br/>
BGM1.sseq
<br/>
BGM1.sbnk
<br/>
BGM1.swar
<br/>
<br/>
And let moonshell autodetect the latter two, just like you would with separate subtitle files. Since you're getting the files from your game yourself, it's unlikely you won't have all three of them together anyway. You can also play .sseqs without bank or wavetable files btw, but they'll sound odd. Another idea is you could pack them together in a .tgz, and call the file BGM1.ssez, but that would require more effort on moonshell's end than simply having three loose files. If moonshell already has MIDI support, I doubt SSEQ is going to be much of a problem. It's the same shit in a different format. In fact SSEQ should be easier to play because of its streamlined for playback file structure.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the whole moral of the story is nobody's been able to get .sseq sounding quite right on anything other than the original hardware or an emulator like no$gba. So the solution then is obviously not to try to get it to sound right on anything other than the DS, but simply play it on the DS where it belongs!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i have been toying with the custom clocks and came across a few questions.
<br/>
<br/>
clock clk_vu just doesn't work correctly. the date does not appear to function. not sure what the issue is with this, has anyone had it working?
<br/>
<br/>
the temp never seems to appear no matter the clock i try. the preview inside the clock plugin tool has the temp set to 'show' and everything set up correctly including one of the free fonts. does the temp work on the custom clocks?
<br/>
<br/>
cheers,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Couple of  questions:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Does Moonshell 1.71 support unicode by default? I downloaded a version that does, but have had others that don't support unicode.
<br/>
<br/>
2) If Moonshell 1.71 open source? If so, can someone give me a link to download the source? Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
