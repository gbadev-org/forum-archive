    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Version 0.9 is out!  This is a complete rewrite due to an "uninstall" of original source (curse you uninst.exe).  Alot of changes and improvements were made so take a look.  I've tried to implement as many request features as possible.  Thanks and hope you enjoy the update!
<br/>
<br/>
CHANGES
<br/>
-------
<br/>
Version 0.9 - 08/20/2008
<br/>
-Updated GUI:  Can now load backgrounds and settings from FAT
<br/>
-Removed DLDS files:  Can now read DLDI from FAT
<br/>
-Added support for AKRPG NAND: If you have an AKRPG just boot from the SD and you will have access to both
<br/>
-Added option to boot into GBA mode
<br/>
-Changed/Added some controls
<br/>
-Added support for MP3 playback
<br/>
-Added file size display
<br/>
-Added multiple copy/delete support
<br/>
-Added display of copy speed
<br/>
-Added display of current date and time
<br/>
-The file list is now sorted alphabetically
<br/>
-Renaming works now by copying file and deleting source
<br/>
-Booting now works on the extra FAT systems
<br/>
-Fixed pause when lid closed
<br/>
-Fixed compatibility with M3/G6 Real
<br/>
-Various other bug fixes
<br/>
<br/>
DualSlot Browser lets you copy and boot files to and from the filesystems available.  That means if you have two FAT based flashcarts inserted, you will have access to both!  With this boot feature you can boot into GBA mode or boot NDS homebrew files.  The boot function Auto-DLDI patches for whatever filesystem its on.  So if you boot a homebrew on the Slot-2 it will have access to the Slot-2 FAT.  Also with the new MP3 Player feature you can build your own playlist or have DSBrowser search the available FAT for MP3s.  All MP3s found will be added to a new playlist.  MP3s can be played while exploring the apps features!
<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions and comments are welcome.  Thanks to all that helped!

I'm a noob when it comes to hosting downloads.  This is actually my first time.  Megaupload was one of the first sites that came up when I googled for "free file upload".  Any suggestions on a better site?  Also thanks for getting me started DM.  Hopefully this can become as popular as DSO!

MechaBouncer:
<br/>
<br/>
This works because there is two DLDI sections: DLDI/DLDS.  The DLDS was created by cybermind on this very forum!  The original thread can be found here:  <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=12001&amp;start=255" target="_blank">DLDI topic</a>.  I probably wouldn't have been able to do this without his work.  So a big thanks goes to him.  Chishm said he is working on implementing this officially into libfat.  That way more developers can use this feature.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Call fatInitDefault() as usual. To then load the extra drivers, call fatLoadExtraInterfaces (FAT_DEFAULT_CACHE_PAGES, FAT_MAXIMUM_PARTITIONS-1). 
<br/>
<br/>
FAT_MAXIMUM_PARTITIONS is currently set to 4, you may use less if you prefer (eg, 1 (for 2 partitions), as you suggested) . 
<br/>
<br/>
The cache size is measured in 512B pages. I suggest you stick with the default unless you do many random read/writes or you are short on memory. In the first case, increase it, in the second case, decrease it (but not below 2).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I just thought of the reason this could be happening. In all the places that you are allocating space for filenames, replace 256 with 768. Filenames can be up to three times as big now, and you'll get stack corruption if you don't have enough space.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

You'll be safe with MAXPATHLEN. chdir and getcwd both use buffers of size MAXPATHLEN. libfat uses 768 <span style="font-weight: bold">char</span> buffers, which is less than MAXPATHLEN's 1024. In this case, all buffers have type char*, since they are using UTF-8 and not UTF-32.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I figured out what is wrong. If your card uses the Chishm loader because it is not an EZ4,M3,SC, or GBAMP, the chishm loader reads DLDI data but not DLDS because the DLDI string says cybermind instead of chishm. I will make a fix for this today.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
1) I DLDI patch the .nds file for my Slot-1 card (CycloDS Evo, no patching, skipped this step)
<br/>
2) I rename the .dlds file that is named as my Slot-2 card to "dldspatch.dlds", in this case, rename "Max Media Dock CF.dlds" to "dldspatch.dlds"
<br/>
3) Then, I drag the .nds file for my Cyclo onto the .bat file.
<br/>
4) Finally, I copy it onto my CycloDS and run it with my MMD plugged in.
<br/>
<br/>
That's what I did, and my MMD doesn't show up using the Slot-1 .nds file. Is it just because the MMD isn't supported or am I doing something wrong? :S</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

3 things
<br/>
<br/>
1. renaming doesn't seem working properly? (i thought i remember you saying you knew this, but i couldn't find the post so maybe i'm mistaken)
<br/>
<br/>
2. if you the filelist extends past the bottom screen, and you are using left/right on the control pad to scroll faster, the cursor will stall when it hits the bottom. To browse to the rest of the files, you must press down button again to bring up the next page of the list.
<br/>
<br/>
3. i was a bit confused with the control system at first (Pressing start to access commands), but i'm getting used to it now. it works good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SqAWK and LocalToast:
<br/>
<br/>
It seems to be a problem with the way some autopatch systems work.  The way to work around this is to boot the homebrew from your Slot-2.  It will work the same booted from either cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Tonopie:
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, I'll look into GBA_NDS_FAT.  That idea came across me for a split second some time ago, but I never tried it.  I thought LIBFAT and GBA_NDS_FAT couldn't be compiled together.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I've manage to get Bootlib to boot from a DLDS cart, but it only works if the DLDI patch isn't present.  Now I just have to figure out how to get it to know which one to choose.  Right now it tries to boot from the DLDI first and if it fails it freezes.  Will it be possible to get it to try the other cart if one fails?
<br/>
<br/>

I have two of those problems fixed for the next release.  I want to try the things mentioned above before I release it though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry for the lack of news guys but I've been working on a pretty major update to DSBrowser when I lost all my projects source.  I'm working on recovering the "uninstalled" files but it's not looking good.  I can release my last build as a preview.  It's full of bugs but if you'll like to try it let me know.

<br/>
Chishm:  Thanks to the help of wolped on the NeoForums, I've found out with more testing that fatLoadExtraInterface works just as intended.  The problem is my hardware isn't compatible for some unknown reason.  Do you know what may be causing the problem?  I'm developing using a EZ-V in Slot-1 and a EZIV Deluxe (32MB RAM) in Slot-2.
<br/>
<br/>
I planned on releasing two versions on my next release. One that uses a secondary DLDI from FAT and the other that uses DLDS if the first version doesn't work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
