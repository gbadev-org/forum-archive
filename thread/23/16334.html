    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was playing for the last two developing a ray tracer for DS. It turns out to be pretty neat so I decided to make it public.
<br/>
<br/>
It's in very early state and it uses a hard coded scene but I hope you enjoy it anyway!

I'll keep posting here the progress. I'm planing to implement a lot more features soon. If you plan to post any feature request... here're the things I already have in my list:
<br/>
 - Torus shape
<br/>
 - Refractions
<br/>
 - Textures
<br/>
 - Constructive Solid Geometry
<br/>
 - Rendering from script file
<br/>
 - Multiple light types
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by naleksiev on Thu Jan 08, 2009 8:27 pm; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

Totally forget to add it in the list. Of course this will be one of the features. What format will be better BMP or non compressed PNG? 
<br/>
BTW for fun just because it's generated on NDS I'm thinking about saving the image with 15 bits depth colors, although I have the colors in 36 bits depth.

I don't have such plans for now, especially because the initial demo was made for two days and now I'm making quite a refactoring. I might release it later. I'll think about it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
