    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">More or less a port of SMSAdvance to the NDS now under the name of S8DS, as it's a SEGA 8-bit emulator for the DS. 
<br/>
The biggest difference from the GBA is probably that you don't have to use a builder to add roms, you can use zipped files directly and the screen doesn't have to be scaled to fit. 
<br/>
*Pretty much everything works perfectly. 
<br/>
*Supports zipped files. 
<br/>
*No scaling needed for most games. 
<br/>
*Can scale to correct aspect for PAL, NTSC &amp; GameGear. 
<br/>
*Savestates.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">that would Rock PC engine for the win. oh and thanks for this SMS emu. I should try to work on a emu again Id love to get SnemulDS polished up a bit. its so close to being very practical and functional... or perhaps Ill work with the last Snes DS code that was cool but it only ran under gba.ds format so perhaps with a little efort it could be updated to use slot 1 and dldi loading for roms. only problem im not very good at coding so id have to learn more.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
