    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">MancalaDS is a fun game, but playing a game without a song is WAAAY boring... So I decided to make some songs for MancalaDS and release it.

Lotti (the creator of MancalaDS) didn't had much time so I put it on my site. He will put it later in his <a class="postlink" href="http://lottisden.blogspot.com" target="_blank">own blog</a> too.

MancalaDS is a board game (Single player or 2 players on 1 DS) for the Nintendo DS.
<br/>
The games of this family best known in the Western world are <span style="font-weight: bold">Oware</span> (or <span style="font-weight: bold">Awele</span>), <span style="font-weight: bold">Kalah</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Sungka</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">Omweso</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold">Bao</span>.
<br/>
Mancala games play a role in many Africa and some Asian societies comparable to that of chess in the West.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
