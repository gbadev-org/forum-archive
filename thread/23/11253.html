    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is MP3 support intentionally disabled in this version, or is it just broken? My monster.so3 file (for Sam &amp; Max) still works in 0.61, so I don't think it's a problem on my end. (Using GBA MP, Flashme v7 on DS Lite.)
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I'm liking the 2x scaling for the top screen, the general improvements are nice, and I haven't had any issues running Sam &amp; Max aside from the aforementioned MP3 issues.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try clearing your cache and refreshing the page, or loading it in a different browser. I'm using Opera too, by the way, so the browser itself probably doesn't have anything to do with it.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd put the download link here, but I'm not sure how Agentq feels about direct linking to files.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

* Fix to Zip file reader

* Replaced SCSD driver with original version

* Readded MP3 support

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yay! Thanks for fixing it!
<br/>
Just checked it out with my SC SD.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried MI 1 and 2, Loom, BASS and Simon 1 and 2.
<br/>
All seemed to work great. Going to play through Simon 2 tomorrow, to make sure everything's working fine and then post a report. 
<br/>
<br/>
Only things i noticed is that unlike with the other games, the DS doesn't switch off when i quit Simon game and that the DS options (when pressing select) are a little messed up with all games. (Just parts of the window's frame missing. Nothing really bad)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, i like what i see! Keep up the great work!
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
Oh yeah, unlike in the 0.6.1 version, i don't need to use the files with loaders anymore. The regular .nds ones work fine. Cool.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm having some pretty significant issues running this with the Max Media Dock.
<br/>
<br/>
The frontend ScummVM program boots up fine, I can switch screens and push all the buttons on the touchscreen and everything, but when I select 'Add Game...' it doesn't seem to see the directory structure on card.  All I get is "Select directory with game data' line break 'np:/' then a big empty box with the "Go up" "Cancel" and "Choose" buttons underneath it.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried running it with the TENTACLE.000 and TENTACLE.001 files unzipped just sitting in the same directory as scummvm-a.nds, I've tried zipping them up as scummdata-a.zip (uncompressed) and leaving them in the directory, tried putting everything in the root directory of the CF card, tried having them in the "games" directory, tried a ScummVM directory, still nothing.  The console/readme thing on the top screen says "ZIP file check...Not in use!"  I also just noticed the info screen on the top says Version 0.9.1beta1, but I downloaded the beta2 zip, and the readme in the zip says beta2, so I'm confused.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there something I'm missing, or is there still a problem with the libfat and the MMD?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
