    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
<br/>
I finally finished book II of the Lone Wolf series for the Nintendo DS: "Fire On The Water". For those who had missed the first volume, Flight From The Dark, this is an attempt at porting good old paper gamebooks to the DS console.
<br/>
<br/>
So what's new in this second book?
<br/>
- A totally new and exciting adventure! :)
<br/>
- Improved the game engine for handling more complex events
<br/>
- Made 4 new musics (1 intro and 3 ingame) for even more variety
<br/>
- Added mini-games
<br/>
- Added merchants
<br/>
- and many other fixes and improvements
<br/>
<br/>
You can get the game here : <a href="http://www.projectaon.org/staff/frederic/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.projectaon.org/staff/frederic/index.php</a>
<br/>
<br/>
(please don't host the ROM on your site but use this link instead, as required by the Project Aon licensed)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm now using the new EFSLib by Noda, which should add some improvements in speed and compatibility with SLOT 2 linkers. It should even work now in emulators (except for loading/saving maybe). As this is a Release Candidate, if you encounter a problem or a bug, please tell me and I'll try to fix it for the 1.0 release. Thank you for your feedback!
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've played through a few times now, and I've found a few bugs:
<br/>
-Rolling two zeros in Portholes is not an insta-win (I rolled it for the computer.)
<br/>
-The Arm wrestling "Battle" gives weird results if you lose.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
