    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody.
<br/>
<br/>
I haved been thinking of doing a NDS dev OS or something similar to help new NDS developers begin. And finally, I do it.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you like this, and contribute to grow the catalog of NDS homebrew sourcecodes ready to compilate and RUN. Expecially for NDS librarys developers can use. Like libpng, zlib, palib, sdl, etc..
<br/>
<br/>
From <a href="http://jandujar.homelinux.com/index.php/NDS_DEV_OS" target="_blank">http://jandujar.homelinux.com/index.php/NDS_DEV_OS</a>
<br/>
<br/>
NDS-DEV-OS means Nintendo DS developer's Operating System. The main purpose of this OS is to help news developers to create homebrew for Nintendo DS as soon as possible, giving an Operating System with all the nds tools and librarys installed, ready to start new development.
<br/>
<br/>
Another purpose NDS-DEV-OS have is to be the largest collection of NDS Homebrew sources, to help people understand the tricks of the NDS developers Gurus.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">On top of what WinterMute said, it's going to be a major pain once the next DevkitPro version is released.  Is someone going to go through and make sure all the provided source code still compiles on the newest version?  Also, using a Linux based environment.. you should call it a "media adapter" developer OS, as most (I think I only know of 2) GBA Flash Cart linkers don't have drivers for Linux.
<br/>
<br/>
I think you will see that we'll get one release (building this package is really not a big deal) and once jandujar realizes the amount of work involved to keep it working, and up to date, it might not see a new release again.
<br/>
<br/>
You'd be better off writing a tutorial on how to do it.  something like:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Download this VMWare image (and here is how to use it)
<br/>
2) Download/install DevkitPro
<br/>
3) Download/install PAlib
<br/>
4) DevkitPro and PAlib examples overview
<br/>
5) starting from scratch
<br/>
<br/>
6) Updating your envirnment

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The purpose of the NDS-DEV-OS is to help new developer's to build applications as soon as possible, and have a large amount of librarys/homebrew ready to use. (freetype, libjpeg, zlib, etc...) without waste time of searching this librarys and try compile/include in his/her homebrew. 
<br/>
<br/>
I modify every Makefile to use environment variables like $DEVKITPRO, $DEVKITARM, $PAPATH, $SDLPATH, etc...
<br/>
<br/>
At this moment I have settup the environment variable DEVKITARM to $HOME/devkitpro/devkitarm_r20. When r21 becomes available I will update this variable and "recompile all the homebrew", if something does not compile I will try to fix them, of use the devkitarm_r20 to build it.

At this moment I'm uploading librarys, libsdl, libfreetype, libjpeg, zlib, etc...

I will update the site this week whith a newer version. You could use it or not, but I think more people will use it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://jandujar.homelinux.com" target="_blank">http://jandujar.homelinux.com</a>

<br/>
can you explain me why I'm currently in violation of that GPL license?
<br/>
<br/>
I put the source of every program, and put a README.TXT and LICENSE.TXT for each one. And always cite the author/s site. 
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I need to create an script to download the latest DEVKITPRO and DEVKITARM from net and build the library automatically to "unviolate" the GPL license?
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I explained bad, I "only" modify the homebrew who does not compile under the default devkitarm. Adding the "ds_rules" in makefile, etc....

<br/>
I apologized for my english.

Also, thanks for this, it's much appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
My major concern with your repackaging is that it will differ from the standard install and thus cause problems for users who will then seek support from me. This has happened in the past and resulted in considerable problems where users where unable to build code without first removing the 3rd party install and reinstalling using the devkitPro official installer.
<br/>
<br/>
The toolchains will be updated again in a few weeks at most - at that point libnds in particular will be dependent on the new toolchain. I am also currently investigating the possibility of providing an updater for linux and OSX in order to keep the users on those platforms up to date as well. If I understand your package correctly you will then have to track those updates and rebuild your VMWARE image for every update of every library.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

That's quite ambitious. What libraries did you have in mind?
<br/>
<br/>
I've often considered a devkitPro subproject to provide ports of useful libraries such as libpng, libjpeg etc but, as always I lack the time to think about it much. I'm also a bit disdainful about things like libSDL on a console like the DS so I haven't really spent a lot of time looking into those sort of support libraries. This is probably something that will be pretty useful.

<br/>
Cygwin is not now nor will it ever be a supported devkitPro platform. There have been considerable problems with that in the past and if you think I gave you grief about the GPL then you'll enjoy the attention you get from the cygwin people if you provide downloads of any of their tools.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the install instructions I'm not convinced they're entirely necessary. As I said previously I'm currently looking into a cross platform installer/updater which will then become the preferred method of obtaining devkitPro toolchains.

Personally I think that porting libraries such as libSDL, libpng, libjpeg etc would be more useful to the community as a whole than a collection of DS specific homebrew applications or emulators. I'm sure there are a few other libraries that people would like to see on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Most of these libraries are easy enough to port, if you know what you're doing, and it's definitely a skill worth acquiring. Generally it's better to massage their makefiles or configuration system a little rather than trying to fit them into the devkitPro build system. I can probably help point you in the right direction with this sort of thing.
<br/>
<br/>
I think you'll give yourself a lot less work in the long run if you keep them separate instead of trying to squeeze everything into one single zip. It's a lot easier to replace a small archive than a big one.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what you mean by "applications, emulators, games and libraries with some kind of GPL or some similar license". You can't just relicense other people's work because you chose to offer it as part of a collection.
<br/>
<br/>
With other people's work where it's not a large open source project I think it's better to point users to the proper website where they can get support and newer versions. The programmers may even welcome some help if you get in touch with them first but I would advise making contact before including their work in your own package, unless of course that their license specifies that their permission is not needed.
<br/>
<br/>
The idea of automatic tools to submit newer homebrew/libraries sounds intriguing although I get the impression that Lynx's new project is along these lines. Perhaps you'd like to get involved with what he's doing, I'm pretty sure he'll need some help.

"He didn't get permission", that's laughable.  I guess I missed that provision in the GPL.  GPL was designed for this very reason, to prevent someone from controlling it.

It's unfortunate that he chose a counterproductive way to try to help, but it's better that we lose him than that we suffer the damage.  Besides, none of what he's doing is particularly new ground, and not much seems to ever have been achieved.  Frankly, this sounds like more of the "I was gonna but nobody did it for me" nonsense we get on IRC so much.

Jandujar: If you have a project, and you expect help from other people to complete it, the project will never be completed.  Accept that and move on.

I understand the point of view of wintermute.

He told me I'm violating the GPL, so I decided to cancel the project. I could share the devkitpro source to "unviolate" the GPL license, but I don't want to steals other people's job.

The only thing I want is help noob's to begin programmer in DS, packaging the devkitpro and some ds homebrew in the same package.

I don't think he was shot down so much as informed by Wintermute of the breach of license agreement (to which he agrees to by using the software) and I also feel that Wintermute was merely letting the readers  know that the product would not be supported by DKP and the pitfalls that have happened already with a similar effort.  This has happened before with another installer and the developer then (just like Jandujar) had understood his concern and the licensing agreement (in the end).  It is interesting that others within the community aren't as understanding as the people working on the discussed project.
<br/>
<br/>
The childishness of which you speak comes from the lack of understanding from other people (not Wintermute or Jandujar) and how they deal with the situation.  It is unfortunate, but luckily doesn't seem to happen that often.
<br/>
<br/>
And in the end the creative energy that Jandujar had (as far as the thread reads) is now going to be directed into another project that will also contribute in almost the same manner that he had intended to begin with.
<br/>
<br/>
So in the end it appears to be all good right?
