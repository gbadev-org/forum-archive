    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm happy to announce the release of <span style="font-weight: bold">libXM7 version 1.04</span> :)
<br/>
<br/>
Some bugs were patched and MOD replay has been introduced. Now it loads and play MOD modules of the following subtypes:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">- M.K., M!K! and FLT4 module subtypes 4 channels modules
<br/>
- OCTA, CD81 and FLT8 module subtypes 8 channels modules
<br/>
- TDZx module subtype 1 to 3 channels modules
<br/>
- xCHN module subtype 2 to 9 channels modules
<br/>
- xxCH module subtype 10 to 16 channels modules</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
and also features the on-the-fly sample change capability used in many ProTracker modules. This has been set as the default replay style for MOD tunes, but you can deactivate it (or you can activate it on XMs... lol).
<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold">XM7Play r2009-006</span> XM/MOD Player 
<br/>
Based on libXM7 1.04 of course, no other big changes since previous version. It plays XM/MOD modules with up to 16 channels directly from your FAT memory card. Download here -&gt; <a href="http://wcms.teleion.it/users/cgq/nds/libxm7/xm7play.r2009-006.zip" target="_blank">http://wcms.teleion.it/users/cgq/nds/libxm7/xm7play.r2009-006.zip</a>

Feedback is always appreciated. :) Also please point to me those XM/MOD modules that the player can't reproduce properly. Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This was easy to implement into a pure asm project that didn't use libnds and used IPC for sending a pointer to the arm7. Most people should be using FIFO for projects these days but either way it's quite easy to setup.

Great library, very easy to implement into projects, low resource usage, highly recommended!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In the example source code you can download from the documentation page, I'm using FIFO to let arm9 side of the library communicate with arm7 side (start/stop tunes). (libXM7 actually was born before the FIFO system was released into libnds and retained the chance to work without it even today...)

I owe you some advertising now ;) By the way I think that the best there has been to 'integrate' it with zlib so that we could gzip the 36 tunes (shrinking the size to 60% of the original) and store them in the NDS (either using -or not- a filesystem) and I really wondered then to see that uncompressing and loading a tune took just some (one hundred? two?) millisecond... it's a very interesting solution that I guess many other projects could benefit.

(I'm talking about Manic Miner in the Lost Levels, of course, Flash/HK/Lobo/SpaceFractal great homebrew :) <span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">Adv served</span> ;) )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
