Changelog:
<br/>
<br/>
v3.2
<br/>
-Added aspect ratio support for monitors that aren't 4:3. Mplayer stretches the movie incorrectly if the monitor's AR is not set.
<br/>
<br/>
v3.1
<br/>
-Videos now actually play all the way through (cut off early before).
<br/>
Use AviSynth now requires AviSynth <span style="font-weight: bold">2.5.7</span>. 2.5.6 will not work.
<br/>
<br/>
v3.0
<br/>
-RGB21/15/18 being too dark is finally fixed.
<br/>
-Can simulate how DPGs look on the DS's screen (check "Simulate DS")
<br/>
Both options require AviSynth.
<br/>
<br/>
v2.8 
<br/>
-Seeking is fixed, but this requires an installation of AviSynth 2.56 or later. <a href="http://www.avisynth.org/" target="_blank">http://www.avisynth.org/</a>
<br/>
Uncheck use AviSynth if you can't or don't want to install AviSynth.
<br/>
-Since AviSynth is used now, you can play the AVS in pretty much anything now, such as Media Player Classic.
<br/>
-Alternate video output option added in case video playback gives you green video.
<br/>
<br/>
v2.7
<br/>
-Private test build
<br/>
<br/>
v2.6
<br/>
-GOP list output actually works now
<br/>
-DPGs with 32768Hz audio properly supported
<br/>
-mplayer now resamples audio to 48KHz on playback (the mp2 is still untouched), so it should sound a bit better (though the volume output is a little quieter) on most soundcards.
<br/>
-code cleaned up somewhat
<br/>
<br/>
v2.5
<br/>
-Demuxer updated for DPG2 support (and a silly bugfix for DPG1, but they're still too dark unfortunately...). Now also dumps pixel format to .fps for DPG1/2 and dumps the GOP list for DPG2 into a .gop file (so you can remux later for whatever purpose).
<br/>
-Fixed a stupid bug where it'd call mplayer before the files were actually demuxed.
<br/>
<br/>
v2.4 
<br/>
- New demuxer that doesn't steal focus and overwrite your clipboard's contents, also works faster
<br/>
- Lets you output temp files to a different folder now so you can use it from SD cards and CDs/DVDs
<br/>
- Fixed minor bugs (still haven't fixed DPG1 being too dark though)
<br/>
- Compiled with AutoIt v2.3.0.1
<br/>
<br/>
v2.3 
<br/>
- Minor fix in regards to .fps (it overwrites instead of appending now) 
<br/>
- Fix Demux &amp; Play possibly not working when using the Browse button.
<br/>
<br/>
v2.2
<br/>
-Added half-working DPG1 support. The movies play way darker than they should. I'll see if I can fix it, but so far I'm having no luck.
<br/>
<br/>
v2.1
<br/>
-.fps (to not need the DPG each time you wanted to play) and output folder function was added.
<br/>
<br/>
v2.0
<br/>
-Initial release. (v1 was made by chuckstudios; this is the successor remade from scratch)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Firon on Sun Jan 21, 2007 6:02 am; edited 11 times in total</span></div>
