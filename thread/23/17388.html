    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Previous Platdude games have focussed on a nice simple-ish Puzzle form, but last year a simple suggestion created a whole new brand of Platdude games.
<br/>
This is the third of such games, and has been re-redesigned to fit neatly into a cute little DS sized package.
<br/>
<br/>
The rules are simple.  You have to remove 70% of the blocks from the level, which disappear simply by being stepped on.
<br/>
There are also spheres that you can throw at the blocks to remove them, too.
<br/>
<br/>
Along the way are many enemy creatures, who will kill you with a simple tap.
<br/>
Throw the spheres at those to defeat them.
<br/>
<br/>
A simple rinse/repeat mechanic, with a multitude of gameplay settings, and highscores for each.
<br/>
<br/>
Should be easy enough!
