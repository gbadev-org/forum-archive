    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
<br/>
It's time to say I'm still working on libxm7, and it's time to release yet another (still beta) version: it's 0.81!
<br/>
<br/>
In this version more effects are supported, and the bugs that were discovered in beta ver. 0.59 should have been removed :)
<br/>
<br/>
A big effort has been put to assure good replay accuracy and, even if it's still an incomplete work in progress, I'm sure you'll notice that.
<br/>
<br/>
You can <a class="postlink" href="http://www.teleion.it/users/cgq/nds/libxm7/libxm7_v0.81_demo.zip" target="_blank">download the new demo</a> (1489 KiB ZIP) 
<br/>
(edit: you can also <a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOTtW3GKVTs" target="_blank">check the video</a> on YouTube (high quality recommended! [Thanks raina!])
<br/>
and/or check all the details and download the library <a class="postlink" href="http://www.teleion.it/users/cgq/nds/libxm7/" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are some images from the demo: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.teleion.it/users/cgq/nds/libxm7/libxm7-img1.gif" target="_blank">the songlist</a>, playing "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.teleion.it/users/cgq/nds/libxm7/libxm7-img2.gif" target="_blank">Worse than this</a>" tune, playing "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.teleion.it/users/cgq/nds/libxm7/libxm7-img3.gif" target="_blank">Hurtless (part 1)</a>" tune.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, here's the complete changelog:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">[add] Portamento slide effects (1xx, 2xx, E1x, E2x, X1x, X2x) are now supported.
<br/>
[add] Portamento to note effect (3xx) is now supported.
<br/>
[add] Portamento to note with volume slide effect (5xx) is now fully supported.
<br/>
[add] Jump to position effect (Bxx) and Pattern break effect (Dxx) are now supported.
<br/>
[add] Key off effect (Kxx) is now supported.
<br/>
[add] Portamento to note volume column effect (Mx) is now supported.
<br/>
<br/>
[bug] istruments specified 'alone' (with no note) in the pattern now shouldn't lead to unpredictable
<br/>
      results even when used when you never specified a note before in that channel.
<br/>
      Also, they should now work even after key-offs of instrument with no envelopes.
<br/>
[bug] effect Rxy (retrig note with volume slide) used at the same time when setting a volume on
<br/>
      the volume column now should correctly reset the volume before every every retrig.
<br/>
      "Memory effect", should work correctly now, even when only one of the values (x or y) is 0.
<br/>
[bug] effect 0xy (Arpeggio) now keeps on working even in the 'extra ticks' added by an effect EEx
<br/>
      (Pattern Delay) on the same line.
<br/>
[bug] effect 9xx (sample offset) is now not ignored when used with a sample that has a loop.
<br/>
[bug] libxm7 startSound() (internal) function has been renamed, so you don't have to rename yours.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

The game is cool, but the tune is too simple... maybe you need help from some fellow tracker? Try to ask @ "<span style="font-style: italic">The Mod Archive</span>" forum, the "<a class="postlink" href="http://modarchive.org/forums/index.php?board=67.0" target="_blank">Wanted: Music for Projects</a>" is the right section, I guess :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://bit.ly/yiQrz9" target="_blank">libXM7</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://bit.ly/yJwcOo" target="_blank">NDS programming tutorial (Italiano)</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://disjointedstudio.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Waimanu DS / GBA</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://adshomebrewersdiary.blogspot.com" target="_blank">A DS Homebrewer's Diary</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I really hate to rain on your parade here, I know just how much work goes into something like this.
<br/>
<br/>
I've only had a brief look at your site but I can't seem to find an example project so I haven't really checked it out properly.
<br/>
<br/>
Does your library work with the most recent devkitARM releases? We've rearranged quite a bit of code and put together a decent interprocessor communication layer amongst other things.
<br/>
<br/>
We're also including an audio library with devkitARM that provides support for XM playing, among many other things. Source is provided on the SF releases and in the devkitPro SVN for reference - it should give you some idea how to make sure things will still work.
<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is that, since we're distributing maxmod along with the other libraries we now have a default arm7 core which has it's audio support built in. This is to make things much easier for programmers to add wifi and audio features to their own projects without having to deal with the arm7 themselves.
<br/>
<br/>
Have you considered the possibility of helping to improve maxmod instead of trying to support your own library independently? I'm sure there are probably features of your library that may be useful to maxmod &amp; vice versa.
<br/>

Hi, sorry for replying you so late, I wasn't on-line these days...
<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's true, I never prepared an example project, but <span style="font-style: italic">theli</span> did it, it's <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=164571#164571" target="_blank">here</a>, in the 0.59 beta version release topic, and should still be working since I didn't change anything 'outside' the library.
<br/>
<br/>
I still don't know if my library works with the most recent devkitARM releases, you released it almost the same moment I was releasing mine... anyway upgrading it's one of the things I'll be doing soon, of course! And the interprocessor communication layer is what I was missing the most so I'm happy there's a decent one now :)
<br/>
<br/>
I've read -and seen demos- about maxmod and it's amazing, it does everything that libxm7 does and even a lot more... the matter about libxm7 is that I started it because I didn't know there were already other wip libraries that do that... I discovered 0xtob's libntxm after I released the first demo, and I discovered about maxmod just a couple of weeks ago... but I enjoyed coding my lib so much and I'm still having a lot of fun developing it. I learnt and I'm learning a lot of interesting things (you know, I'm quite a newbie) and I think I still need to write a lot of code before I can call this thing done. After that, if it happens that I learnt enough that I could actually really help improve maxmod, then I'll surely will. Now I believe it's impossible :)

You didn't. You simply gave me a chance to think once more about this thing. :) Bye!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://bit.ly/yiQrz9" target="_blank">libXM7</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://bit.ly/yJwcOo" target="_blank">NDS programming tutorial (Italiano)</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://disjointedstudio.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Waimanu DS / GBA</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://adshomebrewersdiary.blogspot.com" target="_blank">A DS Homebrewer's Diary</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
  no library update yet, but a tiny example (12KiB) that shows how to use libxm7 with libnds 1.3.1 using the new IPC system.
<br/>
Includes a 10KiB XM by Lasse (thanks!)
