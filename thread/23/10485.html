    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is a program I whipped up for personal use. If you use the latest Xbox Media Center and activated the webserver on port 80, you can use this program to navigate through Xbox Media Center.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a buggy beta version[0.2beta]. Here's what's new:
<br/>
<br/>
* Backlight shuts off when the lid is closed. You can also shut off the backlight manually.
<br/>
* Buggy file browser added. (use with caution. Some files can't be played if there are weird characters in them.)
<br/>
* Left/Right analog stick button push added
<br/>
* You can shut off and reboot the Xbox
<br/>
* You can send messages to your TV screen ("Fun" button)
<br/>
* You can press START at the IP address input screen to connect
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I'm only releasing this version because there might be some people that want to have these new features sooner rather than later. Enjoy!
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: There's some confusion over what this program actually does. It does not work on Xbox 360 or Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005, rather it controls the homebrew version of Xbox Media Center for XBox.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by tsunami0ne on Mon Jul 31, 2006 8:06 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

depending now you have HTTP API mapped.

This is the same version except the IP address can be changed entirely. Eventually I will release the source code, but right now I am not very fond of how the code is structured and am very very undecided about the GUI. Sorry about the Rapidshare link, I have no place to host my files.

Truthfully, this is a very very simple PALib application that just makes a bunch of HTTP requests.

<br/>
<br/>
The next 2 things I am focusing on are:
<br/>
<br/>
- In Playlist mode(tentative name), the information about the media that's currently playing on the Xbox will be shown on the top screen, while a bunch of controls (fast foward, rewind, pause, etc.) will be displayed on the bottom screen.
<br/>
<br/>
- Media browser on the DS so you can browse through your music and video lists on the DS and tell the xbox to play them so you could watch a movie and not interrupt it while browsing for files.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lol. I totally forgot about the fact that there was an XP Media Center edition and an xbox 360 media center... to clarify, Dillama will not work with those. ... From my experience though, Xbox 360 Media Center + Windows XP Media Center 2005 = garbage, compared to XBMC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Is it the DS wireless library that causes the connection to drop out after a few minutes? (Or something my end?)
<br/>
<br/>
Things I'd love to see before it becomes a wireless media browser (if possible within the API):
<br/>
<br/>
- Ability to save IP address settings AND set up the server password (you have to use it without one) and use a FAT device (ie GBAMP CF) to record the settings.
<br/>
-Hold R button to turn D-pad into the right thumbstick (vol up down etc) Or screen functions to that effect.
<br/>
-Ability to turn DS screens off to save power.

Just looked at the API page you linked to. A touchscreen slider for volume would be great... :)

Saving settings is something that I definitely need to implement... I've added a crude file browser and the ability to switch the backlight on/off, but somewhere down the line I screwed up the code and it freezes up when the DS tries to connect to the Xbox. I'll have to figure it out eventually, but I hope to have an update by this weekend.
