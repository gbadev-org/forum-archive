    <h4>#142975 - ant512 - Mon Oct 15, 2007 7:48 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been working on a <b style="color:#FFA34F">GUI</b> <b style="color:#FFA34F">library</b> for the Nintendo DS (called "Woopsi" - spot the pun), with the hope that other homebrew authors will use it and focus on more interesting development, instead of having to waste their time writing GUIs of their own.
<br/>
<br/>
Current features include multiple screen support, screen dragging, windows, gadgets, a text viewer, screen backgrounds, an event system, and more.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to have a look at the latest demo, you can download it from the SourceForge project page here (download the demo package; the other package is the sourcecode):
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/woopsi/" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/woopsi/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The zip file has the usual ROMs for the SuperCard, Slot-1 carts and the nds.gba file. If necessary, patch the .nds file for your card.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested in learning more about the system, there's loads of info on my blog:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://ant.simianzombie.com/blog" target="_blank">http://ant.simianzombie.com/blog</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The <b style="color:#FFA34F">library</b> is written in C++ and uses the PALib, both of which may prove to be barriers to wider adoption.  The PALib stuff can be stripped out and replaced with libnds calls, but C++ isn't negotiable in this project.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, any feedback is appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by ant512 on Thu Jul 21, 2011 12:30 pm; edited 17 times in total</span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I think I might be possible to do, but I've only looked at a couple of the files so far.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason I want it without C++ / PALib is to do something like the Win32 stuff, and IIRC Amiga did not have the STL stuff in it - so it should not be too hard to do.
<br/>
<br/>
It will be a while before I start this as a project tho, got another one in the works that is taking up a lot of my time at the moment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You're a brave, brave man.  Removing PALib wouldn't be too hard - I only really use it in a few places.  Switching to C would be a real pain, though.  Possible, definitely.  Something I'd want to attempt, no.  C++ is the perfect fit for something like this.  Rewriting it in C would change it from consisting of tidy, self-contained data structures and member functions to being an unmanageable explosion of structs, linked lists, and horribly complicated function calls.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to see it if you manage it, though!
<br/>
<br/>
There's a new version available (source and demo build) from the SourceForge site:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/woopsi" target="_blank">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/woopsi</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Lots of new stuff, including radio buttons, checkboxes, and dual screen support (the top screen now functions as a "swap space" - click the flip-to-top gadget and the bottom workspace will switch places with the top workspace).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#144672 - SteveH - Mon Nov 05, 2007 5:07 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Converting to C does not mean complicated function calls - you just need to plan it out more.  After a little more looking today and I'm not even sure you can strip out the PS Lib stuff as your entire touch pad code works off of the PA Libs stylus code - I also spotted some optimisations that could be done on the line drawing code.
<br/>
<br/>
One problem I'm getting at the moment is that PA Lib does not want to compile on my PC (Vista Home Premium and DevKitPro r21) so I'm unable to see exactly how everything works, but I'll let you know what I come up with...
<br/>
<br/>
One thing that gets me is when people say C is structs and linked lists - What's a vector? An overly complext link list.  So all I will do is move the vectors to linked lists, and I prefer linked lists as I have full control over how they are accessed, unlike a vector (in my limited experience at least).  But it's still early stages, and I'm still working on another project that's getting removed from me soon - it's a third party app for a game I pla.y, and it's nearly ready to be released to the public.  So while I code that I can be thinking about how Woopsi can be changed to a C / C++ and libNDS code base.
<br/>
<br/>
I've just had a quick play around with 0.25 - very nice, I like the swap screen button on the virtual screens.
<br/>
<br/>
One question - when I press the A key the SuperBitmap window increases in size, until it overlapps the screen and then your unable to do anything (move, close or change screen), not sure if that's a bug or not.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#144676 - ant512 - Mon Nov 05, 2007 5:48 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The great thing about the vector class is that it's a ready-made linked list that can become a linked list of *anything*.  I tend to keep away from the STL because, as you say, writing your own constructs gives you more control, but the vector's so handy I use it all the time.  Once you decide to use your own linked lists, you then have to write all of the usual linked list functions, and before you know it you've spent days coding and got nowhere.
<br/>
<br/>
The touch pad code is solely limited to one function in the woopsi.cpp file.  You'd just need to strip the PALib calls out of there and replace them with libNDS calls.  The Woopsi class sends clicks through the rest of the hierarchy, so it's the only class that has any knowledge of the user's interaction with the DS.  Same with the d-pad stuff, the lid opened/closed stuff, etc.  Other things the code uses PALib for are screen setup (all handled in the main.cpp file), DMA hardware (spread all over the place, particularly the gadget.cpp, screen.cpp and textviewer.cpp files), pointers to the framebuffer (all over the place), and RGB-&gt;DS 16-bit colour conversion (mainly gadget.cpp and font.cpp).
<br/>
<br/>
PALib doesn't work with devKitPro r21, so you're a bit stuck there until that gets sorted.  It doesn't work with Vista either, so you're stuck there too.
<br/>
<br/>
Any optimisations you can share would be great!
<br/>
<br/>
I think I've stripped out the superbitmap increase thing in the latest demo.  That was just for me to test the window resize code as I was writing it (the window borders needed to match the dimensions of the enclosing window, so I had to ensure that everything resized at the same time).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
As for coding link lists, they are very easy to do and I've coded that many of them now that the functions to add and remove items have become second nature.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing I was going to add to my implementation was font support using the fonts based on <a class="postlink" href="http://bmf.wz.cz/" target="_blank">BMF</a> - Byte Mapped Fonts.  There's a load of fonts on the site for free use, also some of the fonts are small enough to use on the DS - I've got some code on one of my HDD's that reads and stores the data that's in the files if you want it I'll hunt it out - it uses pure C / C++ so should work fine on the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks!  Another update on SourceForge, taking it to version 0.27.  Lots of bugfixes and more API improvements.  The most obvious change in the demo is the ability to drag windows beyond the confines of the screen (OSX/Windows style).
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, my advice is still to wait until the API settles down before jumping in and trying to use Woopsi.  I consider it to be in the "pre-alpha" stage of development - each new release is liable to break code written with the last release.  However, there's at least one developer actively using Woopsi to create a program and test the system at the same time, which has proven to be a great help in creating an API that's easy to use yet powerful at the same time.  If you're willing to be a guinea pig, and don't mind downloading the latest update to find that nothing works any more (for entirely inexplicable reasons), it'd be good to get more people using it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A few more changes, the most interesting being:
<br/>
<br/>
 - No need for PALib.  SteveH kindly wrote a patch to remove it.  Woopsi now ships with two makefiles - one lets you use it with libnds (no PALib required), and one lets you use it with PALib.
<br/>
 - Skinnable screens and windows.
<br/>
 - Animation class and animated buttons.

<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/woopsi" target="_blank">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/woopsi</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Changes mostly limited to API improvements and a few new gadgets.  There's a new Pac Man demo, though, ported from a JavaScript version I wrote for the canvas tag a while ago, and a debug console that will pop up when you press any of the d-pad keys whilst the Pac Man window is active (just flip it to the top screen or move it out the way).
<br/>
<br/>
I've also added an optional SDL layer that simulates the features of libnds that Woopsi uses.  This means that you can create, build and debug Woopsi applications for your native development platform, then build exactly the same code for the DS.  Writing apps is much easier when you can take advantage of VC++'s step-through or Xcode's memory leak visualiser.  You just need to replace a couple of files in the "woopsi" folder with the files in the "sdl" folder to enable it.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that the SDL layer does not simulate anything other than the features Woopsi needs; if your app uses anything other than the Woopsi API (ie. it hits the hardware) you have to develop the hard way again.
<br/>
<br/>
There's an Xcode SDL version of the demo (source and pre-built binaries) available from the SourceForge page.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Changes this time are a lot of bugfixes and some new gadgets, including scrolling panels, scrollbars, etc.  I've completely removed the STL from the solution, which has reduced the size of a basic "hello world" ROM down to less than 250K.
<br/>
<br/>
There's also a new makefile that will produce a Woopsi <b style="color:#FFA34F">library</b>, giving a total of 4 different ways that the system can be built (with PALib, without PALib, <b style="color:#FFA34F">library</b> and SDL).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
 - General bugfixes and API improvements
<br/>

 - Buttons change colour when clicked
<br/>
 - ProgressBar gadget

<br/>
     - Fixed checkbox incorrectly setting font pointer instead of leaving it to
<br/>
       the base class.

You'd do this:

<br/>
<br/>
We are running in to an issue with using wireless functionality and the touch screen.  Basically, we have a woopsi application running with various screens and gadgets, all working fine.  We have a connection setup that associates with an access point, connects to a remote system and then logs in successfully. 
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that after wireless is initiated, the touch screen no longer functions.  Any ideas?

Hmm, interesting one.  I haven't used Woopsi with wireless yet.  I wonder if initialising the wireless lib does something strange to the interrupts?  I'd suggest looking in the woopsifuncs.c and .h files to see if there's anything obvious in there.  If you're using the libnds version, that is.  The code in there that deals with hardware setup and the touch screen was essentially ripped out of PALib by SteveH into a separate file, so the chances are it's inherited some of PALib's crazy coding.
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I know that the (presumably now aborted, as it was a final year university project last year) DSTalk application used Woopsi and the wireless hardware with no problems.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

These days, C++ compilers are so good that there's no virtually no difference between C++ code and the same algorithms expressed in C. The only reasons anyone can have for wanting to re-write in C are a) masochistic tendencies, or b) superstition based on the performance of C++ 20 years ago.

The project we did used Woopsi in tandem with some C functionality on the backend.  The two play nicely together, so if you wanted the 'meat' of your project to be in C, there is nothing stopping you from implementing it that way.

<br/>
<br/>
There's no use of the STL at all in Woopsi.  Jeff, one of the contributors to my blog, did some investigative work and together we figured out just how much bloat the STL adds to a DS ROM.  I estimated that just including the vector class added 0.5MB to the Woopsi ROM, which is 1/8th of the total available RAM in the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
If you treat the DS like an embedded system and completely avoid the STL, RTTI, exceptions, etc, and just use C++ as "C-with-classes", you shouldn't encounter any problems with performance or ROM size.
<br/>
<br/>
There's a good article here by a chap called "cearn" in which he actually tests C vs C++ compilation.  He finds that there's virtually no difference (of the two, C++ actually comes out on top):

You can mix C++ and C in the same binary.  If you structure your project well, you'll have an API into your C program that a C++ Woopsi application can work with, keeping the two things separate (MVC pattern).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
There are quite a few under-the-hood changes this time around.  First of all, Quirky (of Bunjalloo fame) supplied patches for half a dozen crashes, which are all now fixed.  There are a number of other miscellanous bugfixes in there too.  The only fix likely to have an impact on user code is the renaming of "Gadget::draw()" to "Gadget::redraw()", which is a workaround for a problem with GCC.
<br/>
<br/>
In terms of new features, it is possible to get at each gadget's child gadgets, and get a count of those children.  The event system has had a major overhaul and is a lot easier to work with now.  I've also done a lot of optimisation to try and speed things up, and added some new features to the GraphicsPort.  It is now possible to copy rectangular areas of the framebuffer around, scroll rectangular areas, and dim rectangular areas (DimmedScreen style).
<br/>
<br/>
 - Fixes:
<br/>
   - Removed PALib dependency from filerequester example.
<br/>
   - FileRequester gadget fixed for devKitARM r24 (Quirky).
<br/>
   - ListBox redraws correctly when an option is selected in single selection mode.
<br/>
   - Fixed crash in SliderVertical when trying to set value if max and min values are the same (Quirky).
<br/>
   - Fixed crash in SliderHorizontal when trying to set value if max and min values are the same.
<br/>
   - Fixed FileRequester crash when path has trailing slash (Quirky).
<br/>
   - Fixed double-click in SDL (Quirky).
<br/>
   - FileRequester fixed for SDL (Quirky).
<br/>
   - SDL path fixes (Quirky).
<br/>
   - Escape key to quit in SDL mode (Quirky).
<br/>
   - WindowBorderTop and SkinnedWindowBorderTop no longer have pointers to freed memory if window title changes (Quirky).
<br/>
   - ScreenTitle and SkinnedScreenTitle no longer have pointers to freed memory if screen title changes (Quirky).
<br/>
   - Flipping window depth with depth gadget no longer results in corrupted window contents.
<br/>
   - Fixed const-correctness of various Text class methods.
<br/>
   - SDL framebuffers initialised to black.
<br/>
   - More doxygen fixes.
<br/>
   - Removed WoopsiArray::begin().
<br/>
   - Removed LinkedList::begin().
<br/>
   - Renamed Gadget::draw() to Gadget::redraw() and removed unnecessary overloads from all classes.
<br/>
   - Const correctness fixes in Gadget class.
<br/>
   - ScrollingTextbox adjusts scrollbar grip position correctly when first initialised.
<br/>
   - Alert box draws XOR rect correctly when released.
<br/>
   - Requester draws XOR rect correctly when released.
<br/>
   - WoopsiKeyboard no longer adds itself as the decoration event handler twice; fixes XOR rect drawing when clicked/released.
<br/>
<br/>
 - New Features:
<br/>
   - Added Gadget::getChild() and Gadget::getChildCount() (for leonelhs).
<br/>
   - Added context menu example (for leonelhs).
<br/>
   - ListData class raises events to ListDataEventHandler objects.
<br/>
   - ListBox listens for ListData events.
<br/>
   - Added base template class for event args passing.
<br/>
   - Refactored gadget event system:
<br/>
     - Replaced EventArgs struct with GadgetEventArgs class.
<br/>
     - Renamed EventHandler to GadgetEventHandler.
<br/>
     - Gadgets can now have multiple event handlers.
<br/>
     - Replaced handleEvent() method with multiple methods.
<br/>
     - Removed EventType enum from GadgetEventHandler.
<br/>
   - ListData events passed by references instead of pointers.
<br/>
   - WoopsiKeyboard includes a set of new events:
<br/>
     - Press
<br/>
     - Release
<br/>
     - Repeat
<br/>
   - WoopsiKeyboard no longer stores the last key clicked.
<br/>
   - WoopsiKeyboard has set of event-related classes:

<br/>
   - End point rects now cached (sans child rects) for extra speed.
<br/>
   - Gadget rect caching moved into separate RectCache class.
<br/>
   - RectCache::removeOverlappedRects made non-recursive.

<br/>
<br/>
This release includes the usual set of bugfixes.  New features are mainly centred around testing the library - there's a new "tests" folder which will grow into a comprehensive set of test harnesses for every UI gadget.  The two existing tests have already highlighted a number of bugs in the tested gadgets, all of which have been fixed in this release.
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, this release adds the ability for Woopsi applications to load and save 24-bit BMP files.

<br/>
<br/>
This release is the first alpha version.  At this point I'm mainly concerned with bugfixing and tidying up than adding significant new features.
<br/>
<br/>
Big changes this time around include the removal of PALib support and a directory restructure.  This is the first release of Woopsi that ships as a proper library.  Installation instructions are included in the zip file, but it's essentially a matter of just copying the libwoopsi folder to the devkitpro folder.
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, there are a lot of improvements to the graphics API, are a few new example and test projects, and a sizeable number of bugfixes.

<br/>
This version contains the usual set of bugfixes, optimisations and new test projects.  The SDL compatibility layer has been greatly improved in this release - I compiled a quick test for the GP2X F-200 and it now runs at the same speed as the DS version.
<br/>
<br/>
New features are limited to some more graphics functions.  It is now possible to draw bitmaps in greyscale, and convert a region of a bitmap to greyscale.

However, as I say in the blog post, the GP2X touch screen is <span style="font-style: italic">awful</span>.  There's no point in me trying to maintain a GP2X port.  I'll do a Wiz version as soon as a decent set of instructions for getting a toolchain set up appears, but I'm fairly certain that the Wiz screen is even worse.

<br/>
<br/>
This release improves the functionality of the ListBox, ContextMenu and CycleButton gadgets.  It separates management of data from the UI, allowing such things as adding/removing/sorting CycleButton options, custom sorting orders, etc.  It improves the speed of the FileRequester and includes several bugfixes and optimisations.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Version 0.43 is now available.
<br/>
<br/>
This release mainly focuses on fonts.  I've added dozens of new proportional fonts into Woopsi that can be used in place of the default.  To aid in the creation of new font classes, Woopsi comes with three new .NET applications (sorry, non-Windows guys).  One can create Woopsi fonts from BMP files, one can convert Windows fonts to BMP files, and one can perform the entire operation in one go and convert a Windows font directly to a Woopsi font.
<br/>
<br/>
I've replaced the old system font (Topaz, the default Amiga Workbench font) with a proportional font called NewTopaz, which greatly reduces the amount of space wasted when printing to the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Other improvements include a redesigned "defaultStyle" system, a .NET utility to convert a BMP to a Woopsi bitmap class and a smattering of bugfixes.

<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/woopsi/" target="_blank">https://sourceforge.net/projects/woopsi/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
This release adds system-wide support for unicode (UTF-8).  Virtually all of the new features are related to text storage, manipulation or display.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition to that, the FileRequester is now an official part of libwoopsi and there are dozens of fixes and improvements.
<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that this release does *not* include any font classes that can render text beyond the standard ASCII set.  This will come in a future release - TrueType support is in the works.  Alternatively, you can roll your own font class.
<br/>
<br/>
Fixes:
<br/>
- Moved fatInitDefault() SDL function into woopsifuncs.cpp (Quirky).
<br/>
- ScrollingPanel::raiseScrollEvent() only fires if events are enabled.
<br/>
- Gadget::raisesEvents() retrieves its value from the GadgetEventHandlerList object.
<br/>
- Gadget::setRaisesEvents() alters the GadgetEventHandlerList object.
<br/>
- Removed the raisesEvents flag from the Gadget class.
<br/>
- Bmp2Font produces working Font classes.
<br/>
- Deleted badly-converted fonts:
<br/>
  - Latha;
<br/>

<br/>
- Dragging a screen that isn't the top screen so that it is not visible no longer causes a crash.
<br/>
- Removed glyphs from NewTopaz and Topaz fonts.
<br/>
- Changed NewTopaz font to PackedFont1 from PackedFont16.
<br/>
- Changed Topaz font to MonoFont from Font.
<br/>
- Fixed memory leak when enumerating directories in FileListBox.
<br/>
- FileListBox shows dummy file list when in SDL mode.
<br/>
- Graphical corruption in GraphicsPort::clipScroll() fixed.
<br/>
- Fixed FileRequester layout.
<br/>
- Replaced magic number double click time with define in woopsifuncs.cpp.
<br/>
- TestPanel class in scrolltest example draws its border correctly.
<br/>
- Fixed a crash in GraphicsPort::drawText() when trying to draw text outside the clipRect with a PackedFont1 font; should provide a minor speedup.
<br/>
- ScrollingPanel draws its border correctly.
<br/>
- Removed Text::getLinePointer().
<br/>
- MultiLineTextBox::drawCursor() uses a StringIterator to locate the cursor position.
<br/>
- MultiLineTextBox::drawCursor() does not read past the end of the string when the cursor is positioned beyond the string.
<br/>
- Text::wrap() does not perform an invalid comparison between line index and char index when truncating the line positions array.
<br/>
- Text::wrap() correctly appends the string end position in all scenarios.
<br/>
- Text::wrap() always assumes text height is at least one row.
<br/>
- Text::getLineContainingCharIndex() returns the correct value if the character is in the last row.
<br/>
- WoopsiString::insert() explicitly calls its own setText() and append() methods to prevent the Text class from wrapping twice.
<br/>
- Added WoopsiString::encodeCodePoint().
<br/>
- PackedFontBase::isCharBlank() returns correct value if character not present in font (fixes horizontal alignment in MulitLineTextBox).
<br/>
- Key repeat values stored in defines.h.
<br/>
- FileListBox does not show "." directory.
<br/>
- Minor optimisation when building the FileListBox contents.
<br/>
- Split Label::calculateTextPosition() split into horizontal and vertical methods.
<br/>
- TextBox switches to left-aligned automatically if contents exceeds size of box.
<br/>
- Fixed memory leak and logic problems when deleting gadgets.
<br/>
<br/>
New Features:
<br/>
- Added FontBase::getCharHeight().
<br/>
- WoopsiString supports UTF-8 (Lakedaemon).
<br/>
- Split glyphs into separate GlyphFont.
<br/>

<br/>
- Added WoopsiString::subString().
<br/>
- Added WoopsiString::indexOf().
<br/>
- TextBox implements key repeats when left or right d-pad is held down; cursor moves repeatedly until end of string reached or d-pad released.
<br/>
- MultiLineTextBox implements key repeats when left or right d-pad is held down; cursor moves repeatedly until end of string reached or d-pad released.
<br/>
- Textbox contents scrolls horizontally as cursor is moved.
<br/>
- Added key repeat event handling to the entire system.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Version 0.45 is now available:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/woopsi" target="_blank">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/woopsi</a>
<br/>
<br/>
This version includes TrueType font support via wrappers around the open-source FreeType library.  Coupled with the unicode support added in the last release, this means that it is now possible to develop GUIs with characters outside of the standard ASCII set.  Many thank to Lakedaemon for his work with both unicode and FreeType.
<br/>
<br/>
Instructions for installing the bundled FreeType library are included in the "Installation.txt" file in the source archive.
<br/>
<br/>
The release includes a number of API improvements.  Wiring up the keyboard gadget to a textbox is now very simple.  In fact, double-clicking a textbox now automatically shuffles the touchscreen display into the top display and opens a keyboard on the touchscreen.  Closing it shuffles everything back to how it was.
<br/>
<br/>
The various click(), release(), etc, methods that needed to be overridden when creating new UI gadgets have been replaced with simpler alternatives, called onClick(), onRelease(), and so on.  The shift-click system (in which the shoulder buttons work as modifier keys to enable right-click style functionality and a context-sensitive menu) has been greatly simplified.
<br/>
<br/>
The drawing API has similarly been simplified, and all drawing - whether done to a bitmap or a gadget - can now take advantage of the clipping system.
<br/>
<br/>
There are more improvements, bugfixes, tests and examples, which are detailed in the changelog below.
<br/>
<br/>
Fixes:
<br/>
- Fixed error when subclassing MultiLineTextBox.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/woopsi" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/woopsi</a>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the first beta version.  From this point forwards, future Woopsi development will centre around bug fixes and documentation.  There are many features I could add to the library, but the feature set is complete for version 1.
<br/>
<br/>
At this point, what I really need is for people to try out Woopsi in some small projects and let me know what bugs they find and what apparently simply tasks they find difficult to accomplish with the library.
<br/>
<br/>
Any volunteers?
<br/>
<br/>
Changes in this release mainly involve the MultiLineTextBox.  All alignment options now work, as does the cursor.
<br/>
<br/>
Fixes:
<br/>
- MultiLineTextBox jumps to bottom of text correctly when required to do so.
<br/>
- MultiLineTextBox extensively refactored.
<br/>
- MultiLineTextBox top-aligns when text exceeds size of gadget.
<br/>
- MultiLineTextBox alignment options all work.
<br/>
- Removed ScrollingPanel::clipToClientRect().
<br/>

To get the text to display the start, call the gadget's jump() method after you've finished setting it up.  For example:

ScrollingTextBox* textbox = new ScrollingTextBox(blah);

<br/>
<br/>
The font system has had some minor changes made. I finally got around to ripping out the Font and MonoFont classes, as the PackedFont classes perform the same job with far more efficiency. They?ve been moved to the ?extras? directory in the SVN repository in case anyone should ever need a reference for creating new font classes.
<br/>
<br/>
All of the monochrome fonts that ship as part of the library are now PackedFont1 classes instead of PackedFont16. This highlighted a bug in the bmp2font .NET program that is included in Woopsi?s ?tools? directory - it was allocating relatively huge bitmaps for the font data instead of the tiny bitmaps that were really necessary. I?ve deleted the ?CourierMono? font as it was an exact duplicate of the ?Courier? font. The GlyphFont is a PackedFont16-based class instead of a Font-based class.
<br/>
<br/>
This changes have reduced Woopsi?s footprint quite significantly:
<br/>
<br/>
1.5MB from the size of the Woopsi library;
<br/>
2MB from the sourcecode;
<br/>
400K from the packedfont example ROM;
<br/>
60K from the helloworld example ROM.
<br/>
A big saving for very little work.
<br/>
<br/>
Other changes include replacing the x, y, width and height members of the Gadget class with an instance of the Rect class (itself converted from a struct). A lot of the clipping work can now done be within the rect instance rather than throughout the codebase.
<br/>
<br/>
The FileListBox and FileRequester classes include a getPath() method that allows a developer to determine which directory the file requester is pointing at.
<br/>
<br/>
Fixes:
<br/>
    - Replaced clipping code in Gadget::clipRectToHierarchy() with call to new
<br/>
      Rect functions.
<br/>
    - PackedFont16::renderChar() aborts correctly if there is nothing to render
<br/>
      (Lakedaemon).
<br/>
    - Bitmap::getData(x, y) no longer declared inline (Lakedaemon).
<br/>
    - Renamed gunsuh15.bmp and gunsuhche15.bmp to gungsuh15.bmp and
<br/>
      gungsuhche15.bmp respectively.
<br/>
    - Deleted CourierMono as it was an exact duplicate of Courier.
<br/>
    - Converted most fonts to PackedFont1.
<br/>
    - Converted GlyphFont to PackedFont16 (manually altered class to force
<br/>
      fixed-width).
<br/>
    - Removed Font and MonoFont classes (PackedFont classes are faster and more
<br/>
      efficient).
<br/>
    - bmp2font upgraded to latest version - no longer creates gigantic arrays in
<br/>
      PackedFont1 fonts; removed support for Font and MonoFont classes.
<br/>
<br/>
New Features:
<br/>
    - Added getPath() to FileRequester and FileListBox.
<br/>
    - Converted Rect struct to class.
<br/>
    - Added Gadget::getRelativeX() and getRelativeY().

<br/>
<br/>
This release fixes a number of bugs.  Some of the code has been tidied up.  The only change that could have an impact on user code is the removal of drawHorizLine(), drawVertLine(), drawCircle() and drawFilledCircle() from the GraphicsPort class.  The drawLine(), drawEllipse() and drawFilledEllipse() methods will now automatically call the optimised form if it is available.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
- Moved unused FixedWidthFontBase class into extras directory.
<br/>
- Moved putSDLPixel() and getSDLPixel() into FrameBuffer class from woopsifuncs files.
<br/>

<br/>
- Graphics::drawLine() automatically calls drawVertLine() or drawHorizLine() if lines can be optimised.
<br/>

<br/>
- Fonts include doxygen comments.
<br/>

<a href="http://woopsi.org" target="_blank">http://woopsi.org</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The big change this time around is the rendering system.  Instead of each gadget needing to redraw itself when its appearance changes, gadgets now push their damaged rectangles to a queue that is redrawn every VBL.
<br/>
<br/>
In short - redrawing the screen is faster and the code is simpler.
<br/>
<br/>
The FreeType library and associated classes are no longer being distributed as part of Woopsi.  Instead, Lakedaemon has put together a distribution of Woopsi that includes ported libraries and extra classes.  These provide Woopsi with a wealth of extra functionality.  His distribution can be found here:

I don't know; Lakedaemon is distributing these, not me.  I do know that he built them with the portlibs system, and that his "XmlBox" Woopsi gadget depends on them (hence him distributing them).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've sent Lakedaemon a link to this thread so that he can take a look.  Like I said, it's not my distribution; Woopsi purposely doesn't include any external dependencies at all - barring libnds for the DS build, libfat for the file requester, and SDL for the Mac/Windows/Linux build - to make it as easy as possible to get it up and running.  That's why libfreetype and the related Woopsi font classes are no longer part of Woopsi.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hullo. 
<br/>
<br/>
Technically, I'm not installing the libraries. 
<br/>
<br/>
As I need them to compile the classes that add some features to the woopsi library, I just put them in a directory, in a somewhat tidy way, to be able to use them in the makefile that build the classes and the 2 provided examples. 
<br/>
<br/>
But I don't deploy them/ I don't try to add them to the devkitpro folder structures/path (but I'll make any change you ant me to, no worries)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the ndsToolKit bitbucket repository is mainly a place where I put my source code. I made it public because I thought that there is some stuff there that could be usefull to other homebrewer (it definetely is usefull for me). 
<br/>
<br/>
Yet, I would like the build process to be really easy for someone/a beginner who want to test that and as the "xmlbox" widget requires lots of libraries : 
<br/>
libz
<br/>
libfreetype (for fonts)
<br/>
libpng, libjpeg (for images)
<br/>
libmxml (for xml)
<br/>
to ship precompiled libraries with a makefile/a script that made use of them was the best that I came up to. 
<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure that I have the dedication to provide as good a support for ndsToolKit that Ant is providing for woopsi (which is 3 years old) or Wintermute for devkitpro. I definetely don't want to make another Palib. 
<br/>
<br/>
Just contributing a little bit to the homebrew community via ports and some classes would be just fine by me. ^^
<br/>
<br/>
So, I'll make the changes that winterMute will ask to get my contributiuon back in line. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also, is there a way we could contribute ports to portlibs ?
<br/>
For example, I read somewhere that pthread had been ported, etc.., is there a central place where we could see/download/know about the libraries that have been ported to the nds ?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Woopsi 0.99.6 is now available from the Woopsi website:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://woopsi.org" target="_blank">http://woopsi.org</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Other than a few minor enhancements to the Debug class, this release just contains bug fixes.
<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of points to note about this release.  First of all, it is built with the latest versions of devKitARM and libnds (r32 and 1.4.8 respectively).  Due to changes in the FIFO system, the current version of desmume is not compatible with this release.  You'll either have to wait for the next version of desmume or compile it yourself from the SVN repository before you upgrade your release of devKitARM.
<br/>
<br/>
libnds 1.4.8 includes a bug in line 661 of nds/arm9/videoGL.h.  See the following link for the fix:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://devkitpro.org/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=2277" target="_blank">http://devkitpro.org/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=2277</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Note that you can still use Woopsi with older versions of devKitARM; you'll just need to compile the library yourself.  This is very simple; just open a command line to the Woopsi/Woopsi/libwoopsi folder, type "make clean" and then type "make".
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, one of the new features in the Debug class is a vsnprintf() method.  This method triggers a GCC warning about va_list mangling changes in GCC 4.4.  This is neither a problem in Woopsi or in devKitARM; it's actually the result of a bizarre decision by the GCC team to include news items as compiler warnings:

<br/>
<br/>
Wintermute intended to fix this for devKitARM r27, but this obviously never happened:
