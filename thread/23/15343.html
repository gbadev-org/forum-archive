    <h4>#153968 - anomalous_underdog - Tue Apr 08, 2008 7:17 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. If any of you own a Nintendo DS, I made an on-screen keyboard using hex-shaped keys instead of rectangular ones. It uses the QUONG layout made by <a href="http://www.strout.net/info/ideas/hexinput.html" target="_blank">http://www.strout.net/info/ideas/hexinput.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
If you're familiar with the FUNADY keyboard layout for the palm PDA, its kinda like that.
<br/>
<br/>
from the hexinput article:
<br/>
<ol type="1">
<br/>
<li>You can input a letter by tapping it, or by dragging to it from a neighboring letter.
<br/>
</li><li>Letters are arranged in a hexagonal grid so that every one has six neighbors, and all neighbors are equally easy to reach.
<br/>
</li><li>Letters are arranged to optimize text input in a particular language (English, in this case).
<br/>
</li></ol>
<br/>

<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>its only a demo, you won't be able to save/load the typed text (although I will use this program to make an actual text editor)
<br/>
</li><li>the text cursor doesn't blink yet
<br/>
</li><li>the upper screen is currently used for debug. in the future, that area will be used as non-monospaced text display too
<br/>
</li><li>cut, copy, paste of text not yet implemented
<br/>
</li><li>no unicode support yet

Message:
<br/>
Bugfix: TextBox::mLineData would have elements more than the available display lines.
<br/>
<br/>
Bugfix: Graphical cursor would move up when inserting new chars when they shouldn't have.
<br/>
<br/>
Bugfix: Made sure graphical cursor doesn't get stuck to a position somewhere beyond what is possible (when backspacing at the end of a word-wrapped line wherein the backspacing made the line not word-wrapped anymore). (I simply brought back the code removed in r98).
<br/>
<br/>
Bugfix: Now TextBox::clearLeftOverSpace() is always called on every call to TextBox::refreshTextDisplay(). This is to ensure display lines that should be cleared are cleared.
<br/>
<br/>
Refactoring: Added private function TextBox::whichDisplayLineCursorIsIn()

Message:
<br/>
Bugfix: When inserting a char at the end of text, and the line became word-wrapped because of that newly inserted char, the cursor was not getting updated properly. Additionaly, if that caused a vertical scroll down, the line wouldn't get cleared.
<br/>
<br/>
Bugfix: When inserting a new char at the beggining of a display line, but that display line is part of word-wrapped line: if the char to insert was thin enough, it would be displayed at the line above, so the cursor should go upwards too, instead it stayed where it was.
<br/>
<br/>
Bugfix: The first TextLine was not getting the proper offset value if vertical scrolling had occured.
<br/>
<br/>
Refactoring: TextBox::isCursorInAWordWrappedLine() now uses TextLine data
<br/>
<br/>
Refactoring: TextBox::moveTextCursorToEndOfPrevLine() has a new override function, one that uses TextLine data. TextBox::moveTextCursorLeft(const s16) makes use of this.
<br/>
<br/>
TextLine::length now no longer includes the newline in its value

Yeah, actually lack of DSOrganize's hexinput support was what made me do this in the first place. I can make a patch and upload a modified DSOrganize 3.2 somewhere, I'll try it in the weekend.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't guarantee that it'll get integrated in the official release though. I've read how Shaun Taylor reacts to suggestions. He can get.. haughty. He's said it himself that he doesn't like other people touching his source code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'd suggest you modify the source of 3.1129 (Birthday release, although my number memory my be wrong I'm 100% sure the Birthday release was the last stable one.

Hard. I'm no coding guru.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry to those who were expecting me to add hexinput on DSOrganize.
<br/>
<br/>
I took a look. While its possible, the source code is so convoluted, I might as well start from scratch (I have distant plans for that). I really have better ideas on how to waste my time. Its no wonder dragonminded himself gave up on adding hexinput back then.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the BLARGH Text Editor I'm working on and DSOrganize are both licensed in GPL, so anyone willing enough is free to have a look at my source code and somehow put it in DSOrganize.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When I was done with this and it didnt scroll at all, I tried to erase it all.

yes, lolz! I'm really sorry I didn't bother to mention that, but yeah, it has that bug. I realize it'll be sooner or later that someone else will point it out. what happens is it tries to clear lines out of its display range.

<br/>
Sorry, you lost me there. Did you mean you were pressing backspace but the letters getting removed were far from where the text cursor is? Its most likely a misalignment between where the "text cursor" really is (in terms of the data in memory) and where the text cursor (the one that you see on the screen) is. what happened is the vertical scrolling currently doesn't take word-wrapped lines into account yet, so the text cursor got misaligned (i'm going to fix that too)

well, honestly I'm more comfortable coding in a desktop pc, but, yeah, you could do that.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to use this text editor mainly for taking notes. In the future I'm gonna make it a wiki editor, something like <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/" target="_blank">tiddlywiki</a>
<br/>
<br/>
one of the things I want to experiment in is being able to save/load the text file to/from your pc via wifi. something like a hotsync in palm pda. I'm looking at <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFTP" target="_blank">uftp</a>. just an experiment though, I'm not sure if I'll really add it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">that would own... like... what was it called, midiwifi? I think that there are programs out there that use something like that... that would kick! Be like having all of your text files on your gameboy without having to use up all the memory. Also save a lot of time transferring. Sweet idea, I can't wait to see how this works out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've checked it out, dsmidiwifi is used for controlling midi devices. its not at all related to transferring arbitrary data to/from ds to a pc.
<br/>
<br/>
the closest I saw was <a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">dsftp</a>. it turns your ds into a ftp server. I tried it out, but it couldn't pick up my wifi router's signal.
<br/>
<br/>
there's also <a class="postlink" href="http://donotjava.netsons.org/index.php/dsup/" target="_blank">dsup</a>, but I couldn't compile the program that would be running on the pc. there was some missing header file "arpa/inet.h" or something. I'll have to look into it more.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by anomalous_underdog on Mon Apr 28, 2008 6:32 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

KillerMapper is pretty much saying that the hunt and peck has a lot more hunting than with the more familiar QWERTY layout in DSOrganize. Adding Dvorak and QWERTY support in addition to QUONG might help reduce complaints.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Well, its only natural, one would find it difficult to use something he's not used to.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't talked about it in this thread but I'm actually planning on adding OPTI, Quikwrite, and QWERTY I guess.
<br/>
<br/>
I really encourage you to try out alternative keyboard layouts though. Having used a PDA for 4 years I can say QWERTY only encumbers text input in stylus-based devices. It works good for two hand typing though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
