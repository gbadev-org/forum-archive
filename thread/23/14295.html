    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Imagine, the day I decide to check on any updates, there happens to be one!
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The GUI artworks are not ready, so you have a ?naked? and not very pretty GUI, but at least, you have the multi languages support!
<br/>
<br/>
You can check if your language is correct.
<br/>
You can choose one of the language in the firmware or some language by editing the snemul.cfg :
<br/>
# Language of GUI
<br/>
# -1 -&gt; Use firmware settings
<br/>
Firmware languages:
<br/>
# 0 -&gt; Japanese (Katakana only)
<br/>
# 1 -&gt; English
<br/>
# 2 -&gt; French
<br/>
# 3 -&gt; German
<br/>
# 4 -&gt; Italian
<br/>
# 5 -&gt; Spanish
<br/>
Non firmware languages:
<br/>
# 106 -&gt; Portuguese
<br/>
# 107 -&gt; Catalan
<br/>
# 108 -&gt; Polish
<br/>
# 109 -&gt; Dutch
<br/>
# 110 -&gt; Danish
<br/>
<br/>
Various External RAM packages can be used to improve large rom emulation, see snemul.cfg for more informations.
<br/>
<br/>
Scaling support has three modes :
<br/>
- Full screen : nearly like snezzids
<br/>
- Half scaling : ?smart? scaling, only reduce half the backgrounds, and doesn?t squish sprites. It looks quite fine in games.
<br/>
- No scaling : no scaling at all, classic SNEmulDS mode, still default
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the complete list of changes compated to 0.5 beta:
<br/>
<br/>
- New GUI using framebuffer for sub screen
<br/>
- Better human interface, improved file selector (alphabetical sorted), buttons, check boxes, multi choose zones, etc.
<br/>
- New GUI supports joypad (joypad is not supported when emulator is running however).
<br/>
- Multi language support (more than 10 supported, including katakan japanese !)
<br/>
- Memory pak support (Opera RAM, Slot 2 card reader, etc. using libram) with paging or with large ROM mapping
<br/>
- Scaling with pseudo bi-linear filtering and sprites squishing : full screen scaling (like snezzids), half scaling (half scaled and without sprites squishing), and no scaling (classic snemulds mode)
<br/>
- Autiomatic SRAM saving when needed
<br/>
- Some other bugfixes and improvements in GUI
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, neat. I'll test it with the usual ROMs:
<br/>
<br/>
F-Zero: Menus even more broken, gameplay just as good as it was last version (playable with very minor graphic glitches).
<br/>
Mario All-Stars: Still freezes on loading. Funny, the readme says large ROM (&gt;3MB) support even for slot-1, I would assume it works on GBAMP too.
<br/>
Super Mario World: Same as last version; totally playable (I played through the whole thing :-p) with some minor graphic bugs.
<br/>
Tetris Attack: Also the same as the last version: broken backgrounds and the blocks don't move properly.
<br/>
<br/>
I see it still doesn't check that ARM7 has initialized, so if you launch it from a faulty loader, you'll get a ROM list but not be able to select anything. Also, it doesn't verify that the default directory exists, nor let you change directories; if it doesn't, you just get an empty list. Still just the 8 save states per game, well I've never needed them all anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
The improved GUI is great, but it looks like not much was fixed. I wonder why the Japanese option can't support Hiragana?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#142540 - dantheman - Wed Oct 10, 2007 6:39 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as I know, All-stars should not be freezing, and yes you should be able to utilize the paging system for large binaries.  Regardless, the Tetris Attack scrolling issue is due to a function of the SNES that cannot be directly mapped to the DS's 2D hardware.  Only a slow software renderer could fix that.
<br/>
<br/>
For the language, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.snemul.com/ds/?p=34" target="_blank">this post</a> indicates that the current charset is limited to the languages it can support, though this is expected to change in the future.
<br/>
<br/>
Archeide has stated that he has taken most of the time since 0.5 Beta off entirely, so the changes for this version have been made fairly recently.
<br/>
<br/>
The main problem I'm finding is that the slot-2 RAM is not working for my Supercard miniSD in regard to large binaries.  It appears that while it works if you launch the SNES binary from slot-1 and use the slot-2 card solely for RAM, it freezes upon booting if you use the slot-2 card for both launching the SNES binary and as RAM.  A few other slot-2 users have reported the same issue.  I have changed the snemul.cfg file in an attempt to force it to use the old paging system, but it still attempts (and fails) to use my Supercard's RAM.  Smaller SNES binaries load fine; it's just ones that would normally require the paging system that fail to load.  Archeide appears to be looking into the issue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I haven't tried the MazezaM homebrew that tepples mentioned, but most of the SNES homebrews I've seen are scene demos or even just cracktros.  It actually would be somewhat interesting to test those out in SNEmulDS since they often used some rather complicated graphical effects and hardware tricks.

(DANG that was a lot of rebooting to catch all that info.)
<br/>
<br/>
One thing that caught my attention right away was the Country.  The game is clearly a (JU), yet it thinks it's in PAL format.
<br/>
<br/>
(And yes, the Title is exactly 21 y's with 2 dots above them. :P)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I am running a supported homebrew device with 32MB of ext. RAM (M3 perfect microSD)
<br/>
<br/>
I do know that it runs on SNES hardware and in Snes9x and ZSNES v.1.36 and earlier.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First off thanks to anyone who can help me with this. I've been spending hours trying to get Chrono Trigger and Secret of Mana 2 working on my DS Lite. I have the following setup:
<br/>
<br/>
- Black Nintendo DS Lite
<br/>
- M3 Lite
<br/>
- Passcard
<br/>
- 1GB SanDisk MicroSD Card
<br/>
<br/>
The only ROM i've managed to get working is FF Mystic Quest... and its really buggy. Thank you for any help.
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: When i try and load up Chrono Trigger and Secret of Mana 2, it says in the code "large rom detected" then changes to the menu and a white top screen
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE #2: I've tried it with the new SLOT-2 fix as well and am still having trouble</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try changing "MapExtMem = 1" to "MapExtMem = 0" in snemul.cfg.  That fixed it for me.  Note that you still get the speedup of additional slot-2 ram, even when set to 0.  It just uses the ram like a disk with paging enabled instead of mapping it directly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The DKC games essentially contain their own built-in speedhacks (in a manner of speaking) so disable any speedhacks SNEmulDS may be applying, as they probably make things worse.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, they automatically stop the CPU at the end of each frame rather than entering an idle loop like nearly all other SNES games do.  Very convenient, really.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
