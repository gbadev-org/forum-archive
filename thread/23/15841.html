Reality: That was the idea when I first started, and is still my goal for the future of this project. However, my second kid is due in a few months and I'll end up being even busier than I am now.

Really impressive! How many shadows can have a player at the same time?

Too much players at the same place make some player vanishing. So I suppose we won't have lot of characters at the same time.

When I put start I see some boxes. Those boxes are the collisions?

<br/>
- my lighting stuff uses just the hardware lights only, so up to 4 shadows per object (not in the tiles yet though)
<br/>
- yea, NWN models are a tad high in vertex/poly count for the DS (IMO), but I don't possess the skill to "down-sample" them. The shadows are actually the last thing sent to the geometry engine, so if I go above the 2048 threshold you start seeing missing/flicking shadows. when I'm ready for a change in content, the models I'll use will be a tad lower in vertex count and everything will speed up, more creatures on screen, push out the far clip plane, etc, etc. NWN models are just for testing, really
<br/>
- i forgot about that box button, it was there to help test initial AABB code, that's all... they're the AABBs around objects and mesh groups

<br/>
You're right. I use NWNExplorer to get the model then I use Unwrap3D with the NWN plugin to import, clean it up, export it out, and it's finally packed into my own silly little binary format</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For the poly count, yes I thought polys was high too, especially for the big monster in the house. (also maybe you can disable the fog in little rooms like in the house).

<br/>
That's a good idea... I could dynamically adjust the far plane based on the number of polys in the scene or something. The fog is only there to hide the clip plane (which looks ugly as it chops stuff up :) I'll look into that in the future

I haven't really thought about it much. An RPG would be a ridiculous amount of work, but I certainly am a fan of the genre. Maybe it makes more sense for me to just build things into the engine to allow others to create (if I even get this far). You know, scripting, map editor, release some kind of model converter to use in the engine/map editor. I dunno. I guess if someone really wanted to fiddle with it now with what's already in there they only have to unpack the rom with ndstool, play around with the .map files, and then repack it up with ndstool. I haven't actually done that but I don't see why it wouldn't work. I'm sure all kinds of horrible ugly bugs and other funny weirdness would surface too ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Does anyone have a DSi (and a compatible flashcart like Acekard 2i or EZ-Flash Vi) yet? If so, I was hoping they would be willing to give my rom a quick test run to find out if it's gonna work.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It seems the Fandian build gives a black screen with R4 cards on the very first load. If you power off and load again, it'll work. I've so far been able to determine that the bug seems to lie within the EFS lib during the init stage. It goes to la-la land on attempting to return from SearchDirectory(). And when I say "doesn't return" I don't mean the SearchDirectory() function failed because of some FAT/no-file thing... it actually doesn't return at all to SearchDirectory()'s caller. Some kind of stack thing I assume. Anyway, once the rom path is written it doesn't need to call SearchDirectory() anymore... hence why it works the second time around.

Do other flashcarts have this same problem (black screen first load, fine on the second)? Anyone wish to report their results?

<br/>
<br/>
The point lights are done with the hardware. I basically just set the light direction (and colour) of the light(s) on every vertex. The light direction is slightly different on every vertex because it's a point light and the colour/shading is different also because of the attenuation function (and other factors). Dynamic point lights are the same thing, except they're updated live :)
<br/>
<br/>
There's a few static point lights set up in the regular Fandian maps but I never set up any dynamic ones yet. If you want to see them just go into the builder (you may already know the following, but I'll jot it down for others if they're interested):
<br/>
<br/>
- Tap on the tile icon (top right) and use the d-pad to go through the different ones. Push A to choose one. Push A again to set it.
<br/>
- Maybe put a dude in there too... tap the creature icon, push A, push A
<br/>
- by default, I have a simple white directional light already set. It's the little white cone you see at the beginning of building a new map (if you can't really see it, just zoom with L or R). Anyway, delete it so that the point light will be easier to see when you create it: tap on the white cone to select it and push X.
<br/>
- So, now that things are nice and dark, tap on the candle icon. Use the d-pad to scroll through the different lights (directional is the cone, point light is the sphere). Push A when on the sphere to choose the point light, but don't push A again to set it yet. Now just move it around with the d-pad. You can hold Y and press up or down on the d-pad for Y-axis movement. You can move all the objects around like this, not just the lights. Also, you can rotate objects/tiles with L/R while in selected/highlighted mode.
<br/>
<br/>
The light colour is just chosen randomly. If you can't really see it try making another one and hope for something brighter :)
<br/>
<br/>
As for the shadows, they're drawn based on the positions of the lights (directional or point light).
<br/>
<br/>
That's all I can think of right now.

A while back I released a model compiler and wrote up some notes about what to do in regards to this. The compiler now is somewhat different since then as is the model format. If this is really something you want to play with then let me know and I'll re-build the compiler and try to find some notes on models/tiles/etc (don't hold your breath tho). The next couple of things I wanted to do was to change the model source format to XSI 3.6 and read custom files off of the FAT drive. Currently you can (kinda) build and save maps using existing models, tiles, etc. located in the rom. The idea I was/am going for is to build (and play) your own adventures/modules on the DS: create maps and link them together, add monsters, etc, etc. and it would save all of it in a sub-directory on your SD card. And, if you wanted to, you could put your own custom built model files, textures, scripts, etc. inside those so-called directories and Fandian would just read them in (just like it does for the resources inside the rom - the code is there I just haven't tested it fully) and allow you to use them in the builder or game. I just thought it'd be cool to drag'n'drop adventures onto your SD card that were built by others. And that you could make a full module/adventure (or even just a cool map) on the DS itself. On the bus. On my way to work. 'Cause the bus is soooo long and boring.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yea, the 3D hardware is actually quite cool IMO. To me, it actually seems smarter and makes more sense then if you were thinking vanilla OpenGL API coding. I think Nintendo did a bang up job on this 3D hardware implementation considering the console that it is. Funny thing actually, when I first did positional lights it was looking pretty good on the DS but simply did not work with no$ at all. I discussed this with Martin at the time and the OpenGL code in his emulator was the reason he said (too limiting, couldn't emulate the console's 3D exactly). It must have bugged him too because not too long afterward he released software-lights without OpenGL (v2.5) followed by his nocash 3d software renderer (v2.6) and everything worked awesome.

Sounds like it, but it's actually not too bad. I do some things in parallel. I mean, there's seperate math and matrix hardware. I dump things on them and let the CPU do something else. I do this heavily with the quat animation stuff too, I come back for the results later :)

With some decent data structures and a bit of optimization where it makes sense helps a ton. Did you try moving a positional light source around in the builder with some tiles and couple creatures set out? It does pretty good considering the poly limit will be max'd out. This is, however, just a tech demo. I'm sure a real game would never sacrifice CPU for such a feature :)

Yes, using pos_test. The matrix/math hardware is great. I also store a bunch of very select and useful matrices in the matrix stack and only use matrix_restore when needed. I do little pushing and popping, waste of time.

Yeah I followed your instructions to move lights in the builder.. its an impressive setup. I tried to spot if the lighting changes on enemies during their animations, it seems like it does, which suggests its completely dynamic.   I'd love to hear more about the kinds of data structures and optimizations you use to make the recalculation cheap.  And I can definitely see a use for this in games with not much more going on.

I knew about that matrix restore method for rendering.. but if I got this right you're saying that you use the matrix transform hardware to transform vertices into world space, grab the result and dump them (minus the light positions) onto the math hardware ready to normalize for you as lighting vectors.  And you interleave both the matrix and math hw operations with cpu calculations to offset the cost.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I read there are 2 kind animation, i hope the terms are right, they are:
<br/>
1. skeletal animation... 
<br/>
you must have a good math,so in animation you can rotate, translate or do anyhing to the vertices of the model to animate it. but I don't recommend this animation because in libnds, there is a huge difference in rendering delay between using display list and drawing each faces into a mode
<br/>
<br/>
2. keyframe animation
<br/>
I love this kind of animation, you just need to create the model of every frame possible.. so if your character in the game is attacking a monster, try to make 4-5 frames of character slashing and 3-4 frames of monster getting hit..
<br/>
after modelling them, just export them from 3DSmax to 3ds format. You can use NDS model exporter to convert them into binary display list. You Just need to call them in your code.. give delay to each frame.. you can use timer or whatever to give delay...
<br/>
This modelling take more spaces... 
<br/>
<br/>
If you have problem with basic modelling, I suggest you to learn from youtube.. It helps me alot..

Come back to 3D: for me no problem if the game use keyframe animation. But I have doubts about this: in the "fandian", what kind of animation have been used ? Cuz I like very much. If it?s keyframe animation, is excelent and I need something like it !!! Can I move the camera about the character, even in key frame.. ? So, excelent. If you see the movie on youtube, I use keyframe animations with sprites, but I can?t  change the view, camera, or other thing. I think that Shining Force 3 use keyframe animation on Sega Saturn, that have a hardware more simple than DS. 
<br/>
What I need: make a simple scene (depend on situation, a town, a river, a camp, but simple, like SF3, etc... ), put 2 characters animeted that will fight and can move the camera on this action (with thack of view pre-definite), in other words, change my 2D battle scene in a pre-definite 3D battle action scene, like SF3. Where and how can I do this ? Tutorial helps ?

<br/>
can you pls give us example how to do skeletal animation? I'm just curious, because I use display list and keyframe animation. 
<br/>
<br/>
If I use skeleton animation, my method is to load object from a text file converted from .ASE file definition, So I can get coordinate from each vertex and I can modify it. But with it, rendering will be really slow. 
<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe your method is using display list and you split the object (like human) into several limbs and then move them separately?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Your best bet is to look for a simple example or tutorial about skeletal animation on the net. I don't know anything about your .ase format but the idea is that every vertex is associated with a joint/bone which have position and rotation represented by quaternions. As each frame goes by, you interpolate between the key frames and your concatenated matrices from parent to children get applied to the vertex. I hope I explained that somewhat correctly. Also, I don't use display/call lists so I can't shed any light on that.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not sure what you mean by "vertex RAM is only about 1000.. ", but the ds can display about 2000 triangles per frame - it does not matter if it is using display lists or not.
<br/>
<br/>
edit: things can get slow and a little wonky if you try to send too much each frame - for instance sending 3000 triangles each frame.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I essentially do what elhobbs said earlier about glVertex calls.
<br/>
<br/>
I use an external ascii file that defines the model similar to your ASE format, I assume. Offline, I have a program that parses, converts from float, triangle strips, vertex packs, does joint/bone stuff, etc, etc, and then is finally written to a my own little binary format. These "compiled" files just sit in the rom's Nitro filesystem and get loaded straight into RAM, ready to go. It's a simple matter of sending the packed vertex to the DS. Well, there's normals and other crap too... but that's the idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I?m crazy with all that people are writing here... hehehe... I?d like a kind of "engine" to help me, a way more simple that I can get my 3D models from Blender and show than in sub-screen on DS, even by keyframe animation, but with play, pause and camera controls and together my 2D engine, with 4 elements; ground scene, 2 characters and some times 3D fight/magic effects. I know make this with animation lowpoly on Blender. Is really necessary that I "learn" about  how to do 3D on DS to show this there? For example, I mixed the lib "thSound and thMp3" with my 2D engine and worked perfectly.  Isn?t there a similar easy way ( already made, free ) for 3D ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
