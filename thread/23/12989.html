    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everybody! I'm proud to present you <span style="font-weight: bold">Ka-BoOm</span>, my first game on DS. You can <a class="postlink" href="http://stravingo.over-blog.fr/" target="_blank">download version 0.1 on my devblog</a>. This is not a revolutionary game as this is "only" a minesweeper. However, I'm trying to make it as fun as possible, with some improvement on gameplay. You can play on terrains that are as large as 1 screen (normal), 1x2 screens (double) or 2x2 screens (huge).
<br/>
The game is not totally finished, I estimate it is 85% ready. I have to improve the graphics, to code highscores management, to finish the menu, and to add rumble during explosions.
<br/>
Beware, the game must be played on a real DS and not on an emulator, because of speed issues, as well as graphical bugs due to alpha blending of 3D sprites. And there is another reason: you need the mic!
<br/>
Indeed, the most original feature of Ka-BoOm is the following: in all others minesweepers, it can happen that you clic on a cell containing a bomb at the beginning of the game, without having time to sweep an area. So you loose, without having any clue that there was a bomb in this cell. Sooo frustrating ;)
<br/>
In Ka-BoOm, when this case occurs, the bomb doesn't explose immediately. The bomb appears on the upper screen and you have 2 seconds to blow in the mic to extinguish the fuse ! Have fun !  :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">tried it out, and it works on M3DSS, but sometimes while holding r and selecting a tile it will click as if normally, and if its a bomb you lose, so you might want to fix that in the next version</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
