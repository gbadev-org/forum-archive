    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
as you may notice, I entered the NeoFlash with
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.neoflash.com/forum/index.php/topic,3957.msg27384.html" target="_blank">Beup Live 0.3d</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I added DLDI support and it will now work with the new DS Lite's.
<br/>
<br/>
But it seemed to be this version had some boot up problems while it searches for WiFi with some flashcards
<br/>
(Like the M3 Simply, the R4 and the Max Media Dock).
<br/>
<br/>
I fixed this bug now.

Known bug: Time is at 00:00 will fix this as soon as possible.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
This version is too late to enter the NeoFlash compo, so I couldn't post it anymore :)
<br/>
<br/>
So.. this version isn't joining the compo...

(Just to let you know guys) :)

<br/>
works great now on my M3 Simply, thanks ;)
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, don't know if this has been reported :
<br/>
<br/>
if you press Enter (without any text or draw), it sends an empty message....on real messenger, if you hit enter without text, you can't send it.
<br/>
<br/>
drawing do not work anymore....you can draw, but it's not sent...and you can't receive draws from your partner</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

@Badablek: It DOES work.. but it doesnt work with all cli?nts.. I really don't know..

The drawing works for some people.. and for some people, it doesn't...

<br/>
I know the "Enter" key.. This is just a "feature" that was always present on Beup :)
<br/>
Funny to spam and flood with empty messages ;) hehe

@cartesia: Go to my site <a href="http://HtheB.area-ds.com" target="_blank">http://HtheB.area-ds.com</a> and click on Beup.

<br/>
<br/>
Couple of suggestions:
<br/>
- How about including the Beup directories so that folks can select avatars etc.?
<br/>
- How about dropping the 'fixed' from the name but changing the release letter? I've seen people trying 0.3 fixed thinking it's the best version, only  to find that it doesn't work and later being pointed off to 0.3 'final'.
<br/>
<br/>
All in all minor things, keep up the good work HtheB.

It really depends on what errors he got. It could have been his own dev environment not being correctly set up. It's really common that one has to "fix errors" in order to recompile someone else's project.
<br/>
<br/>
The questions are, how much code did he rewrite (show me) and how much code and new functionalities did he add himself (show me)?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What I need proof for is to what depth HtheB has furthered the development of Beup. Only that will tell us whether he is qualified to enter a compo with the project.

Also, it seems that you have contact with HtheB. Is he notified of this discussion? Though I can't imagine that he isn't. Perhaps he's too busy enjoying his Wii...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think envy is the reason behind Lick's post.
<br/>
<br/>
But I feel Lick is making s a valid point. I'll explain...
<br/>
<br/>
Beup was developed and written by kevinc. I've been using it since 0.2 or something and it's a fantastic application - my thanks to kevinc!
<br/>
<br/>
HtheB's version was derived from the source of 0.3 as kevinc freely released the source code to on his site, to which HtheB added a new skin.
<br/>
<br/>
When Microsoft changed server address kevinc mentioned the new server details on this forum and said (if i remember correctly) he didn't have the time to recompile it with the new details,  and HtheB then recompiled his version with the new server details and we all had to move to that to be able to connect again.
<br/>
<br/>
HtheB then recently added the DLDI to it, to get it working on more flashcards. 
<br/>
<br/>
Then last week we see HtheB win the NeoFlash contest, without any credit going to kevinc at all, and that's where the problem really is. The core of Beup is the work of kevinc and not HtheB, so is it not right that kevinc gets credit too for the bulk of the work of beup as apart from DLDI and a new skin it is his work afterall?
<br/>
<br/>
It's not the first time HtheB has 'failed' to credit kevinc, it's been seen before on this forum. And looking around other forums (google is great to find them!) you can see that people percieve HtheB as the full coder of Beup which isn't the case.
<br/>
<br/>
I only hope kevinc is still working if he has the time on version 0.4, as mentioned on his blog last year. (And hopefully a fix for the SSL connection failed that has been plaguing us all for the last three days or so due to microsoft doing something with the servers!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You don't seem to be a programmer of any kind, so I can understand that you don't understand the hardship one goes through to get working code. Especially when one has to make an entire protocol (MSN) work on a limited device. And when someone receives benefit off your hard work, you surely will feel screwed ten times over.
<br/>
I don't think KevinC has any knowledge of this case yet, and I hope he never will because it's so backstabbing.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I wasn't following the NeoCompo at all until Alfatreze alerted me about the results. So I didn't pick "before" or "after", I just picked "right now".<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm following your position.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm no coder, and i don't claim to be, but i can understand whats being said here.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, i don't want to diss HtheB, or anger him etc. That's because i appreciate what he has done to fix/improve beup.
<br/>
<br/>
But it does clear that the entry to the competition could be invalid, and if so, accepting the prize is unjust, when other developers who have made a bigger effort to furthur the homebrew community may go unrewarded.
<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly, i hope that we all stay civil in this argument.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: and after looking at that review, i'll say that is seriously ridiculous.

The least you could do is borrow a ds and make a proper review!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by OSW on Sun Apr 15, 2007 11:22 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

i dont see how you can say HtheB hasnt given him credit when its plainly writen on his site in the section where you download beup and if HtheB didnt take over this application we would all not have a working application now would we? anyways this is not the proper area in these forums to discuss this im surprized it hasnt been locked by a mod yet if you feel you need to continue this discussion i think you should make your own topic in the proper forum but i dont see why this needs to be continued any more because its getting no where and will end up no where

<br/>
<br/>
This post pertains only the source code of the program. I am aware about HtheB giving technical support and troubleshooting advise, which may have influenced the votes. I'm not here to speak about that.
<br/>
<br/>
HtheB has given me the source of Beup Live, and I have reviewed the differences.
<br/>
<br/>
The changes amount to about 15 lines of code in 2 files, which are: 
<br/>
- A new option for auto-connect (about 5 lines)
<br/>
- Modifications for the new FAT lib (about 10 lines)
<br/>
Please notice beup has about 9800 lines. So I'm afraid I can't say beup live is a considerable difference code-wise. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you ask my personal opinion, I didn't like the fact that beup was allowed in the competition again, and even worse, that the judges let it win. However, it's not my contest o_o
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry that I haven't paid attention to this topic (or have read the PMs, for which I apologize), I'll be back tomorrow to keep reading.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

this thread was started to tell people about the latest version of BeUp.. it's been brought up that the no one's beup is working properly.. due to an SSL Connection Failure.. then it went sour with accusations of code thieving.. 
<br/>
<br/>
i think it's shitty if someone takes credit for someone else's work, i know because i produce electronic music and it's happened to me before.. IF that's the case.. however it isn't. it's completely irrelevant to this thread. 
<br/>
<br/>
i just bought a ds for my wife and got a couple friends and my brother into it too all within the last couple weeks. It wasn't the games that sold them on the ds it was the fact that you get an mp3 player, movie viewer, mini computer as well as gaming console all in one (with the appropriate hardware) but the real selling feature was beup. (kick ass app.. thanks to kevinc for that and htheb for keeping it alive..)
<br/>
<br/>
anyways.. why am i telling you all this? because it's irrelevant! just like this thread has gotten and..
<br/>
<br/>
beup STILL doesn't work! lol.

i give total respect to the developers for doing what they do.. thanks for all you've done.. but it seems too much energy has been wasted here on bickering, when it could have been used for so many better things ie. coding.. fixing the SSL Connect Failure error..
<br/>
<br/>
so about that SSL Connect Failed error.. did i miss somethng? is a fix for that in the mail or do i gotta go buy a psp?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The last time I saw him was on a Dutch forum, requesting people to vote for him, did anyone ever wonder how the votes got so high in the "Should HtheB get his Wii" thread? The answer lies here...

<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately.. It didn't help (I had MORE votes :)) 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But neoflash didn't want to give me my Wii.. That's why they backstabbed me.. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In short: 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to certain complications: I still don't have a DS.. :( (I would sell the Wii and buy a DS) 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And update BEUP??????????? 
<br/>
<br/>
Too bad people.. A lot of dudes called me a thief.. 
<br/>
Why? Because I updated the source.. (Because I took over the project from kevinC?) :S 
<br/>
<br/>
And I think what Neoflash did was just lame.. 
<br/>
Thanks to Lick.... 
<br/>
<br/>
I thank you for all your support!  :)
<br/>
<br/>
And, oh wow.. I saved a conversation with NeoFlash...
