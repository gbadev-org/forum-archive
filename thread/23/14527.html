    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">PuzzleManiak is a port of the marvelous Simon Tatham?s Portable Puzzle Collection on Nintendo DS.
<br/>
<br/>
It's also a great mp3 player, thanks Thomas.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are the main features:
<br/>
<br/>
    * All 27 games are ported on NDS: Tents, Dominosa, Mines, Bridges, Light Up (aka Akari), Pattern (aka Picross), Net (aka Netwalk), Untangle (aka Planarity), Sudoku (aka Solo), Galaxies, Slitherlink (aka Loopy), Blackbox, Mastermind (aka Guess), Map, Filling, Solitaire (aka Pegs), Sixteen, Fifteen, Slant, Rectangles, Netslide, Samegame, Unequal, Flip, Inertia, Twiddle and Pyramid (adaptation of Cube).
<br/>
    * Support of graphic themes
<br/>
    * Daily challenge downloadable via wifi
<br/>
    * Score submission via wifi
<br/>
    * Global ranking computed from all scores submitted available on NDS/Website
<br/>
    * Game translated into 7 languages:
<br/>
          o English
<br/>
          o French
<br/>
          o Italian
<br/>
          o Spanish
<br/>
          o Brazilian Portuguese
<br/>
          o German
<br/>
          o Dutch
<br/>
    * MP3 Support (thanks TOM)
<br/>
    * When the Nintendo DS is closed and an mp3 is playing, pressing buttons ?L? / ?R? will go to the previous/next song in your mp3 playlist.
<br/>
=&gt; This feature can be disabled in new ?options? screen
<br/>
    * Past Daily Challenges can be played again and again (without submitting your scores, for sure!)
<br/>
    * Press ?Select? to change screen?s brightness
<br/>
    * Several players can play the game on the same Nintendo DS =&gt; For each one, a profile is stored so that the user keep his settings like language, colors, background, mp3 folder, mp3 options (repeat all, repeat one, mp3 path) and so on? The 3 players have their own score file, and a ?overall local ranking? is managed, so that you can train yourself against your scores, but also against all scores on your NDS.
<br/>
    * When displaying scores, you can switch between your scores, scores of other players, local overall scores and overall scores downloaded via wifi by pressing the Left / Right buttons.
<br/>
    * DLDI patching is required.
<br/>
    * PuzzleManiak file and ?PZMK? folder must be extracted on your linker root.
<br/>
    * The ?hall of fame? feature is back in this version 3.1 and some bugs found in the version 3.0 have been corrected.
<br/>
<br/>
The hall of fame replaces the old ?high scores? page (on web site).
<br/>
The hall of fame is divided in 4 rankings for each game/each level.
<br/>
These rankings are computed from the scores submitted:
<br/>
<br/>
          o Since the beginning of Puzzlemaniak
<br/>
          o Since midnight (GMT)
<br/>
          o Since the last 7 days(GMT)
<br/>
          o Since the last 30 days(GMT)
<br/>
<br/>
The hall of fame stores the 20 best scores of each game/level.
<br/>
That?s also the case of the Global Ranking, that is now computed for the 20 first players on each game/level (and scores are thus balanced to 200 instead of 100).
