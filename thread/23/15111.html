    <h4>#151777 - Michoko - Tue Mar 04, 2008 9:54 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
Here is my first homebrew project on the DS: <span style="font-weight: bold">LoneWolfDS - Flight From The Dark</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
This homebrew is adapted from a famous Gamebooks series called "Lone Wolf" and written by Joe Dever.
<br/>
<br/>
This version is based on the original US edition (the only one, with the Spanish version, which is currently freely available on the net) and allows to play the full first book without bothering with tedious elements like combats handling, random rolls, inventory management... All this is directly integrated into the gameplay, as my primary goal was to make a video game and not just an interactive ebook.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
You used the graphical elements realy well and made it look very professional.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you plan on porting the whole series. It was a blast to play through, no bugs or any kind of problem encountered.
<br/>
<br/>
I just noticed that you might want to restore the illustration, if present, to the second (top/left) screen when returning from the character data to the story. But that's no problem, and maybe it's intentional anyway ...
<br/>
<br/>
Also when a scene is multiple pages long sometimes a sentence is split between two pages which is kind of akward to read. A check to move the whole sentence to the next page would be nice. Also maybe you could add a scrolling mode where you don't flip pages but scroll down. This would take way some of the "book" feeling, but I think it would feel right too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot for the kinds words! :)
<br/>
<br/>
About porting the other books of the Lone Wolf series, yes, there will be more!
<br/>
<br/>
About other books written by other people, right now there is a copyright issue that prevents me to do it. We had the chance to get the Lone Wolf books due to the work done by the Project Aon team (who got a special authorization from Joe Dever to publish his work).
<br/>
<br/>
But I admit I'd really LOVE to port books like House of horror, which would be really fun due to its very specific atmosphere.
<br/>
<br/>
Now you know what you have to do: harass Steve Jackson until he gives his authorization ;)

I noticed that too. I also noticed that I like being able to select and deselect skills though, so maybe it's best if the weapon is selected after the skills are finalized...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">great project. i did email you about the m3 lite i hope you can find a fix for it. as of now the homebrew won't launch on the m3 lite.
<br/>
<br/>
i found some typos but only wrote one down =/. sorry i'll try to write more later.
<br/>
<br/>
on page 217 it says "sign above it that says: ____" and you didn't enter the name here. later on a different page the sign of the INN (i think it was) is named.
<br/>
<br/>
Also somewhere early on I remember there was a line the refered to the prince of the relm as a "her." I'll try to track that down and let you know.

keep up the good work!

A long shot...but might it be possible for the engine to support mp3 sounds as well as text-to-speach?
<br/>
Obviously not for the majority of the text, but letting you have specific sounds at certain points could potentialy open the door for audio-based puzzles. (not to mention ambient/sound effects)
<br/>
<br/>
Just a random idea, probably tricky to impliment.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

About text-to-speech, there is a full audio implementation of the book called Hyena though (but it's not exactly the same concept as what you described, I suppose).

    <h4>#154454 - MechaBouncer - Wed Apr 16, 2008 5:28 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I finally gave this a proper play through and must say I found it to be excellent. The way the game played took me back to similar "make your own adventure" books I used to read, but with a flair reminiscent of D&amp;D games. I must say I had never heard of this book series until this port, and frankly, I wouldn't want to play it any other way now. Not having to worry about having paper, pencils, dice or whatever to play it makes things so much easier to pick up. Not only that, but the graphics and sound really set the mood for the story, pulling you in all the more.
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that really bugged me is that you can't choose your weapon proficiency. It seems rather odd to just have it arbitrarily assigned to you, but that's coming from my D&amp;D preference and I'm sure the original books were like that. I can't fault you for sticking true to the original work.
<br/>
<br/>
One question I have is why do you still include the page numbers when there aren't really any pages anymore? You mentioned that it was ported from Project Aon's HTML port. I'm guessing they still referenced the page numbers? Are they referenced internally by those numbers or to have some kind of connection with the original books? Or was it just faster to leave the numbers in from the HTML port? Well, I suppose there are probably more reasons to leave them in than to remove them. I just found it a little humorous to have page references in a video game. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hehe yes, the Project Aon had the sections numbers included in the texts. And if I had removed the "Turn to XXX" statements, then it would have required to recreate the links on another portion of the sentence, which coulb be quite tedious in the end.
<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, I thought that keeping the sections numbers gave a bit of a nostalgic touch to it, and from the mails I receive, I think many people like to play it the old-school way :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everybody!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm pleased to announce a new release of LoneWolfDS v1.4. And the biggest addition is nothing less than a Spanish version! :D
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know, I had said that I would not do any translated version yet, but a guy called NewKuato contacted me some weeks ago, by providing all the book texts already translated. Moreover I must admit I was a bit euphoric because of the LoneWolfDS first place at the NEO compo, so I thought it would be worth a try. ;)
<br/>
My original concern was that it may take a lot of time to make a localized version, and hell, I was right! Without the amazing help from NewKuato and Urbatain El Cl?rigo, this project would have never seen the light. Those guys spent hours and hours testing the new translated engine, and I'm still impressed by the huge efforts they put into providing all translations and test reports. With such a great support, this translation has been really a positive experience!
<br/>
<br/>
But the second most important aspect is that with all those tests, a lot of bugs and events errors were detected and fixed, both in the Spanish and English version. Hence the new releases in both languages. Moreover, it has also helped stabilizing the engine for the second book (I've already started working on volume 2 too).
<br/>
<br/>
So here is the changelog:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">2008/04/27: version 1.4 (Recommended update!)
<br/>
- Fixed a memory leak during random rolls, making the numbers disappear after many rolls.
<br/>
- Fixed some vicious inventory bugs.
<br/>
- Fixed many sections.
<br/>
- Updated the events handling engine so future books will be easier to port.
<br/>
- Spanish version! (thanks A LOT to NewKuato and El Cl?rigo Urbatain!!!)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Before I get spammed with translations requests in all the languages of the world, let me say that I WON'T do any other language adaptations right now! It requires too much work and I prefer focusing on the second book now (so many things to do, so little time). Moreover, only the english and spanish versions are available for free on the net, so I'll stick to them right now.
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!! :)

PS: Please, don't upload the ROM files on any other site, since the Project Aon license requires me to host all projects based on their work on the Project Aon site itself. So please give the following download URL instead: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.projectaon.org/staff/frederic/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.projectaon.org/staff/frederic/index.php</a>
