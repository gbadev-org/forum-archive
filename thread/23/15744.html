    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After almost 2 years since the GBA version has been canceled due to GBA market death, DHG Games strikes back with an evolved version of Motocross Challenge for the Nintendo DS. You can have a preview of the game in this video:

<br/>
The game is still at an early stage of development and we are looking for a publishing deal once again.

<br/>
<br/>
the scene very much apprecated that you pulled out the gba version for free, rather than keeping it and let it catch dust.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Kojote</span>

<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that some of you spread this news accross other homebrew websites and it's very appreciated. 
<br/>
<br/>
According to the comments we had, the homebrew scene appreciated that we released the GBA version for free and now we feel your support for the DS version. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for that, it will certainly help us in breaking the "official / commercial / $ / publisher" wall.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">to spread the news further i would contact the likes of Engadget/Gizmodo/Joystiq/Kotaku/Slashdot/DS Fanboy
<br/>
<br/>
the only one you would need to write an article is for a slashdot submission.
<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck with your game :)

This is definitively something we would like to put in this game. We started to approach publishers and this is something we have to negociate: we want to do it, but not for free ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

that is really normal for a comercial quality piece of software like that, but just beware of licensing, if you used GPL or other third party open source tools/lib... (even if you do use some of these you are free to sell caridge I think, but you have to provide complete source code if I'm right, but i'm not a licence professional :) )
<br/>
<br/>
anyway good luck, your software seems great and I'll prolly buy it (that is if I'll see it in my country...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not aware of anyone who links their tools to their executable binary, so there should be no problem there.  Ie, I can use the GIMP to make my art and I am under no obligation to tell anyone.

<br/>
You can charge for the software, but you need to do a few other things as well:
<br/>
A) Let the user know the software is released under the GPL.
<br/>
B) I think you also need to provide the complete verbatim text of the version of the GPL you are using, or at least a link to it.
<br/>
C) You need to provide the complete source upon request, with instructions on how to go about doing this.
<br/>
<br/>
If your software uses any GPLed code, read the version of the GPL that came with it.  It will explain your obligations.

few points to clear it up for you
<br/>
<br/>
- Source code just needs to be available on request, if that means needing emailing them for it, then thats A ok.
<br/>
<br/>
- Some libraries (like SDL) are LGPL you don't have to open up your source code, just any change you made to that library.
<br/>
<br/>
- if you use a GPL library, yes you do have to open up the source if statically linked. Dynamically linked I believe its a different matter.
<br/>
<br/>
- if they used GPL tools then they don't have to open source their code. since GPL doesn't carry over to the resulted data created and into the core game code base.
<br/>
<br/>
They are looking to go commerical so if they are anything like me, they'd would of developed their own tools.
<br/>
<br/>
In anycase I wish you guys luck on the publisher. Hopefully you get a deal and get multiplayer in because I'd really love to have a blast at it with some mates :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This does not preclude tools from being GPLed, although tools are neither here nor there when it comes to releasing games shipped without the editing tools.
