It has various transfer functions, basically:<br/>
                DS Cart Info<br/>
                DS Cart --> File<br/>
                File    --> DS Cart<br/>
                DS Cart  --> GBA SRAM<br/>
                GBA SRAM --> DS Cart<br/>
                GBA SRAM --> FAT<br/>
                FAT      --> GBA SRAM<br/>
<br/>
Though I don't have any GBA games, so I don't know how well the SRAM functions work, but it seems to work on the SRAM on my supercard. (going dscart -> sram, then sram -> fat, and i get the saved game out ok.)<br/>
<br/>
It MAY work for some slot-1 card users, because I have a bunch of pauses in there (so you can insert the right card at the right time). But I've heard that it wont work for some cards because inserting the slot-1 flashcart causes a reset. (the reset never happens with a commercial game cart it seems, I can pop my metroid cart in & out all day long with no reset, so this is quite odd)<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if it works, or if it wipes out your precious save games :)</div>

SCSD is suported by libfat without DLDI patch, isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
I think all slot 2 cartridges are supported by libfat without DLDI?</div>

EEPROM access isn't encrypted at all, but accessing the normal DS card ROM is. The new Slot-1 cards all use the ROM interface, and the encryption on the card side gets reset when power cycled.</div>

    <div class="postbody">It copies the save game from your commercial DS carts to your CF/SD card, and vice versa. <br/>
<br/>
You can make backups of you save games, to share with others, to cheat, or just to have a safe copy in case your game gets messed up.<br/>
<br/>
It's also useful in a couple specialized cases, like Band Bros. where you can insert songs created by others into the savegame.</div>

I too play ACWW, and I currently use REIN to back up Picken about once a week. It's too bad about the lack of support for pak-swapping among some popular SLOT-1 cards (R4, M3 DS Simply, DS-X).<br/>

    <div class="postbody">added support for transfering between GBA SRAM as well. This can be useful for people who have a slot-1 flashcard, but also have some GBA game with SRAM. You can get your save files using this method:<br/>
<br/>
1. boot eepinator<br/>
2. eject slot-1 card, insert ds game <br/>
3. copy ds cart --> SRAM<br/>
4. reset DS, boot eepinator again, keep slot-1 card in<br/>
5. copy SRAM --> FAT<br/>
<br/>
of course, SRAM is only 64KB, so until I add some compression, you cannot use it for the larger save files.</div>

I downloaded all the files here:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/save/920786.html" target="_blank">http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/save/920786.html</a>
<br/>
And ran 'gzip' on them as a test (since zlib should be easy to use for compression on the DS).
<br/>
The largest after compression was 44KB, and the smallest was 10KB, so the chances are for ACWW. 
<br/>
<br/>
Mario kart was not as good though, the saves ranged from 26KB to 140KB after compression, only 3 of the 5 saves on GameFaq's page would fit into SRAM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Is there something you can do to fix R4 or M3 Simply support, or will it have to come from a higher level? I understand it has something to do with the card resetting when inserted.
<br/>
<br/>
If it's something that has to be addressed at a firmware level, I'll try to talk to a contact of mine that is in touch with the R4 team and see what I can do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1. if the DS ITSELF resets when the card is inserted, than I am pretty sure this is a HARDWARE problem, with the flashcart not being 100% electrically the same as a retail ds cart, tripping something or other in the ds. This can only be fixed by a new piece of hardware from the flashcart makers. 
<br/>
<br/>
2. if the DS does not reset when the card is inserted, then the reason you cannot write to FAT most likely it is due to the card itself being reset. This cannot really be helped, since DS cards need complex initialization to get them into encrypted mode. I might look into doing this, if it seems like this would help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

nvm i got it i used a combination of this site <a href="http://www.shunyweb.info/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.shunyweb.info/index.php</a> and the G6 Save Converter  ( <a href="http://forums.maxconsole.net/showthread.php?t=26252" target="_blank">http://forums.maxconsole.net/showthread.php?t=26252</a> )
<br/>
<br/>
i converted the .0 to the .duc and then i used the other application to convert it to the .sav file and put it in the directory on my card next i used RAC ( <a href="http://www.pineight.com/dx/RAC" target="_blank">http://www.pineight.com/dx/RAC</a> ) to transfer it to my card

If you want to manage your saves with your R4, check out the topic for SavSender, which will work with pretty much any device.  I've made a how-to guide for SavSender at <a href="http://scdev.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=9915" target="_blank">http://scdev.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=9915</a></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

once you dump the info onto your slot-2, you can convert it to the r4's .sav format (512k) with the software that came with your r4. 
<br/>
just make sure the .sav and .nds file are of corresponding names. (der)<br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
