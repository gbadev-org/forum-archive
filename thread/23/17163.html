    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First version of my PC-Engine/TurboGrafx16 emulator for the DS.
<br/>
Most things from PCEAdvance are ported over and most games run quite good.
<br/>
The savestates are broken at best and not working for CD/Arcade games at all.
<br/>
But this is just the first test version and I need some feedback.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: V0.5
<br/>
<br/>
*Added support for CD-ROM images in .bin/.cue format.
<br/>
*Added support CD audio playing.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm having issues running CDROM games as well, specifically Dracula X.  I have the V3 System BIOS set under the machine settings. I have Autosave BRAM set to "On". I've tried loading an ISO of the whole Dracula X disc, as well as the ISOs for specific tracks 02 and 22. I've also set the region to both "US" and "Japan". Each time, I select "Load CDROM", select the ISO, and hit "A". Nothing Happens. If I go to "Select HuCard" and select the BIOS file I get the BIOS screen. From here I hit "Start" and the screen goes black. 
<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any advice? I know you've confirmed that Dracula X works. Are you using an ISO of the whole disc? Or just of track 02 or 22? And what steps do you follow to actually load it in NitroEngine?

I've done that, and as I've written above I've followed those instructions without success. I just need a few things clarified:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Once the machine settings are ready, can I simply click "Load CDROM", select the ISO, and have it start right up? Or do I need to load the BIOS rom first using "Load HuCard", and then press "Start" from that screen?
<br/>
<br/>
2. For Dracula X specifically, do I need an ISO of the entire disc, or will the track 2 or track 22 ISOs work?
<br/>
<br/>
3. Do CDROM games take longer to start? I've left it run with a black screen for 20-30 seconds after loading the ISO. Should I be waiting longer?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm sorry I was a little tired yesterday and didn't see you had configured the BIOS.
<br/>
If you have selected a BIOS correctly you should be able to just turn the machine on (in the emulator GUI) and then close the GUI and you should see the BIOS. Pressing start now should tell you that there is no disc.
<br/>
<br/>
If this works you have successfully selected the BIOS.
<br/>
Now you should be able to select a iso/datatrack file. There is only support for datatracks with 2048 bytes per sector.<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
First of all congratulations to you Flubba for bringing NEC emulation to the DS :D
<br/>
<br/>
I've been playing with your previous homebrews for the GBA and they're great!
<br/>
<br/>
As for NitroGrafx, I just tried it, but I can't go very far, because the lower screen is garbled right at the beginning. The upper screen seems fine, as it displays animated "noise".
<br/>
<br/>
I have a EZ Flash V on a DS Lite.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried both versions of NitroGrafx, with and without DLDI patching (EZ Flash V does it on the fly, but hey always worth a try ;) ).
<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any idea what the problem could be?
<br/>
<br/>

There's nothing wrong with the DLDI for the EZV(i) the problem that the picture shows is down to a problem with VRAM initialisation - I got the same issue with all of the headsoft homebrew on my EzVi on the DSi, but only on the initial intro screens...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
It seems it was caused by the version of EZ Flash V kernel/shell I had, or the Moonshell it was based on.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I installed kernel/shell 2.0 RC14 (24th March 2010), and even an external version of Moonshell (v2.10), and NitroGrafx starts just fine from both.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I can enjoy the best version of R-Type on the DS :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A hentai clone of Final Fantasy...

It is said this game can only be run with two CD-Cards: one being the system's card and the GAMES EXPRESS CARD... But I don't know, only a friend of mine played it in Magic Engine!

<br/>
Extremely rare and Costly ($150-$300)!!!!!!
<br/>
-Needs Games Express CD Card to play.
<br/>
-Needs Turbo Duo or any of the systems with the 3.0 card built in. Sorry TG16 CD owners
