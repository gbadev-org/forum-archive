<br/>
<br/>
Colors! is a simplistic digital application for Nintendo DS based on modern painting-techniques developed for drawing tablets in programs like Photoshop. By taking advantage of the pressure sensitivity of the DS touch-screen it becomes a perfect portable digital sketch-book.
<br/>
<br/>
Major updates for this version are:
<br/>
* Compability update - Should solve a lot of save corruptions and lock-ups
<br/>
* New user-interface by Ernst (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.madwurmz.com" target="_blank">madwurmz.com</a>)
<br/>
* Full opacity brush option
<br/>
* Border around canvas to allow more panning
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Jesse on Fri Aug 03, 2007 12:46 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
Yes, that and general brush precision will be my top priority for v1.06.
<br/>
Also I intend to get the "pressure controls brush-size" brush in there.
<br/>
After that I think I'm pretty happy with stage 1 of the offline feature-set. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That would be lovely to fool around with and I'm very flattered for the offer. The blowing feature is an awsome idea and I love the addition of merging that with the motion-sensing feature. Still, there are other features I would prefer spending time on until I get that far down the todo-list, so I'll get back to you in a month or so. :)

I've moved the playback to the top screen in v1.05 and I intend to have some playback controls on the touch-screen instead, so control of playback speed seems like a good idea there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I understand the need, but there is no way for me to do a rewind since the information I store for the playback only allow it to play in one direction. 
<br/>
<br/>
Still, it would be possible to store a key location that you can skip back to to replay from there, and that is something I will consider.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

woot ! the bigger size give the soft brush true power and the full opacity allows fine strokes.
<br/>
The labels on the UI are back and it's much appreciated too.

On my M3lite/DSlite I have to launch the soft by pressing "start" now ("a" doesn't work at all) and everything is ok. I don't need to patch the rom with DLDI though.

<br/>
That circle around the brush-size really helps me out.  Also, I didn't even realize I wanted a completely opaque brush, but that comes in handy quite often too!
<br/>
<br/>
I like the pan/color pick cursors.. they also remove some of momentary confusion about what button does what when I've rotated the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Hell, all the improvements are great, the panning border helps too.. I don't know if it might be slowing things down a bit though with the larger surface size.

<br/>
Recommendations for version 1.06:
<br/>
<br/>
- Higher resolution (why not? is it limited by RAM?)
<br/>
<br/>
- Playback controls... : play(&gt;), pause(||), speed:x0.5(}), x1(&gt;), x2(&gt;&gt;), exit playback(X)
<br/>
<br/>
- When you press the eyedroper button, the cursor should appear on the same place it got the color the last time
<br/>
<br/>
- MORE SAVE SLOTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br/>
<br/>
- Colors! playback viewer... PC edition (yay) (it would be too difficult to export the animation as a GIF or Flash animation so I'm not asking for that :) )
<br/>
<br/>
- Better pressure callibration: START&gt;callibrate&gt;"Are you using a DS lite with even callibration?" if yes, goto simple callibration, else, "DS fat" goto advanced calibration. "no"&gt; drag hard from here to here, then from here to here and to here and to here.... Touch soft here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here. Calibration Complete. Voila, perfect callibration :P

The problem with pressure at the side of the screen for newer DSs, I believe, is the result of the DS construction and therefore mechanical. Correcting in software may not give good results (there will not be a large difference between light and heavy touch).
<br/>
The ability of pan the non zoomed paint canvas in version 1.05 is a good solution. The addition of the hand icon is excellent, giving visual feed back as to which mode you are in.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Another idea for C! '06
<br/>
<br/>
- You added a brush which paints only with a 100% alpha stoke. Sometimes you need a regular pressure thoughout a stroke (at 50% alpha, for example) but you can't get it because your screen won't cooperate... Thats why I'm proposing a pressure slider next to the set pressure button :d

<br/>
<br/>
Could we possibly get a way to skip the replay of a drawing once we start it. For some of the longer drawings I find I want to skip to the end. Could we press a button or tap the screen so skip? If there is a way I couldn't find it. Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I know it was mentioned before but I didn't see the answer. Is there a way we could stop a drawing part way through replay and continue drawing from the point we stopped? This would of course kill off the remaining drawing from the playback but could allow people to redo sections of a drawing that they feel they could do better.

I second the request for an opacity slider, especially since once I'm past the blocking stages, I tend to use semi-transparent brushes to refine. For the time being I work around this by messing with the calibration (pressing extra hard on the hard setting), but as that's hardly convenient in the long run, an opacity slider would be ace. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

heh Normally you sound a bit smarter, but saying that about layers doesn't make you look good :/

Anyone can make a drawing, just put a pencil to the screen and create some lines. When filling that drawing with a bit of color a layer is pretty much a necessary... In Colors! It would increase the usability that still anyone can use, attract 'professional' users, but it wouldn't hurt the 'unprofessional' users, they still will enjoy themselves with the playback option :)

So you see how important they are and easy they can be?

Without a layer Colors! is like DS-Paint..

But with pressure control and the compact and portable aspect of the DS, Jesse is building something much more then just Paint.
<br/>
<br/>
I've too suggested Jesse the Creator to add one extra layer..
<br/>
Call the extra layer the 'Colors! Coloring layer', place layer on top / on bottom and for full benefit add an eraser.

Wouldn't that be amazing?

The program is supposed to be simplistic!
<br/>
The RAM in the DS can't handle layers... Why would you want layers anyway??? you don't use layers when drawing on a sketchbook (do you?) 
<br/>
<br/>
"Colors! [...] simplistic [...] application for Nintendo DS [...] perfect
<br/>
portable digital sketch-book."
<br/>
<br/>
If you can't do it on a sketchbook, you can't do it in colors. (Payback is the only exception)
<br/>
<br/>
Idea: If you want something less simplistic, program it yourselves. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Pro-Photoshop</span>
<br/>
The rubber-stamp tool would be an excellent addition to this program. Even though layers can't be handled, the "cloning" or copying of a portion of the picture into another place in the canvas would be cool.
<br/>
Also levels, and some filters.
<br/>
<br/>
"Colors! ... digital application for Nintendo DS based ... in programs like Photoshop. ...
<br/>
advantage of the pressure sensitivity of the DS touch-screen ..."
<br/>
<br/>
A blur tool would be also good for making the depth of field in a painting shallower.
<br/>
<br/>
Idea: Develop a new application called <span style="font-weight: bold">Colorshop!</span> which has every single feature in Photoshop even if it makes the DS explode.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I do see your point, maybe layers might help, here's a reason I might like it:
<br/>
<br/>
I usually use layers in Gimp for pasting in details onto a background, say, a layer of text over a background image, or an icon or something, without the pasting function, layers would still be useful for drawing a background, then drawing a foreground (if you mess up, you won't ruin the background erasing it).  I've had this happen a few times, where I couldn't get the colors to blend right after erasing part of something I drew on top of a background.  An Undo function would be nice, and I guess if it used layers it wouldn't be too hard, just have the latest brush stroke be the top layer, and the rest of the image be the bottom.  If you don't undo the latest stroke (erasing the top layer), then the top layer could merge with the bottom layer, and the new stroke could be drawn on the top layer.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Couldn't agree with you more on this.
<br/>
The sheer joy of using Colors is mainly down to its "basicness", and I mean that in the most complementary way possible.
<br/>
<br/>
The more features that get added, the more bloated the program becomes, and the less charm it holds.
<br/>

The different brush types, along with the opacity options in V1.05 are more then enough for me, and I'd be happy if this part of Colors never got added to again.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've gotta agree with the "less extraneous features" mindset. I'm a heavy photoshop user, primarily for digital painting and texture painting. I do make good use of layers, but for something like Colors!, I'd much rather the focus be on speed and accessibility. Layers would tax the already-limited available RAM, and for a sketchpad, do you really want to be futzing around with lots of layers?
<br/>
<br/>
I've also really enjoyed the lack of an undo, especially since I haven't run into the "line across the screen" issue in the most recent versions.
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I could really ask for would be an opacity slider. That's all. :)
<br/>
<br/>
ps. Blowing paint or ink could be interesting, but to get anything even remotely convincing, wouldn't that require a fair bit of horsepower? And a lot of dev time, too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
It's such a pleasurable and intuitive experience painting in Colors compared to something like Phideas.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm definitely more of the opinion that Colors should stay a simple digital sketch book and doesn't need novelties like blowing paint around. It just needs to stay fast and smooth.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as features, the only thing I think it -needs- is an opacity control slider.
<br/>
<br/>
Things that would be nice: 
<br/>
Higher resolution support (maybe take advantage of the extra ram available on some carts?).
<br/>
Network mode. Network mode in OpenCanvas is a lot of fun. We used to play around in this a lot at one of the studios I used to work at.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://sinistergfx.com" target="_blank">sinistergfx.com</a>

<br/>
A: Stylus jumping (where the DS reports an incorrect stylus touch) in
<br/>
Colors! can cause long lines to be drawn over your painting. This normally
<br/>
only appears about once every 5 minutes, but can differ from DS to DS. Also,
<br/>
having pressure on different parts of plastics close to screen (resting your
<br/>
hand for example) can make this more common. Stylus jumping is also present
<br/>
in official titles, which indicate it is not a completely solvable problem
<br/>
and the current state of libnds seems to work as well as Nintendo's official
<br/>
libraries. As for Colors!, it is possible that this will be slightly better
<br/>
in future versions since it may be possible to make some special predictions
<br/>
of what should be allowed. This could reduce this problem, but it will
<br/>
probably never completely go away.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
This does not depend on HORI foil. This is more like per unit difference.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all. I've just gone through the last pages of posts since the release of v1.05 and I'm really happy that it seems to be working so well for everyone. Still, I understand those who said that this was best left for the card-manufacturers to fix the broken DLDI code, and by bypassing the problems in Colors! I've not helped the state of DS homebrew, but that's a cross I have to bear. 
<br/>
<br/>
I've read the discussions here with great interest. It?s great to see that the feature-set of Colors! has reached a point where a most suggestions for improvements have more than one side (except for the ?more save-slots? suggestion :). Regarding the layers discussion I believe many of you already know where my preferences are. It would probably be possible to find a good way to integrate a second layer into Colors!, but it would still make the program more complex. Also as mentioned, there are technical considerations as well. So for now, I won?t spend time trying to find a way to implement multiple layers but it could be something I will come back to in the future.
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the opacity control, I thought I would get away without having one, but it seems like there are very many of you asking for it so I?m starting to sway on that one. No promises though.

<br/>
So, that?s it for the some comments. I?m currently working away on a couple of different things, where one of them is improving precision of the brushes (especially with the small brushes) which seems to go pretty good. Also, I?ve started the initial work on the wifi support. Next version will probably not be out until the end of august, but it?ll be worth the wait!

I don't think I'd ask for much more than you're already planning.  It's kinda like the MSPaint drawings in a way, it's more interesting seeing what can be done with limited toolsets (for the record, Colors beats the hell outta Paint).

I would like to warn you that Colors! is not replacement for Centiq, and if you expect that, you will be disapointed.

There is online gallery already. And direct upload was ment striaght from the beggining. Current system is just to get going before direct upload gets ready, and will be used for people who do not have wifi connection.
<br/>
<br/>
Q: What do you mean by Wifi-support?

A: The first step for Wifi support is to integrate it into the online gallery and be able to upload and download painting directly to your DS. Also, I would really like to allow for multiple people to paint on a painting as once using through connecting between DS-to-DS directly, but that is not possible using homebrew SDK yet.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

I like the inclusion of random pictures on the front page of the gallery and feel it should remain even when the rating system is implemented. Without it pictures can get lost in the mists of time (there were some 21 pages of pictures last time I looked) and never get on the front page again (people are unlikely to go back through older pictures and rate them).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was thinking about the possibility of the pressure being able to control brush size as well. Perhaps, with options such as, normal, opacity, and size, so which ever you choose (maybe possible to choose more than one at the same time), you get the effect with the brush. For example, say if you choose opacity and size, the brush's pressure would decide the thickness of the line and the darkness.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The problem with those random pitures is that they are taken only form te prechoosen list. I made this because quality of newest pictures vary. It may be that there are many great pictures, but it may be that there are only weaker works. But we want to be sure that some good works will be shown when somebody visits for the first time, so he can get interested.
<br/>
<br/>
I think that totaly random pictures shown too, would be good idea, for the reasons you gave. But the page will need major redesign when rating system gets implemented and running, so i will include that idea somehow.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

Did anyone ever play that online game where you enter a chat room and one person is given a word? You have to draw a picture of the word and everyone else has to guess. Like online Pictionary. I wish we could do that on DS. Of course DS would need a keyboard...... actually it would be amazing if it had voice recognition. Can you imagine how fun it would be to be drawing and yelling at your DS, playing online with other people? Maybe on DS 2?.....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I would love that. 
<br/>
If you are drawing then you dont need keyboard, and you could paint on the touchscreen, when you are guessing, you dont need painting, so youcould have virtual keyboard on the touchscreen.
<br/>
<br/>
However i think that it would be beter made into different homebre than incorporated in colors. Btw. voice recognition would be too difficult, especialy when shouting is involwed.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I had an idea for the Colors Gallery site. Currently the vertical layout doesn't seem to utilize the entire site.   I was wondering if it would be possible to make it into a horizontal layout with voting options bellow.
<br/>
<br/>
The Voting can be constrained to one per IP address and it could be calculated mathematically.  1 unit per star.  So the images with the most stars voted appear in the top images section.  
<br/>
<br/>
Or completely eliminate the voting and display top 5 random images.
<br/>
<br/>
Though I would love to see smaller preview thumbnails and a horizontal view of the images, just to utilize the wasted space.  Here is a quick 2min mock up I did during work.  Any thoughts? I could spend some time and actually make it pretty.

I assume he giving it a similar function to pictoblog.
<br/>
I read that the source was released.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, rather than adding it to colors i'd love an intermediate app which is basically pictoblog but can upload images from your cart (ie drawn by colors)
<br/>
<br/>
The thing with pictoblog is that the drawings are very limited.

<br/>
er, also this short topic is related

Pictoblg goes Open Source!
<br/>
April 17th, 2007 by 0xtob 
<br/>
<br/>
As promised, I’m releasing the source code of Pictoblog. I hope someone will pick it up and develop it further. It should also be pretty easy to use my MetaWeblog API class in other projects.
<br/>
<br/>
I would really like to see more blog-enabled homebrew, because I think blogging and the DS go together very well. With the DS you can blog in unusual places (as long as they have WLAN) and in unusual ways (by drawing, recording voice messages etc.)
<br/>
<br/>
Get the it here.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions concerning the source, don’t hesitate to post in the Pictoblog thread on the GBADev forums!
<br/>
<br/>
Have Fun!

Q: Will undo be implemented?

A: At the moment no Undo feature is planned. However there is a plan to extend the playback functionality so you can stop the playback and continue painting from there.

This solves the problem of not knowing here the Colors.nds is, which allows me to have the config-file next to it instead of in a hardcoded directory (/colors/). By that I can also allow the user specify where the save-folder should be. Hopefully I can get that into the next version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
the gallery images really look like they were done in a sophisticated desktop applicaction. who would think that a device marketed as a children's toy could produce such quality output?

<br/>
colors alone makes a ds and homebrew card worth buying.  i love having a little digital sketchbook i can put in my pocket.
<br/>
<br/>
great job, i'm very excited to see where this goes.  even if dev. stopped it's already a killer app.
<br/>
<br/>
i agree, though, that some sort of networking or online collaboration feature would be great.  maybe that's for a separate app., when homebrew developing toward online gaming is easier.  from the first day i got my ds i thought that an isketch/pictionary-like game would be splendid.
<br/>
<br/>
i think sounds should be a very low priority.  i'd just turn them off, or turn off the volume.  interesting, sure, but just a novelty that would wear out quickly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Pictochat is just sending pictures back and forth. Collaboration on a single picture is much more fun, and I think would work well in Colors. Since you'd probably either be near a computer or near the other person, I don't think a chat window or anything would be necessary, just a connection screen on the start button menu. It'd be really cool to grab a couple friends and draw some pictures at a cafe or something.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

<br/>
<br/>
Two things I'd like to mention:
<br/>
<br/>
I'm having problems with pressure sensitivity on my NDS Lite, it seems to only be reacting on the edges of the screen. Is this common? If so - I would really like an opacity slider! 25-50-75-100% increments would be enough for me.
<br/>
<br/>
With the fear of bloating the program, I would like a two extra types of brushes: A grainy pencil, and even watercolor. That would really make it feel like a real sketchbook :)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, you should add some PayPal-contribute button on your site. You should get something back for making an excellent little program such as this.

That is one of my personal most wanted features. The problem is that no one to my knowledge has managed to do any sort of DS-to-DS communication with the homebrew, so I'm pretty reluctant to dig into it before that.

Yes, it is common but differ between DS'es. The v1.05 workaround is that you can pan the image so that you don't have to use those areas but I'm working on a smarter calibrating system.

<br/>
For now, I think I've reached the feature set I want for the painting engine and will spend time working on things like wifi features instead. It could change when I'm "finished" with that though. An idea I've been having is to break up the painting into different modes, depending on what you want to do into for example a sketch mode, a watercolor mode etc. With separate palette/brush screens and stuff for each mode, I could still keep the UI simple (perhaps even simpler) and intuative for each mode. Probably a stupid idea, but it would be far off anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Picking up the exact color you want is kinda hard because of the size and being able to fine tune with an HSV slider would be perfect.

What do you mean with "because of the size"? Do you mean that the triangle is too small to get the exactly right color? I know some people prefer sliders instead of the circle/triangle style color-picker and I've been wondering if I should include an option to switch between them.

Please try not to clog Colors with too many features. Keep the spirit of it: simplicity
<br/>
<br/>
the only drawbacks I see to Colors are:
<br/>
- stylet "jumping" across the screen (3 times in 3 hours)
<br/>
- lack of precision for tiny brushes
<br/>
<br/>
except from that everything rocks.
<br/>
<br/>
What I would kife to see added:
<br/>
- possibility to select color through HSV or RGB sliders to be able to select a specific color with a better precision<br/>_________________<br/>- Ben

Making it any bigger or being able to zoom in on it would probably clutter things up if that's what you were moving toward when you asked if "the triangle is too small." 
<br/>
<br/>
Thats why like you said, being able to switch in the sliders would be perfect because then you could just use the triangle most of the time, and when you can't get the exact color you want, just switch in the sliders and fine tune the general color you chose on the triangle. But yea, you're right. Some people just use them for everything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nah. I just wanted to be sure of what you ment. But you are right, with the low resolution and so, it's not possible to get full precision from the color-picker.

You, sir, are an amazing app writer.

few quick questions though--

1: Is the pressure-sensitive-brush-size brush still in the works? And will that be the only thing the pressure controls on this brush, or will it control the size and opacity simultaneously?
<br/>
2: Is an 'undo' function completely out of the question? It seems like with the .drw thing, an one-step 'undo' would be possible, without going into the full fledged .drw viewer...or am I completely wrong?

<span style="font-weight: bold">3.</span> Will there be a feature for viewing a different image on the top screen while drawing on the bottom? It would be great to be able to display a reference photo while drawing...

It might sound a bit useless at first, but I've always had a problem with accuracy using the touch screen. I'll let <a class="postlink" href="http://kiz.nowuckingforries.com/DS/touchscreen.JPG" target="_blank">this picture</a> explain exactly what my problem is. I'm not entirely sure what the cause of the problem is. I've experienced it in a number of games, and I always figured it was one of the following:
<br/>
<br/>
- I'm left handed, and Nintendo's internal touch screen stuff has a very slight bias to the left, so that a right handed person would find it feels much more natural (very unlikely).
<br/>
<br/>
- The default stylus that comes with the DS is shit. The rounded tip, as opposed to one with a pointed tip, would result in part of the rounded edge touching the screen, not the actual tip.
<br/>
<br/>
- The distance between the actual LCD screen doing the drawing and the touch screen causes it. In that while I press on the screen at a certain point, the touch screen registers that exact point, but doesn't know what angle my stylus is on. So, while I'm expecting to hit the pixel that continues along the same angle as my stylus, because of the thick touch screen, it appears to be slight off target.
<br/>
<br/>
That's all just speculation though. There would be some problems with it in that the angle of your stylus might not always be the same, but it should be easy as pie to program, and could help any others that have the same problem as me.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the good work.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: if my problem still isn't clear, I'll try and take a digicam photo. There's some clear compensation for right handed people at the moment (holding the stylus straight up and hitting a point, it'll be fairly far off to the left), and it'd be really awesome if there was a handedness option. As is I need to hold my DS on a ridiculous angle for fine details to see exactly where I'm drawing. I've destroyed this poor face's eyeball about ten times.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmm. I thought all those problems were solved in v1.05. What flashcard are you using? This is probably due to faulty DLDI drivers so make sure you are using the latest update for your flashcard.

Presure sensivity is something that is not part of DS specification.

It is exploiting of unsupported features, and it works differently on diferent machines. In other words, its normal.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

<br/>
An option to only allow the brush to draw within the bounds of the bottom screen. Handy so that you could draw straight lines by just lining the part you want up with the edge of the screen. It's a bit limited, just because panning bounds are limited, but it'd be an easy way to allow perfect straight lines.

Fun trick:

1) Touch somewhere on the touch screen.

2) While still holding the first point, touch somewhere else.

This technique works for me except when trying to do diagonal lines between bottom left and upper right parts of the screen which results in a V shape... rather interesting...

Kiz: for horizontal and vertical lines you can press some part of your hand against one of the edges of the DS and try to hold the stylus at a fixed distance from that and then just slide your hand along the edge.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Here is what the FAQ says.
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Will undo be implemented? 
<br/>
A: At the moment no Undo feature is planned. However there is a plan to extend the playback functionality so you can stop the playback and continue painting from there. The reason why there will be no traditional undo is that it would eat up too much memory.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Recently i wanted to make a gallery of the painting, i've done in colors completly in flash, so i've took the oportunity to port Masscat java .drw player in actionscript 3 since the code was posted, i hope you don't disagree Masscat, you can take a look here .

It is designed so that it can be. If you have a look at the html source of the <a class="postlink" href="http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/Colors/test_page.html" target="_blank">test page</a> you will see that the location of the .drw file is passed into the Java applet using the <span style="font-style: italic">drwfile</span> parameter (path relative to the location of the HTML page containing the applet tag):
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">&lt;applet code="colorsdraw.ColorsRenderApplet.class" archive="classes/ColorsDraw.jar"  width=600 height=500&gt;&lt;param name="drwfile" value="hello.drw" /&gt;&lt;/applet&gt;</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
So it should be fairly easy to generate a similar applet tag on, say, the picture details page.
<br/>
Unfortunately I am a bit busy at the moment so I do not know when I will be updating the code.

<br/>
The Java AVI exporter for FlickBook builds uncompressed AVIs so I could put the facility into the Java Colors .drw application.
<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem with doing the export on hardware is that the uncompressed AVI files get big very quickly. A 512x384 24bit AVI requires 589824 bytes per frame, so running at a cinematic 24 frames per second that means 13.5MiBs per second. Those file sizes are fine on your average desktop but can quickly fill up a smaller memory card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yay thank you very much! I will try to post more girls for my fantasy school(fantasy school is not the title i am still thinking about the title).

I'm working on 2 girls right now and i am hoping that i could finish it today or on Saturday. I will post the playback too.
<br/>
<br/>
Colors is so close to open canvas my favorite drawing software so i find colors pretty easy to use and it became my most valuable DS application. 
<br/>
<br/>
If Jesse could add a temporary Lock to the save files so no one would accidentally save over their work that would be really fantastic.
<br/>

Thank you for making Colors it gave my DS another use other than Playing games.

That only proves that perversion is just in ones mind. One see bukake there, other see a girl that eat ice cream on a stick, but was a bit clumsy. On the other hand comment is quite suggestive, and i had to bend my mind to see it as a girl eating ice cream.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally i would rather lean toward adding disclaimer when you enter colors gallery for the first time saying that you have to be over 18 to watch it. As this is one of the pictures i like best.
<br/>
<br/>
But as I do it for Jesse, it is he who should decide how similar cases should be handled in the future.

I know. It's a hack. :)

I think the size in v1.05 is 1MB before it clamps, I think. It's changed a couple of times depending on how much memory was available for each version.

That would be excelent, however straming data to the flash card can be pretty devastating to the flash, unless you do some buffering and write in larger chunks. If you would stream it stroke by stroke, you would kill the flash memory pretty quickly.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

A better way for the future could be paging the document to disk. You need some abstraction in there to do this in a simple manner, but it should be quite doable. Slow, but at least robust :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
v1.06 is coming along slowly, but if we are lucky it will be released late this week. As I mentioned earlier, improvements to the precision is one of the big things and I think I'm happy with the result I have now. Pressure Controls Size is also in there and seems to work nicely. I'm currently working closely with Ernst to update the UI for the new features, which also includes an even sharper look. Another big feature I've come a long way on is the Send To Email functionality. By using this you can send your drawing directly to an e-mail address, which is a simple way to extract your paintings from Colors! or to send birthday cards to your friends. I'm not completely sure yet, but I think that will make into v1.06 as the first step of the online functionality. One of the neat things about that is that it is based on the .drw format, so it's repainted on the server in higher resolution before it's sent (1024x768). I still haven't fixed the MORE SAVE SLOTS!!! request, but I probably couldn't get away with releasing another version without doing something about it so I plan to have that fixed as well. :)

Of course I didn't want to copy / paste from Colors, I just wanted to have fun with a interface Mario Paint style. I'll just leave it alone now -( But I am looking for a new project to do though, since the state of v1.06 allows it :) )

I just thought of something else as well, when a drawing is being played back the touch screen is just white until the playback is finished. I'm not sure how complicated this would be, but I'll just throw it out there, would be at all possible to display a graphical (perhaps bar) or numerical percentage of how much of the playback has been completed? I only thought of this while watching the playback on a really detailed drawing and I kept wondering when it was going to be done and how far along it was. If this is a crazy nonsense idea just point your finger and laugh at me ;) but like I said, I just thought I'd throw it out here.

I know it's not very practical, but lemmingsds uses a config (.txt) file that is put in the root directory that tells where the nds file is located, I guess this could always be an option and then perhaps if that file didn't exist then just assume that the colors folder is located in the root directory.

I put it on for test purposes (go into the details of the picture), but it needs alot of tweaking yet.
<br/>
1. It does not blend into the page well (i wont bother untill i'm done with new functionality of the gallery).
<br/>
2. Its extremly slow, and does not refresh right if you alt+tab.
<br/>
3. It only draw to some point on the time line. So only like 1/3 or even less of the drw is being drawn.

I had a look at the code and the download of the .drw file can bugger up hence the 1/3 of the picture being drawn.

<br/>
That's not the case.
<br/>
Actually, PNG is nondestructive file format, so it does not do any preprocessing while being written, and does not change any pixel, not a bit.
<br/>
However pictures you see on the page, are not PNG, but JPG which degrade pictures slightly, but on the other hand are a couple times smaller (load faster and consume less bandwidth). 
<br/>
You can still save/see original PNG if you wish, so worry not.
<br/>
BUT the difference between original Colors paintings and those produced by the Java applet, are caused by other drawing alghoritms in Colors and in Masscat's applet. The main difference is that Masscat's algorithm does not use soft brushes, and soft edges (YET).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks for the info.  of course its a jpg on the page, not a png.  stupid, horrible, filthy me.
<br/>
<br/>
the aliasing around the brush strokes in playback mode also shows up somewhat within the colors app on the ds, for me.  if i'm playing back a drawing, and i compare it in the later stages of playback to the finished drawing shown in the other screen (whether that is the png that is shown or some sort of post-processed or otherwise "finalized" version of the .drw file, i don't know), i notice a little bit more jagginess and hard edges in the playback drawing image.  it's only a slight difference, mind you, but it is present.  it seemed to be more visible on longer drawings, perhaps some sort of memory issue?  if the png is a perfect facsimile of the final stage of the rendered .drw (maybe that's not the case, perhaps there is another pass to get the final render before saving as a png), why would there be this difference?
<br/>
<br/>
maybe it's just an unavoidable aspect of the renderer.

That is strange. You could see some changes in the final image if you playback a painting done in another version, but other than that I know of nothing that could cause that. Anyway, v1.06 will be a lot nicer in this aspect. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
* Major precision overhaul
<br/>
* Opacity slider in brush-screen
<br/>
* Pressure-Controls-Opacity option in brush-screen
<br/>
* New user-interface with graphics by Ernst
<br/>
* Playback controls with the option to continue painting from mid-playback
<br/>
* The possibility to send your painting directly to an e-mail address
<br/>
* Unlimited save slots
<br/>
* One additional zoom-level

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">About undo. I don't know if anyone has mentioned this (I didn't see it) but as an alternative to wasting memory by using a traditional method, couldn't you just commit the last stroke to the image only after the next stroke is begun? It seems like you do that anyway to an extent -- the top screen doesn't update until you lift the stylus. It would give you an opportunity between strokes for a single level of undo.
<br/>
<br/>
If my guess is right, you can probably juggle a few things around and use roughly the same amount of memory. Maybe I'm being ignorant of the amount required to record a single stroke in the first place, but the playback feature seems to indicate that it's small.
<br/>

<br/>
In order for you to pick up the newest version of the Java applet from the Colors Gallery you may need to clear the class cache of your Java runtime.
<br/>
<br/>
First of all you may already have the latest version. The applet displays its version just above the "Download .drw file" button. The current version as of this posting is "test version 20070916". If this version is displayed then you do not have to do anything and can happily use the applet.
<br/>
<br/>
If the version has an earlier date then you will have to clear the class cache.
<br/>
On Windows a Java icon should appear in the botton right corner of your screen (the area of the screen that displays the time) whilst you are on a page which contains the Java applet. Right click this icon and select "Open Console" from the menu that appears. When it appears, type 'x' in the Java console. The console should display something like "Clear classloader cache ... completed.", indicating the cache has been cleared. Refreshing the Gallery page should now cause the latest version of the applet to download.
<br/>
If the above does not work for you then repeat it but before refeshing the Gallery page clear your Web browser's cache too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i'm thinking that registered users could have a little "add to favorites" check box or button or whatever when viewing the details of an image, and if selected it would add it to a mini-gallery in that registerd user's details page.  this favorites section should be able to grow, or perhaps span multiple pages or something.  i'd just like to somehow mark my favorite images/artists so i don't need to wade through the entire gallery each time to find them.
<br/>

what other navigation/filtering features do you think you might be adding to the gallery?  searching by name, or from a list of names, could be useful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think it's okay to do that (good for practicing colouring techniques.) Although I wouldn't post that stuff to the gallery. Maybe you should give people a bonus to their rank for including a .drw file for this reason. ;)

<br/>
<br/>
many of you can just take pride in the fact that you are already a kick ass visual artist and have already payed whatever dues were necessary for you to get there.  if you are trying to learn something, tracing can be very useful - the way light falls on an object, difficult perspective, etc. can certainly be learned from tracing or from studying a photo or situation.  
<br/>
<br/>
i'm happy that i can work from my imagination, but i know that my traditional painting abilities are nowhere near some of the still life work i've seen on the gallery.  i don't have a problem with those artists painting what they see (rather than being a bit jealous of their skills), it's just not my bag.  nobody is winning any money or prizes for their Colors work on this gallery - it's basically a digital sketchbook with which to do whatever one wishes.  i expect a lot of experimental work as Colors reaches more and more people.
<br/>
<br/>
relax, everybody!  and don't copy my stuff :)

<br/>
<br/>
but as you can see i do not talk about what the style of the artist uses, what i am talking about is what kind of drawing procedure the artist used.
<br/>
<br/>
I do not claim that my art style is original but i take pride from drawing something that came out from my mind. All of my artworks are original (no my style is not original but everything that i compose there is original)
<br/>
<br/>
Being an artist(a generic word) for so many years now, tracing in my opinion is a good way to practice, but as you can see colors.brombra.net is an art gallery.
<br/>
<br/>
So why am i pointing the obvious? It is because an art gallery is where you should post the finest artworks you have and not something that has been used as a practice material if that was the real intention of the artist that is being accused or he really intend to cheat.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope everything would be clear now. I am sorry if this is a wall of text but i just need to make my side clear.
<br/>
<br/>
Also do not forget that i said "this kind of stuff needs a debate if it should be allowed or not".

I am just asking questions there I did not directly say that it is illegal.

I'm inclined to agree. My earlier comment was made tongue in cheek mostly. I still do think it's a good idea to give people incentive to post .drw files for the obvious variety of reasons.
<br/>
<br/>
But people copy stuff all the time. The Orange stuff, for example is worthy of imitation, and any one who can do it well still deserves props. I don't think we're going to see rampant abuse here, 'cause what's the gain? It's not like prizes are being handed out. I'm not up to posting 'cause my skills went down the tubes years ago, but Colors is convenient enough that I'm getting much needed practice (if only it had a built-in mp3 player or .mod player... j/k, Jesse.)

You already pick your favorites by giving stars to them.

2. They shouldnt be offensive.

yes, i think that's a great proving grounds.  also, i've seen some very nice work in the gallery from what look like trained, traditional media painters.  this is great for me because i don't have much background in oils, and i can learn from their additive process which would be similar on a real canvas - no malleable layers, no undos.  of course, there are no blending or real color mixing tools in Colors (not a complaint, mind you!), so it's not <span style="font-style: italic">just</span> like using real paint media.

i've been wishing for that since i started using Colors!  i'm sure there are plenty of reasons that it wouldn't be a practical idea, but it would be splendid to have one available.

LiteDS, i was just weakly trying to nail down my point.  Your drawings are well done, i have no disrespect for that style.

I'll bet there are kids under 10 years old posting stuff to that gallery that don't even know this thread exists or have much scruples about their artistic integrity just yet.  older kids and adults with that attitude, too.  those goddamned, stoned reprobates, probably not giving much thought to their careers or producing their finest works for the gallery.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yup. Well music gave me the patience to draw back when I was doing that sort of thing, and it gives me the patience to do the things I do now (writing, coding, sucking at 3d modeling, etc.) and I'd love to have the same box that makes it convenient to art at random provide the tunes to keep me focussed, but the DS can barely handle playing mp3s effectively, doing that while drawing would probably make it unresponsive, and who knows what the memory requirements would be. I think .mod playing would be more realistic but less generally appealing, not to mention the fact that it would complicate the app considerably.
<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, I have an mp3 player that I bring whenever I go too far so it usually works out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just curious, how come the "This picture may offend" link doesn't show up for all pictures, only a few?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

When pictures are added they have this link untill someone of the admins aproves it. Once approved it does not need that link anymore.

Sweet!

Oh yeah id love to see Colors! have an mp3 player function! Thats something ive really wanted for a long time too, but it might just take up to much of the DS's processing memory. But as we Filipinos would say "libreng mangarap!" which translated means, hoping/dreaming is free.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
