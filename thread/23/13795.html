Diddl: As far as I know all versions are playable, but some work still needs to be done for them.
<br/>
For example, the menu in spear of destiny is missing it's background and you cannot return to game.
<br/>
<br/>
The source code will be released once I have builds for all 4 wolf3d versions available.
<br/>
<br/>
Metaluna: :) Though I hadn't realized it had been more than a year since I last released a wolf3d build.

I may also look into adding a map since it's very easy to get lost and run in circles.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On my R4 it works properly. on my ds linker (Neo MK-5) it doesn't. The upper screen shows an incorrect picture. The menu text isn't really readable. But you can move up and down. After starting a new game the lower screen shows a red background and register listing as an error???

NeoFlash has offered to send MK-5 cartridges to developer for free. many developer got their free MK-5 cartidge already. you only have to register at their homepage and write it is for testing Wolf3d. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.neoflash.com/forum/index.php" target="_blank">klick</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

there is no DLDI driver, cause MK-5 has auto DLDI patching like DS-X.

Look into the DLDI driver API, there are only functions to initialize driver and to read and write whole sectors. nothing about 4 byte boundaries, this is done by libfat itself not by the DLDI driver.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But when some drivers are asked to read a whole sector into a data buffer that is not aligned, they misbehave. For example, if your code causes libfat to ultimately make a <a class="postlink" href="http://devkitpro.cvs.sourceforge.net/devkitpro/libfat/source/disc_io/disc_io.h?revision=1.2&amp;view=markup" target="_blank">disc_io</a> call like this:

I beg your pardon, you are absolutly right. This MK-5 driver has a bug. I have changed my fat test program and can reproduce it. I will notify NeoFlash about it.
<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to make a small change in the libfat to avoid the problem. In case of a address where bit 0 or 1 isn't 0 you can add a memcpy to a buffer. But this will decrease the performance of libfat a little bit. With this libfat version wolf3d should run on MK-5.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I look at it like this:
<br/>
Q1) Did you buy the hardware to play pirate warez or homebrew applications?
<br/>
warez -&gt; GTFO
<br/>
applications -&gt; Goto Q2.
<br/>
<br/>
Q2) Does the card run homebrew applications that it should be able to (ie, ones that run on a comparable card from a different manufacturer)?
<br/>
Yes -&gt; Congratulations, you got what you paid for.
<br/>
No -&gt; Your card is faulty. Send/take it back and get a refund, or ask for a fix. Do your research next time.
<br/>
<br/>
As an analogy, let's say you bought a video card for a Linux PC. It is advertised as working under Linux so you buy it. However, when you get it home you realise that it will only operate at 320x240 resolution. Do you:
<br/>
a) take it back and buy the similarly priced card from another manufacturer that has full Linux compatibilty in all modes,
<br/>
b) spend dozens of hours reverse engineering it so you have a chance of getting it to run, or 
<br/>
c) ask everyone to reduce the minimum window size of their applications so you can use them on your crippled system?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I have my development environment set up again and will be starting on Wolfenstein again very soon.

There is lots to do because of the loss of recent features in a weird source loss accident but they should be easy to add again.

However, I did complete the tools required to extract and convert the music files. All I need to do now is test them on win32, linuxppc and osx.

Also, I have sent an email to ID software asking for the source code to be re-licensed under the GPL.

If this is successful I will add the helix MP3 decoder and the next release will have MP3 support.

If not, I will just have to go back to writing and ADPCM decoder.

They both sound the same but MP3s are a lot smaller.

This shouldn't be a problem though since the arm7 and arm9 binaries are essentially two separate applications.

<br/>
I did a quick hack-in of the helix mp3 example that was posted on this forum and the music sounds perfect coming out of the DS :)
<br/>
This hack job won't stand for release since I will need to stream the MP3s since some are too large to fit in RAM (not good anyways).

Which Adlib emulator are you using? The mame/adplug one or Ken Silverman's one he developed for his .ksm files? I don't know if you've given the latter one a shot, I would hope getting his emulator to read IMFs wouldn't be any more difficult than properly parsing the different header information.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, would you be able to release your IMF extraction and conversion tools for those who would like to listen to these classic adlib tunes from Wolf/SOD on our PCs?

<br/>
<br/>
I have been working more with the sound today and have re-enabled the sound menu where you can enable/disable sounds and music.
<br/>
The thing about sounds is the way I do it now differs from the original wolfenstein.
<br/>
<br/>
In the original version a new sound will interrupt the old one, on the DS it just plays it on a different channel.
<br/>
If you have played my port and noticed how funky it sounds when you pick up multiple ammo packs or treasure items then this will fix that.
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand like in the original if you push a wall then fire the rest of the pushwall sound will not be played.
<br/>
<br/>
A side note: I fixed the issue where MP3 playback crashes no$gba, it was a very dumb mistake on my part :)
<br/>
<br/>
There is still an issue where it sounds like the arm7 randomly gets starved and the music playback starts to crack up really bad.
<br/>
I still have to track this one down.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

Besides the occasional crackling, your sound system seems pretty good. I was just amazed you ported it running at full speed, with sounds and music all going at the same time.
<br/>
<br/>
I noticed ROTTDS seems like it uses compressed WAV files for it's music vs MP3s. I don't know if that's less CPU intensive, or worth looking at.
<br/>
<br/>
If I had the the know how, I'd attempt to mess around with the source, but it's over my head.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Soooo....
<br/>
The project died for quite a while, but I managed to locate my source!
<br/>
<br/>
I was worried since I could not find it and my latest build had an "exploding hitler" feature.
<br/>
For some reason I had it set where killing a guard would turn him into hitler and run the death sequence where he melts/explodes.
<br/>
<br/>
Luckily the source I found does not have this issue and seems to be working very well, even better news is that it is definitely possible to emulate the OPL2 chip in realtime on the Arm7!
<br/>
<br/>
The next build will have support for music and not require any external conversion tools!
<br/>
I have also fixed the color issue so things no longer look off or washed out.
<br/>
<br/>
However, once I get it to a point where I'm satisfied there will be no more changes to that specific port.
<br/>
Too many hacks were made and I have lost track.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently I'm looking into Wolf4SDL as a new porting possibility.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep an eye out though, hopefully soon all versions of wolf3d will be supported.
<br/>
Or, at least the registered and shareware versions of wolf3d and spear of destiny.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Depending on how I feel I may release the source, though it's full of horrible hacks which I'm embarrassed about now so maybe not.
<br/>
I will release the source to the Arm7 binary because the OPL2 emulator has a GPL license.
<br/>
So like the other test I did before with MP3 I am building and treating the arm7 and arm9 binaries separately.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I did convert all the colors for you, but you never got back to me, and I ended up losing them in a hard drive mishap &gt;_&lt; Good to see that you got it sorted out anyway, looks perfect now =)

Putting the sbar at the top of the bottom screen was a nice move. Can't wait to try your next build, MIDI music will be a nice addition (or whatever it is you're doing).
<br/>
<br/>
The new bottom screen background seems kind of out of place, but I suppose you can always replace it with the automap whenever you get that good and polished. Maybe a quick inventory, like I've seen some games do (but Wolf only has like what, four different weapons?).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

At least today I managed to get the music to work without cracking but that is in a separate application so I still need to move the code over.

I'm not sure about an inventory system yet, all I want to do is get the registered build out the door.

But I found some different sources for the pic you're using...I'm gonna mess with them in Photoshop a bit and see if I can't remove those icons.
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I wasn't getting very good results from the green sources, but I'm really happy with how this color version turned out...I've got one cropped and ready for 256x192, and another one that's uncropped/unsized, if you wanna recrop it yourself (my resize is a little bit soft, Idunno if that'll look good on a DS screen or not).

It's actually from the ScummVM source, it's very well optimized and worked perfectly after I made a few modifications.
<br/>
I don't think I did much memory wise, here's what I remember:
<br/>
<br/>
- Give the arm7 vram bank D and set it as the heap
<br/>
- Allocate ring buffer, sample out buffer on the arm9
<br/>
<br/>
There probably was 1 more but I'm not remembering it right now.
<br/>
The arm7 binary will be open source since the GPL requires it but the arm9 binary has a different license and will remain closed source.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While you can probably use a YM3812 emulator to play music in the DS Doom port it would not be an ideal solution.
<br/>
A few reasons why:
<br/>
- At 11KHz it pretty much eats up all the cpu time on the arm7
<br/>
- It's BIG, I had to leave out dswifi to even get it to build
<br/>
- Needs a vram bank mapped to the arm7 since it needs lots of memory at runtime
<br/>
<br/>
A better solution would be to convert the music into something that the DS can play with little to no effort.
<br/>
I believe the latest libnds release has something that can do this.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the fifo system is just used to transfer data between the arm9 and the arm7 and has nothing to do with playing music.
<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 things slowing down Wolfenstein 3D at this time.
<br/>
The first being that I cannot reserve audio channels for the music so the default sound playing functions overwrite and mess up the music at times.
<br/>
The second issue is a mysterious timing problem, somewhere it gets stuck but unlocks maybe 30 seconds or so later.
<br/>
<br/>
The sound problem could be hacked if I could find a way to modify getFreeChannel() on the arm7 to ignore the first 2 channels.
<br/>
I have no idea how to get the timing problem, I lost my no$gba debug key and desmume simply does not work with the latest libnds release.
<br/>
<br/>
What I need is a way to get the address of the currently executing instruction so I can look it up and track down the issue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
What I've found is that you can update your data files so they work fine with the port.
<br/>
<br/>
Look for "vgafiles.zip" on google, that should update your wolf3d and hopefully it'll run perfectly on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course only if you are getting garbled graphics, if the data files work right out of the box you don't need to do anything.
<br/>
<br/>
[Edit]
<br/>
Didn't see your edit, yes the turing speed is a bit too fast.
<br/>
That could either be because the timing is wrong or the game is running too slowly or maybe something entirely unrelated.

<br/>
<br/>
does the spear of destiny release support all 3 missions (episodes)? i remember there was Spear of Destiny, Spear of Destiny Return to Danger (Mission 2), and Spear of Destiny Ultimate Challenge (Mission 3). I can't recall if they were add-ons or stand-alone verisons.
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;edit&gt;
<br/>
i also remember a cd version that contained all 3 with .voc files.
<br/>
<br/>
i just did a quick search and it appears that all 3 missions have the same files but different exe files. i have no idea what the exe files are doing. patching, adding other graphics, or what...
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;edit2&gt;
<br/>
it appears that mission 1 and 2 both load and play (didn't test 3). they all load with the same "intro" screen, but display different sprites, etc. because the file names are the same you can't have both on the msd in the data directory at one time.
<br/>
<br/>
might be worth looking into this, if you have the time.

Two further missions for Spear of Destiny, titled "Return to Danger" and "Ultimate Challenge" were also created and published by FormGen Corporation in May 1994; these are collectively known as the "lost episodes", due to the fact that their existence is not widely known. Each of these, too, consists of 21 levels, with a layout similar to that detailed above; they introduced some new graphics to Spear of Destiny, but are otherwise mostly a collection of more levels for the game. A CD version containing all three episodes, titled the "Spear of Destiny Super CD Package", was also released in late 1994. The Steam release includes the lost episodes.

I always liked the automap displayed on the bottom screen on your preview video though. Maybe during gameplay you can have the auto map cover the entire bottom screen instead of just a portion of it. A cool styled auto map would be the one from Flo edit. Its the only thing that bothers me (and it doesn't bother me that much either) :P

<br/>
Right now I'm splitting my time between music and switching the sub screen graphics to use sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
An interesting thought for the automap would be to have sprites of the enemy's head floating around instead of a red dot.
<br/>
Unfortunately I can't include a lot of enemies because they would come from registered versions that I cannot distribute.
<br/>
<br/>
For music, I have the extraction and conversion utilities written and pretty much ready to go.
<br/>
At least I hope they are, I'm not sure how compatible they will be with other operating systems like linux or osx.
<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to take a look, I can send out the source to the utilities.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm no programmer or coder, and I don't think it's impossible, however there's no source code available for that game and I know they share same engine but you know different EXE mean that they'd altered it's codes here and there... and as you might already be aware, even v1.1 of wolf3d is not playable because of it's source base iirc.

Unless I'm seeing things in my test app the arm9 is decoding it very fast, using 10 of 263 lines at the most.

Well, one thing I wonder, is it possible to make an option so the game jumps instantly into the gameplay when you have saved? Because now you have to scroll down to the "back to game" and then push the "A" button, this after the game has been saved. Oh my, now I feel like the lazy one here, since I just have to scroll down a little and then push the "A" button one time to get into the game again=P
<br/>
However, it still would be nice to have an automatic return to the gameplay, but of course it's you choice^^

I only have a few of those working since I just started it a few minutes ago but hopefully I can get all of them to work, if not I'll add something else in it's place.
<br/>
<br/>
Still left to go before next release:
<br/>
- Finish converting status bar to better use the 2D hardware
<br/>
- Finish cheat menu
<br/>
- Add automap (needs status bar mod to be completed first)
<br/>
- Add level warp screen after episode selection
<br/>
- Remove "lives" from gameplay, figure out what to do with those 1up spheres
<br/>
- Get adpcm decoding on the arm7
<br/>
<br/>
[Edit]
<br/>
- Godmode works
<br/>
- Noclip works
<br/>
- All Hitler mode works (I love this one :D)

- All dog mode works

Why don't you use 256 colors instead? I'm curious...

And maybe you can show the left lives drawing some spots under the health percentage...

The Answer: No! But if you want the port to play 100% like the original game you should add it. But since modern fps doesn't have a live-system I don't think that anyone will care about it that much?!?!?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

or replay a favorite level.
<br/>
<br/>
both sides of the life argument are valid. however, a purest who wants to play the game, the way the game was intended to be played, would want the lives left in. you are truthfully shaping this project up to be, arguably, one of the best 1st person shooter ports for the nds. i think you should try to keep it as pure to the original with all of the current enhancements, additions which really keep it a step above the rest.
<br/>
<br/>
finding a small area of the user interface or off to the side of the auto map to hold more data would work, if you can make it work. would you consider adding info to the side of the auto map like which cheats we are using, last game saved, number of lives, etc?
<br/>
<br/>
none of these are needed but it is nice to have all of the info right in front of your eyes and not behind sub sections. what about some type of clickable tabbed view. tab1 is auto map, tab2 is info on the game/stats, tab3 shows cheats, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
as for options, any visual efx that you can add in. anything to clean up old graphics? what about volume control? hmm....

I will concede though, lives will remain in the game.

What I can do is sneak in a small sprite in the lower corner next to the face which represent how many lives you have left.

From what I imagined the automap would be toggled by tapping the touchscreen, any other features would come later.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">that tiny number near the face is just perfect. just be sure to add to the readme in the final version what that number means.
<br/>
<br/>
as for saving by the ds owner's name, i use japanase characters to make up my name. they <span style="font-weight: bold">never</span> appear correctly in any homebrew. i get the same problem in some retail games as well. sometimes i see characters, other times i see spaces and question marks. just FYI.
<br/>
<br/>
if you only allow 1 save per level why not just default to the version of wolf3d and the level. SOD_LEVEL1.SAV, etc. if you allow more than one save you could always have the code check to see if a save exists and then make a 2nd, 3rd, nth save which is automatically numbered.

Profile management (main)

<br/>
- Add cheats for Spear of Destiny

- Add 50% slowdown cheat

Sorry, off topic. The only thing I can think of is some complicated mess that would read in a texture and pretty much count how many pixels there were of each color and pick the highest one. Although I'm not sure what format the textures were in. If they're indexed palette it might be a little easier, but still a lot of work for minimal payoff.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

in the functions however, I try to avoid putting comments in the code. when you put comments in your function, then you should first see if you can make the code itself better understandable, instead of trying to cover up onreadable code with comments. if the code is just hard (like with algorithms) then you can put comments in.<br/>_________________<br/>my blog:

Not that I personally need flashy graphics to enjoy the game...mostly I just don't play it (the original PC version) because it makes me motion sick, there's no strafe buttons, and the GBA port doesn't have music, a solid framerate, or support Spear of Destiny etc.

I'm looking at them right now (version 1.2), and I guess redrawing the enemies didn't work out, because these are all the original 64x64 sprites. Unless they were in a previous version and got taken out? Which I kind of doubt.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, scratch the part about it using the Jaguar version graphics. The weapons, most of the textures, and some of the objects are higher res...I'm not too familiar with the Mac or 3DO ports, but they look to be from there. Version 1.0 doesn't seem to have any high res art at all. Version 1.1 looks about the same as 1.2, except there's no SoD.

Thirdly, scratch the part about me testing your port on a DS-X. I got a new flash cart and gave the old one away.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey Lazy,
<br/>
<br/>
Lately I've been porting Wolfenstein 3D to the Quake engine (DarkPlaces, to be more specific) and I was wondering if you had any ideas for converting Adlib sound effects into WAVs.
<br/>
<br/>
Right now I'm using the OGG files from the iPod port of the game, but several sounds are missing (all of the menu sounds and most of the "use button" sounds). I've already converted all of the music over using a WinAmp plugin, but there doesn't appear to be any program for the sounds (or at least I got tired of looking after about an hour).
<br/>
<br/>
I guess if I really need to I'll just record straight from the sound card, but I was hoping you knew of a better way.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I had the same problem with sounds, when I last tried I knew a lot less about how wolf3d used the adlib hardware.
<br/>
I just used dosbox and extracted the important ones.
<br/>
<br/>
Be careful with the winamp plugin though, at least when I tried it some things were played incorrectly.
<br/>
An example would be episode 1 level 10.
<br/>
<br/>
Looks nice so far though. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Well it still sounds a lot more accurate than the music in the iPod version (and loops properly, too). Do you have a better way of converting the music?
<br/>
<br/>
How do you extract sounds from DOSBox? Does it have an option to log the sound output as a WAV?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#175091 - Lazy1 - Mon Sep 06, 2010 7:11 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What I'm going to suggest will sound insane:
<br/>
<br/>
Put an adlib emulator inside your Quake source port.
<br/>
You'll save a tonne of disk space and it'll sound fairly close to the original.
<br/>
<br/>
ScummVM's emulator comes fairly close, real hardware of course sounds better but no longer exists.
<br/>
:D
<br/>
<br/>
The IMF format is dead simple, I wrote an app a ways back to do the conversions.
<br/>
Once I find it I'll upload it so you can use it as a starting point.
<br/>
<br/>
The sound effects should follow a similar route, you'll just need to check out the original sources and or other wolf3d source ports to see how it's handled.
<br/>
Likely it's going to be a bunch of adlib commands fed to the hardware at 700hz - just like the music.
<br/>
<br/>
[Edit]
<br/>
Make sure ScummVM and your source port's licenses are compatible though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Which is rather unfortunate because I'm pretty sure that's the only way I could make this project legal. Right now I'm just sort of hoping since it won't get too much attention that id won't really mind. I know there's two different Wolf mods for DOOM that have been around for a while and haven't had any legal action taken against them...and Romero already knows about my mod, and hasn't said anything outside of "Interesting..."

Pate's adlib emulator used to successfully play an IMF tune from wolf3d!

<br/>
Adlib based sounds appear work as well, things like item pickups should have sound when I get around to adding this.
<br/>
<br/>
Pate:
<br/>
The adlib emulator in your downloads section is dated earlier than when your blog says it was completed.
<br/>
I was just curious if any major changes were made between the two versions.
<br/>
<br/>
So far it sounds amazingly close, some instruments are a bit off or quiet but all things considered it's a damn amazing piece of work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, great to hear you are healthy again! :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I believe the AdLibSrc package is of the latest version, I think I just mentioned it on my blog somewhat later than I actually finished it.
<br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear you feel it worth incorporating into Wolf3D (or at least testing it). My primary goal was speed (as I wanted to get all 9 channels working), so I had to do some shortcuts regarding the accuracy.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the compliments! :-)

<br/>
Basically the code I was using to generate a single colour from each texture for the automap was broken.

I assumed the registered version so the shareware would die cryptically when it requested data which was not in the files. (PML_ReadFromFile: Zero Offset)
<br/>
<br/>
I have a bit more tidying to do and updating for the newest libnds changes but once that is done I'd like to have the source hosted somewhere.
<br/>
Any personal recommendations for source control?
<br/>
<br/>
Oddly enough looking at the code everything was set to go using ADPCM compressed wave files for music.

I'll add in the adlib emulator later but cannot release anything until I finish/integrate the other code for the bottom screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are a few kinks that need to be worked out, but must be done on hardware since neither desmume or no$gba can handle the arm7 opl emulator.
<br/>
What I'm trying to do now is get the priority stuff working so that picking up a machine gun sound isn't overridden by moving against a wall.
<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention all the code for the bottom screen is probably horrible and in need of a rewrite.
<br/>
It also has no keyboard to enter in high scores or saves.
<br/>
<br/>
// TODO:
<br/>
// Stuff
<br/>
<br/>
[Edit]
<br/>
An interesting thing happened...
<br/>
I noticed a bug where the pickup +1 life sphere would lower the volume of all other sounds that come after it.
<br/>
I wasn't sure if it was my problem or a quirk of the opl emulator, a quick run of wolf3d in dsx86 tells me:
<br/>
<br/>
- All of the adlib based sounds are being played back improperly
<br/>
- The other bugs I noticed are not there when running under dsx86
<br/>
<br/>
So it appears there is a flaw in my implementation, looks like I'll have to rewrite it based on the original x86 asm based sound manager in the wolf3d source.
<br/>
I don't know x86 assembly but it shouldn't be too hard to figure it out... Right?
