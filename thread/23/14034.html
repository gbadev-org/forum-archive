    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
First post on this forum, but I had the habit to come and see what's happening here.
<br/>
So I finaly decided to put one small project online.
<br/>
<br/>
It's based on the old The Light Corridor.  I played this one on Amiga loooong time ago :)
<br/>
<br/>
It's been developped to test some stuff on the ds before starting again on a 'bigger' project.  So this one don't have any sound and still has some minor bug, but well it's playable :)
<br/>
<br/>
Have a try and tell me if you succeeded to see the end of the corridor ( yes don't be suspicious there is a end ! )
<br/>
<br/>
You can download it on my website :

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
tepples : It can be understood as close to Eurotunnel yes, but the description is closer to a brickdown where you have to move forward. ( a brickdown where the bricks don't brake though )
<br/>
<br/>
jerbob92: thanks for the offer for graphics, but this project will probably don't evolve any more, the game was coded in 2 days ( +10 days debug my lib lol ) and it was just to test my lib before restarting to work on my 'real' project.  As I don't have so much time to work on this, I'll probably give priority to the main project. ( it has already been paused for more than 6 months... )
<br/>
<br/>
Kojote: not sure I'll do it, the corridor is in 3d, that means that I'll have to code a part to project sprite in a false 3d world.  It's realy easy to do since the camera is always looking the same way, but well, it took me already lot of time to enter in the ds specs, I will probably don't find time to enter in the gba ones...<br/>_________________<br/>-jerome-</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
