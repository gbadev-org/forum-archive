Menu Controls:
<br/>
<br/>
A - Proceed
<br/>
B - Go back
<br/>
Hold Up while booting - Deletes custom controls file and lets you recustomise
<br/>
<br/>
Game Controls:
<br/>
<br/>
Start - Reset onto track
<br/>
Select - Change View
<br/>
A,B,X,Y,L,R - Customised on game load
<br/>
Touch - Top half zooms in on view from above, bottom half zooms out
<br/>
<br/>
Game Points:
<br/>
<br/>
- Needs DLDI patching
<br/>
- Tested to work fine on Supercard SD, CycloDS and DS-X (yes, I have one of those -_-)
<br/>
- Still jerky rotations over some triangles
<br/>
- Cannot exit a level, so you'll have to reset the game to change level or ship :(
<br/>
<br/>
General Points:
<br/>
<br/>
- This engine is REALLY unoptimised, over the next few months I'm going to be rewriting it and totally changing it.
<br/>
- Textures were created for DS Lite, they look really bad on the old DS (sorry!)
<br/>
- This isn't F-Zero GX, but listening to it's music while playing makes it feel better :) (no sound in this demo)
<br/>
- I'm no graphic artist
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to:
<br/>
<br/>
- All the Devkitarm and libnds people for their excellent tools
<br/>
- SausageBoy for <a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/gaspcubed/" target="_blank">texmex</a>, all textures were converted using this tool
<br/>
- Lick/Melw for their <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=13654&amp;highlight=directory" target="_blank">file locating code</a>, which means that the data folder can be stored anywhere on the card :)
<br/>
- gbadev'ers for all the help!
<br/>
<br/>
What took so long?!?:
<br/>
<br/>
Well, this source was actually completed around a year ago(!) but I soon realised that some methods I was using were really unoptimised. Since dev had gone too far, I would have had to rewrite the engine again. I thought I might aswell work towards a second demo, but lost interest knowing that it wasn't going to be final.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm back at uni and I'm basing my new disso around this game again, but I'll have to rewrite core parts of the engine in the mean time, so I thought I'd post this demo now. Enjoy and let me know if there are any bugs or whatever :)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Rajveer on Sat Sep 21, 2013 12:51 pm; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Finallly some news about this game! :D
<br/>
<br/>
It's really great, speed sensations are good, levels are good too, no fog or whatever and it's fine, if you find a good graphic you should get a good game.
<br/>
Edit: ha I finally saw that the level isn't viewable at long distance but if you put the building on good places you can hide it a lot.
<br/>
Also I successfully passed trough the holes, and got shortcut. You should add waypoints ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Didn't got bugs when tested. Just on supercard SD, the game won't launch after the commands settings if the .nds isn't at the root of my card (dldi patched).
<br/>
Good job, continue to improve your game!<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.mariokartsource.com" target="_blank">www.mariokartsource.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
