    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello fellow DS dev'rs:
<br/>
<br/>
I'm doing a free, open-source operating system for the Nintendo DS. This has been brewing for a few months, and is starting to get ready. Currently FeOS supports loading relocatable code (which includes support for shared libraries), basic console I/O (thanks to libnds' functions), ARM7 code loading support (!!!), a native libnds-based DS video API and cooperative multitasking (!!!). dswifi and libnds' videoGL API have also been ported to FeOS under the names FeOSWifi and FeOS3D, respectively.
<br/>
<br/>
As usual, it's available through <a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/fincs/FeOS" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Pre-built packages (including the FeOS SDK) will be available soon.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I've also currently ported <a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/fincs/FeOSLua" target="_blank">Lua</a> to FeOS (pictured below), and since there is shared library support, Lua extensions (plugins) are also supported.
<br/>

Here are some screenshots:

Oh, and it may not be instantly clear in the README file, but you have to set the FEOSSDK env var to your FeOS/sdk folder (in Unix-style):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm just wondering how you plan on having programs share resources, and what states a program can be running in.  We'd love to see at least two programs running at the same time, maybe one for each screen.  Or for background programs (minimized music players), no screens.
<br/>
<br/>
A program might want to request a video engine.  It might not need everything Engine A provides, but you might be running another program that's already using Engine B.  So you might have a function that requests Engine A or Engine B.  If you request Engine B, you could get Engine A back, if B is already in use.  The program would need to be written to support either engine, depending on what it gets back.
<br/>
<br/>
Then there's a situation where you would want to minimize a program, and deny that program the ability to write to the screen.  To do that, a program would need to call a function "Am I minimized or not?", and intentionally not do any video writes during the time it's minimized.
<br/>
<br/>
Then there's VRAM sharing.  The VRAM situation on the NDS is already tricky enough as it is, but if you will be running two programs at the same time (one on each screen), you would need a way to request VRAM.  Then the program can work with whatever it receives after requesting it.
<br/>
<br/>
Then if the program is minimized, it should stop trying to write to VRAM.  Then when it is restored, it will need to assume that VRAM must be reconstructed.  It might even be given a different VRAM page to work with.
<br/>
<br/>
Then you have other resources to share, like Wifi, Sound, Filesystem Access, etc.  That might be tricky to do.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
FeOS supports two modes: console mode (using libnds' keyboard and console facilities) and direct mode (which allows direct HW access). It is up to you what you do in direct mode.
<br/>
In order to allow multiple direct mode apps, frameworks which manage all video-related stuff will have to be written. For example, I plan on having a system for having apps init the video HW to their liking. Somebody could also write a windowing system, and so on.
<br/>

<br/>
Wifi is already implemented (using a port of dswifi to FeOS named feoswifi). Filesystem access is done through fopen() and friends (I just expose the newlib functions).
<br/>
<br/>
As for sound, you'll have to make your own ARM7 sound driver (that you'll load with FeOS_LoadARM7()). I do plan though on having a common basic audio interface (things like PlaySound(), PlayPSG(), etc; similar to libnds' "simple sound engine") that you'll be able to implement and have other apps use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
