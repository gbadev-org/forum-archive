<span style="text-decoration: underline">All</span> XM features are finally completely supported (and a couple of bugs corrected too!)

What was left behind was :

Documentation, complete changelog, a dedicated new support forum, examples, demos, etc... look here -&gt; <a href="http://wcms.teleion.it/users/cgq/nds/libxm7/" target="_blank">http://wcms.teleion.it/users/cgq/nds/libxm7/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">XM7Play r2009-005</span> XM/MOD Player
<br/>
Based on libXM7 1.00 of course, with an additional kind of MOD support too. It still includes the <span style="font-style: italic">sample optimizer</span>, it still doesn't have a GUI, this time with battery saving features (turns off screens &amp; backlight when playing, just touch the screen to turn it on again). It plays XMs and most common format MODs with up to 16 channels directly from your FAT memory card.

Hope you enjoy. Feedback is very appreciated. :)

I have been playing with your lib and I think it is great. How do you manage to play mod files?<br/>_________________<br/>-----

<br/>
There's no support for MOD in libXM7 but, since XM is actually kind of a <span style="font-style: italic">superset</span> of MOD, it's not hard to play these files too. I wrote a MOD file loader, but it's still work in progress and unreleased. I can send you a copy of it, if you need, but I suggest you instead to convert your MODs to XM format (use MilkyTracker, for example) if you can, it'll be easier :)
<br/>
<br/>
Are you using libXM7 in your projects? If you need support there's a support forum, go to the documentation page :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the fast answer sverx. I will convert my mods to XM then.
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I think I'm going to use your library to add music to <a class="postlink" href="http://zalods.blogspot.com/2008/07/rokoban-sokoban-version-in-3d.html" target="_blank">Rokoban</a> for the DS version. I will of course include a mention of it on the credits :)<br/>_________________<br/>-----
