<br/>
<br/>
I'm satisfied with this enough to make the first release.  Make sure you read the instructions!
<br/>
<br/>
This version is still very limited.  I've only tested it with my linksys router, and a few AIM usernames.  I hope that you are able to log in.  We'll see.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, let me know if it works.

One request, if you're taking any.  Is there any chance you could make it so it looks like the keyboard buttons are pressed down so I know I'm hitting the correct letter?  In Beup, when you press down, the letter button that you hit changes color as you push it.

<br/>
System: DS Lite

Firmware: Flashme v7

Card: G6 Lite Chinese

Bugs:  If I IM someone with an alias "person" for example.. it opens up a conversation for them.  However, when I receive an IM back, a new conversation is opened from "person:::w".  Everything else seems fine so far.
<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions:  As dafatkid27 said, it would be nice if the keyboard buttons changed color when you hit them.  Also, I think the SEND button should be where the Enter key currently is.  The SEND will get much more use than Enter.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, back wuth more requests/suggestions and comments.
<br/>
<br/>
1) I love the big keyboard, please keep it as is, just add the pushed button feature as above (which I know you already confirmed, thanks).
<br/>
<br/>
2) Make it so it says when someone signs off if you have a chat opened with them (just like in AIM, "suchandsuch has signed off" right below the last line of text).
<br/>
<br/>
3) Please add the ability to navigate the buddy list and chats opened box with the DS's D-pad.
<br/>
<br/>
4) Maybe make the chat dialog box a bit bigger and the area where you enter the text a bit smaller.
<br/>
<br/>
5) Please add an away message feature.  For example, I want to be able to put up an away message that says, "On my DS, may type slow", or any other away message.
<br/>
<br/>
5 1/2) Maybe when you close the lid of your DS, your default away message goes on and your DS goes into standby?
<br/>
<br/>
6) Lastly, saving of things to SRAM, or even just the ability to create a configuration file beforehand that it reads (I have an SCSD).  It would be great not having to type in my username and password every time, but again I understand that this was a preview release, and I thank you for it.
<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks so much for this wonderful application.  Also, I hope you know that these are suggestions and comments and not complaints.  Hopefully you are able to incorporate some of these ideas soon, but I understand that it's not necessarily easy.  Thanks in advance!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by dafatkid27 on Fri Jul 28, 2006 7:22 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
except most of the same things other people have asked about. i don't know how many of these you're already planning on adding, but here are my suggestions. many of these are small issues, or are only asthetic ones.
<br/>
<br/>
-be able to see when keys are hit.
<br/>
-fix Usernames. many usernames show up as a blank space on the buddy list, and show up as ::w: on the chatting screen.
<br/>
-add imsend and imrcv noises! just rip the default ones from aim.
<br/>
-save login info on the login screen, and be able to mask password (ie, *****).
<br/>
-sliding scroll bars.
<br/>
<br/>
other that that, it looks great!
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
glad its mostly working.  This ::w: bug seems to be more common than I though. 
<br/>
If it is okay, post or PM me one of the screen names that come out as ::w?  Also, is this only with names that have aliases?  I'd like to fix this problem ASAP.
<br/>
<br/>
mntorankusu: those emticons look great to me,  I'll use those if it is ok.
<br/>
<br/>
dualscreenman: I've def not seen this one.  If others have this problem, let me know.
<br/>
<br/>
sinoth: The freezing you saw.  was was "Connecting to WIFI" being displayed, or was it "Logging into AIM?"  Sometimes it does hang there for awhile waiting for AIM to respond.  I don't know if I can fix this problem yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Lots of good ideas on new features.  I especially like the shutting the lid/away message.  I'm working to put this stuff in as well.  But I'm going to try to fix these other problems first.  
<br/>
<br/>
If you guys want, I've tried to support most of the AIM errors.  You should get a dialog box whenever an error is received.  For example, someone sends you a message that is too long.  It should also disconnect when your connection is down for about 30-45 seconds.  If you guys want to test this, feel free.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'll get on these fixes and new stuff.  I gotta go work now though.

Great. I'm working on some more of them right now.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any chance of having animated emoticons? Some things like :lol: and :winky: can't be properly portrayed with still images. Not that it's particularly important, though.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I got a chance to try the program out. The actual meat of the program, the IMing, works flawlessly. It's perfectly usable in its current state. I'd just like a way to have the username/password be saved and loaded from the CF.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Here's a new set of those emoticons. I made some new ones, and improved the old ones.

Maybe you should call it DS AIM/ICQ ;) because it works "fine" with my icq account, and here in germany icq is far more popular than AIM and i don't think everybody knows thats kind of the same thing.. i wasn't shure either.
<br/>
<br/>
i wrote "fine" because the progam freezes after a few minutes of chatting and i cant do anything but shutdown the DS.. the WiFi-LED is still blinking though..
<br/>
also every once in a while it already freezes at "Connecting to WIFI"
<br/>
Ds Lite/Supercard SD/Superkey in case you care ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions:
<br/>
-Put a hook at the bottom of the small "J" it looks almost like the small "I"
<br/>
-other keyboard layouts (german) would be nice, but that can wait ^^
<br/>
-Send-button at the free space next to the space-bar
<br/>
-remembering of login-infos (config file?)
<br/>
-usage of the d-pad instead of the onscreen arrows
<br/>
-better/bigger scrollbar for the received messages
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
the freezing only seems to occur when you use a icq account, im really sad about that :(</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by deshi on Fri Jul 28, 2006 2:40 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
If so, after sending an IM to your DS from your PC, set an away message up on the PC side and then see if at least your screen name from your PC is added to your DS buddy list.
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes AIM express is slow to pick up all names on the buddy list I have heard.  This may be the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
DSAIM will only add people to the buddy list window whenever AIM tells DSAIM the user is online/away/etc...  AIM must not be sending this message.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i only have one problem and suggestion (besides the ones above)
<br/>
<br/>
the problem: i was watching on my computer from a different account, and when i "signed off" DSAIM, it didn't sign me off. the account still said it was online and i could still send messages to it. you said you were going to fix the signoff issue, though, so this isn't really a complaint, but more of a warning to those who sign off and miss messages that people have sent to them afterwards.
<br/>
<br/>
suggestion: press "L" for shift. i'm not sure why, but without thinking i pressed L when i wanted to shift. i'm not sure what (if any) programs do this, but it's pretty good, and allows me to type faster, for me at least.

<br/>
<br/>
the problem: i was watching on my computer from a different account, and when i "signed off" DSAIM, it didn't sign me off. the account still said it was online and i could still send messages to it. you said you were going to fix the signoff issue, though, so this isn't really a complaint, but more of a warning to those who sign off and miss messages that people have sent to them afterwards.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
Seconded, I just tested this and my username is still logged on, even though I turned off my DS.  Also, I've signed on with my DS about 3 times total between last night and this morning, and when I just went on AIM on the computer, it sent me the AOL System Message notifying me that I was signed on from 3 locations.
<br/>
<br/>
But, I'm sure when a proper sign-off feature is implemented, this will stop happening.  Thanks again!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The sign off problem happens because the client never tells AIM that you've signed off.  That hasn't been implemented yet.  It will be in the next version.  As of now, you have to wait for your name to timeout to sign off.  Its an easy fix, I just need to implement a menu that allows the user to sign off.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll prob make the enter key send the IM.  I just didn't do that for this release.  I'll haven't tried DSOrganize, so I'm not familiar with the sliding key.  I'll have to check it out.
<br/>
<br/>
clone dad: glad it seems to be working.  Anyone with the ::w problem, please PM me one of the names/aliases that causes this so I can debug.
<br/>
<br/>
Linkiboy: Next release I'll have it.
<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who has a problem with the client freezing (clock stops working), I might release a debugged version that sends the program status to my machine so I can see where the freeze occurs.  OR, I can release a PC client that will display debug messages, so you can tell me where in the program the freeze occurs.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope to get everyone's working before the next release and next set of bugs arrive :)

Here are my suggestions:
<br/>
- Change the button's color when it is "pressed down" so that you can tell when you make a spelling error without looking at the top screen.
<br/>
- Maybe make the cursor or something blink so you know the program hasn't crashed?  I sat there for a minute wondering what to do... then I remember to read the readme. heh.
<br/>
- Turn off the screens when the lid is closed, just to save battery life.

- Add a disconnect button or fix it so that you sign off as soon as your turn off your DS

It's a "Super Card SD" Cart that takes a mini 1GB SD.

I bought my DSlite in Hong Kong, so it came "modified" as they call it. So all I have to do is stick the GBA cart in, and turn on the system, and your file will play on both screens. So there is nothing in the DS slot.

Later this week maybe, I'm going to release a version 0.01d which will send the program status back to a server running on my machine so that I can see where freezes/login failure occurs.

I'll release a debug version in a few days so I can see where it is hanging.  If it is hanging where i think it is... It may be either the AIM server or the wifi libraries.  We'll see.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it's because of the buddy list size. I tested dsAIM with three AIM accounts.
<br/>
<br/>
Acct #1 (224 buddies) = hangs &amp; produces static noise @ login
<br/>
Acct #2 (200 buddies) = same as #1
<br/>
Acct #3 (1 buddy) = works flawlessly
<br/>
<br/>
Just a speculation. Maybe DS AIM only shows the online buddies but will still have to check through all the buddies on the list to see if they're on, and 200 is just too much ATM?

I think I fixed the problem with screen names showing incorrectly in the buddy list and chat list window.  I'll put that in the next debug release.
<br/>
I've also tried a buddy list with around 250 people in it.  I'm still able to log in and get the whole list.  I'm having a hard time reproducing the problem of freezing on login.
<br/>
<br/>
I might release a version that won't wait for the buddy list to arrive before logging on.  This way everyone should be able to log in fine, but might not have a buddy list until AIM sends it and the DS receives it.  
<br/>
<br/>
For people that are having the freezing problem in the beginning or before the login screen draws...  I might release a wifi client that DSAIM can talk to so that you can see where the freeze is occuring.  If you are having this problem, and know how to run a windows program from the command prompt, let me know and i'll send you the software (in a few days)

<br/>
ive tried both but cant get it to load.

DragonMinded let a few volenteers controll the Database so there can be even more downloads for the db, i am one of the volenteers and that is how.
<br/>
and if you mean the downloading part. Dragonminded lets us upload files and 
<br/>
then using the script in some wierd way, the ds can download strait to your flash cart! But lets stay on topic. so you can pm me if you want to disscuss more or ask questions as i am up to doing that!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Could you possibly have a key repeat itself quickly when you hold down a button?  It would make editing comments easier and quicker.  If you really want to go nuts, you could also add a "End" button to skip to the end of the comment you've typed.  Anyway, keep up the rockin' work</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
for example, holding left and hitting backspace will delete the previous word.

holding left and hitting the left touch button moves back one work, the opposite for holding right.

<br/>
holding up and down will act as an end and home button.

Something along those lines anyway.

FYI I'm using the Passcard 3 and M3 MiniSD just in case you needed to know.

I would, however, like to cosign on the person that requested some control changing for us lefties lol. I know I can probably do without it but it would just make it a little easier. Like for instance, someone said when you hold down the L button, it is like pressing the SHIFT button. That's great. I would like to be able to change the controls so that i can press it on the R button instead. Just things like that. and to have a SEND button on the left side as well.

Not yet since I've only got my router to test on.  Althought now there is a network setup built in so that you can try other settings.  I don't know if that will help or not.  
<br/>
<br/>
The login screen has a bit more wifi connection info in it too now.  So you can see at which point the router does not connect or freeze.  Mine freezes on authentication when I try to use other people's routers in my appt.  I hope that higher router compatiblity is available soon.

<br/>
*IM users by inputting their names.
<br/>
*Get buddy profiles.
<br/>
*Set away messages.
<br/>
*DS will set away message and power off screens when lid is closed.
<br/>
*Proper sign off feature.
<br/>
*UP/DOWN buttons scroll through buddy list.
<br/>
*Fixed misc bugs

I'm still playing with it but one thing I noticed is that when I press select and then choose to type in an away message, once I type in what I want the away message to say, there is no way to press the OK button. I've tried everything. Maybe someone else can get it to work. But otherwise, everything is great so far.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

With another screen name on your PC, add the bad screen name onto your PC buddylist.  Then try signing on DSAIM again with the bad screen name and tell me if this name shows up on your PC buddylist before you get the error message.  I'm not entirely sure it's signing on at all.

I press send, and it logs in almost instantly.

Btw, the 4GB HDD is pretty much a Mass Storage Device, and (from my experience) all FAT support MUST be disabled to get anything to work on it. Many homebrew apps give the user that choice. I'm not really sure what the problem is, all I know is that I get no login screen at all, it just goes straight to the keyboard and two big white circle things at that top, where I guess the conversations are supposed to be. After that, it doesn't seem like I can touch anything. I hope you can fix this eventually.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

EDIT #2: One suggestion, when typing, make it on the release of the stylus to type things, instead of when pressing it. Say you put the stylus down, and then you drag it, the keyboard lights up following your stylus, but when you let go, it doesn't type that key.

<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Problems &amp; Bugs</span>
<br/>
- If you put in your username and password, then go to the WEP setup, and go back, your username and password are gone
<br/>
- When you put in the 128 wep or another box that is in the top screen, there's no way of sending the information (enter makes a new line, and send does nothing)
<br/>
- After failing to connect to WiFi, the program just freezes, so you have to turn the system off and back on again
<br/>
<br/>
What should be added:
<br/>
- Username and Password should be able to be saved
<br/>
- Refresh AP list quicker
<br/>
- Get rid of "Network Setup is Complete" screen.
<br/>
- Instead of Send, Warn, Block... change the Warn and Block to one giant Send box (on the bottom), and on top where send used to be make that menu (aka the functions of hitting the Start button)<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://prdesign.co.nr" target="_blank">http://prdesign.co.nr</a>

<br/>
<br/>
I just have a few suggestions about text input...it would be nice to be able to use the buttons to enter text.  I'm imagining something like what they do for cell phones.
<br/>
<br/>
The 8 directions + neutral of the D-Pad point to the 9 number keys and Y, X, B select the first/second/third character (or use all 4 * 9 = 36 keys).
<br/>
<br/>
Also something like T-9 text prediction with a dictionary would be nice.
<br/>
<br/>
This is something that perhaps a lot of home brew apps could use, not just AIM.
<br/>
<br/>
Know anyone working on something like this, or anyone that would wanna give me a hand getting started (new to NDS development in general... but MS in comp sci).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But which key would you assign to each direction+button? And how would you represent this keyboard on the screen? If you don't know how to prototype this on the DS, then you perhaps could prototype it on Microsoft Windows using a USB joypad.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

so the Y X A match up with the 1st/2nd/3rd character of each direction ( B can be used if there are 4 characters or as a dedicated space bar)

so if you wanted to type

<br/>
<br/>
Draw a 9 key button instead of a keyboard but in the same spot.  This would be touch sensative and also be highlighted when the directional pad is pressed (one press for first letter, two presses for 2nd, ect).  In addition to the 9 keys, there can be a few buttons to switch touch modes (Alpha, Numeric, Auto Complete), just like the options you have on a cell phone.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DHCP usually doesn't work too well in homebrew, so you're going to have to figure out the static settings.  I would recommend you go into your official WFC settings and change it from Automatic to manual.  You can usually find the correct info either from your router's administration page or by typing "ipconfig" at a command prompt.  The IP can be anything you like as long as it's within your network.  For instance, my PC is 192.168.1.100, so for my DS's IP I chose 192.168.1.125.  Subnet Mask you can find on your admin page (mine is 255.255.255.0), and Gateway is your router's IP address.
<br/>
<br/>
DNS servers can usually be found on your router's administration page, though sometimes it might work if you just type in the IP address of your router itself.  It works for me at least, though I generally prefer to use the actual DNS IPs.  
<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, if you have a new DS Lite, you might not be able to connect at all due to a change in the Wifi hardware.  DSAIM would need to be recompiled with the new WIFI library to fix this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

-a memory thing so you can have it remember you're sn and pass

the programme is great, good job.

But it only words for me, if I deactivate the WEP code.

I tried to use the firmware settings, but it stucks at "Logging into AIM" -&gt; "ERROR could not resolve host"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In games and with BeUP (the MSN tool) it works.
<br/>
<br/>
I set the WiFi connection (firmware) manually, not using the DHCP host.
<br/>
(I have a second WiFi connection saved in the firmware, maybe I should delete this? It's the same, but using the DHCP).
<br/>
<br/>
If I take out the WEP pw it works without problems.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An other thing is the keybord...I miss the buttons very often or rather more it does not give me the letters I hit...

Success with commercial games is not a good indicator of whether homebrew will work or not, as the homebrew Wifi library is a bit more picky.  For instance, it works best with manual settings applied, not automatic, and homebrew won't work with the Nintendo USB Wifi dongle without driver modifications.

* Compiled for DLDI

* Hitting up or x simulates the shift key
<br/>
* Hitting left or y simulates backspace
<br/>
* Hitting right or a simulates the return key.
<br/>
* Custom network settings are now saved in /DSAIM/DSAIM.CFG

* Accounts are saved in /DSAIM/DSAIM.ACC
<br/>
* Saved accounts can be scrolled through using the up/down or x/b keys
<br/>
* Password fields are now hidden.

Make sure you use the correct DLDI file so that writing to the flash device works.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Quick request:  could you make it use /DATA/DSAIM/* instead, or have it check that directory as well?  Using the /DATA/ folder is nice as it helps declutter my root folder.
<br/>

My miniSD card seems to be giving me issues right now.  I launched the program and it immediately locked up.  I can't run chkdisk until I reboot for who knows what reason.  I'll get back here in a few minutes.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  Yeah, can't get it to work on a Supercard miniSD.  I've tried placing it on the root directory, patched with SCSD.dldi (and I tried SCSD_moon.dldi when that failed, which usually always works).  I also tried it on my other miniSD card with no difference.  I also tried creating a /DSAIM folder manually in case it needed that.
<br/>
<br/>
The basic issue is that it doesn't show me the login screen.  It shows me the IM window screen as if I had already logged in, and it then freezes completely.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hi Ryan, 
<br/>
<br/>
Could you <span style="font-weight: bold">please recompile version 0.02e</span> with dswifi0.3d?! 
<br/>
<br/>
Since version 0.02e is working fine on my DS Lite with M3 simply but 
<br/>
version 0.03e freezes at startup, it might be the best way to take a 
<br/>
running version and enable it for (new) wifi..... 
<br/>

Same thing with the NOSTORE version.

Be honest, why don't you <span style="text-decoration: underline">recompile DSAIM 0.02e first</span>?

After that you will have plenty of time for bug fixing.

If you are having trouble connecting like me, try this:

Hit Select and Choose Your Router,

cmd /k ipconfig /all

then Find IP ADDRESS, you are going to change the last number,

<br/>
I got DSaim running, and the log in screen comes up but I still can't connect, I tried both dsaim.nds and dsaim_nostore.nds.
<br/>
Heres what dsaim is saying when trying to connect using the network settings from firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
searching for wifi...
<br/>
Acquiring IP...
<br/>
Failed to connect to Wifi.
<br/>
<br/>
Now when I run Wifi_lib_test.nds it says:
<br/>
<br/>
sgIP_DHCP_Start()
<br/>
ARP: request IP 0401A8c0
<br/>
ARP: request IP 0101A8c0
<br/>
<br/>
and then the lower screen says cannot connect to access point.
<br/>
<br/>
I know its not dsaim giving problems, cause I can't connect using the Wifi_lib_test.nds either.
<br/>
<br/>
The hardware I'm using:
<br/>
Newer DS-lite
<br/>
M3-Simply 1 gig micro sd (v1.03)
<br/>
Linksys wireless G router
<br/>
<br/>
Network settings:
<br/>
broadcasting on channel 10
<br/>
Automatic Configuration - DHCP 
<br/>
 Wireless SSID Broadcast : enabled
<br/>
Mac address set up for ds-lite (Which I double checked)
<br/>
WEP 128 bit security (Which I double checked)
<br/>
<br/>
I can connect for regular nds games... but can't connect to DSaim or other homebrews. Hopefully someone knows whats going on, cause i don't, hah

<br/>
I've got everything set up correctly, and I've tested the ICS with a separate computer to make sure it was working (it was). 
<br/>
<br/>
Using Wifi_lib_test.nds I can see the access point and connect and configure to it just fine. It accepts my settings, sees the network, says "Connected", and lets me perform all of the queries, returning the correct results each time (such as for DNS query, it correctly returns the IP addresses of any website).
<br/>
<br/>
When I boot up into DSAIM and try to use the same settings every time I try to log in I get "ERROR: Could not resolve host".
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions? Other than wifi_lib_test are there any other good homebrew programs I should try to test connectivity?

The regular version seems to hang whenever I try to log in (stops at "Searching for WIFI", right green status LED on DS light is blinking), or after saving any network settings.  The NOSTORE version seems to work a bit better, in that it doesn't hang after saving network settings, but it still hangs just after I send my AIM login info ("Searching for WIFI").  
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried both no WEP and 128-bit WEP (I've confirmed WFC works fine with a regular cartridge).  Have also tried static IP, DHCP, and getting network settings from firmware...all methods result in same symptoms for both .nds versions, that is, it hangs after I send my login info, with message "Searching for WIFI" shown.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wish someone would port Gaim to the DS :)  It has all the protocols in one, and it's open-source, but probably too big to port :(
<br/>
<br/>
As for the bigger evil, there is one evil and one stupid.  The evil will be evil, and AOL will be stupid.  We used to have AOL dial up, and it was horrible...you couldn't use anything, the AOL program was slow, and it persisted on installing needless junkware on your computer.
<br/>
<br/>
But, there is one thing AOL did right, AIM.  It's the most widely used IM protocol out there, even though it's not as good as say, Yahoo or MSN, it's still the most used.
<br/>
<br/>
As for DSAIM, it's awesome.  One thing I don't like is that the top screen isn't used to full potential.  You have the message crammed in and a border on the screen.  A tip on making applications: functionality over looks.  If it looks good but the looks interfere with the functionality, reduce the looks to improve the functionality...so minimize the border size and allow more text at a time.  Also, a smaller font (like the DSOrganize IRC font size) would be good, it'd allow more text on the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I think a good interface would leave the whole top screen for messages, and you could see the message you're typing on the top of the lower screen, remove the on-screen D-pad (use the hardware D-pad instead), and assign the user list to a button (have it fill the bottom screen, or use small tabs (like in Gaim or PictoChat).
<br/>
<br/>
Ah well, even with the current interface it's a great app.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Yes, but you'll have to make the Nintendo Wi-fi Adapter into a soft AP (access point).

aw bummer. it is WEP but there's a captive portal. when you first plug in your computer to their shit, it makes you install a bunch of junk. :(

    <h4>#144872 - IHaveCrayons - Thu Nov 08, 2007 6:31 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys. I've been successfully able to connect with DSAIM using the static IP configuration. Shortly following the "Login successful" prompt the keyboard is shown and it freezes. A lot of people say the solution to this is to patch with DLDI, which I did. I noticed many people still had this problem even when they DLDI patched or ever running the NOSTORE version.
<br/>
<br/>
So in order to understand why I tried a few steps.
<br/>
<br/>
I was able to successfully login under a different screenname. DSAIM was fully functional. I was able to IM, receives IM, look at my buddylist etc... so what was the difference? I was able to login with one SN but not another.
<br/>
<br/>
The difference was my main SN, the one that froze up, has 200 buddies on it not to mention about 384 recent buddies which the server continually tells me is over the limit. The other SN had about 20 buddies.
<br/>
<br/>
What I am guessing is that SNs with a large amount of buddies freeze DSAIM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i've noticed the buddy list thing, too.  i've been having a lot of problems logging in.  originally i couldn't login on my AOL screen name, which i've had forever.  not AIM, AOL.  i get an error saying AOL automatically logged me out or something.
<br/>
<br/>
then i tried it with an AIM screen name i hadn't toyed with.  new buddylist and everything.  that logged in fine.  i IMed a bot and got a reply and everything.
<br/>
<br/>
i took the buddylist from my AOL screen name, using the buddylist save option, loaded it in AIM, and tried to log into my AIM screen name again on my ds.  this time it just froze after claiming "login was successful..."
<br/>
<br/>
so i went in and i deleted all the groups, to see if the amount of people on the list was the problem.  i attempted to login and No, not the issue.  even with no one on my buddylist the screen froze.
<br/>
<br/>
so i created another AIM screen name and this time i just added 14 of my friends, all people i talk to.  i didn't delete any groups on the default buddylist or anything...i left all the bots.  didn't screw with the settings.  now it is working again...
<br/>
<br/>
this is bizarre-o.  there is no rhyme or reason to it.  my suggestion is, if you can't log on to your default screen name...create a new AIM screen name, don't alter the buddylist in any way other than adding buddies (try to keep it to a minimum), and see if you can login that way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
