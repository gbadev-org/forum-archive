    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all, 
<br/>
<br/>
DSFTP 2.2 is out. Get it at <a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">http://giesler.biz/bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html</a>. 
<br/>
<br/>
Noteworthy changes: 
<br/>
<br/>
o Stupid bug fixed that broke GBAMP support. (Thanks a lot to sgstair and chishm for help!) 
<br/>
o Booting verified to work on SuperCard and GBAMP, and should work on much more. This means just about everybody can now upload and auto-boot their stuff directly in DSFTP.
<br/>
o Safe power-off button combo added to prevent (rare) FAT corruption.
<br/>
o CDUP command added by request.
<br/>
o Built with devkitpro R19b
<br/>
o More bugfixes. 
<br/>
<br/>
On the topic of bug reports: reports via email are much preferred to reports posted in the forum, because I can track them much better that way. My email address is right there on DSFTP's GUI. Please include as much information as you can: What you see on the screen, the log output, your hardware configuration, DSFTP version used, etc. 
<br/>
<br/>
As always, donations are welcome. :-) My Paypal address is the same as my email address. 
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun! 
<br/>
<br/>
Regards,

Successfully upload a file, downloaded a file and booted a file.

Fine work.

A few of things:
<br/>
If I upload a file it does not immediately appear in the directory listing for the CF card and, therefore, I cannot download it.
<br/>
The meteos E3 demo does not boot but my homebrew stuff does.
<br/>
The upload speed (PC to DS) is about 30 KB/s (reasonable for a 1-2 Mbit wireless link) but download speed is about 3-5 KB/s. Is this what other people see? Capturing the download frames on the PC there appears to be lots of duplicate TCP ACKs and suspected TCP retransmissions. Maybe dswifi library doing something strange?

I have had problems like this with GFTP as well. Sometimes the file will not show up, or sometimes (this one is very odd), it will get put on the card but won't have the right file name. It often takes the name of a file I deleted from the card previously. I am not even sure how this is possible, but it has happened about 5 times since I started using DSFTP.
<br/>
<br/>
There was another problem I noted but I could not really track down. Occasionally when putting a file on the card with DSFTP and then reading that same card in my card reader, any attempt to delete the uploaded file from my Linux machine will cause I/O errors and a message about the file being read-only. But if I then take the card and put it into a Windows machine, not only is the file <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> marked as read-only, but it deletes without an issue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've seen this before on my SC CF. It has always been the fault of a previously-corrupted file system, which FATlib, Windows and Linux have very different opinions about.
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure your card is FS-checked. Also, do not switch off your DS while there's a transfer in progress. The new key combination for safe shutdown seems to be the best bet for this.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">DSFTP homepage</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have been looking at the dswifi library's TCP implementation. It appears to send data it has already sent along with new data, wasting bandwidth and leading to poor download performance.
<br/>
<br/>
Done a quick hack and get download performance of about 30+ KB/s, i.e. the similar to the upload performance I was getting.
<br/>
Not all good though as small parts of the downloaded file get corrupted and I have knackered the upload (the TCP window keeps reaching zero). If I get it sorted I will pass on the changes for sgstair to look at.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT:</span>
<br/>
The slow upload speed seens to have been caused by a buggered FAT filesystem.
<br/>
<br/>
The 'rename' command does not work for me. DSFTP locks up half way through the operation leaving the original file intacted. A new file is partly created (the name appears in a directory listing) but not properly (it has no size and Moonshell complains that the FAT is bad).

My mistake, gftp maintains a cache of the directory listing. You can clear this with "clear cache" and then the file appears.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Great Work @masscat !
<br/>
Your patch works very well for me. I get ~80KBps(!) in DS -&gt; PC ! Much more than i expected.
<br/>
Maybe you could figure out how to get this wonderful speed for PC -&gt; DS !?
<br/>
<br/>

It does make the DS -&gt; PC transfer much more usable.
<br/>
<br/>
Just a word of warning. Take care with the patch as it is more a proof of concept than a well thought out implementation. Keep an eye on it if you use it in other projects.
<br/>
I have seen it not transmit data, requiring a timeout (no bytes were lost), and reducing performance when using it with my gdb stub.
<br/>
Also the increase in speed is only when using TCP (UDP does not have a speed problem as far as I know).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

At those speeds streaming becomes much more usefull, I was thinking.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --
