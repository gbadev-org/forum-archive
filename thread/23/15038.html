Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm pleased to announce Rainbow Sprite Wars for the NDS. a 2D sprite-based shooter. The game is still very early, but I think it's to the point where it's at least fun to play for a few minutes (hopefully). Still lots and lots of stuff to do... I'm going for some kind of an AI sandbox with tactical assault overtones! :o) Any feedback is appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the demo download page (geocities):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is a pretty cool beginning.  I defintely like the style.  Are you coding it for the pdroms.de 4-color compo?
<br/>
<br/>
I find the mechanic of having to tap the touchscreen to shoot a little difficult to use.  I understand that you probably designed it this way on purpose to make you game different instead of just copying the Robotron mechanics from games like Geometry Wars, so I don't know if I have any suggestions for improvement, but I just thought I'd mention it.  Maybe I just need more practice, though, eh?
<br/>
<br/>
Since the default behavior of the enemies is to follow you around, I often wished I had a mine type weapon.  It could either be activated when touched by an enemy or maybe be time based and explode a certain time after you drop it off.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to seeing this game develop.

Thanks for the feedback! I wasn't aware of the compo...
<br/>
<br/>
I've posted a <span style="font-weight: bold">new version</span> that features "drag shooting" -- just hold down L or R and drag to shoot!
<br/>
<br/>
But I've also kept the "tap shooting" system as well, probably to be used for a secondary weapon (grenade?) later on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks! I've added walls and some questionable pathfinding for the "big brother" enemies.
