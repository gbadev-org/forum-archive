<br/>
It was many time ago since I released the latest MegaETk version, and people kept asking me when I was going to add DLDI support to it. I personally won't do it (I left MegaETk development already) but I will finally let you do, for whoever wants to.
<br/>
You will be able to add more levels and monsters too.
<br/>
If you want to do it, please read this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
This code is released for public DS homebrew.
<br/>
If you want to change/edit and release it to public, please contact me before doing it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Notes:
<br/>
-You will probably have to port MegaETk to latest PAlib version (I'm sure it won't work with actual.. megaetk was created with an old PAlib version, which was new in it's creation)
<br/>
<br/>
-Game had a encryption for saves, I removed it before releasing to public because the person who gave me the code didn't want it public. (Removed encryuption/decryption lines, it may or not work.. it should work)
<br/>
<br/>
-If you want to add any more monsters, you can use the tools I've added (after drawing it), you will have to recompile the 'Event Editor' if you want to add it in your own level (visual studio 200X(3?)).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DLDI Support needs: update fatlib and fix PAlib changes (it won't compile in latest version, something shouldn't be working now in the game with that).
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!

Does it compile in MinGW or Visual C++ Express, or would people have to pay Microsoft to modify your program?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I really don't know if it compiles with that, I'm not really experienced in windows applications.. I just used "Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003" to "code" the application to make it easier to place monsters/objects/teleports or edit monsters attributes.
<br/>
You can allways do it manually:
<br/>
"levelevents/info.txt" has the info you will need for level objects (monsters, teleports, etc.)
<br/>
"monster/info.txt" has the info to edit your monsters too.
<br/>
<br/>
When I meant recompile it was just to add 1 more option to 'select monster', you can just choose any other monster and edit it's monster ID later in the .c output</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
