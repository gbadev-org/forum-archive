    <h4>#134062 - Lordus - Tue Jul 10, 2007 11:57 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
if anyone is interested, a new version is out. I am sure you can find it somewhere ;)
<br/>
<br/>
New features:
<br/>
<br/>
v0.7.4
<br/>
<br/>
  - Changed scheduling of M68000 and Z80.
<br/>
  - Some changes in M68000 internal memory handlers.
<br/>
  - YM2612 FM core mostly rewritten in ASM.
<br/>
  - Some bugs in FM core fixed (Operator 1 was sometimes not considered in certain cases).
<br/>
  - Fixed reset bug for FM core resulting in unstable sound for every game loaded except the 1st one.
<br/>
  - Raised sample rate for FM emulation from 16KHz to 28KHz (28, because a few games can't do 32KHz)
<br/>
  - Sound is completely mixed in hardware now, meaning every FM channel, PSG and DAC have their own DS sound channels.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
v0.7
<br/>
   - Fixed bug in Z80 core, preventing some games from having sound.
<br/>
  - Fixed bug in 68000 optimization, that could make some games hang.
<br/>
  - Changed sound handling and doubled sample rate for PCM sound, resulting in slightly better sound quality.
<br/>
  - HW renderer partially rewritten, many glitches should be gone, some are still there (and will probably not be easy to fix ever)
<br/>
  - Sprite rendering completely rewritten in ASM. Should be faster and fix most of the sprite issues.
<br/>
  - Implemented mid frame palette updates (water effects in certain games). Note, that this just works, if a game is constantly fast enough, so slowdowns can still cause colors to flicker).
<br/>
  - Many little optimizations in memory handling and the CPU cores. Should reduce slowdowns.
<br/>
  - Added option for sprite masking. It is not 100% emulated, just faked to be enough for most games using it (disable it, if sprites are missing, that should be there).
<br/>
  - Added option to change between 3- and 6-Button pad (just works, if the option is applied BEFORE loading a game). When 6-Button pad is disabled, L+R can be used to move the visible screen area, X to center it.
<br/>
  - Added sound state to the savestates, so that the correct tracks should play now when a state is loaded. Savestates are still not 100% reliable and loading old states can potentially cause problems.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The new version also contains a preview version of a SMS/GG emulator i have been working on a bit. It has these features so far:
<br/>
<br/>
  - Enhanced Z80 ASM core used in jEnesisDS.
<br/>
  - SMS/GG emulation.
<br/>
  - 10 Savestates per game.
<br/>
  - Rewind and fast forward feature.
<br/>
  - Settings can be saved per game.
<br/>
  - Fully rendered by the DS 2D hardware.
<br/>
  - Perfect sync option, that actually syncs every scanline (emulated scanline to DS scanline).
<br/>
    This option is more accurate, and needed for some games to look correctly, but it can be     problematic to use it, when "Rewind" is enabled.
<br/>
  - sample accurate (almost ;P) PSG emulation.
<br/>
  - Stereo sound for GG games.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Known issues: 
<br/>
- timing is not exactly correct yet, so some games might not work, or have glitches.
<br/>
- No FM emulation (yet?)
<br/>
- Sprite updates need to be improved, sometimes there can be glitched sprites atm.
<br/>
- Many more, that i don't remember now..
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you like it.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Lordus on Sun Jul 13, 2008 1:05 am; edited 4 times in total</span></div>

I wonder if this could ever possibly have any chance of supporting custom ROMs that are over the 4MB 'standard' Genesis size limit (and the DS' RAM size)...examples of these ROMs would be several of the Sonic * homemade hacks/addons, and <a class="postlink" href="http://umk3.hacking-cult.org" target="_blank">Ultimate Mortal Kombat Trilogy</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am definately gonna work on this until i am statisfied and i am a perfectionist ;)

Dont get your hopes up about sound too much. Ill do what i can, it just really needs a LOT of processing power. The FM chip needs about the same and in cases more power than the M68000 core itself.

Thanks, but i dont really see the point in that. jEnesisDS is fairly new, but i am working on Genesis emulation for a while myself and my Java version is at about 99% compatibiity atm and plays Dino Dini soccer just fine ;)

I am not aiming at 100% compatibility (which you can never reach anyway) with this one, but speed.

wow! perhaps it's possible to implement sound on a scaled down level, with some parts cut back? having sound would be neat, but not at the expense of a constantly fluctuating/stuttering framerate.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i know the FM chip is pretty much an impossibility, but provided you aren't using the arm7 for much right now, the z80 is definitely within reason, right?
<br/>
<br/>
(and if you get the 68k and z80 working at a reasonable speed in tandem then neogeo might not be too far off...)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: it just occurred to me that goomba color can't be at all a bad reference to point to use for emulating a z80 on an arm7...

Wow. I tried this out at school today while not bothering to cheer on others in races, and I have to say this is <span style="font-weight: bold">the</span> best Genesis emulator I have ever had the pleasure to use on my DS. It ran Sonic 1 and 2 perfectly, albeit some problems in Sonic 2 concerning what looks like scanlines flicking up and down the screen after a while, but the special stages are still playable even with the purple stripy background. Thank you for this wonderful emulator. I read a post before about having a large buffer for sound or something; this would be nice, but on my top 10 list for the next release, I'd say savestates would make this emulator one of the best I have ever used.

I have a Genesis, but I don't know much about how it does sound.

Does the Z80 do most of the sound or does the FM chip?  Even if some effects didn't show, all it really needs is background music and jump and item sounds, it depends on what chip the sound is on.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

<br/>
<br/>
I made some progress with the sound, but its still a long way to go. I dont think full sound will be possible, maybe 3-4 of the 6 FM channels + PSG and DAC at reasonable quality. I currently have 2-3 channels + PSG working for games, that dont need the Z80 for sound, but i see room for optimizations. The Z80 will be a problem though, as it would have to be additionally emulated on the Arm9.
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that is really slowing me down at the moment is that i dont have a DS anymore and it might take some time, untill i can get another one...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks, but it wouldnt really help. I wrote my own 68000 core in arm assembly, and i intend to continue using it. It is an integrated core, based on my Java core, which has no known bugs and should be a bit faster than Cyclone.

I also dont even like to look at other code, because its much more fun developing from documentation only. Except for the sound cores, jEnesis was completely developed based on documentation and tests on real hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I had always thought emulating the FM would be the most CPU intensive part, from what I'd heard from other coders. IMHO, I'd focus on the FM + PSG and ditch the Z80 for now. Games without music are kinda "meh", and sound effects are nice, in the games that will be able to use them without a Z80.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Great works for this new update as Thunder Force IV works near perfection with sound (which is for me the best test to see how the emulation works).
<br/>
But I have two questions.
<br/>
First : Do you think it'll be possible to force 50 hz on the game. What I mean is with the 50 hz, you got 2 black zone (up and down) so no need of vertical scalling.
<br/>
Second : Can't you use the same kind of scalling as the other (but lost) MD emulator on DS which succeed to have full screen scaling or use some kind of hadware zoom (no scalling) on a larger screen (as the Ds can manage page screen of 512x384).
<br/>
However and once again : GREAT WORK !!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

jEnesisDS already implements vertical scaling, and in fact this option is enabled by default.  PicoDriveDS used software rendering, unlike most builds of jEnesisDS which use hardware rendering.  Only software renderers can use horizontal scaling.  Scaling horizontally in hardware rendering mode is not possible.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want horizontal scaling in jEnesisDS, download v0.4a and use the SW renderer version.  This will cause a performance hit though, so you'll need to use frameskip to maintain full speed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

PAL has actually a higher vertical resolution, that's why those black borders appear for games that were not properly converted to PAL, or even done directly for PAL. Forcing the speed to 50Hz would have absolutely no impact on the resolution.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

BIN is a pure dump. SMD is deinterleaved and has a small header, due to the piracy device they originate from working much like that (2 banks of 8-bit RAM to emulate a 16-bit ROM), emulators have to reinterleave to make a usable image, hence the slowness to load.

Yesterday I tested all Sonic games and they worked great!

The only thing missing on this emulator is the screen size. Genesis resolution is too big for the NDS and we can't get horizontal resizing because of the hardware renderer.

Would you be able to implement a similar auto scrolling mode like PocketNES had? NES had a bigger resolution than GBA, but it had a mode that the camera followed a specific sprite.

The problem is, that some games change palette entries mid frame, to achieve the water effect, for example. To get the same effect with the hardware renderer, the DS's palette would have to be updated on the same scanline, the game intended to do so. Of course that will be at a completely different time as the emulation of that scanline. This causes the current glitches. So the write has to be buffered and executed later during a DS hblank interrupt, which is not completely without problems.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, that's one of those games that changes the palette midframe (for the water effect), which is currently a problem. Hopefully this (and the slowdown) will be solved in the next version, but the sound and everything involved took all my time for the current release.

Just a quick question.
<br/>
<br/>
The player animations for Tecmo Superbowl sometimes just stay they same when running.  Is there any option in your emulator to correct this?
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried them all but I was wondering if perhaps it was a combination of options that were needed.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'm not able to change anything in the options screen for this game or change team control either for season play.

I'm currently running it without sound and the 60 fps is utter fantastic!

Yes it is particularly hard when you render in hardware. Many EA games, including the ones you mentioned use 128x tile wide BG modes, which do not exist on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: 
<br/>
Oh, sorry Tepples i didn't see your post as it took me an eternity to write those 2 lines ;) Of course that is an issue, too, with games like that. But i believe, that even with hardware rendering, the CPU and VDP timing is accurate enough to handle this. And it is also reproducible with software rendering, by not supporting 128x modes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The SMS/GG emulation is currently not included into jEnesisDS for a reason, which is lack of RAM. So i doubt very much that there will ever be an all in one emulator. 
<br/>
As for the SegaCD emulation, i would say no. At the moment jEnesisDS spends most of its time on the ARM9 for the 68000 emulation and is not always full speed. The SegaCD adds another 68000, which runs even 50% faster than the Genesis' CPU, plus rotation and scaling hardware (and some other things that have to be emulated).
<br/>
Of course many games might not need the rotation hw, and spend a lot of time idling on the slave CPU, but still it would have to be synchronized and slow everything down.
<br/>
The worst thing would probably be, that once it'd be there, people would ask for 32X emulation, which is completely out of the question. But people always want more, right?

The savestates don't really work very well yet, but i plan to work on them (when i feel like it).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, i rewrote most of the FM core in ASM, fixing some bugs along the way and changed the scheduling of the M68000 and Z80 core completely. Along with some other little improvements here and there, this results in speed ups of up to 30% and much better sound.
<br/>
<br/>
I could raise the sample rate for the FM sound from 16KHz, as it was in version 0.7, to 28KHz. A few games can not quite make it at 32KHz, that's why I left it at 28KHz, but I'm working on it. Anyhow the difference is not really noticeable, except for a few sounds.
<br/>
<br/>

Thanks. The sound emulation itself is not really affecting the speed at all, as it's entirely run on the ARM7. The Z80 emulation is, of course. While most games can run at 120fps or above, there are some hard cases that still have occasional slowdowns. I wont stop until they're gone though ;)

I think, that is a bit problematic. It might work for relatively static backgrounds, like in the Sonic3 save select screen, but unfortunately Road Rash and other games that have 128x32 bgs (like Batman and Robin, for example) scroll around heavily per line (which is even easier on the Genesis, as it has a horizontal scroll table, so games don't even need to use HBlank effects). So what is the visible area then? I would have to keep track of that constantly and update the DS maps (and tiles) on demand. At the very least that'd require a complete new renderer just for 128x32 mode. 
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking before of using two adjacent 64x32 maps that i can simply forward the VRAM writes to, like i do now, and choosing the right 64x32 map window out of it each HBlank, by setting the table address appropriately and adjusting the horizontal scroll value. When I thought about i calculated that I'd run out of VRAM, if i keep everything else like it is now, but I'm too lazy to recalculate that at the moment.. Of course, there is still the problem, when the map wraps horizontally, but it would probably be better than it is at the moment.

The SegaCD adds a lot of extra things to emulate. You have to synchronize 3 CPUs, and the 2nd M68000 runs at 12.5MHz (about 60% faster than the Genesis' M68000, which still runs, too, of course).
<br/>
Video is basically the same, except for the scaling and rotation hardware, which is completely out of the question. Even on the GP2X, games that make heavy use of it run very slow.
<br/>
<br/>
So let's wait and see..

Genesis games that seem like that have a resolution of 320x224, while the DS just has 256x192. The screen is scaled vertically, but not horizontally (I'm kinda lazy to explain why that is not possible), except you turn vertical scaling off.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you're lazy, i'm lazy..it's cool.  makes sense though..I know the scaling capabilities of the DS are a bit weak.

I can't confirm it. There seem to be more issues with certain flashcarts now though, so maybe that is the problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've played Gunstar Heroes on it and got through a couple of levels but I'm also using an M3 Lite, which I think has additional RAM?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
