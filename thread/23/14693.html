    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried some of these releases out probably when they were first released, but I found them frustrating because I didn't know what the graffiti input was supposed to be for some letters and there didn't seem to be a backspace command, so the interface was really frustrating.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I should have RTFM or gone to Papfuji's page or just tried pressing some buttons randomly since it looks like the X button brings up a table of the graffiti characters.
<br/>
<br/>
Now that I know, I'll have to try some of these out again and see how well they work.  Text adventure games on the DS with graffiti input sounds like it would work out really well.
