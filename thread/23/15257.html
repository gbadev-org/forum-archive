    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Happy easter,
<br/>
here is a late present for you: DSChess 0.4
<br/>
<br/>
I have changed a lot in this version, the engine becomes stronger, while at the same time becoming weaker. How does that works? 
<br/>
On the one hand I have optimized the memory management and hash tables, this leads to a more than 50% search speed increase, on the other I have added a level system. There are eleven playing strengths for beginners, now even a not very experienced player should beat his Nintendo DS at level one (<span style="font-weight: bold">Important: Start a new game after changing the level!</span>).
<br/>
Additionally you can now beat your friend on one DS (H vs. H).
<br/>
Furthermore a lot of bugs were fixed and some more features were implemented. Look at the Changelog for more details.
<br/>
<br/>
As usual you get the latest version here: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.vonloesch.de/dschess" target="_blank">http://www.vonloesch.de/dschess</a>
