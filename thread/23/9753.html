    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Someone has made a replacement for the Moonshell encoder that encodes at a higher quality and with smaller files. Best of all, it's a batch encoder so you can set up a list of files and it will ancode away. No more babysitting!!!

<br/>
<br/>
Edit: It seems the batch encoding isn't in this build yet, but will be added in the next one. Still, it encodes at much better quality than the original encoder.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There seem to be a lot of people having issues with the program, which I'm unfortunately not able to reproduce. Screenshots of where it exactly gets stuck might help.

@Extreme: You just need three things; Avisynth, BatchDPG and mencoder. Bundling mencoder wouldn't be of much use since the best version to get is processor specific.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But don't almost all machines with USB ports (and thus with CF or SD writers) have at least a Pentium II/III (i686+MMX) CPU? So even though mencoder for Pentium II isn't the theoretically fastest build, wouldn't it be reasonable to bundle that and then let performance freaks sort it out?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Yes, I did some testing and the performance difference is negligable. That's why a generic (and much smaller) version of mencoder is now included in v0.4.
<br/>
<br/>
Installation instructions.
<br/>
- Install Avisynth from <a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=57023" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=57023</a>. Make sure to get the 2.5 version, not the 2.0.
<br/>
- Install this file to any place you like: <a class="postlink" href="http://rapidshare.de/files/22045448/BatchDPG.exe.html" target="_blank">http://rapidshare.de/files/22045448/BatchDPG.exe.html</a> / <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mytempdir.com/711360" target="_blank">http://www.mytempdir.com/711360</a>.

<br/>
- Now includes generic version of mencoder.
<br/>
<br/>
BatchDPG v0.4 beta 2
<br/>
- Batch code somewhat rewritten.
<br/>
- 'nodef' error should be fixed. It was caused by sloppy coding on my part. -_-" To keep it short: the error occured when the path to BatchDPG contained any number of spaces. This wasn't the case on my setup, so I didn't notice before.
<br/>
- Audio bitrate can now be as low as 96 kbps.
<br/>
<br/>
BatchDPG v0.4 beta 1
<br/>
- Batch support, finally!
<br/>
- Desperate attempt to fix issues. Probably won't work, but worth a try.
<br/>
<br/>
BatchDPG v0.3
<br/>
- Settings are now saved.
<br/>
- Should handle VFAPI better.
<br/>
- Should work now on non-English Windows XP systems.
<br/>
- Because of the marginal speed difference between the Medium and Low profiles, the quality of Low is now a little lower to improve speed, and equivalent to the dpgenc default.
<br/>
<br/>
BatchDPG v0.2
<br/>
- Required codec included.
<br/>
- Package now in semi-installer form.
<br/>
<br/>
BatchDPG v0.1
<br/>
- Inititial release.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Only suggestion I have is an option to force a certain aspect ratio as in the original DPGenc application.  Some videos I have aren't quite right, a couple of them are encoded a the original DVD resolution rather than padded or manipulated to a true widescreen res.

Avisynth's BicubicResize is used for resizing the video, and its ResampleAudio for resampling the audio. This appears to sound better than mencoder's resampling, and as soon as I started using this method the out-of-sync issues in MoonShell disappeared too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On one hand I understand you want more control on the ouput, but on the other hand I'd like to keep this app as simple as possible and I don't really know how I would integrate this option in the program. For now, you can do this relatively easy by creating an AVS file for your video yourself, use Avisynth's Crop command, and open that file in BatchDPG. It will, ironically, create an AVS file for the existing AVS file, but it works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is probably some kind of codec problem. You could try installing the latest version of Windows Media Player, which should install the necessary DirectShow codecs. Also, could you interrupt the the VFAPI step by clicking on the system tray icon and selecting Exit, open the created .avs file in any media player and tell me what error message it displays?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is no step by step guide. It just works for me with Real Alternative installed, and there are too many factors involved to have me give you an answer to why it isn't working. Luckily, media files are not very often originally created in RMVB, so in those cases just get to the original, non-re-encoded files.

seems to me that all of my avi files are encoded (is that the right word?) with xvid, either that or the codec pack i have installed use xvid to decode stuff. also what file formats does mediainfo support? maybe you can add a seperate colume in the task file noting the files rejected by mediainfo but add it to task anyways?

<br/>
<br/>
I wrote a small batch application for Windows XP that uses mediainfo to check the resolutions of all video files in a given directory. It then creates a list of the new resolutions you should use in batchdpg. Since this batch application is specific to batchdpg, and since LS5 likes it so much, I'm only listing it in this thread for the time being.. to get it, click on the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.electronicfiles.net/files/2314/DSCoding/batchratiov1.0.rar" target="_blank">this link - </a><a href="http://www.electronicfiles.net/files/2314/DSCoding/batchratiov1.0.rar" target="_blank">http://www.electronicfiles.net/files/2314/DSCoding/batchratiov1.0.rar</a>
<br/>
<br/>
All you have to do is copy ratio.bat and mediainfo.exe to any folder with movie files you wish to run in batchdpg, then doubleclick ratio.bat and it will automatically create the list for you. BTW, don't close the command prompt box that comes up until you're done with it.

Are you, perhaps, using VLC or MPlayer to watch your video's? If yes, you're most likely missing the correct codecs. Try installing a recent version of XviD.

<br/>
I could not get 0.6b1 or 0.6b2 to work due to bugs etc.
<br/>
<br/>
After testing MANY encoding variables, best settings are (ZERO pauses , Excellent quality) 
<br/>
<br/>
FPS = Auto (Don't expect more than 15fps for full screen 4:3 videos)
<br/>
Profile = MED (High if you don't mind longer encoding time for little bit better quality) 
<br/>
Width/Height = Same as ratio of video 
<br/>
Audio Bitrate = 160 Stereo (Or 96k Mono is better quality but without seperation) 
<br/>
Normalize = Use this for louder sounds. (Will pause for around 3-5minutes during encoding at beginning) 
<br/>
Video Bitrate = 288 (This is the PERFECT rate for videos. Even 296 causes pauses.) 
<br/>
Max Video Bitrate = Always match the video bitrate = 288 
<br/>
<br/>
I have 3 NDS Lites and have encoded a few videos all with various settings.
<br/>
Then played 3 same videos with different encoding settings next to each other.
<br/>
The only video bitrate which got zero stuttering/pauses was the 288kbps.
<br/>
All other higher rate started to pause once in a while.
<br/>
Video quality is still much better than DPGEnc. =)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways. it's tough getting all the codec to work together. But worth it.

just curious, a nodef error shouldnt occur if the video can in fact play properly in a player right?

also, i think people should stop refer it as a nodef error, just put a language file in the dpglan folder or somethign similar and see what it says

edit: why would a .rm video that can be converted in the official DPGtools not able to convert in batchdpg..."playtime cannot be detected"
<br/>
edit 2: i tried using dpgenc alone, and it converts it. seems like there's some kind of "translating" error by using VFPAIConvEn, whats VFAPI for anyways? subtitle support? if so, can there be an option where we can simply bypass it and let dpgenc handle the original file?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nope, the VFAPI step can not be bypassed. What VFAPI does is turn the AVS file into a 'fake' AVI file which does include audio, but still depends on the AVS file for the video. This is done because dpgenc doesn't accept normal AVS files.

AviSynth + VFAPIConv seems like an unnecessary step, from my understanding, AviSynth is used to serve each frame at the specified settings in the avs scripting file. however most of these functions is already present in DPGenc except normalizing the sound, but that can be done with mencoder anyways right? wouldnt it be easier to just use dpgenc with the original video file instead of passing frames to it? (well, to be honest i say that because i seem to have problem with my video files going through AviSynth and VFAPIConv)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hi LS5,
<br/>
Can you add the fuction that we can select ouput folder. There are only 2 selections; by default output files will be same folder as input files; and the other option is that we can choose a folder for some output files.
<br/>
<br/>
For example:
<br/>
I have 1.avi, 2.avi, 3.avi, 4.avi. When convert, I can choose output for 1.dpg, 4.dpg at a folder that we can set; output for 2.dpg, 3.dpg by default will be at same folder of 2.avi, 3.avi.

By looking at the mencoder log, it seems dpgenc converts the video to BGR24 anyway, so if it's just dpgenc not being able to handle YUV video properly, I guess adding a ConvertToRGB24() command to the Avisynth script would fix this problem.

That's the error that comes up when using the mencoder version from the DPG tools package. It's not that hard to add support for it though, so expect it working in the next version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's not really a graphical interface for Avisynth, but you can use the crop values you find in VirtualDub for Avisynth's Crop command.

<br/>
<br/>
The reason I used VFAPI and dpgenc in the first place was because I didn't know how to write the DPG header. I knew about this (<a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7897" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7897</a>) topic with very valuable information, but I didn't have enough coding experience to actually be able to write something that creates the header. The thing is, I still don't. The good news, though, is that I pasted the code of the program in that topic named headermaker into Microsoft Visual C++ Express Edition, and to my surprise, I actually got it to compile correctly. However, when joining the header with the audio file and the video file, MoonShell would reject the file. After comparing the header created by dpgenc with the one from headermaker, I found that the error came from one subtle difference. headermaker writes the number of channels, while dpgenc doesn't. Apparently, if it is a null byte, it tells MoonShell that the file contains MP2 audio, instead of GSM. After slightly editing the headermaker code, I got it to work correctly. I've rewritten a large part of BatchDPG so it now doesn't need VFAPI and dpgenc anymore. This allows for a lot of new possibilities, such as using other encoders, framerates up to 60 fps (60 fps is, ofcourse, not really useful, but 25 fps might be), samplerates up to 48000, audio bitrates higher than 160 kbps, etc. I've gotten it to work correctly for the most part, but there are still some things that need to be worked out. I'm not ignoring your bug reports and feature requests, but I want to get this completely working first. ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Too much has changed, so no changelog, just a list of notes:
<br/>
- Progress bar (currently) only works for video.
<br/>
- TwoLAME is used as the MP2 encoder, which should provide a little bit better quality.
<br/>
- I've been testing a lot of MPEG-1 encoders, but I havn't found one yet that provides better output and is easier to use than mencoder.
<br/>
- Only use mono for 44,1 kHz and 48 kHz. You've been warned.
<br/>
- Only use up to 192 kbps for mono.
<br/>
- A lot of files in the older versions of BatchDPG are not used anymore, so if you're overwriting your older installation, you might want to delete the older directory first.
<br/>
- Avisynth is still a requirement.
<br/>
- The created DPG files are not exactly compliant. You won't notice it during playback, but dpgdec will give an error when trying to demux the DPG file. Still trying to find a solution.
<br/>
- Probably some more I forgot.
<br/>

My complete lack of knowledge in compiling anything is what's blocking the use of a non-.NET language.

It appears you don't need the framework; you just have to have another program compiled with a recent Visual C++ installed, or you need to use Google to get MSVCP70.dll.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Hmm.. As compared to the Moonshell's encoder they have.. The file they output are smaller in filesize (Max Settings) and slightly better in quality.. 
<br/>
<br/>
I compare the quality via the clarity of the lyrics that my mtv video played.. The words that moonshell encoder produced are alot clearer than that of the BatchDPG..
<br/>

However everyone kept saying that this program is indeed better.. So maybe I've got my settings wrong.. So I am wondering if anyone can provide me with the best settings that can outshine the Moonshell's encoder totally?

Well, don't expect anything amazing. In my opinion, with the recent release of the PSP MOD AVC homebrew, the PSP is still light-years ahead of the DS in terms of video playback. However, from my own experience, the results of my BatchDPG are at the very least slightly better than those of 'just' dpgenc. You might disagree though. As for the best settings, the program's defaults are actually what i use myself.

Could you try the v1.0 beta 2 alternative build from the previous page, and try playing the created AVS file in a media player? If the process is that short, it's probably a codec problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think I might have fixed the DPG not being created issue.

BatchDPG is supposed to select the correct aspect ratio automatically. If it doesn't, you have no choice but to select the correct aspect ratio manually.

As for the people with MSVCR70.DLL problems, the culprit is avs2wav. However, I don't know how it is compiled exactly. My current advice would be to try installing the .NET Framework 1.1 (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=262D25E3-F589-4842-8157-034D1E7CF3A3" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=262D25E3-F589-4842-8157-034D1E7CF3A3</a>), but I can't give you any promises.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

+ Nice audio quality,cleaner and sharper than moonshell's.

+ Jumping to various points of the video causes no desync at all,unlike moonshell's dpgenc.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it's important to note that some media cards aren't read as fast as others. I'm not sure about other flashcarts, but there's some pretty extensive studies done on SD, Mini-SD and CF Media with the corresponding M3 units, and Media Cards that perform poorly on certain tests (<span style="font-weight: bold">[/yarr]</span> video comes to mind) won't be able to play the higher quality videos without freezes. I have one SD card that can play 256x192 res video at 24fps without slowdowns, but the same video on other SD cards tends to freeze for about 45 seconds after the first ten seconds.
<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, it all depends upon how fast your Flashcart (M3, Supercard, EZ4, and whatever else) can read/write from/to the SD or CF card. 1.1MBps is required for a perfect 5 on the video test (no slowdowns, no frameskips, etc.). The one that plays the best can transfer around 1.5 MBps. We need a DS app to test performance of media cards - something I'm looking into making, but I've got a LOT to learn about coding for the DS before THAT happens.

Once transcoding audio is finished, the transcoder crashes, but I click okay on the windows memory error popup and then in goes on to do the same thing at the end of the video transcoding. The resulting DPG is works almost perfectly.

</li><li>The resulting DPG has problems with aspect ratio (no kidding). It seems to be stretched only horizontally on the DS.</li></ul>

<br/>
The original file was encoded with XVID (29fps, 153kbps, 24 bit sample size), MPEG 3 (128kbps), 512*384 pixel. So I'm guessing the problems have to do with the codec as XVID can't really be trusted.

Ah, another person who has the problem of the aspect ratio not being retrieved correctly. In any case, you can set the width and height manually in the video 'group'. A width of 256 and height of 144 is the 'perfect' value for widescreen content, and a width of 256 and height of 192 the correct one for fullscreen content.

Well, yeah, simulating keypresses could ofcourse solve this, but if they crash there's something more serious going on. Do the error messages say something informative?

<br/>
That can be solved by setting the width and height correctly. But like I said before, this should be done automatically, and if it doesn't, I'm going to have to take another good look at the code.
<br/>
<br/>
In other news, I've released BatchDPG v1.0 beta 5, which includes the array variable bugfix and the 'do after encoding' and process priority feature requests. Only mencoder is currently affected though.

Thanks for your reply. Umh, I installed .NET Framwork 2.0, so I need to uninstall version 2.0 and install version 1.1? :(</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Actually, the 1.1 and 2.0 versions are two standalone frameworks. For applications based on framework 1.1, you'd still need 1.1 even if you already have 2.0 installed.

I'm using the default settings with the low and medium profiles. I've tried several different videos in different formats and all lock up. I tried turning off the dithering and the GOP in moonshell, but it didn't help.

Perhaps a small and simple drag and drop interface that allows you to predefine the arguments you want passed at each step. Then just drop all your files at once and the program spits out a .bat file with all the commands to do the processing.

Like Snowy? said, .NET v2.0 is irrelevant, you should have v1.1 installed.

It is a version number, after all, and Microsoft has only recently given up on backwards compatibility. (And it still does exist, for the most part).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:

<a class="postlink" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnnetdep/html/netfxcompat.asp" target="_blank">There...</a>
<br/>
See chart in the middle; Microsoft appears to be saying that it's backwards compatible. A web search seems to give mixed opinions.
<br/>
Wouldn't it be crashing with a big and loud error box, though?
<br/>
Of course, I do believe you; I'll install 1.1 and see what happens :)

Execuse me while I go outside and beat myself over the head with a phone pole.

As you may have guessed, it works now :P

(I guess I inadvertantly uninstalled AviSynth previously).

Very nice!!

<br/>
Okay, two suggestions:
<br/>
Firstly: Is it possible to auto-detect if AviSynth is installed?
<br/>
And: Any chance of a Cancel button? I found a big problem with Moonlight's movie encoder was the inability to cancel an encoding operation without going into the task manager, which was a a pain.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for making this... and for putting up with my inability to read instructions :)

Edit:
<br/>
Seems to create much smaller DPGs, too!
<br/>
What took up 52 MB with the old DPG encoder only consumes around 32 here.
<br/>
Is that a known feature, or something that I've done wrong?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

You mean using the same bitrate settings? As for your first suggestion; that's very easy to do, so I added that to the code. Will be present in the next version. Your second suggestion is on my to-do list.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That would do it.. It's giving you an error during the audio transcoding process. Don't fully know why, but try the previous beta. It uses a different audio transcoding method.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Either audio or video was not added to the DPG... I'm guessing audio that's missing, since video would probably take up more space. Both seemed to have been converted, but perhaps not both added to the final dpg file.

<a class="postlink" href="http://ls5.cydonianknight.com/" target="_blank">BatchDPG v1.0 beta 8</a> was just released. No major changelog:
<br/>
- Check to see if AviSynth is installed.
<br/>
- 44100 samplerate removed because it introduced artifacts in the video, the 384 and 320 audio bitrates removed because they caused the video to freeze when seeking.
<br/>
<br/>
Lots of betas, I know, but I want the v1.0 final to be atleast somewhat stable. ;P I also wanted to include some kind of abort function, but my implentation didn't work as I wanted it to, so I left it out for now. Also, with the release of the v1.0 final, I plan to release the source publicly so anyone can add the features they want, or maybe even make their own program.

Actually, they're not really gone, they're just hidden. You could make them appear again by playing around with the columns, but it won't remember the positions, which is obviously what you want. I have to dissapoint you though, it seems like too much trouble for me to make the on/off setting a built-in option. However, since I'll release the source soon, I'll provide you the instructions on how to modify the correct part of the source and compile it yourself.

Unlike dpgenc, BatchDPG doesn't alter the brightness. I like to keep the video in its original state as much as possible, which is why I didn't include a brightness option. If you really want to change the brightness, you could do what Madrigal suggested, or create an Avisynth file and use its Tweak function.

Since the actual files I was trying to convert appeared to play fine (albeit kinda quietly) hadn't noticed this had happened.

It would seem that either batchDPG or AVIsynth has some weird issue with Nero's AC3 decorder.

I think ppl should remove all the existing codecs and install only the ones that are proven to work. I have the latest DivX codec + the latest AviSynth beta and it it's a working combination. I also have latest XviD and other codecs and I have never had any problems with DPG encoder -interface or your program interface. It's for sure that movie clips that doesn't work with windows media player, doesn't work with BatchDPG.

Are you able to make BatchDPG to make mencoder.exe to use less CPU power?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Changing the priority like in Windows Task Manager is exactly what the process priority option in BatchDPG does. The idea of a low priority isn't to  make it use fewer CPU cycles by default, it's to only lower the CPU usage as soon as there's another process that needs the CPU cycles more than mencoder does. Correct me if I'm wrong.

That rules out the possibility of a bad compile. It's either a bug in mencoder or the mpg2splt.dll file it's refering to. Does it only happen with this particular MPEG file?

I'm not quite sure what you tried to do with VirtualDub there... In any case, could it be possible that your subtitle file's timing is based on frames rather than time?

Subtitle based on time/fps, what's the difference.. does your script only support time based subtitles?

    <h4>#93164 - LS5 - Mon Jul 17, 2006 9:20 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The difference between a time-based and a frame-based timing is the way they indicate when a subtitle needs to be displayed. For example, let's assume a subtitle needs to be shown 30 seconds into the movie. In a time-based system, you could indicate this as [00:00:30.000]. In a frame-based system, you would have to know the framerate. Let's assume the framerate is 25. This would give you the frame number 25*30=[750]. 
<br/>
<br/>
It usually doesn't matter for the end user in what system the timing is done, but only the time-based system works properly using BatchDPG. BatchDPG changes the framerate (let's assume 15fps) <span style="font-style: italic">before</span> adding the subtitles, so when the subtitle file indicates the subtitle should be shown at the 750st frame, it actually displays it after 750/15=50 seconds instead of 750/25=30 seconds! This is just my speculation though, I don't know if your subtitle file is frame-based. What type of file is it exactly?
<br/>
<br/>
As for the supported subtitle types, anything that VSFilter can handle is supported. SRT (SubRip), SSA and ASS are definitely supported, and are time-based. MicroDVD is frame-based and would probably have desynchronisation issues.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Regular (vcd) mpeg displayed no error message and worked fine. As for the download, I downloaded that and got an .ax file.

That fixed it thanks ;)

Even though I know it's the "final" ver, I was wondering if some kind of 'cancel' / 'cancel all' option would be possible to include?
<br/>
<br/>
As you know, when for example an avi is at example 92 height, it changes it automatically in the settings when added. Sometimes I forget to set that to max as I use and start encoding. Just to realize im using the wrong setting, so I have to 'force close' the program and go to the temp dir and remove the working files manually.
<br/>
<br/>
So a 'cancel and cancel all' option would be a neat feature, so it would stop the current (/all files in que) file it's converting and automatically delete the temp files used when doing so.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Anyhow, my question is, are there any setting tweeks I should be aware of that will improve the video quality while using this converter?  I converted an episode of Lost and noticed the framerate skip at different parts of the episode.  Is this just normal or am I doing something wrong?  Thanks for your help, and thanks for this great program.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Oops, missed this post. Well, the only 'tweak' I really recommend is setting the profile to 'High', since it doesn't have any negative side-effects aside from a slower conversion speed. You can experiment with raising the bitrate values, but do note that higer values will result in larger files and can cause some skipping.
<br/>
<br/>
As for your skipping problem, you might want to try to lower the video bitrate (especially the max video bitrate value), and check if the problem persists. If it does, you should probably manually adjust the framerate (FPS). Widescreen videos (such as Lost) are encoded at a framerate of 20fps with the 'auto' option, so experiment with values like 18.

Yes, you could quite easily replace BePipe with avs2wav by making a very small number of modifications to the source. There's a good reason I chose to use BePipe instead of avs2wav, though. First of all, avs2wav was giving <span style="font-style: italic">a lot</span> of people problems. Second, BePipe outputs a percentage of completion which avs2wav doesn't, so BePipe allows me to have a progress bar. May I ask why you don't want to install the .NET framework?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Although I do see your point, you must understand that I will not switch programs just because one person might find a certain runtime bloat. The installation of the .NET framework should have no impact on the performance on your system, and more programs are going to be using it in the future. I'm afraid it's either install the framework, or not use BatchDPG at all.

Does that noise come from the right speaker/earbud? If so, it's due to a bug in MoonShell. MoonShell v1.31 beta 3 is known to certainly be working correctly, although the v1.4 betas have been working fine for me too.

It supports MP2 output and I have played around with it for a little while now and find it quite stable (certainly more so than bepipe or avs2wav and it dodges the .net issues which is in my opinion the single biggest detractor from BatchDPG).
<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure about the license but seen as one of the AVIsynth authors is responsible for it and is considering integrating with V 2.6 I am sure it will be compatible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I encode a lot of video and DPGs I normally make by hand so this post will likely reflect that.
<br/>
<br/>
Vob files are the container used on DVDs so you should only have to find a splitter/demuxer and use that.
<br/>
<br/>
DVD conversion is often a fairly complex process so I would suggest visiting somewhere like <a href="http://www.doom9.org/" target="_blank">http://www.doom9.org/</a> , <a href="http://www.videohelp.com/" target="_blank">http://www.videohelp.com/</a> or <a href="http://www.digital-digest.com/" target="_blank">http://www.digital-digest.com/</a> and the forums these sites at some point. None the less it is quite possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Chances are you will first need to decrypt the video (smaller studios and some of the more sensible ones do not encrypt), ripit4me <a href="http://www.ripit4me.org/" target="_blank">http://www.ripit4me.org/</a> is able to deal with structure protection fairly well (it acts as a frontend to the legendary DVD Decrypter and includes several other great little tools you can use to treat corrupt DVDs that some companies put out these days).
<br/>
Chances are AVISynth will probably be a tool in your arsenal so DGMPGDec: <a href="http://neuron2.net/dgmpgdec/dgmpgdec.html" target="_blank">http://neuron2.net/dgmpgdec/dgmpgdec.html</a> is the next step. Using this you can serve your DVD files through AVISynth (some encoders such as HCenc (a very good freeware mpeg2 encoder) and a few automated GUI type applications can also take DGMPGDec input but that is besides the point).
<br/>
From now you can re-encode your video to whatever you like and ply any filters you like to them.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have not used DGMPGDec before then you may an example script so here is one I used the other day to encode a DPG video.
<br/>
The first line is probably all you need but what the hey.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have to deinterlace your video I would first try and use AVIsynth's reduceby2() filter as DVD res is well above half DPG.

You may be interested in DVD subtitles, they are actually just pictures included with the DVD so you will have to OCR them out (you could just rip them and then hardsub them back in but that may not work too well for the DS), some good OCR software comes in the form of Subrip (you can also rip subtitles from normal video files using this, the format it uses as standard (SRT) is also one of the most popular subtitle formats): <a href="http://zuggy.wz.cz/" target="_blank">http://zuggy.wz.cz/</a>
<br/>
You will probably want to do some editing and while subrip has some features subtitle workshop is a good way to go (be warned it does not handle Unicode well): <a href="http://urusoft.cjb.net/" target="_blank">http://urusoft.cjb.net/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#116675 - FAST6191 - Sun Jan 28, 2007 4:01 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">FLV is just a container and they tend to use fairly rubbish codecs/standards (from a quality standpoint) and less than optimal options for them, I do not really know of many apps that support it as their only output so I assume you are working with youtube-style videos. Before going on it is worth mentioning that google video often allows you to download the original file so be sure to look and see if you can do that first (transcoding once is far more preferable).
<br/>
<br/>
Youtube uses flash video (given the flv extension) and it is usually well suited to conversion for the DS (sizes are similar, video is rarely interlaced, suitable framerates often used).
<br/>
To convert this sort of video you will need two things:
<br/>
1) A way to grab the video:
<br/>
Firefox is the way to go here and there exists quite a few plugins to do the job:
<br/>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/search.php?q=youtube&amp;type=E&amp;app=firefox" target="_blank">https://addons.mozilla.org/search.php?q=youtube&amp;type=E&amp;app=firefox</a>
<br/>
There are about 10 different ones available with videodownloader and unplug being highly recommended.
<br/>
If you use another browser you can use the following site to download instead:
<br/>
<a href="http://keepvid.com/" target="_blank">http://keepvid.com/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
2) A splitter and codecs to enable you to play it back (there does exist seperate players but this is a good method):
<br/>
Gabest (author of media player classic amongst other things) comes to the rescue with FLV splitter:
<br/>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82303" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82303</a>
<br/>
If you have not installed a splitter/codec manually before it can be done using the CCCP insurgent:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.cccp-project.net/" target="_blank">http://www.cccp-project.net/</a>
<br/>
FFDshow (linked with CCCP Insurgent above or you can try the tryout versions: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffdshow-tryout/" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffdshow-tryout/</a> ) can be used to decode FLV video although media player classic has some support for decoding FLV (under codecs set FLV1 to be decoded with libavcodec).
<br/>
<br/>
Using the both of these you are now able to download and watch flash video from youtube style sites, a nice added bonus is you can now use the post processing features of things like FFDShow (you may wish to turn these off when it comes to re-encoding, especially if you are using other improvement filters).
<br/>
Batchdpg should support it right off the bat now but if you prefer the manual approach:
<br/>
You will need to use AVIsynth?s directshowsource to enable you to open it and you will need to set FPS=something (it is best to use the original frame rate which can be found out from the options available in media players, graphedit or simply GSpot) and convertFPS=true in the options for it.
<br/>
It is also a wise idea to resample the audio en route to either 48 kHz or another typical value 32kHz or above or you will probably end up failing to re-encode (if you can using avisynth?s killaudio() and then dubbing the original audio is a good way to go for youtube uses mono MP3 @ 22050 Hz and 64kbps which usually sounds awful to say the least).
<br/>
A lot of the time flv video will not be mod8 or mod16 (dimensions a multiple of 8 or 16) so you will either have to use addborders or crop to get it to size, using crop is probably the best method as most codecs have difficulty with black borders appearing halfway through a block.
<br/>
If the video is interlaced you will probably not be able to get away with the usual reduceby2() trick and instead I suggest a bob deinterlacer if you need it. 
<br/>
Although you can avoid using it you may want a flv demuxer:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Apologies for the double post but I thought I would share my butchery of BatchDPG 1.3 beta1, I replaced Bepipe with the new SoundOut and consequently removed the need for .net (as well I hope upped stability significantly):
<br/>
First things first this is a proof of concept build and prior to this I had never used autoit so beware of falling debris, I have no idea if I will keep up with this either (I much prefer encoding of DPGs by hand).
<br/>
<br/>
I will also assume you have avisynth installed and it comes as a plain zip containing only batchdpg + source, mencoder, VSFilter.dll, media info and the headermaker.
<br/>
<br/>
Preface:
<br/>
I first started messing around with batchDPG when it was a frontend for DPGtools, before long it was an encoding tool in its own right. Eventually avs2wav (part of the audio encoding toolset) was replaced with bepipe which brought a reliance on .net (and marginally improved stability), as it looked like it was there to stay I figured I would try my hand at replacing it. The new soundout module for avisynth ( <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=120025" target="_blank">http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=120025</a> ) being, in my eyes anyhow, the perfect replacement.
<br/>
<br/>
Due to my laziness and inexperience with autoit I decided that joint stereo should be forced (a brief scanthrough of the code seems to suggest nothing has changed though), the option remains on the GUI but it will do nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that I have only ran rudimentary tests on the app (standard low Xvid-MP3 avi file and a high action wmv from gametrailers) and it appears to work fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Download (my hackjob to the source included in the zip), feel free to share the link:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.4shared.com/file/12441902/3dbd4ad2/FAST6191s_batchDPG.html" target="_blank">http://www.4shared.com/file/12441902/3dbd4...s_batchDPG.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
My fork (if I can be called that) is from the BatchDPG v1.3 beta 1 as that is the latest source I could find floating around (in all honesty I did not look very hard for a later one).
<br/>
<br/>
You will need to install soundout as well (simply copy the DLLs to the plugins subdirectory of avisynth):
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=120025" target="_blank">http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=120025</a>
<br/>
I would make them load from batchDPG's directory but that can be another build (if anyone wants to try just add them to the avisynth script section: lines 230-241, context should be evident from adjacent lines dealing with subtitles), I could add OGG support as well (SoundOut supports it) but that would also be another build.

I'm using version 1.0 final from <a href="http://ls5.citizendeleted.com/?Download" target="_blank">http://ls5.citizendeleted.com/?Download</a> (ls5.cydonianknight.com is down and squatted). I have the latest Defilerpak installed which includes ffdshow, and latest AVISynth (2.5.7).

Mysteriously, I can encode OGM and MKV just fine, but not AVI, MPG or FLV.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yup, that's definitely a different version from what I have
<br/>
<br/>
off the top of your head, do you know if it supports multiple cores for encoding?  that's the only thing I was hoping for over the current version I have

my japanese/korean/whichever asian dialect it is/etc keeps me from reading his page, heh</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, there's a setting for the # of cores to use in 1.44 Unofficial.

I also have what I guess was the last <a class="postlink" href="http://www.madcowdisease.org/~jlsoft/ds/BatchDPGMTv3.rar" target="_blank">official beta (1.3b5 MTv3)</a> version I could find back when I was messing around with it, and it also supports multithreading.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">there's the option to set number of cores, but setting it to anything other than 1 results in a lockup

<br/>
edit:   just verified that 1.44 does the same thing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
