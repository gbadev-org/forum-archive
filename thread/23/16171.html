    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">RetroRocket 1.1 has been released. The game now supports up to 4 players in ad-hoc DS-2-DS (no accesspoint needed) multiplayer dogfight or real time strategy mode.
<br/>
<br/>
For those new to the game, it is a game inspired by classic gravity games like Thrust and TurboRaketti, and can be played in modes where you experience the game almost equivalent to the originals.
<br/>
<br/>
RetroRocket 1.1 introduces smoother network play, bugfixes and gameplay improvements.
<br/>
<br/>
RetroRocket is free software (GPL) and you can download the game and source code from <a class="postlink" href="http://retrorocketgame.org" target="_blank">http://retrorocketgame.org</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I really liked the last version but it was a bit unstable.  When I get time, I'll give this version and try and see if I can give more useful comments.  Thanks for the release and especially the source code.  I'm a big fan of top down multiplayer games.  It could be fun even without the gravity, just shooting rockets at each other GTA2 style.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried it out over the weekend. Looks great! I had two DSes on hand, but only one player, so I couldn't play a real game.
<br/>
<br/>
I've played this game (or a vastly similar one) on the computer in split-screen mode and I've really enjoyed it. The multitude of customizable ships and weapons keep the game fresh, even with only two players.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm excited to see RetroRocket progress. Keep it up!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Any chance you can allow the data directory to be stored in \data instead of residing in root? It's really annoying (to me, anyway) to clutter up my root directory with data folders from several different homebrew games.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe have the software check for the existence of the folder in \data first. I did that for my high score file on the Missile Command game I made.

Yes, good idea.  I have put it into the SVN-version so it will be there for the next release.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
