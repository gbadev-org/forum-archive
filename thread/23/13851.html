    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all I would like to say <span style="font-weight: bold">THANK YOU</span> to all the people who are involved in NDS lib development and the homebrew community in general for sharing their knowledge! Without all the examples and explanations people like me could not develop any stuff on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the first version of my DS port of AcChen. AcChen is a simple to learn ?find the matching tile? game. It is more Arcade-Style than MahJongg. It contains a lot of different levels. Each level takes only a couple of minutes to finish.
<br/>
<br/>
More about AcChen ( screenshots / description / download ) can be found here:

I only had the chance to test the binary on my DS Lite with a R4 Slot1 card. Any comments about working/not working hardware are appreciated!

Here's my personal wish list:
<br/>
 - A "pause" feature, probably through a touchscreen button- obviously the screen would need to be hidden while paused.
<br/>
 - An option to turn off the sound effects would be nice, as some of us prefer quiet when puzzling.
<br/>
 - Give the tile layers some sort of graphical relief.  The colors are a good start but determining which level the different tiles are on is ultimately not very intuitive.
<br/>
<br/>
This is good homebrew.  Thanks preussie!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, I will add it in one of the next versions...

That is right and it gets even worse on levels with three different tile-layers :/. I think I add shadows or something to the tiles...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
