    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Copy and paste it into your address bar, and if that doesn't work try adding a question mark to the end of it.  That usually lets you download from Geocities.
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, this is a fun program to mess around with.  Any way to increase the range of notes?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Pretty cool program. It would be great to have more chords. Maybe you could play minor chords when holding L or R or something. Distortion would also be cool I could make some samples for you if you want. 
<br/>
Great Work Keep it up!
<br/>
<br/>
For your next project might I suggest a trumpet synth using the mic as an input and holding different button combinations for different notes. You could call it BlowMe. LOL
<br/>
Seriously though....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
2 suggestions:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Make the volume dependent on strum speed - faster stylus movement corresponds to louder volume.
<br/>
2) Add DS Motion support to change the pitch (by changing sound frequency) like a whammy bar - add arm7 code to change SCHANNEL_TIMER as a function of the tilt.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was considering a whammy bar, but 
<br/>
A) It would involve using custom ARM7 code, which I can't get GBFS to work with
<br/>
B) I don't think it would be worth it for a 3-second sample
<br/>
<br/>
I will do the volume strumming, if possible, though.  Question: Will this make rocky noises if I plug the headphone port into an amp?  I'm not responsible if you blow one up like this! ;-D

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh, a very fun thing to mess around with, even if it doesn't serve much useful purpose.  It did get me thinking however about how awesome it would be if someone created a band using just DS homebrew applications - StrumMe, DrumMe, PianoVero, perhaps Sampling Keyboard or NitroTracker, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
