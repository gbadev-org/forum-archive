    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all, 
<br/>
<br/>
DSFTP 2.3 is out. Get it at <a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">http://giesler.biz/bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html</a>. 
<br/>
<br/>
Noteworthy changes: 
<br/>
<br/>
o UNZP added (submitted by Bertrand Augereau)
<br/>
o DS-&gt;PC file transfer speeded up a lot (patch to DSWifi submitted by masscat)
<br/>
o Linked with Devkit R18 again (fixes some showstopper bugs)
<br/>
o More bugfixes
<br/>
<br/>
On the topic of bug reports: reports via email are much preferred to reports posted in the forum, because I can track them much better that way. My email address is right there on DSFTP's GUI. Please include as much information as you can: What you see on the screen, the log output, your hardware configuration, DSFTP version used, etc. 
<br/>
<br/>
As always, donations are welcome. :-) My Paypal address is the same as my email address. 
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun! 
<br/>
<br/>
Regards, 
<br/>

Yup. See the docs. It's GNU unzip, though, so no multi-file zip support (until someone submits UNTAR, that is).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">DSFTP homepage</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by bjoerngiesler on Mon Oct 23, 2006 6:19 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Downloading the latest homebrew from Internet through DSLinux and unzipping it through your app seems a nice idea ...

Perhaps I misunderstand the question, but how can you get files into DSFTP without a computer in the first place, let alone initiate the unzip?

While I wouldn't necessarily go that far, DSFTP is available as a library.

It patches the file system access routines to use the correct registers for SC lite. The SC team chose not to document these registers (so they can't be supported properly) but rather to release this patcher.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello...
<br/>
<br/>
I have set up DSFTP 2.3 successfully, and the server states it's running on port 21, IP 192.168.1.8.  My hardware is SC Lite with 1 GB Kingston Micro.
<br/>
<br/>
My <a href="http://ftp.conf" target="_blank">ftp.conf</a> is:
<br/>
<br/>
motd /ftp/motd.txt
<br/>
logfile /data/logs/ftp.log
<br/>
loglevel 5
<br/>
timeout 60
<br/>
portrangestart 9000
<br/>
portrangeend 9999
<br/>
screensaver 30
<br/>
wakeonlog false
<br/>
user ****
<br/>
pass ****
<br/>
root /
<br/>
home /
<br/>
write true
<br/>
boot true
<br/>
end user
<br/>
<br/>
When I attempt connect to DSFTP from a PC on my LAN, my FTP client will report "Connected to 192.168.1.8", but then time out after about 30 seconds.  I have tried several clients, including XP command line, WS FTP, and FlashFXP.  The DSFTP logfile remains empty.  The only other behavior I've been able to correlate, is when I turn off Windows Firewall on the PC, I no longer get the "Connected to... " message... just a timeout.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that I have a working WFC connection in the first position on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Any help is appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I understand what you're saying, but I guess I'm unclear about the distinction between "cart", "card" and "filesystem".  I believe the SC Lite card is supported, according to the documentation.
<br/>
<br/>
Does this mean I need to re-format my SD card into a supported filesystem, and it will work?  Or do I need to wait until Bjoern adds support for my hardware?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Here, I use "memory card adapter" to refer to devices such as SuperCard, GBAMP v2 or v3, Magic Key 2 or 3, and DS-Link (effectively a microSD version of Magic Key 2).
<br/>
<br/>
The issue is that each make and model of memory card adapter needs its own block device driver so that the file system code knows how to read the 512 byte sectors of your storage medium. What you can to do is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/why-donate.shtml" target="_blank">wave money in wintermute's face</a> until he and Chishm unify this adapter mess by releasing devkitARM R20, which has a rewritten file system layer.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
