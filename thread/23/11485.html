    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys, here's beup v0.3 rev2 (because I know I'll end up releasing a lot of corrections).
<br/>
<br/>
With no fat lib support (for people using WMB, or who just don't want their card to be touched - saving is done in SRAM):

<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to HtheB for helping me debug the program :)
<br/>
<br/>
ChangeLog:
<br/>
New features: 
<br/>
- Selectable avatars from card.
<br/>
- Shows typing users.
<br/>
- Shows date of last message (and a clock!)
<br/>
- Emoticons on display names / text.
<br/>
- 302 xfer for @msn.com accounts.
<br/>
- Select presence before logging in.
<br/>
- Option to auto connect.
<br/>
- Stand by when lid is closed.
<br/>
- Scrollable text in chat tabs.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fixes:
<br/>
- Overall GUI revamping.
<br/>
- Reducing socket reading delay from 500 ms to 200 ms because of a more stable wifi lib, making the overall connection speed about 2.5x faster. (reducing it further doesn't change much, most of the times sockets are empty).
<br/>
- Fixed avatar sending / receiving (read incorrect session id in some cases).
<br/>
- Fixed listboxes, text areas to reduce constant flicker.
<br/>
- Text fields are now edited in another window, so as not to cram textboxes in the same window as the keyboard.
<br/>
- Added a clearing button to text fields.
<br/>
- Fixed lots of bugs related to closing windows / opening windows that caused random crashes.
<br/>
- Fixed "invisible tabs" bug.
<br/>
- After closing tab, previous tab is selected, instead of the contact tab.
<br/>
- Fixed bug where garbage was present on some principal descriptions.
<br/>
- Fixed bug where the program was likely to crash if a principal was selected and then left.
<br/>
- Selectable bigger brush on Inks, bigger eraser.
<br/>
- Wider color selector.
<br/>
- Removed START button as logoff, replaced with a button in contact tab.
<br/>
- Added check box to invert RGB subpixel alignment on top screen for DS Lites.
<br/>
- Fixed Ink transmission, caused incorrect messages if resulting GIF was too big.
<br/>
- Fixed keyboard inaccuracy issues (I hope).
<br/>
- Added support for Caps Lock.
<br/>
- Remapped buttons:
<br/>
A for Accept / Update / Send / Open Tab
<br/>
B for Cancel / Back
<br/>
X for Close window
<br/>
L, R for Move to Left tab, Right Tab
<br/>
(in textbox editing, L is still backspace)
<br/>
Left, Right for moving cursor left, right
<br/>
<br/>
Known issues:
<br/>
- Beup will refuse to open downloaded avatars if their size isn't 96x96 (the standard).
<br/>
- Beup will refuse to open inks if they are wider than 256 px (can't present those).
<br/>
- The official MSN client will refuse to send avatars if the last one was sent less than 5 minutes ago. That means that if you chat with somebody, disconnect, and then open the tab, avatar download may fail. (wait a few minutes, then try again).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you want access to the special features, you need to create these directories:
<br/>
<br/>
/beup: Root folder. Contains custo wifi info and optional modified strings.
<br/>
/beup/avatars: Put your avatars in there. They must be in png format, exactly 96x96 or the program will reject them.
<br/>
/beup/emoticons: Put your emoticons there. They must be in bmp format, maximal 11 pixels high. The config file must also be filled.
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.stud.uni-karlsruhe.de/~uxasl/emotest.tar.bz2" target="_blank">Example emoticons</a>
<br/>
<br/>
/beup/keyboard: If you want to create a custom keyboard, put the bitmaps (.bmp) in there, and fill the config file. The config file must be called "config".
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.stud.uni-karlsruhe.de/~uxasl/keyboard" target="_blank">Example file</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Custom strings: If you want to create a translation for beup, or simply mess around with the stringies, put the strings config file in the /beup dir. The file must be called "strings". Please tell me if I missed one.

The no-fat is for people without a writtable flash card (or running through WMB).

<br/>
Incredible update, Kevin.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A question, just to make sure:
<br/>
Will Beup store the content of ongoing conversations until it crashes, or does it forget the earlier messages in a convo as time goes on?
<br/>
<br/>
And the obligatory feature suggestion (and, of course: 'no pressure'):
<br/>
Chat logs would be nice. Of course, I could understand if you don't want to do that, since it's possible to get corrupted data if someone turns off the DS at a bad time.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Here's what I did to combat that problem:
<br/>
I opened each file and copied the contents, and made a new file and saved it with the same filename. I did the same with the config file. Maybe if I zip that, I'll post it. And hopefully it won't be corrupted.

@Mr. Picklesworth: It forgets the contents as soon as you close the window (to save memory, given the size of inks). Logs were planned for .3, but due to lack of time (since I wanted to release something), I pushed it to .4 :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Only tested on Windows:
<br/>
go to My Computer,
<br/>
right mouse click on the drive letter of your card,
<br/>
Properties,
<br/>
Go to Extra,
<br/>
and use the check disk function 
<br/>
<br/>
(I got a Ducth Windows.. so the names can be different on the english Windows)

It will repair the corrupts :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd best say what I'm running on...
<br/>
This is with GBAMP, Flashme 6, and a 128MB CF card. Booting via Moonshell.
<br/>
This is the .nds build with Chism's FAT lib.
<br/>
<br/>
The created directories become corrupted after I have written files to them via Windows.
<br/>
(Perhaps only after writing the emoticons to them? I'll have to see to that. The Avatars directory seemed to work fine with my own image).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After getting Windows to fix the errors, FAT access works fine.
<br/>
Probably just a little error in the directory creation, somehow... is Beup writing anything else to them but not finishing?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
Yay, Start doesn't log out anymore!! (And I'm getting used to the logout button).
<br/>
And the clear button is nice!
<br/>
And the new stylus lib makes the keyboard actually very useable. (And Caps Lock works!)
<br/>
And there's a clock!
<br/>
And it seems a lot faster!
<br/>
:P
<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any example keyboard data files, or can I use something from the source files?
<br/>
I'm hopeless at starting stuff from scratch.
<br/>
Edit: Oh, you do.
<br/>
<br/>
One more question: Do messages wait for a bit before they are sent if a user has not yet joined the conversation?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Whistles happily*
<br/>
Oh - Sorry to those who can't use yet! :P
<br/>
Best of luck fixing these problems, Kevin. I hope it's nothing too serious.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

hmm.. seems to be more people got problems with the Icons!!!

<br/>
I got the problem too guys!!!
<br/>
<br/>
listen.. I know a way to repair.. (NO need to FORMAT!)
<br/>
<br/>
Only tested on Windows:
<br/>
go to My Computer,
<br/>
right mouse click on the drive letter of your card,
<br/>
Properties,
<br/>
Go to Extra,
<br/>
and use the check disk function
<br/>
<br/>
(I got a Ducth Windows.. so the names can be different on the english Windows)
<br/>
<br/>
It will repair the corrupts :)
<br/>
<br/>
worked for me:)
<br/>
<br/>
its reaelly weird that it corrupts the card..</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys, uploaded rev2.
<br/>
<br/>
Changelog:
<br/>
- Due to the -ahm- fracas of card corruption, automatic directory creation has been disabled. If you want emoticons, custom avatars and stuff, create the following directories by hand:
<br/>
/beup
<br/>
/beup/avatars/ (if you want custom avatars)
<br/>
/beup/emoticons/ (if you want emoticons)
<br/>
/beup/keyboard/ (if you want a custom keyboard)
<br/>
- User info is saved on root (so as not to require directories to be created).
<br/>
- SRAM user info saving has been implemented on the nofat version, for people who don't want their card to be touched.
<br/>
- Fixed bug where blocked icons weren't displayed.

First of all I'm not sure about what you mean exactly with "normal chism" (.ds.gba or .nds version?) so I've tried again with both files.
<br/>
<br/>
1) I had two configurations in the firmware saved by Mario Kart. The first one with wep and the second one without wep. So, in Mario Kart I've deleted both configurations and I've created a new one without WEP (I'm able to play continental tournaments with it, so I guess it has the correct info).

With this change I get these results:
<br/>
  - beup-chism-test.nds: "Acquiring host info from DHCP: Cannot      connect". The "stop" and "Use firmware" buttons work but the "Use Custom" button freezes the DSLite and the green battery button blinks.
<br/>
  - beup-chism-test.ds.gba: Same as the former file.
<br/>
<br/>
Do I need to change some parameters in the Wifi Router or in the Mario Kart config?
<br/>
<br/>
2) I can connect with Mario Kart but I've not tested any other homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>

Keyboard touch problem is finally gone,now its more accurate than ever. If only it were a little bigger...

I've found that DHCP just does not work at all with any homebrew apps, but I have no issues when using games... I blew out all my connections and set up a static IP, and I was able to connect (I could also only connect in the wifi test apps by manually entering in the same settings), although it did drop the server quite a few times before actually connecting... I was then able to log in, and it did show that I had a few contacts, but nobody was on at the moment so I couldn't test it further... pretty cool so far though...

For later revisions, an included emoticon package.
<br/>
<br/>
For .4, custom sounds, user options (block, add), see offline members, notifications in form of popups, improved ink.
<br/>
Featurewise, animated / downloaded emoticons (if the memory is enough), file xfer, update from protocol 9 (msn6) to 13 (live) - since the lib seems to be able to handle big packets, unlikely voice chat.
<br/>

Okay, it's not MY emoticon pack.  It's Microsoft's.  Sorry for the confusion.  *rolls eyes and shakes head*  I thought it would be obvious that it is Microsoft's since beup doesn't support custom emoticons.  But I guess the word "my" threw you off ... it should've been replaced by "the".  I just thought "my" would be fine because I resized them and I made the RAR.  I didn't want to give the impression that I somehow managed to draw these smileys.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My NDSL associates to the SoftAP fine also.

It gets stuck doing the handshake with BeUp..

WFC games such as MK and MPH don't connect either.. (61020 error)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay. I FIXED it. (More like, I found a workaround to get it to work) =P
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">1. For the "Searching" issue.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I had this issue when i was using the 2916 version of SoftAP and drivers.
<br/>
Problem got resolved soon as I uninstalled it and installed 2371 version. (which has the drivers also)
<br/>
<a href="ftp://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wireless/WL-167g/eng_2371.zip" target="_blank">ftp://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wireless/WL-167g/eng_2371.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">2. For the "Doing handshake.." issue.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
With SoftAP, go to advanced options and enable "Use Short Slot Time" options. 
<br/>
Then I was able to complete the handshake and authenticate.
<br/>
Maybe it does something? No idea. Just reporting what I found.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">3. For the "Ink" not working with MSN issue. (Sending/receiving blanks)</span>
<br/>
<br/>
It seems if you have the Microsoft Windows Journal Viewer installed, it does not work with Beup.
<br/>
But if you don't or uninstall it, Ink messages from BeUp will show up fine.
<br/>
But you cannot send ink messages to BeUp as you need Windows journal viewer installed. (so it's 1 way or nothing)
<br/>
Can this be fixed or changed so that it will work both ways??
<br/>
<br/>
One thing still left over - WFC games still do not work for some reason.
<br/>
(BeUp now has a 100% success rate but WFC games fail every time. gawd.)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways..
<br/>
<br/>
I still have a bad issue with the lower third of the touch screen where the calibration is very off. 
<br/>
(I have to touch further below than the buttons them selves on screen)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, could the touch screen accuracy/refresh rate for the Ink be improved? 
<br/>
(Or is this the best that can be done currently for homebrew?)
<br/>
Touchscreen is sooo much more accurate and precise for genuine games... hehe..
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, this app is my fabourite and can't wait for it to get better! =)
<br/>

Leaving everything else Dynamic and Auto, the DS was able to pick up the connection. Now my WiFi settings work flawlessly with the router, never had to make anything static, I can connect to all games from the M3 miniSD and Beup works like a charm.

If it stops on Searching, I guess that means it just can't find your AP.

If it gets stuck in "doing handshake", that means the program can't receive any information from the server (it's a "ping" kind of communication, the server always responds immediatly). 
<br/>
Make sure beup has a correct Wifi configuration, that you have a proper IP / gateway / subnet mask, and that the IP is able to send and  receive information.
<br/>
The ones you've got appear on top of the login screen. Make sure the IP you've set (if you deactivated DHCP) is consistent with your network (follow the guidelines in the "Wifi Troubleshooting" thread).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The typing tab shortens the nickname of the typing users to about 20 chars. Given that everybody loooves their 100 char nicknames, I assumed most of the time the nicknames would be abbreviated (that's why the point is fixed).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, for an unknow reason even taugh DHCP is activated it seem to work anyway...wich I dont understand why, but I still get stuck in the Doing Handksake process ( and I need to have WEP activated to...:S )
<br/>
<br/>
My connection say I have an excellent signal, so I dont really know what to do. You said to check if my ds have a right WiFi connection, do I need to change it in a DS games or in Beup ?
<br/>
<br/>
I just checked with Metroid Prime, and it receive a signal, but when testing the connection it get stuck there, just looking for something like he wasnt able to receive data or I dont know, you guys could help me out with this, I think the whole problem come from this but I'm not sure how to fix it :S
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT : Ok I tested it by making my ds detect my router and connection and it work like a charm, but when I enter myself the info, I see that everything is fine till it's testing the connection, where it simply test and test and dont give any result
<br/>
<br/>
so I probably did something wrong, here my connection ( router ) info :
<br/>
<br/>
SSID : ( well the good one )
<br/>
WEP : ****************
<br/>
IP Adress : 69.70.153.119

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
here what I entered in Metroid Prime :
<br/>
<br/>
SSID : ( same as the one of my router )
<br/>
WEP KEY : ( wont tell it but it's the same )
<br/>
IP adress : 69.70.153.119

Primary DNS : 24.200.241.37
<br/>
Secondary DNS : 24.201.245.77
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and in Beup here's my Network Setup :
<br/>
<br/>
Using IP adress : 69.70.153.119
<br/>
Gateway : 69.70.153.1
<br/>
Subnet Mask : 255.255.255.0
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Right now I'm under DHCP ( since it make BEUP work, whitout it, it dont want to work. I have a WEP key ( I've try whiout it and BEUP dont work anymore afterward ), have SSID activated, using 6 Canal at 2.437 GHz and I have no MAC filter on.
<br/>
<br/>
With all of this, BEUP reach the handsake state, then nothing else, like it dont receive anything wich is probably the same thing why Metroid stay in the Testing phase when looking for my connection. So please help me out, I'm so darn close to finaly get everything working

<br/>
<br/>
Changelog: (minor changes)
<br/>
- Fixed bug that made beup crash with long emoticon lists (nestea's set now works fine)
<br/>
- Fixed bug where UTF-8 text width was calculated wrongly.
<br/>
- Added 3 new strings in the string list (that I had forgotten to include)
<br/>
- Added the <span style="font-weight: bold">languageID</span> tag for the string list (that tells the MSN server in which language to send replies). If you're a translator, it's recommended you put it in (instructions are inside the string file).
<br/>
<br/>
Also for translators: You *can* also use special characters inside beup, like ?, ?, ?, ? and so on. You must however, when saving, choose the encoding "UTF-8". Any decent editor will have that.
<br/>

You can check it when words with special characters, like "S?lectionnez", appear as "SÃ©lectionnez".
<br/>
<br/>
I think even Notepad lets you change encoding (at least my version does). In the Save As window, change the encoding from ANSI to UTF-8.

If you use special characters, the strings file *must* be in UTF-8 (used by MSN) format, not the normal ANSI format. When saving the translation file, make sure to select the correct encoding (Notepad lets you change it in the Save As menu).
<br/>
A correct UTF-8 translation, for example, is in MEstk's file. Notice  how special characters are changed to a two-charas combination.
<br/>
<br/>
@faction et al: If the letters are blurry in the top screen for DS Lites, make sure you checked the option "switch bands on top" on the login screen.
<br/>
(This option is harmless, feel free to toy with it.)
<br/>
<br/>
@maarch: The ability to use special characters was always there, I was just pointing out the capability :)
<br/>
<br/>
@phil2dot6: Beup's keyboard does contain !,@,#,$ (and lately |) in the Shift section. Which other characters do you need?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by kevinc on Mon Jul 31, 2006 12:11 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Not all. Only latin, greek, cyrillic character sets, and some math symbols. Enough for european languages, but no arabic, japanese or chinese thingies. The font is Verdana, same as in Windows.

<br/>
When you choose a presence in the dropdown menu, beup sends the command to the server. Only after it receives confirmation does it change the label to the chosen presence.
<br/>
<br/>
Your problem, methinks, comes from a low/bad signal (sent info doesn't make it to the server).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry for the misunderstanding; I do notice these characters were there, however the problem is inputting these characters in the password field.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys, I'm having a connection issue with this program that I can't seem to solve, and it hasnt been working for any version that has been released. I've tried searching the Wi-Fi homebrew troubleshooting thread, and also browsed over nearly every page of this 30 something odd page thread and can't see anyone with the same issue. 
<br/>
<br/>
A few things about my setup first:
<br/>
<br/>
This pc is connected to my wireless router with cat5, the router is a D-Link DI-624. I've tried with WEP 64bit encryption (both shared and open), and with WEP off entirely, both with the same result. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using G6 Lite with Passcard 3. 
<br/>
<br/>
My problem is that when I run the program, it just sits on "Connecting using firmware setup:
<br/>
Searching..."
<br/>
<br/>
It sits there forever, when I click Use custom to manually put in an ip/gateway/subnet, the program usually just locks up entirely. I've gotten it to allow me to put in custom information once, and that didn't fix anything. I've gone into mario kart ds and turned off DHCP and assigned my DS an ip/etc manually, and tested the connection from there and it works fine, then tried firmware settings in beup to no avail. Most of the issues I see with beup connections seem to at least be getting past the "searching..." step of the connection. The wifi light on my DS flashes every 2 or so seconds.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried everything I can think of. In addition, this isnt just related to beup but rather every Wi-Fi homebrew app I've tried (Sylphirc). I just want beup working really badly and can't figure it out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Bug fixes:
<br/>
- Fixed bug in which association stopped when status reached "Cannot connect" (it sometimes gets to that point as temporal intermediate).
<br/>
- Fixed bug that made program crash when closing tabs with many inks
<br/>
- Fixed eraser bug in ink canvas
<br/>
- Fixed rare crashes when somebody registered as offline leaves (ok, not fixed - just made it not crash, still a design bug)
<br/>
- Fixed stupid bug that made avatars be identified as emoticons (and not be downloaded by the official client), and others related.
<br/>
- Fixed some avatar uploading bugs (tough see Known Issues).
<br/>
- Notifies the source of errors for gif decompressing in ink displayings, on hope that I'll know  where to debug :)
<br/>
<br/>
Known issues
<br/>
- For some reason, some versions of the official client simply don't ask for beup's avatar, even after it reports the user has changed it. I need to check deeper on how to notify it, or whether I need permission to send it at all.
<br/>
- Some issues with Ink sending and the official client refusing to display it.
<br/>
<br/>
Other stuff
<br/>
- Compiled against the 31/7 wifi lib
<br/>
- beup nofat version now comes with an included emoticon package, also as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.stud.uni-karlsruhe.de/~uxasl/msn-theme.tar.gz" target="_blank">separate download</a>,  with most of the official client's emoticons.

Are you sure you're not using a captive portal, or that your network doesn't filter MAC addresses?

Beup will use whatever port the server tells it to connect to, they're usually in the range 2000-3000.

I just bought the Wifi USB connector and I'm trying to get this BEUP to work. I have an M3 mini SD, and everytime I run beup it boots, but also freezes saying it can't connect to a firmware setup...

<br/>
So basically I'm not even getting the chance to fail by inputting wrong data or whatever, it freezes right of the bat.

Any idea what's going on? Also, I heard talk about using hacked drivers for the USB connector. What is that about, is that perhaps what's troubling me here?

The recognition of the touchscreen is very good now - and fast :D
<br/>
This approach was already proposed by tepples in april, but not many homebrewers tried it - although it's very easy to implement...(<a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7980&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=touchscreen+accuracy&amp;start=75" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7980&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=touchscreen+accuracy&amp;start=75</a>)
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. : I just noticed kevinc does limit SPEED, not acceleration...it still gets rid of the jumps though, but you can't draw very fast ....(ok, it's fast enough ;) )</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by qw3rty on Fri Aug 04, 2006 8:17 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Only minor changes:
<br/>
- Fixed wifi setup tab, because some people seemed to need it.
<br/>
- Added an intro "loading" bitmap, because a black screen for 1 sec looked like the prog had crashed.
<br/>
- Made the windmill faster and more fluid, because I could.
<br/>
<br/>
For the wifi setup tab, you can select a SSID by tapping on the name of the chosen SSID. If there's no SSID, tap on the label "SSID: ". I think I need a more elegant solution...
<br/>
Put an empty or invalid value on the IP field to choose DHCP.

I second that emphyrian. But, like faction too, I had no idea my m3 has been... revised. Nor do I know what the hell that entails.
<br/>
<br/>
So is it the homebrew that just doesn't support the M3 Mini SD 2nd revision YET, or does this 2nd revision rule out any and all future use of homebrew?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, to those who said they had their homebrew working on the M3 Mini SD. Are you using pre-revised M3 Mini SD?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The 3.0 rein one is working. It says nothing in SSID, but if I wait a while I get to select my internet provider's name with a few numbers.
<br/>
<br/>
It tries to authenticate for 15 seconds or something, but it still fails. If I fill out the ip adress bar too, with the IP of my computer (or does it need something else?), but it still can't connect.
<br/>
<br/>
It's stopped freezing though, so perhaps this is a problem that has nothing to do with my M3 Mini SD anymore? Any idea what's wrong now?
<br/>
<br/>
(I got it to stop freezing by formatting my card to fat32 with default clustersize, instead of a custom one that was supposed to be faster. No idea if that's related to each other though, I don't know anything about all this.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I dont believe it will rule it out forever, but I can see a long wait ahead of us.

Not the coders fault though, I'm sure they get pissed off writing new versions of their software everytime a new piece of kit comes out.
<br/>
Not really sure what to do at the moment. I somehow got nitrotracker to work (I think patching it first) but that will freeze after clicking on one of the tabs. Everything else I have tried basicly wont work, except of course the emus that are already built into the thing.

* On another note, someone on another forum said you need an actual wireless router. In other words, my Nintendo USB connector is only good for playing games, no homebrew. That true? If it is, that explains why it can't even connect. Dammit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That version worked for me. I used M3Game Manager to move it over to my Mini SD card. I have created a folder named "beup", within that I've created several folders "avatars" "emoticons" "... err something else" (My bro is borrowing my DS for a few days, can't remember :p) Then I run beup from the first screen that pops up on my DS, I have it default loads to M3 DS loading thing. Going to "Games" and run it from there.
<br/>
<br/>
It works on my M3 Mini SD. Again, I don't know what revision mine is. I do know it's SLIGHTLY differen than my friends M3 Mini SD... but which is which, nobody knows.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Eitherway, I was searching for another access point than my USB adaptor and it turns someone has an unprotected wifi network somewhere. Signal was weak, but I could connect to it anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
As it turns out, the firmware setup did work when it tried to connect to that network. In fact, beup worked well throughout the rest of the connecting procedure. But I'm only semi-happy, since it turns out the Nintendo USB adaptor indeed doesn't work with homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
I heard something about there being hacked drivers for the adaptor though. Will these help me connect to beup via usb adaptor? Or any other method?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">M3 Mini v2</span>
<br/>
<br/>
To all users who have an M3 Mini and think you might have a v2 (your unit doesn't work with beup-rein):
<br/>
<br/>
First, check these comparison pictures <a href="http://www.yyjoy.com/pics/20060710/6.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
The one on the right is version 2
<br/>
<a href="http://www.yyjoy.com/pics/20060710/11.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
This is what it looks like in a DSLite (difficult to tell compared to the v1 in a DSL)
<br/>
<a href="http://img432.imageshack.us/img432/221/m323xk.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
This is what it looks like in a DSPhat - notice that it does not stick out beyond the edge of the DS, the original M3 Mini stuck out about 2mm.
<br/>
<br/>
Once you've determined that you have a v2 here are some key points to consider.
<br/>
<br/>
1) Rein, when run on the M3 Mini v2 incorrectly states it is a Supercard SD. Rein was not designed with v2 in mind, so it doesn't know about the specific details of the v2, hence its incorrect judgment. Most homebrew also doesn't know this, and this is primarily why some homebrew doesn't work (generally consider that homebrew that needs to access the SD card - homebrew that uses a fatlib - will be the homebrew that doesn't correctly work right now). This is simply a new revision, and once more app coders learn about the differences these problems will be fixed (i.e. like the Rein fatlib that is used so often to fix imcompatibilities with the M3 SD in general). <span style="font-weight: bold">It WILL be fixed.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
2) Moonshell isn't designed to what it's running on. Running the setup.exe program allows you to select which unit to patch it for, and selecting M3SD produces the correct version. Using that to run on the M3Mini v2 also allows you to boot other homebrew. Some users have reported success in running apps like Beup and DSOrganize after loading Moonshell first (just browse to the folder with beup.nds and click A on it, this should load it like normal).
<br/>
<br/>
3) Try running beup using the standard non-fatlib version. This does not require accessing the SD card - this may fix your problems until a newer version comes out that supports it correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
4) Don't fret over your purchase - due to the design of the M3Mini v2, it uses less battery life, and well, you know that it doesn't stick out already.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that - a quick mention about <span style="font-weight: bold">Nintendo Wifi Stick</span>
<br/>
<br/>
It WILL work with beup - you just need to convert it to a SoftAP by using <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10113&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold">these instructions</span></a>

It converts it to an Access Point - which essentially makes it act like a wifi router, etc... the Nintendo WiFi stick is just for those people who don't have a router or AP to begin with, so, in essence, it will work perfectly fine - assuming the conversion to SoftAP works fine (I'd assume it does, few people have had problems with converting it)<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Takieda, I followed all the instructions and it worked like a charm, but funnily enough, beup still won't connect. It tries to authenticate for half a minute, then it gives up?
<br/>
<br/>
Yet the connection is clearly good, connection tests in wifi settings prove so. Manually picking the SSID (which it picks up) and the ip adress belonging to the adaptor doesn't help it connect.
<br/>
<br/>
Any idea whatsoever what it could be now?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Slyphirc does exactly the same thing,  it errors at the authenticating. It seems to be a connection issue then... But what the hell can this be, if the connection test says it's okay?!
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT2: A few things, unlike in the guide, the ip adress my computer uses looks nothing like the NDS and Wifi adaptor one, but I don't think I'm looking at my local adress, would that be a problem? It connects, so I didn't think so...
<br/>

Also, the ICS (which you needed to uncheck) has checked itself again when I look at the options now. Could that be it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've tried taking the steps, Sebbo, but apparantly in my case the lan connection isn't set to a certain ip. It chooses it's own, and even if I check ipconfig and fill out these exact number at the LAN's properties, it won't work.
<br/>
<br/>
In other words, I don't know if it's needed or not, but my LAN's ip looks nothing like the wireless' ip. Also, all I have is a simple cable connection to a cable modem, yet I see 3 LAN connections, not counting the wireless one I added.

I have a G6 lite and I can't get this working so could you tell me how you're writing it to the flash card? Are you using U-Disk Manager? If so, what writing options do you have checked / unchecked? If not, are you just copying it directly to the card and then running it from the MyCard menu?

What router do you have? WEP on or off? In your WFC config settings do you have it set to obtain an IP automatically? or did you manually configure an IP for your DS.

Just copy it to your G6 lite without the Manager and start it. That worked for me. beup recognizes the wifi settings from your ds automatically, otherwise you have to type the IP and so on manually.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is quite odd, When I first tested Beup last night (7th Aug 06) it worked perfectly, Connected to my SoftAP network card to MSN and I was chatting away to people for almost a hour.
<br/>
<br/>
However, today (8th Aug) despite having nothing changed, Beup Now freezes dead when I reach the Contact list page, Sometimes I can open a chatbox to another client but thats about as far as I can go before my DS freezes (WiFi active light keeps blinking, but I dont think that means much)
<br/>
<br/>
It still connects to the MSN network, it just freezes up dead shortly afterwards..
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried resetting my Router, network settings, AP settings, deleted the firmware Wifi details on my NDS, tried connecing by hand, tried using BeUp on a GBAmp and a Supercard but the problem remains exactly the same
<br/>
<br/>
I am at a loss to explain it so I figured I would ask here if anyone else has had this problem..
<br/>
<br/>
My Details (if they will help are) ND-Lite (FlashmeV7 patched) Supercard Mini-SD with Sandisc 1gb memory card (Latest kernel), Also tried with a GBAmp (1gb Integral i-pro High-speed Compact Flash card)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Seems I have found the problem, Beup does not like Large active contact lists, If I have more than.. 5-6 people (approx) online at once, it kills the DS.. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thats the only thing I can think of as BeUp is working again, and the only difference is there are 4 active people on my List</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Slyboots on Wed Aug 09, 2006 2:57 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Well, the size doesn't matter, but I didn't make provisions for it to center the bitmap. You can play around, though I think it'll be better if it remains the same width.

Regular bmp (Windows type) files should be OK.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://akzeac.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://akzeac.blogspot.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm struggling to get my Beup working properly, I've got it on my sd card and it runs with no trouble via the m3 menu, but it doesn't store any data ie my email address, nor does it identify my avitar's or smilies.
<br/>
<br/>
I've created the directories as stated but i don't no how to create the config files, i presume via notepad. nor do i know where to put the config files if i had created them.
<br/>
<br/>
I've read this entire thread and i've seen a couple of people post comments like the one above but nobody has said how to do it.
<br/>
<br/>
Please can someone help.

You probably have an M3 card that isn't supported by rein v15. Try the new version in the last page, it was compiled against rein v16, which was reported to have better M3 support.

Ok, I use Google and dictionary for help if I got troubles while translating.
<br/>
I'm not saying that my translation is better, there can be alternative versions of each language as I have seen on other homebrew projects.
<br/>
Your english/finnish is fine. I must admit that Finnish language is very hard even for most ppl who have born in Finland.
<br/>
I translate for my own good and I like to see stuff in Finnish.

I guess so, because im able to connect using other homebrew (DSorganize irc) and i even manage to get past the 'doing handshake' but that rarely happens, and even once, i managed to actually be up! i could chat. so i guess i configured everything right.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to make a new AZERTY keyboard, but more bigger ! My keyboard size is actually of 256*72 pixels. I made the config file, and keyboard looks pretty well on my computer.
<br/>
Here is a screenshot.

<br/>
<br/>
But when I put it on my DS, I saw that it was not on the correct place ! And the lasted letters of the right of the keyboard are now in the left ! Here is a screen?
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I think that it?s on cause of the main source of beup. The default keyboard is smaller, and so its beginning is around 50 pixels from the left side.
<br/>
For my keyboard, it should begin from the left side, on the 0 position. I wonder if it is possible to do this in the config file, or have I to modify the main source of beup ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for replies?

- If you have a tab open of a person, but you haven't spoke with him for a while and you start typing the app freezes for a while, ignoring a few typed letters.

Suggestions:
<br/>
- The abblilty to scroll through the history of a chetsession.
<br/>
- The abblilty to dissable the 'waiting for partner tyo join conversation', 'partner has joined conversation' etc.
<br/>
- Sort poeple on online/offline.
<br/>
- Drag select text, like with a mouse.
<br/>
- The message functionality of MSN is missing. you can change your name, but not your message, nor can you see the message.

- A real scrollbar in your contactlist would be nice.
<br/>
- If someone comes online you hear a sound, but you cant see whos comming online.

<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to make a new AZERTY keyboard, but more bigger ! My keyboard size is actually of 256*72 pixels. I made the config file, and keyboard looks pretty well on my computer.
<br/>
Here is a screenshot.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
But when I put it on my DS, I saw that it was not on the correct place ! And the lasted letters of the right of the keyboard are now in the left ! Here is a screen?
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/8599/keyboardproblemzp3.jpg" target="_blank">http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/8599/keyboardproblemzp3.jpg</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I think that it?s on cause of the main source of beup. The default keyboard is smaller, and so its beginning is around 50 pixels from the left side.
<br/>
For my keyboard, it should begin from the left side, on the 0 position. I wonder if it is possible to do this in the config file, or have I to modify the main source of beup ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for replies?

EDIT:
<br/>
Yeh emotes work but i can't seem to get avatars to work are you sure it supose to be in a folder called avatars? in same folder as beup.ds?
<br/>
<br/>
and i'm pretty sure its a 96x96 png
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone make an avatar pack?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 2:
<br/>
<br/>
Also some people can see writing and other can only see text i think its because messenger 8 uses a new protocol and i don't know it it supports yahoo contacts or not
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know emotes work fine i guess its cus it has configure file but i can't seem to get avatars to work i put it in the folder and what not and check that it was a 96x96 png so who knows i wish kevinc would get on and tell us how this thing works</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

After a minute or so it will say "Cannot connect" (even though I have setup the wifi connection in Mario Kart and Metroid) so I tap where it says 'SSID', select my router, then input the IP address manually which causes the rest of the settings to fill out automatically.
<br/>
Then when I tap "Use Custom" the program just freezes.
<br/>
<br/>
The really confusing thing is that doing all that used to take me to the login screen instantly. I haven't changed any settings to the best of my knowledge, but the program is acting up all of a sudden.
<br/>
<br/>
Even when I could access the Login it would hang at "Doing handshake" but this is even worse.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone help?</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">put all the information Manually in the Wifi setup of Mario Kart.. 
<br/>
That will help :)
<br/>
<br/>
the important things in 0.4 will be add, block and delete functions.

(maybe even showing custom emoticons that comes from the contacts and send/receive files)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not sure about Microsoft blocking Beup, but they do have a nasty habit of updating the MSN protocol without telling anyone; they seem to be in denial to the fact that MSN is a very successful protocol that people often end up using - Windows or not.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

<br/>
Yes. Beup is trying to connect to an IP which no longer points to a valid MSN dispatch server. I don't have the resources to recompile beup right now, so if anybody wants a quick fix, go to msn.cpp and change the Dispatch_IP line to:
<br/>
<br/>
#define Dispatch_IP IP(65, 54, 239, 20)
<br/>
<br/>
then recompile as normal.

it"s been some months now that i have the ds but i have never been able to use msn,

i dunno if i have to patch it, so i tried patched and unpatched.

the actual problem is that the rom won't display anything except Loading...

i had a different error with others versions showing the Ip configuration, and using custom or firmware setup don"t work better.

<br/>
Yes. Beup is trying to connect to an IP which no longer points to a valid MSN dispatch server. I don't have the resources to recompile beup right now, so if anybody wants a quick fix, go to msn.cpp and change the Dispatch_IP line to:
<br/>
<br/>
#define Dispatch_IP IP(65, 54, 239, 20)
<br/>
<br/>
then recompile as normal.

<br/>
<br/>
Want to start off by saying that I really do think beup is the BEST messenger client. I've used Gaim, trillian, MSN Messenger (PC/Mac) and more, and I think that beup is well suited for its hardware and ease of use. Well done.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope someone recompiles it with the latest MS server details, I would if I had myself a cpp compiler here.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep it up guys. I dont know if its been said, or even implemented yet, but what about voice chat via MSN?

So, does this mean that MSN Messenger servers aren't registed to and DNSs or are we going for better compatibility with peoples setups by trying to skip that step?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

<br/>
<br/>
it"s been some months now that i have the ds but i have never been able to use msn,
<br/>
<br/>
i downloaded both nofat.gba.ds renamed to .nds and the rein gba one, renamed too for the last version available on this topic,
<br/>
<br/>
i dunno if i have to patch it, so i tried patched and unpatched.
<br/>
<br/>
the actual problem is that the rom won't display anything except Loading...
<br/>
i had a different error with others versions showing the Ip configuration, and using custom or firmware setup don"t work better.
<br/>
<br/>
I can say that my internet connection works because i ran my mariokart cartridge and saved the configuration into the firmware and i tested it with a commercial rom ( just for testing :-| )
<br/>
<br/>
I hope i'm clear; please gimme some advice</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
<br/>
I have a NDS Lite with SC+ Micro SD and beup doesn't remember my MSN account so I have to type it each time I turn the NDS on.
<br/>
<br/>
Which version do I need if I want to beup remember my data? (i'm using the dragonM version now and I've also tried the rein version) Can it do it if i'm using Micro SD?
<br/>

Ok, but it also doesn't work with the nofat version. Well, it does work, but it doesn't pass the handshaking part... So same same for me. 
<br/>
Any other ideas, plz...
<br/>
<br/>
The list also said you would need frimware 24, I run 29. As long as the app starts, connects with WiFi settings and comes to the handshaking part, then I can asume the app "works" wor me?
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">For people who want their firmare to auto connect when starting up:
<br/>
Go to WiFi setup (for example in Mario Kart) and make sure your no.1 connection is one with Manual, STATIC settings. So no auto IP, no auto dns, no auto at all. Just fill it in manual and test the connection. 
<br/>
Beup only tries the first settings of your DS, so if these no1 manual settings work, Beup can get through in no time.</span><br/>_________________<br/>Grey DS, M3 perfect miniSD, 2x 1GB Kingston, Passcard 3, FW v29 GL v29</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Your problem.
<br/>
<br/>
1st solution i suggest is to use Mario kart to do a firmware wifi setting and when it done save it and go open beup and see if the problem persist.
<br/>
<br/>
2nd solution (troublesome) find the manual setting for your connection</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
bug for me on nds phat with v7 flashme stelth original v5 so i have now brightness
<br/>
supercard SD version with newest updates etc
<br/>
using beup final 0.3 live with this server update
<br/>
<br/>
wifi with wep

when either close or far, or even next to router it can often not associate, this does not matter actually.
<br/>
<br/>
but this does:
<br/>
<br/>
often i have to enter my name twice before it will actually update.
<br/>
sometimes it wont change at all
<br/>
sometimes i cant change my status whatever i do, i have to re log in
<br/>
to make it work.
<br/>
often when someone taks to you and leaves it takes long for them to re-join, this is not needed in the real msn anyway, why is this in it?
<br/>
and some real bugger: my other friends with ndses without homebrew thingys are jeajous at me for going on msn with it :D

Well..
<br/>
It is because of the connection.. It couldn't contact the server at the moment, so it couldn't change your nickname. If you dont have contact for 30 seconds, it will say "contact to server lost." And if you have turned "auto login after conn. lost" on, it will automatically connect again. (But you can sign out and login again manually if you think that you have lost contact to the MSN service)

<br/>
this is the same on the PC version. But it wont show it. And on PC, it goes mych faster ofcourse. :)

Some MSN Clients on the PC like (dMSN) will show if you joined in some converstation (or if someone leaves a conversation, like on Beup)

Once again, let me thank you for Beup ;)

I'm very glad to learn that we'll can use skins :)
<br/>
About this, don't hesitate to give us some news or screens of your progress.
<br/>
<br/>
I only have a request (and I think it's very simple to do !): I tried to use a Keyboard I made, which was 256*~100 pixels....

<br/>
<br/>
I believe it's in the Keyboard.C file... It says that the keyboard picture must begin at 28 pixels from the left (but in fact it must begin at the 0 position...)
<br/>
I don't know if you can understand me, excuse me because I'm Belgian... :/
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, good luck for your studies... ! I repeat it, give us news about your coding ! (what's wrong, what's new,etc...)

darkgilson, as you can see, the keyboard-layer starts at x=30 (wild guess). Adding 256 and you get 286 which is offscreen (hence, the wrap on the next line).

Does your version of Beup look like MSN (HtheB's Beup Live), or does it look like its own thing? (The regular Beup).

I really got the latest version. I used both the no-fat and chism versions on my G6. I didnt really try other homebrew wifi tools. All i know is that WFC works great and i can connect to AP's but the DNS tests always seem to fail... I wonder if other people got this problem too.

That would require to implement Live functions. It's another different protocol, especially receiving the contact list. Not planned for 0.4

not true i use emoticons on my G6 flash you have to use the No-Fat version for them to work and have the folder on your g6 with the emoticons. Only thing i have problems with is custom avatars.

Um, considering the no-fat version doesn't touch the card at all, not even acknowledges its existence, I'd say either it's not a "no-fat" version, a misnamed custom compiled version, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster is blessing us with his Holy Appendage.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://akzeac.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://akzeac.blogspot.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well..

It is because of the connection.. It couldn't contact the server at the moment, so it couldn't change your nickname. If you dont have contact for 30 seconds, it will say "contact to server lost." And if you have turned "auto login after conn. lost" on, it will automatically connect again. (But you can sign out and login again manually if you think that you have lost contact to the MSN service)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, Bomber here...
<br/>
<br/>
I am just another person who needs help, after tryin' to get Beup workin' right serveral times. This is all the information I've gathered and I hope someone can help me out. Please help after readin' the followin: 
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">First things first:</span>
<br/>
* Passcard3 and a Supercard (DS Lite)
<br/>
* Mini SD
<br/>
* Wireless internet (Usin' WEP)
<br/>
* IP: 192.168.1.12
<br/>
* Usin' Beup 0.3 chishm (also have Beup 0.3 rein, but usin' this as backup.)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Problem:</span>
<br/>
* I power up my DS Lite and execute Beup 0.3 . Then, if I do nothin', Beup himself uses 'firmware' and I arrive at the next page. From there, if I fill in my email and password, leave the two boxes for 'auto loggin' and 'fix blur' open, change my start status to everythin' BUT offline and hit the connect button, Beup begins to connect. And that's where it all ends. Last two words:
<br/>
<br/>
"Doing handshake.."
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Things I have already done, but do not understand:</span>
<br/>
* I can interfere from the moment I execute Beup and need to fill in my IP address by pressin' 'stop'. Then I can make Beup find a couple of SSID's, includin' my wireless connection, but even then if I choose my own connection I will get the same outcome. Normally, Beup uses 'firmware' to connect and the SSID stays blank. W...what?
<br/>
<br/>
* I read somewhere that in order to save your settings, you have to copy 'save.sav', rename it to the same Beup you're using and then add it, in my case, in the SD Card. Enter your settings one time when executin' Beup, immediatly disconnect, goto the saver menu of the Supercard and press A two times to save everythin'. I did this, although as discribed earlier, if I connect usin' SSID, disconnect and then save in the saver menu, Beup will not remember the SSID I logged in with. Huh?
<br/>
<br/>
* I've changed my WIFI connections in the DS usin' Metroid Hunters/Lost Magic (Great games =D) I've changed the last digit of my IP address. So to say, .12 became .13 . Question: My normal IP ends with .12 , but I've changed the IP address to .13 in my DS. Which IP must I use to log in at Beup? .12 , .13 or somethin' else?
<br/>
<br/>
* I've taken a good look at my internet connection and I think everythin' is supposed to be as it is. The connection is OPEN, not SHARED. I can't seem to disable my WEP, but from what I have heard Beup can work with or without WEP. The WEP keys are HEX, not ACSII. The only thin' I haven't seen yet is 'DHCP'. I heard that DHCP can be the problem, but then again kevinc himself said that Beup is supposed to work with DHCP.
<br/>
<br/>
That's 'bout it. If I forgot somethin', please let me know. I hope someone took his/her precious time to read all this and help me out. I would appriciate it from the bottom of my heart.
<br/>

I think this is the problem, you need to use the latest version. MSN changed their hand-shaking server so the latest version is adjusted to connect the new server. Or something like that.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

"Since i cannot find a compiled version of beup with ninjaDS support, i decided to compile latest version (0.3), it has the dispatcher ip changed.

It is based on libfatdragon, btw the make-ds-dragon has LDFLAGS set to -lfat-rein instead of -lfat-dragon, so it took me a lot of time to understand why it didn't work.

Remeber that settings are stored in beup-user file.

I've tried using Beup version 0.3 final.

I have a DS Lite with Supercard Lite.

I get stuck at the login part, I keep getting an invalid login or password message though I'm sure my password is right (i've retyped it a good number of times), and my login name is also correct. 
<br/>
<br/>
I've searched around and haven't seen anyone with that kind of issue yet.
<br/>
<br/>
could that be due to a long msn login (long email) or to a password containing letters and numbers?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ive just got an M3 simply and have got beup to work. Its great! The only problem is Im not sure how to get it to remeber my settings. Im using the 0.3 fixed version and ive also tried putting the information into the 'user' file manually but to no avail.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, ive replaced the .png avatars with my own (literally pasted over them and saved - so they're still .png) but BEUP doesnt seem to recognise that they're there.

If anyone could help me out id be extremely grateful

i believe you need to conform to the standard 96x96 pixel msn avatar.  
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
besides that, i have a question of my own.
<br/>
<br/>
using the DS, i connected to a local wifi network that i use for my internet purposes for my laptop.  now the connection is solid, and when i test it in the DS wifi connection test utility it works.
<br/>
however, i cannot get beup to connect to the msn servers no matter what i try. 
<br/>
now when i try to connect to a nintendo WiFi game through say mario kart or tetris i get error 61020. i.e. ports are closed, firewall is in the way.
<br/>
im assuming this is the same reason why my beup wont connect to msn, since msn runs through its own ports right...
<br/>
<br/>
if thats tha case, my laptop is on the same network, i have the same ports blocked, (not my network so i cannot enter the config to setup port forwarding) but i can still connect to msn through my laptop.
<br/>
<br/>
regardless, it brings me to another point.  if you need to have the right ports open for Beup to run on a wireless network, the chances the random  hotspot you come across while travelling with your DS will have the right ports open is next to none.  so essentially the only networks you will be connecting to are the ones you can admin yourself, which are obviously the ones in your own home/office, which is pretty redundant location to be surfng msn from a DS, when you obviously have a laptop/desktop with a fullsize keyboard and screen from which to do it.
<br/>
<br/>
i hate to think everyone going crazy about Beup is simply using it around the house, while they have a much better medium from which to do it in another room.
<br/>
<br/>
i hope there is some way to have Beup work on the go, and be able to connect successfully to networks with only the basic ports open, i.e. 21</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I get that a lot. Rebooting my router sorts it out.
<br/>
<br/>
My Beup runs fine with no extra ports open.
<br/>
<br/>
The only downside to a lot of the wifi homebrew apps at the moment is that DHCP doesn't work and you have to know/guess the fixed IP and gateway to use.
<br/>
<br/>
Unless I have access to a machine that is already on the hotspot I normaly try 
<br/>
IP: 192.168.1.xxx (where xxx is a largish number)
<br/>
Subnet: 255.255.255.0
<br/>
Gateway: 192.168.1.1

It sounds like you still have problems.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">all routers use the same type of wi-fi its just the software on them that work if you are having problems with your ds then just go into your router and turn on the DMZ feature for the ds so all the ports are open to it
<br/>
<br/>
if your planning on getting a router i would suggest getting a D-Link or Linksys because they are the top 2 brands i have seen D-Link come alot farther  this year so thats what i would suggest or now</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok I've got a problem.
<br/>
<br/>
When I launch the no fat lib I see the first screen and it says:
<br/>
<br/>
"Connecting using firmware setup:
<br/>
Searching..."
<br/>
<br/>
On the bottom screen it show 3 input fields for ip, gateway and subnet mask and "SSID:" with no field.
<br/>
<br/>
There are three buttons on the bottom: use custom, use firmware, stop.
<br/>
<br/>
From here the app just appears to be frozen. I tap all the buttons and fields and nothing happens. The clock does not change.
<br/>
<br/>
I have got the wifi working on DSMail so that is not the problem.

Any help would be much appreciated.

<br/>
<br/>
Even though someone made an update of beup, by simply changing IP an dthat it works, this problem could occur again and again.
<br/>
<br/>
What we should do is a system like DSliveweather, where Beup would connect to a server, get the good working IP, and other DNS info, and would after that connect to the MSN network.
<br/>
<br/>
Will that work? in that case when there is a server change, HtheB or anyone has just to change the info on the server and that'll fix everyones beup at the same time.

NOTES:

Just a couple of things, I found the layout on email replies that I recieved a little confusing, most of the display was full of time, date, and sender ID info, had a tricky time differenciating the actual content of the mail from this info :p
<br/>
<br/>
Also, once I wrote a long enough mail, the screen didn't scroll so I couldn't see what I was typing once I'd filled up one screen worth of text :p
<br/>
<br/>
not too handy :)  be nice to see it fixed.

As for .nds, "it doesn't work" is rarely helpful. Do you mean that it freezes on two white screens immediately after you start beup from the R4 menu? Or does it have some other misbehavior?

He said he has been too busy with school to get much done on Beup but that the next release will be fully skinable and most likely have add/remove buddy functions. I'll tell you more when I can he is going to send me a beta so i can help him with the testing I'll post screens of it.

I told him about this program called Pidgin IM that I use its an open source IM program that has mostly ever protocal in it so I think it will help him work fast if he can use the code and maybe eventually impliment other protocals in beup how awesome would it to be to have aim, yim. gtalk, and wlm all in one on ds.
