<br/>
<br/>
- There is now three difficulty modes, instead of the single "Normal" mode. In "Easy" mode, there is few different tiles at first, but a new tile is added every 5 levels. The "Difficult" mode is for those who want a challenging game. In the three modes, the time speeds up at each level.
<br/>
<br/>
- In "Easy" and "Normal" modes, there is now 20 different board patterns.
<br/>
<br/>
- There is now three highscores tables saved on the DS and saved on the net on <a class="postlink" href="http://leaderboard.palib.info/games.php" target="_blank">leaderboard.palib.info</a> to handle the best scores of the three difficulty modes.
<br/>
<br/>
- When you do a highscore, you have now the choice to send it right now on leaderboard.palib.info or to send it later if you are not close to a wifi access point. In order to send unsent scores, go to the highscores screen (unsent scores are preceded by a red "L") and press X.
<br/>
<br/>
- The current level is now automatically saved, so you can continue to play a previous game when you choose "Play".
<br/>
<br/>
- Some minor graphical and animation changes.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://stravingo.over-blog.fr/" target="_blank">My games (<span style="font-weight: bold">Ka-BoOm</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Setsuzoku no Puzzle</span>) and apps (<span style="font-weight: bold">DS Weather Report</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Treasures of Gaia</span>) on DS are available on my blog!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've had a quick play with this new version and the difficult mode makes it a lot more challenging - like in the original version. Any chance of different shaped boards with smaller time limits to break things up in difficult mode as well? Keep up the good work!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
