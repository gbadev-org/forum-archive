    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I made a Pipe Dream-like game for the DS, it works pretty well IMO.

<br/>
The goal of the game is to build a pipeline between two points on a grid, to the left you see what pipe-pieces will come next (the one on the bottom is the very next one) and on the top is a timer ticking down, when the time is up goo will start coming out of the starting pipe and if it reaches the end pipe you win and go to the next level.

The game is playable on both Windows and Nintendo DS, but since I compiled the Windows version with Visual Studio 2008 most people will probably not be able to run it (you need either Visual Studio 2008, Windows Vista or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9B2DA534-3E03-4391-8A4D-074B9F2BC1BF&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package</a>).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
