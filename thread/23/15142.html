I know there is Colors and Phydias.  Can't remember which, but one of them can do pixel art, but theres still some kind of pressure sensitivty even with the slide at max which makes it a bit fiddy. I want solid colours when i tap the screen.

Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just watched the Inchworm vid and looks brilliant, allows pixel level editing.

<br/>
Can't wait till it is released now!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Phidias can do pixel art with perfect solid colors. 
<br/>
<br/>
Just zoom in very close to see the pixel grid, set brush size to 1 px, pressure to 100 and select the first brush (the completely black one).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
