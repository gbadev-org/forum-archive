<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Updated</span> : Now with EIGHTEEN retro games!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Brief</span>
<br/>
A collection of retro styled games, kicked up a notch.
<br/>
Gameplay&gt;Graphics
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Notice</span>
<br/>
DLDI Patch the _dldi versions to keep your highscores.  There are no other differences between the two versions.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm now having to include 3 versions of each.  It seems that Supercards are fussy enough to want their own special edition of the game.  How silly!   And people complain about the Games'n'Music!! At least that used the standard format!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Credits</span>
<br/>
The Games were coded by Jayenkai.
<br/>
The Graphics were drawn by Jayenkai.
<br/>
The Sound Effects were created by Jayenkai.
<br/>
Some Music was also made by Jayenkai, but then he took it out because it got annoying.

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Games</span>
<br/>
Centipede : Shoot the centipede.  Don't let it escape.
<br/>

<br/>
Invaders : Shoot the aliens.	Don't let them get to the bottom.
<br/>
Light Cycles : Try to get your opponents to crash.
<br/>
Asteroids : Destroy the asteroids before they destroy you.
<br/>
Pacman	: Run around and collect things.
<br/>
<br/>
Frogger : Leap your way across 2 busy roads.
<br/>
Pong : Beat your opponent, "one" ball at a time.
<br/>
Tetris : Build low!
<br/>
Buzzard Bait : You might like to call this game Joust.  I owned a TRS-80, so I call it Buzzard Bait ;)
<br/>
QBert : Hop around and change all the bricks.
<br/>
Spike Dodge : Dodge the spikes, pick up the balls.
<br/>
<br/>
Extract : Keep Blue away from Red, and grab the Greens.
<br/>
Missile Command : Tap to fire.  Stop the missiles.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Copyrights</span>
<br/>
The games contained within this pack are mostly owned by different companies.
<br/>
The ideas are basic gaming concepts, so I'm hoping they don't mind too much.
<br/>
These are collected for the purpose of being fun to play, not to rip off the originating companies.
<br/>
If I was trying to rip you off, the graphics would at least be half decent!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes. The segments are large compared to the entire sprites of the other controllable characters. Also, shouldn't Space Invaders have some barriers to hide behind?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nope, sorry.. That's a perception thing!  All sprites are 8x8 pixel images.
<br/>
In fact, those circles are the same circles that are in the Centipede game. They're just more spread out.
<br/>
(Your Invaders ship looks a bit bigger, but is infact the Racer car with two bullets strapped to it's sides!)
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, although technically Invaders should have both Bases to hide behind, and UFO's to occasionally give out bonus points, I haven't added either.
<br/>
The bases slow down your imminent death.. So they got scrapped ;)
<br/>
And the UFO was going to throw Power-ups towards you, but I'm not too sure if power-ups are the type of thing that'll work in the collection..
<br/>
I'll probably just throw it back in for points!
<br/>
<br/>
Racer's on the scrapheap since I'm really not a big fan of it's slow/dullness, and I've added in a decent Missile Command, a "Keep away from the Red Blocks" game, and a "Tap the random objects" game.
<br/>
The Tap the Random Objects game turned out to be a lot less interesting that it was meant to be, so that'll probably end up alongside Racer!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently adding a DonkeyKong like "Climb/Dodge" thing, but it's incredibly repetitive at the minute..  I'm going to keep tweaking the thing to make a decent game out of it, but if I've not managed it by tomorrow night I'll probably just scrap it and move onto something a little more lively!
<br/>
<br/>
Next release coming as soon as I've got 2 menu's filled :)

</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#146202 - Jayenkai - Fri Nov 30, 2007 1:21 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure what to do with JNKPlat right now, I'm two minds.
<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand I've a perfectly good engine up and running already.  I could add the level editor in properly (Never did that before, it was pre-dldi!) and bob's your uncle, a perfectly good Editable JNKPlat.  sorted!
<br/>
<br/>
But on the other hand, I could redo from scratch, add larger sprites, add scrolling, and then add an even better level editor.  Bob's your uncle, an even  better JNKPlat. sorted!
<br/>
<br/>
Putting it into the collection, though, means one thing.  I'd need to incorporate a level system into the collection.
<br/>
Thus far, I've been trying to avoid that.  If we have, say 10 games, each with editable levels, and 10 people make 10 levels for each game, then that's 1000 files you have strewn around your DS!  That's a whole lot of garbage piling up there!
<br/>
On the other hand, if I try to create files with banks, and allow all games to save levels into parts of those banks, I might be able to do something with that.
<br/>
I don't know.
<br/>
In the meantime, <a class="postlink" href="http://socoder.net/?showcase=6761" target="_blank">JNKPlat 2007</a> (for Windows) might be something to try out, since it already has the editor in it.
<br/>
<br/>
..
<br/>
And.. Thanks for remembering ;)
<br/>
<br/>
.. Speaking of levels!  It took sodding ages designing a decent Pacman maze, and I tend to keep popping back and tweaking it.  Not much in the way of difficulty levels..  Normal = Plain, Hard = Some ghosts move 2* speed, Extreme = YOU move 2* speed, making it about 10* harder to control ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://AGameAWeek.com" target="_blank">A Game A Week.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To all : I'd like to formally apologise for the huge amount of problems in the Tetris game!   An insane number of issues cropped up over the day and a half after I released it!

They've all now been fixed, and Tetris should be about as playable as it ever was.

Because it does rotate..  I suppose I could shut off rotation for the block, but.. who even bothers rotating the block anyway?!
<br/>
Again, because they rotate around a single point.  I've been trying to get the right point to rotate but I think it might be a moving rotation point.  I'll keep trying ;)
<br/>
3 of each are placed into a bag, then pulled out at random.  Once the bag's empty, it restarts.  this is 'cos PALib's Random thing sucks, and it kept giving me nothing but | blocks all the time!
<br/>
PA_Lib's random.  Should probably switch that, but I don't think it really matters, does it?

<br/>
Buzzard Bait
<br/>
In Buzzard Bait they didn't do that.
<br/>
Same again..
<br/>
<br/>
Dodge Spikes..
<br/>
 the collision detection was made slightly dodgy so the game was more playable.  I know it's not perfect, but I was aiming for play, not perfect..  
<br/>
<br/>
And, Missile..

The slowness was added so that the game wasn't 100% simple to beat.

Because in Tetris clones I've played, movement of a rotating O piece has been a symptom of deeper misunderstanding of the game.

Here's a diagram of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tetrisconcept.com/wiki/index.php?title=Image:SRS-pieces.png" target="_blank">the point around which each tetromino rotates</a> in most games since the late 1990s.

So it's a 21-piece bag. <span style="font-style: italic">Tetris DS</span> uses a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tetrisconcept.com/wiki/index.php?title=Random_Generator" target="_blank">similar algorithm using only one of each piece</a>.

It matters.

At the minute the L, J and | all seem to rotate in a way irritatingly differently to the Game Boy version of Tetris - they change column when rotating. Apart from that the feel is spot on, it has just the right slideyness before each piece sticks, for example.
<br/>
<br/>
Buzzard Bait: The AI is a bit duff ;-) The CPUs always seem to end up on the floor and only ever seem to "fluke" a kill, rather than hunt for it. AI is tricky to get right though, perhaps have 'em flap a bit more?
<br/>
<br/>
Pac Man: Any chance of a classic "eating" animation? Feels weird controlling a grapefruit! ;-) 2 frames: mouth open, mouth closed, would do it.

<br/>
Well, it's been vaguely going for the past few months.. It was only a matter of time..
<br/>
<br/>
..
<br/>
Tepples, don't take this the wrong way, (and maybe this is the "OMG!WTF!?THE DS BORKED!" talking) but the Tetris is only 1 of 18 little games that I've made within the space of 3 weeks..
<br/>
I've spent enough time playing Gameboy Tetris' to know that everything after Tetris DX is utterly crap, and that's why I at least bothered to make the tiles slide properly after dropping.
<br/>
To be totally honest, I really don't care if the rotation that the blocks start off in, is ever so slightly "Not as random as it should be"
<br/>
The Space Invaders is missing bases, and there's no UFO, either.  THAT is something to complain about.  The random starting rotation of Tetris blocks... Not so much.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will try to fix the rotation of the L's, the squares will be static when you strangely try to rotate them, and I'll see what can be done with the | bar... But other than that, I'm leaving the Tetris game as it is.  I've spent enough time on it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Right, onto the other games.
<br/>
Buzzard Bait's AI is a bit rubbish, yes.  They either Go left and flap occasionally, Go right and flap occasionally, or sit down and have a rest!
<br/>
AI isn't really my strongest suit, and you'll find in most of my games that if I can get away with plain randomness, then that's what I'll go for.  (like in QBert.)
<br/>
I'll up their flapping probability,  (and actually did do, already!) but again, I think that might actually be a "PALib's random numbers suck!" issue more than anything else.   I might have to find a pseudo-random thing online somewhere, and implement that instead.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for the Grapefruit issue, take a look at <a class="postlink" href="http://jnk.homedns.org/bg.gif" target="_blank">this</a>.  It's ALL the sprites.  Everything!
<br/>
1 single image that's loaded into memory a few times.  1 background layer, 1 foreground layer, 1 Spriteset  and then all 3 again for the other screen.
<br/>
It's nothing amazing, but what I'm trying to do is stick with the graphics that are there, and not have to add anything special.  That's why Pacman is a Centipede's Tail.  That's why Goombas are running after him, pretending to be space invaders, and doing a fine job of looking like QBert..  It's why the asteroids look a little more like random dots than polygons, and it's even the reason that most of the graphics look like strange hobbled together retro graphics!  It's because they are.
<br/>
<br/>
What I <span style="font-weight: bold">could</span> do (I considered it before but then I must've forgotten!) is to shove a black triangle-ship thing on top of him every so often, thus giving a vague impression of a mouth!
<br/>
Should work ok!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
JNKPlat : I don't mean huge sprites, I mean more like 16x16 instead of 8x8.  I'd obviously keep the style intact, and have always tried my best to do that.  Like in this collection, Arcade Slots* and even Stringy Things Gameplay is my main target.  Even if my graphics look really good, and even if the game idea is brilliant, and even if I think to myself "<a class="postlink" href="http://jnk.homedns.org/ab.png" target="_blank">OMG! This looks really really good!!!</a>" I won't let a game of mine hit the net** until I'm about 80% sure it's going to be good to play. 
<br/>
<br/>
Whatever I eventually do with JNKPlat, it'll be just as much fun!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For reference I'm going to take a small break from this collection.  Maybe until after Xmas.. 
<br/>
I should try and get some other stuff done, really! 
<br/>
<br/>
But don't worry, I'll be back!
<br/>
In the meantime, feel free to list any possible games you'd like to see in the next version.   If I can find a way to do it, I'll give it my best!  (Or at least, something closely resembling my best.)

<span style="font-size: 7px; line-height: normal">* Arcade Slots was a great collection of Arcade themed Slot Machine games.  It included a playable Hogan's Alley game, but everyone was put off by the words "Slot Machine" and so nobody ever played it enough to find the Hogan's Alley game.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Personally, I like the way your interpretations of these games play very differently from the "tradional" versions.  It's like you took to general game concept and look but applied your own interpretation of the gameplay.  TO me, that's a very classic homebrew style like we would have seen on the original B&amp;W gameboy or what I expect a lot of the homebrews on the TI calculators play like.
<br/>
<br/>
If I want the original versions, I can emulate them.  I play your versions precisely because they're different.
