<br/>
Pros
<br/>
. It's kinda working, and considering this is only day 2 of development, it's come out ok..  (Day 1 was 2 weeks ago, mind!!)
<br/>
<br/>
Cons
<br/>
. It's kinda not all working yet!
<br/>
. The "slow" objects are broken due to me tweaking the game to fit the DS.   For the most part this is completely unnoticable, but due to the way I got everything timed nicely, it basically means I'm going to have to rebuild/test Every Single Level..  GRrrrr.r..!!!!
<br/>
. The backgrounds aren't in.  The world 1 one is, but none of the others are.  This means that once you hit Worlds 7 and 8, you inexplicably slide over grass for no reason.  !  It's meant to be the Ice world, but it isn't!
<br/>
. The Flame sprites, Coaster sprites, and more aren't in.. The coaster is now a crapload of spikes, and .. well, I just took out everything after world 8 to save me having to fix the flame!  Lazy Jay!
<br/>
. The Music isn't in.  .. I'd have to turn the whole lot into Mods, and I'm REALLY not looking forward to doing that!!
<br/>
. No saves.  There's only 8 worlds to play through, so keep your DS powered until you're done!!!! (If you make it beyond world 8, strange things will begin to occur!!!  It may be playable, but isn't tested, so will probably kill you fairly quickly!)
<br/>
. No Scores.  um..  *shrugs*  Just couldn't be arsed ;)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Features
<br/>
. Spikes
<br/>
. Lots of Spikes
<br/>
. LOADS of Spikes!!
<br/>
. 3 lives per world (back to level one of the world if you lose all lives)
<br/>
. Sheep
<br/>
. 40 levels!
<br/>
<br/>
Reasons
<br/>
People can buy the iOS edition, so if they want it fully working and complete RIGHT NOW, there it be.  It's in the AppStore, costs you $2, comes with 200 levels and even has a nice big proper soundtrack for the entire game.
<br/>
<br/>
I've spent about 10 hours or so converting this over to DS, but if I want to move forward from this point, it's going to take me AGES to get it all done!!!
<br/>
<br/>
This is the "As quick as I can, let's see how it goes" edition, and considering the amount of work I've realised it'll need, I've decided to stop here for now.
<br/>
<br/>
If there's enough interest, (as in PEOPLE ACTUALLY REPLY AND SAY "YES PLEASE", as opposed to leaving this an empty thread), then I'll settle into the long haul, and make a proper kick-ass game out of it all.
<br/>
But if the game falls flat (like it inexplicably has on the iPhings) then..  well.. no harm done.. 10 hours hasn't killed me.
<br/>
<br/>
So, do what you can...  Drum up support.
<br/>
Let me know if you want more, and, hey, if you've got friends with iPhings, (who hasn't!?) tell them about it too, so I can get me sum munies!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy what there is, and reply!  For god's sake, reply!!!!

<br/>
iDeaS is fine, works nicely in an emulator, no problems.. yet!
<br/>
Once I add saves it might break a bit? I can?t remember how well emulators work with the saves. Been a while since I tried!
<br/>
<br/>
The entries will be fixed. I did the endy walk-off bit, added the swoopy spike stuff, but got a bit too lazy and didn?t do the walk-in bit. Lazy Jay!
<br/>
It?ll be fixed, and if I can get it all nice and fast, I?ll be popping in the drop/raise on the backgrounds, too.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Above is the iOS edition at a really early beta stage. (and with a much more annoying jingle!) You can see the lovely swoopy backgrounds, and the entry, too, which are all neatly done on iOS.
<br/>
Rotating spikes, too.. eeek!
<br/>
With a bit of luck, the final DS one oughta look a bit like that!
<br/>
<br/>
As for the donation. wowie! Thanks!!
<br/>
I wasn?t fishing for donations, but it?s nice to know people care THAT much for me to get the job done.
<br/>
<br/>
Very much appreciated! :D<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://AGameAWeek.com" target="_blank">A Game A Week.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Quite funny, I still have to test it on real hardware. Just some problems with collisions, <a class="postlink" href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/163/sgl.gif/" target="_blank">here</a> you can see the spike hitting the sheep, but didn't trigger the expected action...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#176510 - Jayenkai - Tue Aug 09, 2011 10:44 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, the collision detection is currently using the iOS code.  (and is colliding object positions, not sprites)
<br/>
It's expecting spikes half the size! derp!
<br/>
<br/>
This is one of the many things I need to fix, and due to the way the levels were specifically designed to be timed "Just Right" (and much harder!) it means that a fix will also require me to rebuild every single level.. 
<br/>
.. 
<br/>
<br/>
Which I'm really not looking forward to doing!!!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://AGameAWeek.com" target="_blank">A Game A Week.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<a class="postlink" href="http://jayenkai.socoder.net/GameList.php?ShowJust=246" target="_blank">Sheep Beta 2</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Pros</span>
<br/>
10 complete worlds, (50 levels!!) complete with music, and lovely swoopy backgrounds.
<br/>
Mini Editor! OMG!WTF!BBQ!ALODARE!!!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Cons</span>
<br/>
Still no scores.
<br/>
Lives temporarily removed due to lack of "skip" function (see iOS edition!)
<br/>
Nothing saves.  Nothing.. Not even the editor!!
<br/>
It's all just a nice play thing for the meantime.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Tricky</span>
<br/>
The sprites are the same, but the collisions are bumped up to the new sprite sizes.
<br/>
As a result, those old levels are now 100,000% harder!!!
<br/>
Good luck!!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Really Tricky!</span>
<br/>
There's a couple of levels that seem impossible!  But all are doable.
<br/>
I spent the past hour out in the back garden playing through it all, and was quite happy that it was possible.
<br/>
It's tricky!  But it's doable!
<br/>
.. and you do currently have infinite lives, so there's not a whole lot to lose.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">To Do</span>
<br/>
A few more objects to fix, another 10 pieces of music to do, and then I'll be redoing all the levels so that they're at least a little easier!
<br/>
(I'll probably do a 2-level-packs thing)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sheep Goes Left, The "I haven't decided what to name this release, yet" release.
<br/>
Let's call it "The iOS Pack", because, really, that's what it is.
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://jayenkai.socoder.net/GameList.php?ShowJust=246" target="_blank">Sheep Goes Left : Proper Release #1</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Pros</span>
<br/>
100 levels, all taken from the iOS release, but tweaked so they work properly!
<br/>
10 different backgrounds split up into 20 whole worlds, each with it's own BGM.
<br/>
Saving, so everything has to be unlocked in a proper order.  Woot!
<br/>
Editor, so you can start to build your own awesome Sheepy Level collection.
<br/>
Is Hard!!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Cons</span>
<br/>
You can Die now!
<br/>
No DS Specific delights, yet. Everything is still a redo of the iOS original.
<br/>
No switching of level packs.  There's either the Play pack or the Edit pack.  I'll sort that out next time.
<br/>
No scores...  .. Still no scores..  That's coming, though, don't worry!
<br/>
Is Hard!!!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Awesome</span>
<br/>
If you die a lot, you can Skip now!!
<br/>
Menu looks a bit better!
<br/>
Sheep!!  There are SHEEP!!  (complete a whole pack without dying once.)
<br/>
Is Hard!!!!
