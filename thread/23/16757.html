There are two versions available now, a EFS and FAT version. Please try them both and let me know how you go.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by headspin on Tue Jul 21, 2009 3:27 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I'll have my DS at home for the weekend so if you're interested in producing a binary with some debugging - or that skips part of the initialization so you can narrow down where the problem is - let me know.  I'm online frequently over weekends.<br/>_________________<br/>It's not an illusion, it just looks like one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is some garbled display on the intro screens (probably due to DS-X not clearing the VRAM first) but it's fine once I star the game.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Sat Aug 15, 2009 1:18 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For those that have been having problems it appears some cards need more RAM free for Warhawk to launch. So we have created another version which loads the level data from attached ROM space freeing up over a meg. For those having problems please report back if it works or not.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wish I could play this game, but it does not work on my Ez Flash Vi card.
<br/>
<br/>
Using the latest EzFlash Vi supplied moonshell the game just crashes (FAT version)
<br/>
<br/>
I can sort of run the game using the homebrew launcher that is for nitroFS, but I'm not seeing the title screens, and the game does not save anything.
<br/>
<br/>
The EFS version just does not work at all</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
