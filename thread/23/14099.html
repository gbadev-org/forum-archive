Ok,
<br/>
Doesn't detect my EZ 3-in-1 (however Quake does with the same code...)
<br/>
Detects my Supercard OK. Slide test works, however if I plug it back in the screen turns off.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing I find is that the Opera expansion is never detected with the DETECT_RAM flag, yet works fine if it's forced with OPERA_RAM. Maybe you could add a menu to allow force-selecting a certain type of card?
<br/>
<br/>
It's also good to know that my Supercard won't go any faster than the slowest settings with either my code or your code! Slow...
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: when the internal RAM gets tested, is that with the cache on or off?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Currently running as I type... detected all 32768KiB of RAM in my Supercard: MiniSD, its currently on slide test #3 (The screen just says 3, I'm guessing thats the slide test...)

<br/>
EDIT: Finished, it reports no problems. Upon pulling the card out on the slide test, it reported the RAM broken at 0x8000000, So does the moving inversions test.
<br/>
After a second try at the pulling out during slide test, I waited awhile during test 18, and it reports 0x9de94e0 as broken.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

The DS has 4096 KiB of EWRAM. I just chose not to take the effort to relocate the ARM9 program into unused VRAM to run it from there; instead it just calls malloc() to grab an appropriately sized chunk of RAM that's not already being used.

It changes the wait state of SLOT-2 until power down. When the GBA or DS is powered on, the GBA slot starts up in 4,2, but most commercial games' init code changes it to 3,1. SuperCard can't run anything faster than 4,2.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

That's because the EZ4 requires you to set which banks you want to access on just a 16 MiB address range. I think you can write a hackful procedure to check whether the second half of the RAM is available and make it available through the API, but I don't expect someone to.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can try to take a SLOT-1 firmware's use of a SLOT-2 expansion card out of the equation by doing the following: <ol type="1"><li>When Rim first asks you what RAM pak you have, pull the RAM pak out and reinsert it. </li><li>Continue as normal. </li></ol>

Can I link to your memtestarm web page so people can test their cards a bit more robustly than my code can?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
only detects 16megs of the 32megs. (maybe intentional? i heard there is some tricky stuff to access all 32 megs...)

<br/>
does anyone have any information regarding whether the M3 Real Expansion or the Ewin Expansion Pack are recognized and usable with the memtestArm or ram-accessing homebrew?
