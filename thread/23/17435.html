    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all!
<br/>
<br/>
I decided to release the first alpha version of my DS2x86 emulator (a DSx86 port using the SuperCard DSTwo's MIPS processor), which I have been working on for the last (almost) half a year. It is still missing a lot of stuff and is very buggy, but since I have sort of promised in my blog to release some kind of a version during this year, I thought now would be a good time. Next I need to do some major changes to it so that it will probably get broken for a while, so I wanted to get the first release out before that.
<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to your test reports! Please note that it really is still very buggy, so do not expect to actually play very many games on it yet. I would appreciate your help in testing it, as I prefer coding it instead of testing a lot of different games on it. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
You can get it from my download page at <a href="http://dsx86.patrickaalto.com/" target="_blank">http://dsx86.patrickaalto.com/</a> (also, if you wish to host it elsewhere, that would be appreciated to save the limited bandwidth of my hosting site).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your interest!
<br/>
<br/>
Ps. I tried to post here immediately when I released it last Sunday, but the forum was down. So, sorry for this late announcement..

I focused on those that either don't run in DSx86 or those that ran rather slowly. There wasn't much in the way of new games playable, but the speed difference in the slow games (alien breed and wing commander especially) was massive. Excellent work Pate :)

<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, DS2x86 is quite a lot faster than the original DSx86, and I hope to improve it's speed still a little bit. Adding the AdLib sound emulation will sadly slow it down again (when I get around to that).
<br/>
<br/>
I hope to get a few more 386-specific games running in the next version.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for taking the time to test it!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am not sure about the specifics, but it looks like sending two screens and two-channel audio from the DSTwo card to the Nintendo side will pretty much take up all the available bandwidth.
<br/>
<br/>
The DSTwo SDK does not allow any access to the ARM9 or ARM7 side, everything needs to be coded for the MIPS processor. Thus I can not use my ARM7 AdLib emulation, instead I need to code it again from scratch for the MIPS architecture. A task I am not looking forward to with any enthusiasm.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Version 0.05 released!
<br/>
<br/>
The major improvements and fixes in this version are the following: 
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
Preliminary support for high resolution EGA/VGA modes 640x200, 640x350 and 640x480 added. NOTE! Scaling does not work properly in these modes yet. 
<br/>
Implemented preliminary support for Mode-X mode 360x240 (for the Settlers game). 
<br/>
Implemented a lot of missing opcode variations, now a majority of the most common opcodes have been implemented, but many rare opcodes are still missing. 
<br/>
Increased the EMS memory size to 4MB, which allows Elder Scrolls: Arena to start up. 
<br/>
You can now switch between the configuration sections in the INI file on-the-fly, by clicking on the current configuration name. 
<br/>
Fixed a stack alignment problem in overlay loading, which caused an "Exception 5" error in some programs. 
<br/>
Fixed a bug in SETZ opcode, which caused Warcraft to hang when giving a command to dig gold. NOTE! It is recommended that you play Warcraft with "no sound", as the SoundBlaster emulation in DS2x86 seems to cause intermittent freezes and crashes. 
<br/>
Fixed a bug in division-by-zero interrupt handling, which caused Formula One: Grand Prix to fail. 
<br/>
</ul>
<br/>
Please send me the debug logs from this version again, they are very helpful when I improve DS2x86!

<br/>
One weird issue I encountered though was that from time to time some keypresses seemed to become "stuck", i.e. when turning left and right in Alone 3 occasionally when you released the key the character would continue to turn for a second afterwards. It also occurred occasionally when using the d-pad mouse also.

<br/>
The sticky key problem is something that I have been fighting with constantly, pretty much since starting this project. I suspect there is something wrong with either the DS2 SDK itself, or with my nonstandard method of transferring data to the ARM side from the MIPS processor side.
<br/>
<br/>
It looks like occasionally the key presses (and releases) simply get lost. I added some checks to the lowest level interrupt handler in the DS2 SDK, and even that does not get all the key events when that happens, so I don't know how to fix this issue properly. Hopefully I will figure out a fix eventually.

This version has the following improvements:
<br/>
<br/>
- Blinking cursor in text modes (finally!).
<br/>
- HIMEM.SYS emulation added, allows Chaos Engine to run.
<br/>
- Fixed a serious total crash problem in 32-bit string opcodes.
<br/>
- Fixed a stack alignment problem that could cause "Exception 4" BSOD errors.
<br/>
- Improved BSOD reporting, now includes a stack trace.
<br/>
- Improved horizontal blank reporting, this might solve hanging problems in some games.
<br/>
- Improved Mode-X graphics blitting code to handle wrap-around properly.
<br/>
- Changed the screen refresh interrupt interval from 60Hz to 59Hz. This might help with the intermittent "stuck key" problem in some games.
<br/>
- Direct file read to EGA memory is now supported (f.ex. in "Heimdall").
<br/>
- Implemented a number of previously missing opcodes.
