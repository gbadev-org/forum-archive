    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Merry Christmas and happy holidays!  Announcing fileNinja, our simple ftp client.
<br/>
<br/>
Decided it was time to at least release a binary for our ftp client developed over fall quarter of this year by myself and two other students.  There is a lot of work to be done yet to get this to release quality, but as of now you can connect to and download files remotely from any ftp server on the internet for which you have credentials.
<br/>
<br/>
You must have your wireless settings saved to the firmware for this to function, done using a retail game.  Upon booting the program, a connection is established from the firmware settings.  
<br/>
<br/>
Usage is pretty simple.  The windows are draggable with the touch screen.  Swap the ds screens using the control in the upper right hand corner of the touch screen.  Change fields for the login credentials by hitting enter, this cycles through the different text boxes and allows you to input from the keyboard.  Once everything is entered click connect.  From here, navigating the directory structures is simple, double tap on directories to change to them (they are highlighted white).  Download files by selecting them on the remote listing, navigate to where you want to download on the local side and simply click the &lt; button.  Multiple file download is supported, but be aware the gui freezes while download is running and if the file is large it could take quite some time.
<br/>
<br/>
This uses the Woopsi gui development system and a modified version of ftplib.  I am sure there are bugs that we have not found yet so please feel free to submit bug reports / suggestions here (until we get a more centralized location for this up and running).  Tested so far on the Cyclo DS Evolution and the R4.  
<br/>
<br/>
Known bugs:
<br/>
<br/>
-Directories containing a large number of files/directories (somewhere around 400+) the program freezes when changing to them
<br/>
-Upload is broken and the button is disabled, currently trying to determine if it is with the ftplib or based in the dswifi library.
<br/>
-Handling failed connections is not very elegant.  It just hangs.  Will be fixed soon.  For now, make sure you can connect successfully with other homebrew / retail games!
<br/>
-Some ftp sites have long welcome messages.  We have not yet handled this and it will probably hang if you try to connect to one of these sites.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Features currently under development or that have the possibility of being added:
<br/>
<br/>
-Download speeds are pretty slow (~15kbps).  You don't want to download any really large files unless you have a lot of time to spare.  So, speeding this up would be great.  Would love suggestions on how to do this (once we get the source cleaned up a bit for release)
<br/>
-A download progress bar is buggy at the moment and therefore disabled, look to see it added later.
<br/>
-More ftp command functionality, file delete, directory creation, file / directory rename... etc (locally and remotely).  Suggestions here are welcomed.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe the speed problem lies in the dswifi lib. No one has ever been able to get speeds over 15 KBps. Sgstair has not been able to get higher speeds from it for some reason. Try asking him why the speeds are so slow.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No kidding?  I had no idea dslinux could get downloads that fast.  Unfortunately there are other bugs with the wifi driver in dslinux and many people have connection issues (including myself).  I tried to actually dig into the code a bit last summer, but discovered it was well beyond my level to fix.  Interesting enough then, sounds like it might be an implementation issue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yep, thanks for the report, but this was a known issue already and was listed above in my original post, look for it to be fixed soon.  It's actually the number of elements, not just directories.  So, lots of files + directories and it will freeze.  It's a fairly simple fix, we just need to get some time to take care of it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm wondering if a lot of these issues are with the dhcpc client included in DSLinux.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I edited my post to be more clear in stating that the bug exists with directories too.  I guess I get so used to the linux/unix world where files and directories are essentially treated as the same thing.  :)<br/>_________________<br/>fileNinja - <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/fileninja/" target="_blank">https://sourceforge.net/projects/fileninja/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
