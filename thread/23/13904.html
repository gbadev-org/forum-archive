MIDIPad DS is an Kaoss Pad-like application for the Nintendo DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
It sends both X and Y positions as MIDI CCs and also a CC that is at 127 when the screen is pressed, and 0 when it's released.
<br/>
<br/>
You will need the DSMidiWifi server to use it, that can be found on <a href="http://dsmidiwifi.tobw.net/" target="_blank">http://dsmidiwifi.tobw.net/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a video demo :

 I have that installed, but am unsure how to configure things so that I can load up a sample or sample and mess with them as you demostrated in the Youtube video.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I added a few things to the released version : 
<br/>
- Reduced amount of messages sent, hopefully it will prevent the program from stopping sending messages. Now The program only sends X and Y positions and the Press state of the stylus when the position of the stylus moves from the precedent position
<br/>
- A and B can now be set to "Hold", that way if you press it it will send 127, and if you press again it will send 0. When the hold mode isn't pressed, it sends 127 on a NewPress, and 0 on a released
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT : and I'll post a tutorial video on Youtube as soon as I'll have the 0.1 final version ready</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I also had the problem that the DS suddenly stopped sending messages, but it went away with an update of libnds that changed some things with the IRQ handling.
<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to future updates and (hint, hint) a source release :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've bought a DS again, I don't have a flashcart yet but I put my nose in devKitPro again. Also, I lost the sources of the program, but I don't think it will need a lot of work to do it again.
<br/>
<br/>
I've had new ideas of features to add to it, that's what pushed me into buying a DS. More about that later.
<br/>
<br/>
But first I need to figure out why I can't use the libdsmi functions :(
<br/>
I put the libdsmi.a and libdsmi.h in the libnds directory, I think the builder finds the libdsmi.h but then it says "undefined function 'dsmi_connect'".

I figured it out. I had to modify the makefile, link the library, and at the good place (before -ldswifi9). It's been 3 years since I touched a makefile.
<br/>
I can work now !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here are a few things I'm working on :
<br/>
- 12 MPC-like Pads, with velocity, maybe aftertouch, and other features I'm thinking about.
<br/>
- Slider knobs with feedback from the software.
<br/>
- Customisable parameters : CC/Note numbers, max/min values, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have other interesting ideas, tell me. 
<br/>
I'm also willing to do something special with Ableton Live. If you're familiar with Live API and Python, then you could help me to do a MIDI Remote Script, more evolved than the simple txt file you can easily do for Live.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
