<br/>
<br/>
Well this is my first homebrew game :)
<br/>
<br/>
It's a 2 player game you can play during boring lectures ^_^
<br/>
the objective is to get to the goal on either side of the field (the one with the moving cube in your colour is the one you have to hit) 
<br/>
and if you hit a point where you hit another line you "bounce" and you can put down an extra line.
<br/>
if the screen goes red, red player wins.
<br/>
green is the same but (guess what?) green player wins :p
<br/>
and blue means your stuck and noone wins (or whatever you want to happen anyway) 
<br/>
press B to restart
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!
<br/>
