    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. I have just uploaded to my blog a new game that I made for the DS. IT is a port of Sokoban (yes, another one) in 3D and it allows you to load set of levels from your flash card.
<br/>
<br/>
There is also a version for PC available.
<br/>
<br/>
It shoud work on every flash card as I finally fixe the problem I was having with R4 in Gea vs CoDOS. You have to patch it with DLDI to be able to load levels.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you like it.<br/>_________________<br/>-----

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">what did you have to do to get the R4 to work correctly? I am having problems with R4 and M3 simply cards - I think that they use the same driver. Is there something special that needs to be done to make these cards work?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wasn't calling glInit() and that was causing my games not working on those flash cards.
<br/>
<br/>
Luckily with the last version of the libnds if you forget to call glInit() it won't work in any card and thanks to that I discovered the problem. I hope it's the same problem for you<br/>_________________<br/>-----

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It sounds like an initialization problem; Maybe some vars that you think are initialized to 0 are not or something like that. That will explain that ramdonly behaviour

<br/>
About, Rokoban. Is it working ok in all flash cards, guys? I haven't received any complains this time so I hope it's fine :)<br/>_________________<br/>-----
