    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="http://deadketchup.kyuran.be/2007/01/28/penkods-v01a/" target="_blank">Penko DS</a> </span> is a new MSX 2 emulator programmed by Kyuran, the author of <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=12025" target="_blank">Croco DS</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
0.1 alpha release features :
<br/>
<br/>
- A resize mode to manage the various resolutions of the MSX.
<br/>
- DLDI support
<br/>
- rom and dsk supports
<br/>
- sound (with same issues than Croco Ds)
<br/>
<br/>
Copy rom in the root of your card on in roms/msx directories, use DLDI to patch the .nds.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a very early release, so I guess it's OK if it doesn't work on all hardwares yet! I didn't manage to make it work on my M3 DS. I read there are issues with M3 Simply and G6 too. But people with supercard SD should be able to use it.

Anyways, keep an eye on this one. It took only a couple of weeks for Kyuran to make the best Amstrad CPC emulator available and I'm quite convinced this emu will be the next gem in MSX emulation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thx for posthing this , will try it later for sure,
<br/>
<br/>
i never know gradius 2 exist, i always though that life force was gradius 2 :s
<br/>
<br/>
Edit :
<br/>
Emu seems to works fine, nemesis 1 works with noisy sound, and a little bit to fast.
<br/>
<br/>
- nemesis 2 and 3 won't work at all, mario 2 seems to works fine but is crap.
<br/>
- I hope that this emu will be continue , great work so far!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Quick translation of the new features :
<br/>
<br/>
- speed improvements. Many games now have 100% speed.
<br/>
- mode 2 transparencies corrected
<br/>
- files shouldn't appear twice in the gamelist anymore
<br/>
- DLDI support and sound should be better
<br/>
<br/>
DLDI support is indeed much better. I can now launch PenkoDS with my M3 SD and it's just... great!
<br/>
<br/>
I've just tried a bunch of games : Vampire Killer (aka the very first Castlevania), Pacman and Bombjack... it's really amazing!
