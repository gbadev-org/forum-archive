    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if you're talking about pirated software (i read "nes or snes roms"), be ashured that this is the wrong place! you better change the content of your post or else you'll most likely be banned.
<br/>
<br/>
or didn't you know that talking about that stuff is *not allowed* in this forum and nobody will tollerate that? now you know. staring at the screen for two hours would have been more effective if you knew how to search for information. i hope nobody is so dumb and posts links to any "r0mZ".
<br/>
<br/>
by the way: by what measurement is two hours "long", compared to the "value" you get by downloading software illegally off the internet and having "fun" for days (and probably causing some companys losses, effectively killing them slowly - that happens quite often - less developpers, more crappy EA games about sports and WW2 [i personally find it quite perverse to suck so much profit out of such a tragic event! EA is the devil - for canning thrill kill, closing westwood and much more!])?
<br/>
i know this is about the "old" games... but illegal is illegal is illegal... and forum rules are forum rules are... you get it?
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;FLAME MODE&gt;</span>
<br/>
you pretty much deserve the flaming for asking such a thing after just two crappy hours of poking around with your finger in your nose!
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;/FLAME MODE&gt;</span>
<br/>
<br/>
i say: <span style="font-weight: bold">ban him</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
... but if you were talking about *something* else (like *homebrew* roms - you better start expressing yourself in a clear and understandable way [writing "2" for "to" is *not* clear]), i'm sorry, nevermind!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
