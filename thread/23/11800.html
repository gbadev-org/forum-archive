    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">This project is discontinued! There is no need to ask whether bugs can be fixed or features can be added, until I continue the project - IF I ever will, that is.</span></span>
<br/>

<span style="color: red">I know about the consequences, but you can still remind me, if you need to.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I've been building an iPod-look-a-like music player for the DS. I have implemented the ClickWheel(TM) completely, and now I'll be working on the menu, and then I'll add playback of the MP3 and OGG formats.
<br/>
<br/>
I know that Apple won't like this. I'm thinking of making the player -skinnable- and use a different default skin. Also, I could release it with a message like: "If you like this software, buy an iPod! We LOVE APPLE!"
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.uploadline.com/line/250245/2_1_pods.nds.html" target="_blank">Download Page</a> (wip-build, showcases the ClickWheel implementation)
<br/>
It still runs on emulators right now, but will not later.
<br/>
- Use touchscreen to control the ClickWheel.
<br/>
- Press X to reset to bootmenu.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy, you almost have an iPod ;)

<br/>
well, thats exactly what the guys working on DS Player are doing now. Tho i cant access their forum anymore so i dont know of the process but the interface looked great.
<br/>
<br/>
But the main features of a music player that we are lacking for the current bunch (moonshell, dsorg, etc) are playlists and equaliser.
<br/>
<br/>
But actually i had another idea. You know when u listen to music on winamp right? You get to install lyric plugins right? And everytime you change song, the lyrics for that song would be displayed bcoz the plugin connects to the database contributed by users and etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there by any chance this could be implemented thru wifi with a similar concept to DSLiveWeather (which gets info from <a href="http://www.weather.com" target="_blank">www.weather.com</a>) by using a current winamp plugin such as Leo's Lyrics's database for example?
<br/>
<br/>
I mean, you could use bottom screen for scrolling and stuff and the top screen for displaying tracks and when u press a button, it will toggle between playlist and lyrics. that would be neat.
<br/>
<br/>
I might sound a little far fetch here but it would be nice anyway. Some other nice programs such as Patrinator's DSAmp (control winamp from DS) are also very nice but i have not heard anything about it since the first release.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps i dream too much. Afterall, im just a fussy user that has not contributed anything to the scene anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Swap screens would be nice for times when the wheel's awkward or if you just don't feel like it - clickable file listings like with Moonshell. 
<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, your brightness/reset code.. don't know why more devs haven't thrown that in, I love it in DSLiveWeather.

Back to the pod interface, I like it in hardware, and it's similar onscreen, but more interface options (like quick buttons for 5,10,30 sec skips, or something) would be handy too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the interface looks great.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think you should dismiss your idea for a clickwheel and go for a regular scrolling bar, every other player has a scrolling bar, your project is unique in that it has a clickwheel.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry about lawsuits, as long as you don't give away personal details and only refer to yourself with your alias, Lick, there is no way to file a lawsuit against you, don't be intimidated into giving up your original idea, this is homebrew, we can't be bother with legality :)
<br/>
<br/>
But I do think your idea to make it skinable with a default skin that will look nothing like the iPOD, and a separate download of a custom skin with the iPOD design is a good idea, it can even be created by an anonymous user, so nobody can touch you.
<br/>
<br/>
To add to the feature requests:
<br/>
<br/>
- Lyrics, already been said but I want to add my support, I think they should appear one line at a time on top of the regular interface, so you don't have to press a certain button to toggle to lyrics mode, it should just detect when lyrics are available and show only the current line.
<br/>
<br/>
- Something that is very lacking in Moonshell: Random play across all folders, I'd like to be able to store my OGG files in folders inside my Music folder in the root, each band will have a folder of its own and its songs will go there, but I would like to be able to random play from all of the folders inside Music, and not just from inside the currently selected folder.
<br/>
<br/>
- Another idea would be to be able to put a JPG file in each band's folder with a photo of the band, or, if divided by albums, the cover art of the album. and the player will show it on the upper screen along with the lyrics (if available).
<br/>
<br/>
- BassBoost, I don't know if the DS hardware can play deep bass sounds, but if used with headphones it would be great to be able to enhance the bass, I like to listen to my music with full bass.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much for your efforts, the program is shaping up very nicely.

I think it'd be nice if the main menu was just folders you could make, in a directory on your card... ex:
<br/>
Drive Letter:\This Programs Name\Files\Put Folders here which would be the main menu
<br/>
<br/>
Then you can make it the way an ipod is (which would be default), or you could change, add, and delete folders ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Just make settings by default as the last item in the main menu (so if you click on a folder, settings won't be there any longer ;))<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://prdesign.co.nr" target="_blank">http://prdesign.co.nr</a>

Unlike most other players, the iPod does not play songs copied into ordinary folders using the standard USB mass storage interface. The iPod plays only those MP3s that are copied into an invisible folder and listed by name in an invisible file of proprietary format.
<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the criticism of iPod comes from the vertical <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tying" target="_blank">tying</a> between iPod players and the iTunes Store. Songs from iTunes Store have limitations on the number of computers on which they can be listened to, and they can't be listened to on anything but an Apple? iPod? player, an Apple? Macintosh? computer, or a computer running a recent Microsoft? Windows? operating system. It's also difficult to make fair-use parody mash-ups of songs from the iTunes Store.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cool idea, but it can be used much better.
<br/>
<br/>
First off, the circular wheel is silly on a square touch screen. You could better take advantage of a scroll zone, seen on many laptop touch pads.
<br/>
<br/>
The bottom screen could also be used for album art and other info while the top perpetually displays folders and such.
<br/>
<br/>
Or, a spectrum analyzer, or some other cool thing. Button control shouldn't be left out entirely, but the touch interface is a nice touch.
<br/>
<br/>
I know you've got the whole iPod clone thing going on, but I think the concept itself is better played to the DS's strengths and equipment than throwing some cool stuff away to better fit the look and functionality of a iPod.
<br/>
<br/>
Also note the scroll wheel doesn't work without the stylus if you use a harder screen protector.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fireslash.net" target="_blank">FireSlash.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

"Except Apple has a patent on the touch-wheel interface, and there's no blanket exemption for non-commercial use in the patent laws." 
<br/>
im posting this to show my support but also to lay that myth to rest 
<br/>
<br/>
even if they have a patent on the click wheel 
<br/>
they have filed for a patent application but the haven't gotten it on number 20060026535 
<br/>
which is a 
<br/>
"mode-based graphical user interfaces for touch sensitive input devices", which generates and operates virtual GUI control elements depending on where the user touches the screen."

this was a pending patent and i believe it still is

There's a limit to how loud the sound hardware can be made. When you want to go above that limit, you can increase the volume of the sound data, but unless it is a very quiet sound, there will be distortion. It's the same as increasing the volume in the pre-amp in the EQ in Winamp.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ifyou could do that it would be immense but simple steps are what are needed images and music. MPEG 4 compression is a high aim and if you do suceed in implementing it there will be major reprocussions and hopefully showing the DS's true power.

<br/>
but, on a lighter note, I really like how this project is progressing and hope that it will progress into an mp4 player (fingers crossed).<br/>_________________<br/>White DS --- Supercard SD --- Passcard ---

A few comments: Like someone said already, you might want to try how 90 degrees rotated controls play... Holding DS just like with Brain Age (perhaps even having options if you're right or left handed), touch screen for the interface and main data, other screen for the playlists and secondary data. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also, when implementing the actual player, not just the interface, using Moonshell as a backbone would seem like a solid option. Why reinvent the wheel when there's already a player that does most of the wanted features?
<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward how this will turn out. Would use this definitely myself. And perhaps even convince a couple of iPod-loving friends into getting a DS Lite ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

lick.huuf.net is off line for an unknown amount of time. Huuf was hacked or something.

<br/>
This project is merely trying to recreate an iPod. Don't want to change the interface much. 
<br/>
Moonshells source code is the worst ever. I can't make nothing of it. Don't worry, I'll have sound in the next release.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Lick,
<br/>
<br/>
Looking really good, Using DS-X with flashme v7, I get a green battery in the top left corner, and a green battery in the top right hand corner of the menu box.
<br/>
<br/>
But I also get a 1/2 battery indictaor in the top left hand corner.... just to the right of the first one.
<br/>
<br/>
There are 3 little dots above the battery at the top left hand corner (Assuming charge indicator)
<br/>
<br/>
Looks great though....
<br/>
<br/>
I like Bleepz as a name as well

Are you using Tremor in low accuracy or high accuracy mode? The option for either one would be nice. High accuracy requires more CPU, so the maximum quality level that it can play is lower (depending on how well you optimize it, Moonshell can do ~128kbps), but it does sound nicer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But my songs are very very SLOW ! The sounds is very bad (don't take it bad... ! ;) )

The same OGG files are almost perfect with Moonshell... But I believe that it uses another decoder...(plugin).

(For all you people trying to decode with Tremor, add -D_ARM_ASSEM_ to your CFLAGS in the Makefile. It speeds up the decoding by <span style="font-weight: bold">a lot</span>. Also, remove the ARCH option, which contains -mthumb. Don't know if you need -mthumb-interwork though.)
<br/>
<br/>
But I still can't seem to remove all of the clicking and noise.. Anyone know what's up with that? I think it has to do with the ARM9 commanding the ARM7 to switch buffers, but there is a delay? I tried disabling the Vblank interrupt, but still I could hear an unusual jam. Like 'laaaaaaaa' becomes  'laa aaa aaa'.

Currently I've got MP3 playback as well, but I need a way to buffer the over-decoded parts. Will release preview again soon.

MP3 and OGG playback are both working, but gaps/clicks/noises are still there. Don't worry, I'm going to fix all of that even if it takes meh loif!!

For the bug report:
<br/>
The Program crashed when it tried to display a MP3 with an umlaut in the song title ID3  tag. It crashed on several other occasions, too, but that was rather random and I unfortunately couldn't replicate these yet :( . It *could* be possible that german songs were involved there, too, but I'm not sure about it.

Thanks for reporting that! I will fix it asap. 
<br/>
I will add an option to close the lid but still keeping the sound. The way it currently works is actually better for the batterylife. (DSOrganize does the same, and so do professional games. Only Moonshell doesn't do it..)

It'd be up to you whether you put the scanner on the PC and then transfer the DB to the SD card (like iTunes), or do it on the DS. If you did it on the DS, it'd probably be very slow.

<br/>
<br/>
Is there a specific folder structure I should use to store my files in the memory card?  can I place them anywhere I want? can I have subfolders? how do you get the category, genre, album, artist information? is that stored inside each MP3 itself? or is there a separate file such as the iTunes.XML file?
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be possible to make it so that we can use iTunes to import our CDs and then just copy the entire iTunes folder into the memory card and have it work just like it would on an iPod? That would truly be awesome.  I am not asking to be able to sync with iTunes, just to be able to go into windows explorer and use "Send To" to send the entire iTunes folder to the memory card.  That would rock.
<br/>
<br/>

Hey jmordenata, I don't know why it doesn't work for you, but some SuperCard SD users have reported that some of my other applications (DSLiveWeather..) doesn't work right too. While other users of SC-SD claim that it functions correctly. 
<br/>
So it's a strange problem. Anyway, the current state of LMP isn't something you'd want to use, so why bother? =/<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wasnt sure if you were aimming this question at me, I am using Flashme and a M3 mini-SD... It loads everything correctly but when its playing a song there is no sound.... not sure if this is one of the common bugs out there.

Thanks.  I am just getting started though, so I can't say that I'm going to pick up LMP...  I'm going to start going thru some tutorials and look at the LMP/DS Doom/DLDI code.  Who knows where I'll go at that point.

But what happens when you put video on youtube...aaarh, it's available to public :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey Lick, great job on the media player - it's great since DSOrganize and Moonshell simultaneously failed on me. But here's my problem - I'm using a EZFLASH4/mSD, and the music starts great, but then once the black screen (power save? I dunno) comes on, it just turns off. Any way to get around this? Thanks :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Exactly the same problem.. The song plays for a few seconds, and then the light shuts down, and it freezes :(

<br/>
I'm using a supercard SD, with a "normal" NDS. Perhaps you did a mistake with coding the backlight for dslite ?

Did anything happen to those homebrew makers or just a cease and desist order? It doesn't matter about the Pod name, I doubt any court will enforce a ruling against someone using a variation of the word Pod because of fair use.
<br/>
<br/>
Cisco Systems owns iPhone as a trademark and they are going to go to blows with Apple over it. I can guarantee that Apple's legal team, as large as it is, will be spending more time and energy dealing with that than anything else.
<br/>
<br/>
In the final analysis, it's Lick's project and he can do whatever he wants. I just think it is a great idea but support his decision 100%. I just wanted to put my two cents in and let him know that there are people out there that appreciate his hard work.

I find very your project interressant! I tested it, it is really well!

Except that there is no sound for my mp3! However, in video on YouTube, there is sound! Is this normal?
