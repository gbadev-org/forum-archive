<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone started an XCom 1 clone for DS?
<br/>
I ask because I've been working on an X-Com clone. It's a clone because I am not using the original source code but will be as close to the original as possible including using the original game data. 
<br/>
<br/>
I can currently load MAP,PCK,TAB,MCD and LBM files, can load in and create tilesets, render Battlescape maps (where each 10x10 or 20x20 area is randomly chosen from a set of maps depending on terrain type) with up to 4 height layers (the same as the original game) and of course show vehicles like the Avenger and UFO's. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway you can currently show different heights (which displays like the original game) and scroll around the maps with either the d-pad or by touching near the screen boundaries. Animating tiles work and I'm currently working on doors and such. Here are some cheesy JPG screenshots running in an emulator (it works on the real hardware too):

Lighting and "fog of war" are not in yet and the top screen is currently used for debugging but will be used (most likely) to display the map. Since I'm using the GPU as a fast hardware blitter, lighting/"fog of war" will be pretty easy and shouldn't have any impact on speed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you referred at all to the UFO2000 project for any help on this. They've implemented a multi-player version of UFO on PC, but they seem to have stalled when it comes to handling single-player.

Hopefully you'll have better luck, as I think X-Com on the DS would be insane :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

Good plan. I would imagine the UFO2000 sources are a bit messy and also not suitable for single-player :-)

    <h4>#132088 - blue_knight - Sat Jun 23, 2007 7:50 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">An update. I have tile selection working on the map, doors working and a work in progress version of the UI. I provided some screenshots showing the UI, tile selection and working door. I need to resize the UI, but would prefer to use the original art without actually shrinking it. I'm thinking of removing the weapon slots on the sides and doing something else for  the weapon select. I also should compact the height somehow in order to have more map space. What do you guys/gals think?
<br/>
<br/>
Edit - looking at it again, the verticle space isn't that much smaller then the game, you lose about as much space with this UI (percentage wise) as horizontal space (due to screen width difference). So I'll probably keep the height of the current UI and just put in alternatives for the weapon select on the sides.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also working on getting the soldiers/aliens working, as I said before, I'll post some screenshots of them soon :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I already solved it on my end, I left the buttons alone, shifted the whole thing to the left. Then I resized the weapon window slightly - the original weapon art should still fit. At the bottom there will be 2 small buttons: L/R for either hand so you can select which weapon hand you are looking at. I'll just default it to the hand with the primary weapon - alot of weapons are two handed and even when they are not the primary weapon is used most of the time. So you'll rarely have to switch to use grenades or other off-hand equipment. The resizing of the weapon window is done in the program after loading it so the original data is still used. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestions and mockups though, I appreciate the effort :)

<br/>
I'm working on an XCom-style game myself, though I'll be going the FF Tactics route and using 3D for the terrain and environment, and sprites for the characters. Though to be fair, I haven't really started looking for a programmer yet, mainly focusing on the art assets and game mechanics design for now.
<br/>
<br/>
Definitely looking forward to seeing this project progress. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Shtroodle, Reppa's right, XCom works in dosbox, and there's also a win95 version that runs in XP with a patch (get it from Home of the Underdogs).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#132969 - blue_knight - Mon Jul 02, 2007 8:40 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another Update:
<br/>
I just recently finished the entity rendering system. The problem I ran into is that many entities in XCom (all the agents and many of the aliens) are made up of many individual sprites including individual arms, legs, several torso varieties, etc. Then there is a version of each of these for each of 8 directions and for many frames of animation for each of those directions. Obviously this can yield 100's of individual sprites just for xcom agents (for one set of armor) not couting having to store multiple types of aliens, civilians, etc. Now in the original RLE-like format this is only a couple of kilobytes of data but stored as individual sprites it takes up considerably more [even using my current atlasing system]...
<br/>
<br/>
So I wrote another system where the RLE-like image data is stored in memory and when entities need to be updated they are rasterized (by the CPU) into a VRAM cache (part of an atlas texture) which is used to render the sprites as single quads in the proper rendering order. Since I store enough space in the cache for all the sprites in the level, I only need to rasterize the current moving sprite and update that small part of the texture on any frame which has very little effect on the framerate. 
<br/>
<br/>
At any rate this system will handle all the entities: agents, aliens, civilians, etc. So now that is out of the way and I've started working on the gameplay: selecting agents, turning them, crouching, etc. Soon I should have them running around fighting aliens :)

Now I'm working on movement (agents, aliens and civilians). You can already crouch and change facing, I'm working on the actual movement across the map.

BlueKnight, if you need some help with the game logic, etc on the GeoScape side of the game, perhaps you can consult the people working on UFO: Alien Invasion (It's an OSS UFO remake using the Quake2 engine). I think there project has reached a fairly playable state.

Anyway thanks for the interest. I now have agents moving around using the proper time units and energy to move.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A small update: Well photobucket is down so I can't get you a screenshot of aliens but... I can move the agents around which uses TU (Time Units) and EU (Energy Units) properly for moving, crouching, turning, etc. Full collisions are implemented. Turns are implemented (including things like doors closing and regenerating some amount of your energy based on your agent's starting TU). Animations are mostly implemented, I'm working out some kinks in the agent animations. Moving aliens are implemented which move around based on the pathing data built into the maps. 
<br/>
<br/>
So next up is to finish the animation/pathing issues. Once that is done I'll implement shooting and damage (both agents and aliens). Then I'll handle lighting/"fog of war", most of the necessary code is already in place. 
<br/>
<br/>
By the end of the week basic tactical combat should be finished (inventory, AI, etc) with a few weapons. Then I'll get the core base/worldview mode working and then progress both modes in parallel so I no longer have to hack in mission data and can more naturally implement new features on both sides. The key is to build solid foundations for each mode, then I just implement and test them together after that point.

I shed tears for you, my friend. X-Com combines planet-wide resource and base management as well as research trees into alien technology (yes, much like Civilization), along with turn-based fog-of-war combat. On the combat side of things, Rebelstar Tactical Command for the GBA is the closest approximation, because it was made by the same people, but its probably less likely you've heard of that one. You could say its similar to Fire Emblem, Advance Wars, or FF Tactics, just a heck of a lot more complex. Instead of each unit being able to move 5 squares, etc., each soldier has time units. Each action they perform, whether its moving a space, changing out their rifle for a grenade, kneeling down to take cover, or taking a rapid fire spread shot at an alien, takes a certain amount of time units. When the units are used up, they can't move anymore until the next turn. You really have to be cautious and strategic, as the game is extremely difficult. There are also some light RPG elements, as each battle your soldiers survive increases their stamina, hit point, firing accuracy, max time units, etc. It can be quite heartbreaking to watch your super soldier, whom you've molded and trained over the past 10 battles, get whacked in the back by a sneaky alien. You'll find yourself recruiting rookies constantly to fill in the recently vacated spots in your troop roster.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps explain it, a bit. Even if you've never tried X-Com before, its still a fantastic experience the first time. I pick it up through DOS-Box every year or so, and it never ceases to amaze me at how well its held up over the past decade.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well-put.  If the person in question is a PC-gamer, I might refer them to similar combat situations like Jagged Alliance or Fallout.  Despite bearing little resemblance to X-COM, they do have some of the same trends.  
<br/>
<br/>
It's the complexity of X-COM I admire.  I've been playing UFO:ET and miss many of the options that were available to me in 1993.  
<br/>
<br/>
Take this scenario, for instance.  I could hunt down objectives, or dig in and wait for the aliens to approach - setting up occasion smoke screens if I'm taking fire, proximity grenades all around (not only causing damage, but alerting me if something's approaching that I can't see), setting armed charges on personnel so I can send one in charging - knowing that if he gets wasted, the alien and whole building is going down (Predator-style. ;] ), or securing an area aliens are approaching, setting a charge for 5 turns (long enough to get everyone out) and demolishing the area as I leave.  
<br/>
<br/>
I went back and played it after playing UFO:ET, UFO:AI (work in progress clone), UFO-Afterlight (and their other games), and it still holds up despite the graphics (320x240 that weren't great at the time) and interface quirks. I ended up going back through the whole thing on Genius level - part nostalgia and part quality gaming experience.  
<br/>
<br/>
If this can be fully realized on DS, it'd be the epitome of homebrew gaming in my opinion.<br/>_________________<br/>DSL Onyx w/ R4 &amp; 1GB Kingston SD. FlashMe'd v.7</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ah yes, which tactical approach to use? I remember one of my favorite strategies was to put a few soldiers with good strength in the back and give them rocket launchers. Then, after I had set up a perimeter around the ship, I would bring them out and have them fire helter-skelter into all of the nearby farmhouses, clearing out the walls and revealing many a hiding alien. Then, wha-la, my snipers take them out, one by one. Also, I would use the kamikaze-proximity-charge rush into an alien ship, except I would give the cannon-fodder rookie a rocket launcher, and have him launch one into the nearest wall, obliterating himself and all of the alien scum with him. Only problem with that is you tended to destroy all of the nice alien alloys that you could then sell for a profit after the battle. Heh heh.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just joined the forum and came across this thread, I remember a few years ago (well about 10 or so now!) I worked in a games company, and my uncle who was a huge fan of the XCom series suggested to the bosses about the game and they contacted the original company who wrote Xcom and they said to send them an outline etc.
<br/>
<br/>
We knocked up a story line (my uncle wrote it and it involved time travel which we thought was the next step etc, and his story was excellent) and even created some graphics and also code to show the abilities of what we could do etc (I THINK I still have an animated GIF of one of the suits we created, will see if I can dig it out)
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately for us, it was at a time when the original software house decided they thought the next step forward for the series was 3D, so we never got the go ahead for the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Look forward to seeing a playable version of the original game, and im pretty sure that if my uncles lad has a DS, my uncle would go and get an R4 card just so he could play it!!!<br/>_________________<br/>Cheers,

Fun Fact: No less than 8 people have made their first post in this thread, with the majority of them ONLY making posts in this thread. I don't know if that is the norm for other homebrew projects, but I think it just goes to show how freakin excited people are over X-Com on their DS.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">BK, I have an actual honest-to-God legitimate question this time. :) I noticed in your intro post that you said you were creating a "clone" and not simply retooling the existing code to work on the DS. From your screenshots and comments, it appears that you're implementing the art, tilesets, and sound straight from the original game, which is fantastic. 
<br/>
<br/>
But how does it work when you begin to implement the AI and game mechanics? If its a "clone," then are you looking at the original source code and figuring out how they did it? Or are you just attempting to approximate the AI using your own code? For example, there were 5 levels of difficulty in the original X-Com game. Lets say, I played a game through on the fourth level (I think it was 'genius') in the original. When you are finished with your version, if I play a game through on 'genius,' will it act and feel just like it did before? Or will it be significantly different? (I hope my question makes sense)
<br/>
<br/>
Just curious as to how this whole process works. As always, you're the man.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

first, i wanna thank blue knight for undertaking this.  when this is finished, i'll be buying a DS specifically because of it.
<br/>
<br/>
now onto my reason for signing up so i could post.  i have a question.  blue knight, you say this is going to be a direct clone.  i'm wondering if you'll update the game with some of the features that XCOMUTIL has that remove some of the tedious aspects of the game -- namely, that the original UFO didn't remember which soldier was equipped with what equipment between missions.  it would be nice not to have to outfit each soldier everytime, heh.  also the stat strings would be helpful, or you could go the TFTD route and allow the player to access the soldier's stats in the equip screen.
<br/>
<br/>
basically, i'm wondering if these modern conveniences will make it into your DS remake?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">^ That always was kind of a pain to have to equip everyone everytime they were on a mission.  It always got a jumbled up and you had to unequip some to give the other soldiers their weapons, and you would run out of space, and all that.  I didn't know they have tools (or mods) to fix that.  That's pretty sweet.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know anything about soldier stats either.  Is this like kills, number of missions, etc?  That seems really awesome.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you can look here for all the fixes/changes XCOMUTIL made to the game:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://members.aol.com/stjones/xcomutil/" target="_blank">http://members.aol.com/stjones/xcomutil/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
the stat strings was an addition to the soldier's name.  XCOMUTIL would add indicators automatically so that the player would have information about each soldier's stats while in the equip screen.  so if a soldier was strong, say with a strength of 40, you'd want to know that when in the equip screen so you could give this soldier the heavy weapons, like a rocket launcher.  XCOMUTIL would add a string at the end of the soldier's name to reflect that, so the name "Otto Zander" would become "Otto Zander/H" where "H" is the indicator set in the .cfg file for soldiers with a strength of 40 or more.  different letters are set for different stats, and all can be customized in the .cfg file.  this way you can know who is strong, who has fast reactions, who has excellent firing accuracy, etc, so all your soldiers will be equipped properly before you start the mission.
<br/>
<br/>
i recommend XCOMUTIL to any XCOM player, even if you don't use any of the other changes, at least get it for the difficulty bug fix.  without that fix, even if you select "superhuman" difficulty, the game will always revert back to "beginner."  it's a bug that was never fixed, but XCOMUTIL does fix it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#136661 - derrickec - Fri Aug 03, 2007 5:06 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I used XCOMUTIL the last time I pulled out the game, and it was a fantastic addition. Not only does it fix the difficulty bug, remember soldiers' equipment, and add stat strings, but you can adjust a lot of other settings as well. For example, you can have the alien ships be randomly generated, instead of having one of the 8 pre-designed ones. Admittedly, you end up exploring some fairly bizarre looking UFOs, but it does add a nice touch. 
<br/>
<br/>
XCOMUTIL also buffs up a couple of the more useless weapons, like pistols and heavy explosives. 
<br/>
<br/>
All in all, its a nice fix (the stat strings and ability to save what equipment went with what soldier were the most important additions), but by no means are all of the little bells and whistles crucial. I would be happy with just the game as is. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#136666 - priest22 - Fri Aug 03, 2007 5:32 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Illegal, thanks for posting the info about the XCOM util - I had never heard of it till now!
<br/>
<br/>
Since you posted a bit of handy info and some ideas, I wanted to put in my two cents as well:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  I'd like to show my support for this project in a little more $$$ way - by giving Blue_Knight a few bucks for doing this.  BK - do you have a paypal account?  Would you mind a couple of bucks as way of thanks?  I doubt I'm the only person here who wants to show their appreciation this way.
<br/>
<br/>
2.  The only people who are going to play this game at first are the hardcore XCOM fans (heh heh heh), but there are going to be gamers exposed to XCOM for the first time.  I would like to suggest two things along these lines (After the game is playable and we all get our XCOM fix first of course) - 
<br/>
<br/>
A.  Somebody here has to have an good, original copy of the XCOM manual (Mostly for the little pictures, the text can always be re written).  As a sort of sub project that we fans could help out with - we could break up the manual so that you could read through it on the DS.  What I'm envisioning is on the top screen you have a picture of say, one of the basic handguns copied from the manual.  On the touch screen is the text associated with said gun, and a forward and back arrow to go to the next or previous page.  Clicking and dragging with the stylus would let you scroll down the text till you'd finished the entry.  It's a little bit putzy I know, but I think it would be invaluable to new people we expose to this wonderful game.
<br/>
<br/>
B.  Have a tutorial level like Theme Park - where all it truly is is a prerecorded game.  This would be easy to do because all it would need is some text bubbles telling the person what the game is doing during the tutorial, and a small stylus icon to show what's being selected at the time.
<br/>
<br/>
I personally don't have coding ability, but I'm thinking that more than a few of the XCOM lovers here might be able to do this?
<br/>
<br/>
Whadda ya think BK?  How about the rest of you?  Sound like good ideas or garbage?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you wish to make a list of desired fixes/enhancements feel free. They may not make it in and the initial version probably won't have them but I am planning an enhanced version afterwards (for features such as multiplayer). So there will be a "true-to-the-original" version and an enhanced version afterwards. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I've started on the GeoScape part of the game, I really need to put together an update :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#136737 - blue_knight - Sat Aug 04, 2007 7:50 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now I'll answer some of your questions (sorry for the delay):
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;derrickec&gt; you asked how I'm making a clone. I have absolutely no access to any source code for XCom, but to be honest I wanted to rewrite it anyway for multiple reasons. I am approximating the AI and mechanics based on my own experience and information available on the net. I use values from data files where possible to help, for example the map pieces each have waypoints that connect together (and between pieces) that aliens and civilians use to patrol - I am using that data. In addition I have the formulas that tell me how the difficulty levels affect damage/health of units, how damage modeling works and things like that. 
<br/>
<br/>
So all this means that I'm confident that this will feel very much like the original XCom - in fact that's why the first version won't have a lot of modern conveniences. But as I've said I'll build an enhanced version afterwards where I can add all these enhancements and both will be seperately available. Of course obvious bugs like the difficulty levels will be fixed in both versions.
<br/>
<br/>
And since this is a full rewrite it's written in C++, the rendering system is made specifically for the DS, I fully understand the code, etc. But that means it takes longer than a source port, unfortunately. But this all started with me wanting to write a isometric tile engine because I wanted to write a graphics/game engine other then 3D for once :) [I have been writing 3D engines/editors/games since before 3D hardware acceleration was available :]
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;priest22&gt; As far as PayPal, if people really want to make donations I won't turn them away BUT I won't take anything until I've delivered the game. Of course I don't expect or even ask for anything because I decided to do this for fun and to explore a console I've only worked on a little (don't worry, see my post above - I've worked on Apple II's, 286's, Commodore64, PSX and so on [all the way to modern hardware] so I'm not a newbie :). But if you (or others) still want to donate after you've played the game, we can set something up :) 
<br/>
<br/>
As for showing the manual in game (on the DS), that can certainly be arranged. It'll probably be put into the enhanced version however. If someone has an online version of the manual (or can put it online) that would help - I no longer have the manual. 
<br/>
<br/>
The tutorial idea was interesting, but I'll hold off on commenting on that for now. If something like that goes in, it'll be pretty low priority right now (but that doesn't mean no, it just means I don't want to consider it yet :)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the enthusiasm :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I have a small update. As I mentioned before I started on the GeoScape World View. Anyway I've been tweaking the interface and sizes (all in code after loading the original data), below you can see the main GeoScape screen on the DS, the big change is that the Time/Date text display is different since that was the easiest area of the interface to resize without graphical quality loss. The globe isn't being rendered yet, I'm working on that now.

Let me know what you think.

And since I never made a real update for the tactical combat, here is an older picture I have with aliens.

<a href="http://i128.photobucket.com/albums/p175/blue_knight66/Aliens1.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I've only implemented one type of alien (shown) and just the base agents (no armor yet), although I do have male and female now. As I progress through the GeoScape I'll update the equipment,aliens, etc. as the equivalent features (research, equipment, etc) get implemented in the GeoScape mode. That way there isn't anymore hacking in mission data and it flows naturally. So once the core GeoScape mode is finished I'll progress both modes in parallel until completion. I'll post more GeoScape screens soon :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As to whether or not its a hoax, I'm no DS homebrewing genius or anything, but everything BK has said so far sounds authentic (as in his experience, what he's doing from a coding standpoint, his knowledge of the game, etc.). I'm guessing that anyone who would actually perpetuate a hoax would 1) not know much about coding for the DS, and 2) wouldn't really know much about the game either. BK doesn't strike me as either of those things. 
<br/>
<br/>
As to having a list of things we'd like to see implemented, as well as a more accessible way for BK to post updates, would starting a wiki for the project be a good idea? I would be happy to spearhead that, if BK thinks it would be beneficial, and if people would enjoy checking that more often than refreshing this forum topic.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#137000 - blue_knight - Tue Aug 07, 2007 7:32 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not currently planning on adding more weapons (so far, although I could change my mind - but definitely not in the core version), although some new features may go into the Enhanced version, such as multiplayer, graphical tweaks like smooth lighting (the core version will use the same tile based lighting found in the original), possibly some other features (such as those done by the XCom untilities). Exactly what will make it hasn't been finalized because I first want to finish the core version (which will match the original as close as possible except for obvious bugs of course).
<br/>
<br/>
As for multiplayer , I haven't finalized any designs yet but I'll give some examples of some possibilities I'm thinking of:
<br/>
<br/>
1) XCom groups fighting each other with their single player game data. If they fight in the field the winner takes the spoils - technology, equipment, possibly prisioners (which are brainwashed and added to your roster complete with abilities). If one attacks one the other's bases and win then they take the base and all the contents and conversely if they lose than the base owner get their spoils (like above). This could track a player's wins and loses, which other players can see. And all of this would be saved in your game (including all the multiplayer stats).
<br/>
<br/>
2) [No saved game data] Two (or more?) sides get some funds and spend money on soldiers and equipment, they then duke it out in various environments. Their could be multiple rounds(?) and after each round they get some money to upgrade and replace soldiers/equipment based on their performance (?)
<br/>
<br/>
3) One (or more?) sides play as sets of aliens and the other side(s?) play as XCom agents. There could be different objectives for each side. For example the aliens could try converting or killing all the civilians and win once that happens and conversely the XCom agents have to protect the civilians and kill the aliens. Or one side against another (kill all). Or XCom agents have to storm the alien base and destroy the core while the aliens try to protect it. That kind of thing.
<br/>
<br/>
Again none of this is finalized, right now the core game comes first.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm just guessing here, but I imagine the time between when BK releases the original version and the time when he releases the enhanced version will be fairly significant. Because of the awesomeness of X-Com and its extreme replayability, you will probably have finished a few games before the enhanced version even comes out.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It depends on how much extra loading code there is. If it's just a small amount, then I don't think the memory will be an issue (remeber we're not actually storing more then is needed, just storing more code for the different loading paths). If memory becomes an issue then I can easily make a simple command line or simple windows GUI based converter. I'm not sure if this is going to be an issue yet but either way an easy to use solution will be presented.

As long as we know which version the save file is, there is no reason not to either be able to load the file anyway (memory permitting) or have a save file converter.

You will love X-Com bro. Although if I were you, I would play X-Com: Terror from the Deep first and then play blue_knights version of X-Com: UFO Defense, that way the original will be more fresh when you start on the DS. Terror from the Deep in my opinion is a better game, but pretty much identical to the original, gameplay wise (other than graphical differences and some larger levels here and there on TFTD, the 2 games really are almost identical, even the technology structure and weapons are basically the same, just different names and looks). I'm just thinking that you could enjoy 2 great games this way instead of just one :). And don't worry about getting bored with it, I am STILL playing these 2 games on and off to this day.
<br/>
<br/>
And blue_knight, if you did run into memory problems, couldn't people just use the RAM expander slot 2 device if it came down to it? I know with the Supercards you can co-mingle the 2 cards to work together.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah that is definately something to think about, I would definately buy a slot-2 cart with RAM if that is the case. How much RAM did the original DOS version take up? I belive the original Quake required like 12 to 16MB of RAM, but they were able to figure out how to squeeze the game into 4MBs for the DS, so maybe there are some things you can shave of or reduce in the code to reduce the program. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also I remember there were some glitches in the original X-Com, especially being able to see enemy units through the roofs of UFOs with soldiers in Flying Suits, and I remember alot of weird bugs with the vision inside bigger UFOs, Do you think you're version will fix some of these issues or are you planning on re-creating this as true to life as possible?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As for memory, the minimum requirements for the game say 4MB I think - although 8 was recommended. At any rate I'm going to try very hard to get the game to fit - the fun of getting it to fit within DS performance and memory constraints is part of the reason I'm doing this to begin with, doing an old-school game like this would be much easier [ie plenty of space and speed] on the PC :) If this means making an external program for save game conversion or whatever that's fine, it's not like I haven't written a windows program before :)
<br/>
<br/>
As for bugs, some are (unfortunately) inherent in the way collisions and tiles were setup. I'll see if I can fix them but they are low priority. Other bugs, like various base item limit issues, I will fix or may not show up at all since I'll be coding it myself. I certainly won't try to introduce an obvious bug, but if it's ambiguous or a gameplay decision (even if people don't all agree with it) then I'll try to match the original.
<br/>
<br/>
However in the enhanced version I'm all for fixing other (non-bug) issues people may have with the original game - within reason :) Does that answer your question?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#137746 - blue_knight - Wed Aug 15, 2007 10:07 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Currently I'm putting together screens, figuring out how best to reduce them (removing 64 pixels from the width and 8 pixels from the height) and implementing the controls. There are a lot of screens, so it'll take a little while, but I'd rather get all that tedius work out of the way before working on the "meat" (gameplay). As I work on them I get the buttons to work so you can go between screens and soon the whole geoscape UI should be working. 
<br/>
<br/>
Once I get a few more screens done I'll show screenshots of a bunch of them and then hopefully get some feedback as to whether people like the way that I reduced the screens. 
<br/>
<br/>
Note, however, that in order to maintain graphical fidelity, I'm not actually scaling the graphics, rather cutting out graphical parts and tweaking the layouts - no information or functionality is lost. The main GeoScape screen is an example of that, I removed the left 64 pixels from the background and cutout 8 pixels from the middle of the right UI bar, used smaller text for the time and tweaked the text layout. But, as far as I can tell, nothing "looks" reduced - however if I actually reduced the graphics themselves that would be noticable and rather ugly given weird scaling factors (256/320 and 192/200). At the end of the day I want the screens to look like the original as much as possible while still looking like you're seeing them in their native size and resolution. 
<br/>
<br/>
Yes I could use bicubic filtering or something similar to increase reduction quality but I want to be able to process it quickly - so I can use the original data as is and easily (and quickly) reformat it on load. Backgrounds are always loaded between screens (yes this is fast enough on actual hardware) so reformatting speed is important. That way if I want to support another game based on the same engine (say Terror from the Deep for example - no promises:) I just swap the data and it works (assuming the format is the same or similar). In addition using the original data was a design goal, which makes many of the tools used for XCom useful for this version too (not all of them, but some  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe the GeoScape UI displayed to monitor what else is going on? Or maybe a list of the condition of your agents or any other helpful information that might be of use? Perhaps even a map of the general area? Something that doesn't require too much processing and doesn't affect normal gameplay, but is still helpful. Maybe even the ability to toggle the screen with Select or some other button. Just a thought. At this point, I'm sure you want to avoid feature-creep.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

It's certainly not going to be a black screen with debug info in the final release, but for now it's very useful for that purpose :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As for the Geoscape and using both screens. Would it be possible to have one screen at the globe at all times and the other used for browsing through your bases or possibly having a whole seperate battle screen once your fighting a UFO?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

keep an eye on UFO2000, the developers have plans to integrate the research/base management part into multiplayer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want to start naming off other games, then I'll mention Front Mission 1st that comes out tomorrow. It's a turn-based, grid-based strategy RPG where you command a squad of customizable giant robots (called "wanzers") that also features local wireless play (although, sadly no online play). It doesn't have a research ability, base management, or any of those other extras, but you can purchase different parts and fully customize your wanzers and adapt them for different roles. Most of the gameply revolves around preset missions or arena combat. It's actually a port of an old SNES game that never made it over here, so the graphics are rather dated. I'm still jumping for joy that it's finally getting released as we've only seen 2 out of the 5 games in the series and this is the original. Here's the link to the site:

Reading over the last few posts I see people excited for the game but not asking, "IS IT DONE WHERE IS IT LOLZ", and the dosbox comment, to me, wasn't asking BK to make it or something. He even wrote, "I doubt X-Com would work like that, but still". I have no idea about dosbox on DS (since I don't follow homebrew much and this is so far about the only thread I've read on this forum); Dosbox DS hadn't crossed my mind. But I think a simple "nope, it won't work, and if you're wondering why it's been talked about a few times in the forum, just search for it" would have been more than adaquate. Felt like your post was an uncalled for flame. Didn't seem like a lot of unintelligent banter going on to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I doubt it. There are many larger X-Com based mods or what not out there on the net. They have bigger fish to catch. Even then, X-Com isn't exactly a name that rakes in money; there are more well known brands out there.

they call this "irony". doesn't anyone remember the bogus "x-com: apocalypse on WinXP" project back a few years ago when Windows XP was new and everyone was desperate for running DOS games under it? basically the developer was asking for money to make it and it turned out to be a complete hoax to just get peoples money. right now we have no real proof that this was nothing but mock-ups, and if anyone were to give money towards the development of it, you'd have to be very suspect.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
