    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">MrShlee your site is very misleading in appearance.  It looks to be a wiki, so I go to try to edit the description thats a year out of date, but it tells me I have to log in.  Yet, there is no signup.  Also you list homebrew by the year created but don't continue it beyond that year, so according to your site DSOrganize looks like an app that was discontinued in 06.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to use a wiki to run your site, at least make it so it's actually a wiki, instead of what appears to be editable and isn't.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, is it entirely necessary to mirror the updates instead of direct linking to my homepage?  You are already a version out of date and it messes with my ability to track how many people download releases.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

The reason I don't like it is his site and many others are out of date.  I then get poeple who join my channel and whine about bugs that have already been fixed, and I end up chasing nothingness thinking it's resurfaced as they always forget to tell me they downloaded from X site as apposed to my site.  Also, several sites in the past have distributed corrupted zip files, so I get flooded with people telling me they can't get it installed right.  Also, his source mirror is 404.
<br/>
<br/>
Mirrors can be good when they are kept up to date, but this is seldom the case and it causes innumerable headaches on my part because someone else decided they want to host instead of me.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

I prefer the content of the page to be 100% wide (other columns for organizing data can use fractions of that amount adding up to 100%), if you want it narrower you can resize the browser window. The colors I don't really care that much as long as it is readable (although in my web-site I almost always don't specify colors and let it use the default colors configured in the browser).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Encourage users to visit the home page and only use the mirrors if it's down, with a warning that they may be out of date. Perhaps ping the site every 12 hours or so to see if it's up, and only show the mirrors if it's not.
