    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been working on a menu based on chishms dldi loader. The main reason I have done this is because I have a Neo R6 Gold and the menu doesn't look very nice (yet?). I have used chishm's code unaltered, you can get it from his post <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=12906&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0" target="_blank">here</a>.

It currently will load only from the root of the card as there is a but somewhere that shows itself when it re-reads the file list. If you would like to see this bug in action, press Select a couple of times to re-load the file list.

Also, if there's a way to load a second DLDI (with this application or any app using a similar system) to open stuff off of a slot-2 card without passme'ing over to it, that'd be nice (aka boot stuff off GBAMP using this, booted from the GnM.)<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

<br/>
I understand that you are facing a bug with directories, but what about adding a shortcut system like that used in DSOrganize.  This way I could put small shortcut files or even better, one file with a list of shortcuts, to point to other nds files in directories other than the root.  Maybe a way to specify icons and descriptions in the shortcut file as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Using DSOrganize to launch homebrew on my GnM is fine but I would love to have another alternative.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
