<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to tell you that the VERY BEST game for the DS that has been ever created... has been updated!
<br/>
<br/>
Behold: <a class="postlink" href="http://dsotaku.drunkencoders.com/Bitsweeper/Bitsweeper.html" target="_blank">Bitsweeper!</a> - Release 5 . 
<br/>
<br/>
* sigh *
<br/>
<br/>
All jokes aside, this was a long overdue release to bring it up to date with the latest devkitARM (r36) and libnds (1.5.4). Some of the artwork was slightly improved; here's hoping you like it. 
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and in case I didn't tell you, the sources have been moved to Google Code. Makes it easier for me &amp; you all to browse away the magnificent, magnanimous work of art that is my (not commented at all) code. :)
<br/>
<br/>
In case you missed the previous link, here is the game: <a class="postlink" href="http://code.google.com/p/bitsweeper/downloads/detail?name=Bitsweeper.zip" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/bitsweeper/downloads/detail?name=Bitsweeper.zip</a> , and here is the source code: <a class="postlink" href="http://code.google.com/p/bitsweeper/source/browse/" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/bitsweeper/source/browse/</a> .
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you like it (again)!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
